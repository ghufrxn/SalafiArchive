<p>We are pleased to announce a new competition section through which we wish to foster better understanding about the <u>Kharijite</u>, <u>Jahmite</u>, <u><a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a></u>, <u>Rafidite</u> creed and its underlying foundations. This is great news for Qutbists who rate themselves in their shrewdness and capacity in defending baatil against all odds, all <u>for the sake of an individual</u> in whose books <u>nothing remains</u>, after you take out the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the Khawaarij (a very extreme form of it), the manifestos of secular Atheist Jews, the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a>, that of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, that of the Mu'tazilah, that of the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, that of the Jabariyyah and expressions of Ittihaad, <u>except heart-warming, eloquent, literary expressions</u> (and not even a drop of the sort and type of knowledge you find in "<i>Fath ul-Bari</i>", or "<i>Bulugh ul-Mar'aam</i>" or "<i>Riyaadh as-Saaliheen</i>"!).    <P>
So here is our first quiz question, and since this is the first competition, we thought we'd start off with a cracker.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Qutbi Competition Corner: Test Your Knowledge of <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a> and The Positions of the Scholars Towards Those Expressing It</font>    <P>
As you will know, a very large number of prominent Scholars made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of Muhiyy ud-Din <a href='tags/ibn-arabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Arabi</font></a> because of his expressions of "<a href="tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a>", and they spoke against him in the most severest of ways. You should also know (as a <a href='tags/qutbi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi</font></a> who has a sense of pride in having refuted the Ash'arites, the Hulooliyyah and Ittihaadiyyah), that the <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> counterargue that <a href='tags/ibn-arabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Arabi</font></a> also negates <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a> in the most explicit of ways, and that these negations are also found in the very same books, through a variety of expressions.    <P>
All the following quotes are documented by Abdul-Wahhab ash-Sha'raanee in his "<i>al-Yawaaqeet wal-Jawaahir</i>" (1/80-81), and they are taken from the Futoohaat of Ibn 'Arabi.    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>The Question(s)</font>    <P>
Now we can pose our questions:    <P>
<ul><li>Does the presence of two mutually exclusive views arising from the one and same individual, either in his speech or in his writings at different times in his life (no matter which way around it is) prevent from refuting what is clear manifest falsehood in some of that speech or writing, <u>given the fact</u> that this pure manifest falsehood is still present and distributed the world over and read by millions of people?    <P>
<li>Do the principles of "<i>an-nasikh wal-mansookh</i>" and  and "<i>al-aamm wal-khaass</i>" and "<i>al-muhkam wal-mutashaabih</i>" and "<i>al-mujmal wal-mufassal</i>" (thanks al-Ma'ribi!) apply to the sayings of men <u>in which there is the clear admissibility of both truth and falsehood</u> - or are these principles applicable only to the revealed texts in which <u>there is nothing but the truth, absolutely</u>, and thus these principles allow the actual intent of the Sharee'ah to be determined in the presence of seemingly contradictory texts. And can these principles be employed in order to excuse and explain away statements of pure baatil arising from a person?    <P>
<li> If we accept that a person recanted from a statement of kufr, <u>then that is between him and his Lord</u>, but does that prevent from exposing, refuting, and warning from that baatil which he wrote or uttered that remained within his books, with his knowledge and consent, published, distributed, and now in the homes of millions, read and studied? <b>Especially when you have dedicated followers who propagandize for this man and his books and hate that the value of these books diminish in the eyes of the people!?</b>    <P>
<li> Given the saying of Jalal ud-Din as-Suyuti in his book "<i>al-Haawee lil-Fataawaa</i>" that the mere use of such language like "<i>ittihaad</i>", even if it was with the intent of exaggeration in <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, confused a lot of people who misunderstood it, and made them fall into kufr and perish - and given the fact that we have people today with ignorance that is multiple times more profound than that in the past, and given the presence and vigour of the da'wah of the Soofiyyah and the people of Ittihaad and Hulool <u>is it permissible and acceptable therefore</u>, for a person to choose to remain blind to the fact that whether a person has two views or not, or whether he recanted or not, and whether his falsehood came first or came later, his books containing expressions of what amount to kufr are distributed the world over and read and propagandized for, despite what they contain. Is Allaah pleased that books containing the innovations of the <u>Khawaarij</u>, <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Mu'tazilah</u>, <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Jabariyyah</u>, and expressions of Hulool and Ittihaad <u>be propagandized for</u> and the hearts of millions of people be attached to them, when they are founded upon nothing but "<i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>" and not true and real Sharee'ah knowledge, and contain the greatest of innovations and heresies, amongst which are statements amounting to wahdat ul-wujood?</ul>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>How to Participate</font>    <P>
Please send us your answers and explanations through our <a href=contact.html>contact page</a>. This competition will last for <u>one week</u> starting today. <b>Note:</b> We reserve the right to update, modify, improve and add to the questions above.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>How You Will Be Marked</font>    <P>
We think its fair that we explain how <u>our marking scheme</u> works so nobody's efforts are wasted. We are not really looking for "<i>right</i>" answers to the above questions. That is not really the actual intent. What we are looking for is that <b>fervor, zeal and passion</b> in rushing out, taking to the seas and mountains, and using all of one's faculties with vigor to defend baatil and its people in a manner that <u>most likely never will</u> and has <u>never</u> manifested itself for the defense of the honors of Uthmaan (radiallahu anhu) and Mu'aawiyah (radiallaahu anhu) and for the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> against the bid'ahs of the Khawaarij, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/rafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rafidah</font></a> - and we mean here <u>the sincere and genuine defense</u>, not the fake (crocodile-tear) reactionary defense that only came about with the motive of seeking revenge for the sake of one's <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> (pole and axis) and what amounts to mere political expediency in the arena of da'wah ("<i>Hey, you attacked my ramz (symbolic figurehead) now I am going to attack your Shaykh</i>") - <a href=index84cf.html?rtfaa >learn all about that here!</a>    <P>
So we are not really looking for correct, Shar'iyy, Sunni, Salafi, free-from-desires, straight-up, honest answers as much as we are looking for strong signs of dedication and passion. You will be marked for zeal, fervor and being the first off the mark. Normally we mark out of 10, but since this is a more complex situation with more complex factors we will be marking out of 100.    <P>
Manifestations of shrewdness and wit will obviously earn bonus points. Good knowledge-based observations will also earn bonus marks. And since we've got most angles covered inshaa'Allaah, <u>those who go in the direction that we actually want them to go in</u>, will then be allowed to participate in our follow-up competition where the noose will be tightened a little more.    <P>
All the best!    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Competition Closed: No Sign of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> Anywhere</font>    <P>
The competition was closed without participation from the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
Looks like we can excuse <a href='tags/ibn-arabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Arabi</font></a> for his statements of <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a> just because there exist clear explicit negations of <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a> in his books - and both those books in which there is clear negation and those in which the doctrine is clearly outlined and affirmed are present today, published, distributed, read and studied. It doesn't matter what doctrine he outlined first or last, <u>the issue is the presence of his books</u>, and a people expending efforts to print, distribute, and promote them - that's the issue here.    <P>
This was the aim of Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ribi with his doctrines of "<i>al-mujmal wal-mufassal</i>" - he innovated these principles in order to defend the realm of Bannaawiyyah and to protect the Innovators and their works from being abandoned and thrown in the closet. He was simply continuing the work of the likes of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq, and <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and others who brought their own attempts to accommodate, defend and protect the innovators and groups of innovation. It's not surprising that we see <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> sitting with Sufis and Sh'ites these days and calling for nearness and understanding with them.    <P>
