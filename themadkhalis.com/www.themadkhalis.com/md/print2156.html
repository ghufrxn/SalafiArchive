<img src=assets/images/baraa-ah-cover.gif border=1 align=right border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah Min Tazkiyah Ahl il-Bid'ah wal-Mudhammah</font>    <P>
To the right is the cover for the second edition of "<i>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah Min Tazkiyah Ahl il-Bid'ah wal-Mudhammah</i>" (The Innocence of the Scholars of the Ummah from the Commendation of the People of Innovation and Censure). This book was prepared by Isaam bin Abdullaah as-Sinaanee. It contains a refutation of the one who used the intercession of Shaykh Bin Baaz (rahimahullaah) for <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> as a proof for the 'adaalah (integrity) of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and commendation of his (Qutb's) manhaj, when it is not a proof at all.    <P>
The book, after compilation and authorship was sent to <b>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</b> who checked over it and made recommendations, and also suggested an improvement to the title of the book. Then it was read by <b>Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen</b> (rahimahullaah), who made his own written notes on the pre-print copy that was sent to him, and he also advised that the section titled "The Salafi Manhaj", <u>should be placed before</u> "The Qutubi Manhaj" and not after it, unless the author had a specific reason for doing that. And images of these hand-written notes are included at the end of the book. We will be quoting from this book inshaa'Allaah in this series. <b>Both of these scholars endorsed the contents of this book and the purpose for which it was to be published and distributed</b>. <u>And the purpose is clearly outlined in the title of the book itself</u>. Namely, to declare the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah free and innocent (in particular Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baaz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baaz</font></a>, and the other scholars in general) of having made tazkiyah (i.e. given adaalah) to those who are from the people of innovation: In this case <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, who aside from writing his commentary on the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> upon an <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> creed, added other great calamities, some of which are serious enough that they cannot really be excused by mere ignorance, such as accusing the Scribe of the Prophet (alayhis salaam) the Uncle of the Believers, <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> - whose integrity is attested to by the Prophet himself -  of treachery, deception and hypocrisy.     <P>
<b>And this book essentially <u>sunk their ship</u>, leaving them only <u>the flotsam</u> to hold onto thereafter, which is what they have been doing since then.</b>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> Whilst many of the biased-partisans use the word "<i><a href='tags/madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhali</font></a></i>" as a derogatory phrase to attack one particular Scholar, everyone should realize that <u>this is simply a cover and a veil</u>. Their hatred and resentment goes way beyond just one particular scholar and <u>it is towards the Scholars of the Sunnah in general</u> for the the fact that the majority of them eventually spoke about <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> specifically and the methodologies of al-Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen in general, after the truth became clear to them. The word "<i><a href='tags/madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhali</font></a></i>" is used in a derogatory way that simply represents this hatred, resentment and jealousy. These people don't have a group of scholars that <u>represent</u> the manhaj they are upon. <i>They have isolated statements here and there from some Scholars in isolated issues by which they cause confusion</i>, but certainly they cannot point to a group of known major scholars and say, "<i>Their manhaj in da'wah is the same as our manhaj in da'wah</i>". <b>By the way, Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> who erred in defending <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> against those who refuted him has statements that contain refutations of these people. Be sure about that! Go and read <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?eoizx >this article</a> and <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?srjss >this article</a></b>. So they have no Scholars guiding and leading them in their manhaj. And for this reason, they have to attack the truth with false labels in order to cut off the people from recognizing the overall broad methodologies that all of those scholars are united upon and which differ from the methodologies of the secular atheist Jews and Christians that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and Bannaa innovated into the religion.</div> <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Saalih bin Uthaymeen on Attending to the Real Books of Tafsir and Doing Away with What is Besides Them</font>    <P>
Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen said in response to the question posed (Baraa'ah, pp. 40-41, 2nd edition):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/baraa-ah-uthaymeen-qutb-1.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'> The esteemed Shaykh, the Allaamah, Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen, was asked - hafidhahullaah - about the author of the book "<i><a href='tags/fi-zilal-il-quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fi <a href='tags/zilal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Zilal</font></a> il-<a href="tags/quran.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qur'an</font></a></font></a></i>" and his methodology in tafsir? So he replied:    <P>
There has been much talk about this man and his book. <u>And in the other books of tafseer</u> such as Tafseer Ibn Katheer and Tafseer Ibn as-Sa'dee and Tafsee al-Qurtubi - alongside what it contains of laxity regarding [the use of authentic] hadeeth - and the Tafseer of [Abee Bakr] al-Jazaa'iree, <u>is the freedom of need and sufficiency, <u>by a thousand times</u>, of this book [of Qutb]</u>. And some of [the people of knowledge] such as ad-Dawaish and al-Albaanee have mentioned observations about this book, and these [observations] are recorded and present. And I have not looked at this book in its entirety, but I have read his tafseer of Surah al-Ikhlaas, <b>and he uttered an enormous saying therein opposing what Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah are upon, in that his tafseer of it indicates that he speaks with <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a> (the unity of existence)</b>. And likewise his tafseer of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> with dominion, control, authority (haymanah, saytarah). With the knowledge that this book is not a book of tafseer, and its author mentioned that himself when he said, "[In] The Shade of the Qur'an".     <P>
And it is upon the students of knowledge that they not make this man or any other a reason for their differing and dissension between them, and that their walaa (allegiance) and baraa (disavowal) should not be for him or against him.</blockquote>    <P>
A few points on the above:    <P>
<b><u>Point 1: Concerning Wahdat ul-Wujood</u></b>    <P>
A number of the scholars confirm that what they find in the writings of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> does not leave leave a person except with the understanding that he is expressing and speaking with <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a>. From them <u>Shaykh al-Albaanee</u>, and he has a story on this subject regarding Abdullaah Azzaam who followed an Ikhwaani boycott declared against Shaykh al-Albaanee (rahimahullaah) when Shaykh al-Albaanee criticised <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> for this. And also from them <u>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen</u>. And also <u>Shaykh Abdullaah ad-Dawaish</u>, <u><a href='tags/shaykh-muhammad-amaan-al-jaamee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Muhammad Amaan al-Jaamee</font></a></u>, <u>Shaykh Saalih Aal ash-Shaykh</u>.    <P>
And also <u>Shaykh Muhammad bin Jameel Zainoo</u> who pointed out the presence of the doctrine of <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a> in Qutb's early poetical writings, and despite pestering  Qutb's brother, <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, on many occasions to clarify this mistake of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, to put it in writing, and add clarifications to the printed works that get distributed. But despite promising to do so, <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> never fulfilled his promise, even after more than a decade passing by. This will be dealt with in another article inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
<b><u>Point 2: Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen's Recommended Reading</u></b>    <P>
Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a> used a very strong expression by saying that the other books of tafseer that are based upon hadeeth and athar, do away with the book of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> "<i>by a thousand times</i>". That shows you the difference in worth. For even if you take out all of the mistakes and innovations in the book of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, the majority of what you are left with is not knowledge. All that remains is Qutb's thoughts and feelings as he reads the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> expressed in a good, eloquent literary style. And this is recognized by some of the Scholars, that his literary expressions can be touching and moving. So were the speech and admonitions of al-Harith al-Muhasibee, and he is better than <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> by a thousand times. So the crux of the matter is what exactly is the reason why these people are attached to his book? What is there in it, besides eloquent literary expressions that is making these people traverse the lands, conquer the mountains and fare the oceans to defend this man? <b>That is the question</b>. The answer is his <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Extremism</font></a> in <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and propounding Leninist's manifesto - which gave birth to the madhhab of the khawaarij.     <P>
<b><u>Point 3: Not Making al-Walaa wal-Baraa Over This Man</u></b>    <P>
The <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> (see <a href=index49f2.html?xwcmm >here</a>, <a href=index33d0.html?tjmrl >here</a> and <a href=index7e0b.html?sxptl >here</a>) who make al-walaa wal-baraa over this man, and then they accuse those who Scholars who give sincerity (of purpose) to Allaah, to the Book of Allaah, to the Messenger of Allaah, and to the generality of the Muslims in pointing out:    <P>
<ul><li>The <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> of <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of the sifaat, rejection of the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a>, expressing negation of <a href='tags/al-uluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Uluww</font></a> upon the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> - (see <a href=index5d01.html?ppxmw >here</a>, <a href=index283f.html?ebzdi >here</a>, and <a href=index6ffe.html?kxsoa >here</a>)  <li> <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Extremism</font></a> in <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> - (<a href=index25d5.html?zlzrg >see here</a>)  <li>Rejection of aahaad hadeeth in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> - ( <a href=index69c9.html?lalhx>see here</a>)  <li>Mockery of the Prophet <a href='tags/moses.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Moses</font></a> (alayhis salaam) - <a href=index854c.html?tgdma >see here</a>  <li>Revilment and belittlement of Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu)  <li> Accusing Mu'aawiyah, the Scribe and Writer of the Revelation with nifaaq (hypocrisy), ghish (deception), khadee'ah (treachery, trickery) lying (kadhib) - <a href=index2099.html?pidmx>see here</a>  </ul>    <P>
And what is much much more than that - they accuse these Scholars and those who love and hate for the sake of the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of Islaam (and not merely for the sake of individuals) - of being "<i><a href='tags/madkhalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhalis</font></a></i>" and of hating this man and showing enmity and allegiance for his sake.    <P>
Let it be known that the Scholars who criticized the mistakes of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, inclusive of Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a>, did so out of walaa (loyalty) for the truth and not because of a mere man. For <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, <u>in his person</u>, is irrelevant, it could have been a thousand other people. Rather it is the deviation found in the mans' ideas and books that need to pointed out since these books are spread the world over and they are used to nurture and teach generations of  youth. And thus, out of walaa (loyalty) for the truth, it is a religious obligation upon the Scholars to clarify and point out the truth, which they have done, not for the sake of loving or hating an individual, but out of walaa (loyalty) for the truth.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>However, it is the diseased partisans, when they saw that truth being made manifest, and a defence of the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of Islam, a defence of the [aahaad] hadeeth and a defence of the honours of the Prophets of Allaah and <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> of Allaah's Messenger, and they saw the errors of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> clarified and explained, they made walaa (loyalty) for baatil (falsehood) and they did not give sincerity of purpose to Allaah, and they accused those who gave sincerity of purpose to the Ummah and who feared being treacherous to the Ummah by remaining silent upon baatil, of being "<i><a href='tags/madkhalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhalis</font></a></i>" and of those who love and hate merely for the sake of individuals. And this is from their jahl. <u>Qutb means nothing</u>. He's passed away. He was ignorant and showed interest in Islam and through the particular circumstances he chose for himself (plotting revolutions with Jamal Abdul-Nasser), he propounded certain orientations and directions in his ideologies. He was certainly oppressed, and in his oppression, he outlined doctrines and  methodologies, based upon his past nurturing, that are far from Islaam. His affair is with Allaah. <b>But today, we have a people who oppress <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, and who harm him and who increase his burden</b>. They do this by allowing the spread of the doctrines of the Ash'arites, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, the Mu'tazilah, the Khawaarij that are found in his works. Whilst Ahl us-Sunnah are merciful to him, the very people who defend and aggrandize him actually harm him, and this is from their ignorance, the lack of their intellect, and their being far from the methodology and understanding of the Salaf, for Ahl us-Sunnah are more merciful to the people of innovation, than the people of innovation are to themselves.</div>    <P>
So Ahl us-Sunnah, such as Shaykh al-Albaani, Shaykh Bin Baaz, Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a>, Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a>, Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin al-Abbaad, <a href='tags/shaykh-al-luhaydaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-Luhaydaan</font></a>, Shaykh Abdullaah ad-Dawaish and the numerous others who have spoken on this subject, have spoken not because of walaa or baraa regarding an individual but because of the deen, and its <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, and this is what is obligatory.     <P>
<b>For this reason they advise not to be concerned about this man, to abandon his books, and to learn real knowledge from the real books. </b>    <P>
However, in the face of this we see a people bending over backwards, and willing to traverse the valleys, conquer the mountains, and fare the raging seas in order to defend <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, his exaggerated doctrines, and his books using the saying of some or one of the Scholars that <u>for those who have knowledge</u> and <u>can distinguish between truth and falsehood</u>, they may benefit from the literary style, expression and eloquence in Qutb's commentary - but they use this to defend the man's doctrines and ideologies and to continue to propagandize for them, because really its not <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> that really matters for them. In reality <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> is just a means. Its the ideology that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> propounded that is what their walaa and baraa is based around - whose revolutionary manifesto came from secular atheist Jews.    <P>
And so <u>for what other reason</u> do you think Scholars like Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a> and Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> read and checked this book "<i>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah</i>" which contains their previous statements and those of a multitude of major Scholars, <b>gave it their seal of approval and their agreement upon its being published and spread so that all people are aware of the truth in this matter?!</b> Stand in front of Allaah and answer that question truthfully if it is the religion and the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> that you make walaa and baraa for and you will know your answer. <P>
