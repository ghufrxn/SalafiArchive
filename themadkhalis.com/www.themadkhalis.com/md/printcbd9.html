<div class='sidebar'> <blockquote>Recently, a group of the extremist Haddaadis have been taking and misrepresenting issues to some of the Scholars such as the Muftee, Shaykh <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> and also Shaykh al-Raajihee. <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> has been defending factions of Scholars from Ahl al-Sunnah from the accusations emanating from these Haddaadis. However, when <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> refuted their falsehood, they took some of his speech made in the course of refuting them, isolated it from the context of the wider discussion, and presented it in a way so that they could solicit these statements from those Shaykhs. These are methods that are not new and they have been going on for decades.    <P>
Over the past few weeks, they  have been distributing a short and dubious clip in which they allege Shaykh al-Raajihee makes tabdee' of <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a>. Well, now comes the lightning strike upon the liars!  </blockquote>  </div>    <P>

<blockquote>You can download the audio here  (<a href=assets/audio/raajihee-rabee-1435-shawwaal.mp3>MP3</a>) or listen to it below:    <P>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="mp3player.swf" width="200" height="20"><param name="movie" value="mp3player.swf" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/assets/audio/abdul-aziz-rajihee-qawaaneen-irjaa.ram&amp;showvolume=1&amp;loadingcolor=ff75ff" /></object>    <P>
<b>Summary: </b>The Shaykh is informed about the defence of <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> by <a href='tags/shaykh-al-luhaydaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-Luhaydaan</font></a>, stating he is from the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah, but that alleged words of tabdee are being ascribed to you. The Shaykh asks who is distributing this, and denies and states that not everything that is distributed is actually authentic. The Shaykh says that people have lied upon the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wasallam), [by ascribing to him what he did not say] and that they also lied upon Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> (rahimahullaah). Finally he confirmed that <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> is from the Scholars of the Sunnah and that this should be transmitted from him.</blockquote> <P>
