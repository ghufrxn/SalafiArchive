Afer the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> (see Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a> on the <a href='tags/qutbi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi Manhaj</font></a> <a href=index49f2.html?xwcmm>in this article</a>) made their debut using the first Gulf War as means to openly call to the Leninist revolutionary methodology that they had taken from the works of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, under the influence <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, they began to present themselves as the masters and lords of fiqh ul-waaqi' (current affairs). Over a period of years, these individuals such as <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a>, <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and others, were giving advice to the Algerian people, and often deceiving the Algerians soliciting their advice into thinking that this advice was coming from the Major Scholars.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Go to <a href=_a.html href=index49f2.html?xwcmm>this article</a> and read the four pages (pp. 110-113) quoted from the book "<i>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah</i>" in which you will find Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen's recognition and approval of the difference between the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a> and the <a href='tags/qutbi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi</font></a> [Leninist] Manhaj, that was being advised by these same individuals. What we are saying here is not an invention or a fabrication of the so-called "<i><a href='tags/madkhalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhalis</font></a></i>". It is actually historical fact. The word "<i><a href='tags/madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhali</font></a></i>" is a derogatory term used to avert people away from the truth through deception, scaremongering and lies.</div>    <P>
As a result of the advice these individuals gave to the Algerian people, and the promulgation and spread of the Leninist ideology of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> amongst the unsuspecting Salafis at the hands of these individuals, <a href='tags/algeria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Algeria</font></a> suffered a great calamity, with tens of thousands of innocent men women and children caught up in brutal murders, and whole villages often being slaughtered, being considered apostates for not agreeing with the takfiri groups in their <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the ruler, the government and various governmental bodies such as the police and so on. People literally fled into the mountains. This state of affairs and this particular environment also allowed foreign powers and the government to carry out their own attacks and to blame them on the these groups as a means to discredit the cause of these people.    <P>
By the grace of Allaah, many of the Algerians, turned to the Major Scholars, and sought their counsel <u>directly</u>, and here is on recorded phone call from <a href='tags/algeria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Algeria</font></a> in which the noble Shaikh, Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaimeen is asked about some groups of people who make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the rulers without any guidelines and conditions and who rely upon the tapes of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> (Safar al-Hawali and Salman al-Awdah). And the response is in the recording below.     <P>
<b>Note:</b> Previously in the 90s, Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a>, like other scholars were not fully aware of the reality of Safar and Salman and they had statements of praise for them in that early period. By the time the 90s had ended, these Scholars were aware of the realities and they made statements which clearly show that they recognized these individuals were responsible for reviving the madhhab of the Khawaarij and Sayyid Qutb's <a href='tags/leninism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Leninism</font></a>, and there are statements of other Scholars in this regard, such as Shaykh al-Albaani (rahimahullaah) that are also presented on this site. It is from the talbees (deception) of these people that they bring all these old statements to fool the people, and they are not ignorant of these later statements, because they have been published online, translated and spread close to ten years ago.    <P>
<b><a href=assets/audio/uthaimeen-warning-from-safar-salman-takfir-khawaarij.ram>Listen to the recorded discussion (Real Audio)</a></b>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Translation of the Response</font>    <P>
The Shaikh replied (and remember that his speech is regarding the situation in <a href='tags/algeria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Algeria</font></a> specifically):     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Those who make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, they are the inheritors of the Khawaarij, those who rebelled against Ali bin Abi Taalib (radiallahu anhu). The kaafir is the one whom Allaah and His Messenger have declared a kaafir, and <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> itself has conditions, amongst them, ilm (knowledge) and amongst them iraadah (will, intent). So we ought to know that this ruler opposed the truth, and he knew the truth, and he intended deliberate opposition, and that he did not have any faulty interpretation (in the matter), such as when a person prostrates to an idol, and he knows that prostrating to an idol is <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a> and he does not have any faulty understanding either.    <P>
What is important is that this affair has conditions, and it is not permissible to rush into <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, just as it is not permissible to rush into the saying, "This is halaal (lawful) and this is haraam (unlawful)."</blockquote>    <P>
Note: Have, in relation to the above, go and read the statement of Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> on the subject of <a href='tags/secular-laws.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Secular Laws</font></a> <a href=index59f5.html?umssw >in this article here</a>.    <P>
The Questioner continues:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Also, they listen to the cassettes of Salmaan bin Fahd al-Awdah, and Safar al-Hawaali!! Do we advise them to not listen to them?!!</blockquote>    <P>
Shaikh Ibn Uthaimeen:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>May Allaah bless you. <b>The good that is in their cassettes is also found in other than their cassettes</b>, and their cassettes have some observations against them, some of their cassettes, not all of them. And I am not able to distinguish between them for you - I (am not able) - between this and that!!</blockquote>    <P>
Questioner:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>In that case you advise us not to listen to them?</blockquote>    <P>
Shaikh Ibn Uthaimeen:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>No (do not listen to them). <b>I advise you to listen to the cassettes of Shaikh <a href='tags/ibn-baaz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baaz</font></a>, the cassettes of Shaikh al-Albaani</b>, the cassettes of the scholars who are known for uprightness and integrity (i'tidaal), <b>and who are not known for <a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a> (thawrah fikriyyah)</b>!!</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Note:</b> The thawrah fikriyyah (<a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a>) that Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a> is referring to started with the likes of <a href='tags/karl-marx.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karl Marx</font></a> in the 19th century who proposed a revolution of the general masses, and this ideology was refined by Lenin where only a small vanguard would lead the revolution. It is this manifesto that is found in the book of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> "<i><a href='tags/milestones.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Milestones</font></a></i>" - <a href=index74ea.html?rhmeq >see here</a>, and so Lenin's revolutionary vanguard  became "the sagacious believers", meaning, <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and his jamaa'ah.    <P>
Questioner continues:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>O Shaikh! Even if in this matter - for example - their is difference (khilaaf), so they make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Rulers and they say that this is Jihaad - for example - in <a href='tags/algeria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Algeria</font></a> ... and they listen to the cassettes of Salmaan and Safar al-Hawaali. So is this khilaaf (difference) one that is far'ee (i.e. subsidiary, as opposed to fundamental)?! Or is it a difference in the Usool (fundamentals) O Shaikh?!!</blockquote>    <P>
Shaikh Ibn Uthaimeen:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>No! This is a difference in aqeedah (khilaaf aqdiyy), because it is from the Usool of Ahl us-Sunnah that we do not make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of anyone on account of a sin!</blockquote>    <P>
Questioner:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>They, O Shaikh, do not make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of one who commits major sin, except the Rulers, they come with the verse, "<b>Whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, they are the Disbelievers</b>", and they make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Rulers only?!!</blockquote>    <P>
Shaikh Ibn Uthaimeen:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There is an athar (narration) from Ibn Abbaas concerning this verse, which explains that the intent is the kufr which does not expel from the religion, as occurs in the saying of the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam), "<i>Reviling Muslim is sin (fusooq) and fighting him is kufr (disbelief)</i>". And in the view of the some of Mufassiroon, it was actually revealed for the People of the Book, this is because the actual context of the passage is what occurs before, "<b>Verily, We did send down the Taurat (Torah) [to Musa (<a href='tags/moses.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Moses</font></a>)], therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah's Will, judged the Jews. And the rabbis and the priests [too judged the Jews by the Taurat (Torah) after those Prophets] for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's Book, and they were witnesses thereto. Therefore fear not men but fear Me (O Jews) and sell not My Verses for a miserable price. And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the Kafirun</b>." (5:44).</blockquote>    <P>
End of taped discussion.    <P>
<b>Note:</b> There are also other statements of Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a> in which he explains that the <a href='tags/secular-laws.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Secular Laws</font></a> found in <a href='tags/algeria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Algeria</font></a> have been there for 150 years or so (brought in by the colonialists), and those rulers were not the ones who instituted them. This is an important point because the attachment of the people of unfounded and exaggerated <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> to the issue of replacing the entire Sharee'ah with <a href='tags/secular-law.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Secular Law</font></a> is simply a means through which they can justify the <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the rulers over those lands in which there do exist <a href='tags/secular-laws.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Secular Laws</font></a> in greater or lesser amounts, but in which the rulers themselves  who happened or do happen to come to power neither "abolished" the Sharee'ah as they claim, and nor introduced or instituted, at the outset, the bulk of these laws. This is a common situation in most Muslim countries that were subject to colonialism and imperialism.     <P>
Inshaa'Allaah we will cover this in a separate topic, because through it, much of the deception of these people comes to light. The crux of the  matter is that these people are upon the methodology of Vladimir Lenin that was brought to them in the works of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> (<a href=index74ea.html?rhmeq>see here</a>). Lenin re-interpreted <a href='tags/marxism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Marxism</font></a>, which was the revolution of the common-people, and he narrowed it down to a revolution involving only a special elite vanguard. <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> simply "Islamicized" the doctrines of Lenin's revolutionary vanguard, who now became the "sagacious believers" (meaning he and his co-revolutionaries).  <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> planned the July revolution in 1952 with regular meetings in Qutb's house between <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, Jamaal Abdul-Nasser and others. Afterwards, when they fell out and <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> was imprisoned, he started writing books laying down and propounding this methodology and intending by it, another revolution by which to remove the "taaghoot" that he had actually brought to power in the first place, and more generally in every part of the Muslim world which he considered societies of <a href='tags/jaahiliyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jaahiliyyah</font></a> and disbelief. His books then became a springboard for the madhhab of the Khawaarij, and the starting point of it is <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>. <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the rulers is the first goal, and before the methodology can be called to or implemented, <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> has to be elicited first. <P>
