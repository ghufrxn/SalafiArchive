<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>  <font class='titleHeadline'>Abdullaah al-Farsee and His Fanatical Follower <a href="tags/sajid-kayum.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sajid Kayum</font></a></font>    <P>
<u><a href='tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a></u> is an individual who chose misguidance after guidance and rejected what he knew to be the truth. In the early to mid 1990s he was following the Scholars of the Sunnah who refuted <b>the new-face of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen</b>. This new face was in the form of <b>Safar al-Hawali, Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq, <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and others</b> who were propagating the teachings of <u>Egyptian Ash'aris</u>, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and Hassan al-Banna to Salafi audiences with false foundations and principles. Their aim was to rouse the masses to lose trust and confidence in the Major Scholars and to mobilize them against the rulers. Towards the end of the 1990s al-Farsee flipped and then began to reject the truth that he knew and spoke of. <a href=indexc7a5.html?qizzj>A specific article</a> has addressed this matter in more detail.    <P>
As for <u><a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a></u>, he is a fanatic of the confused, shaky and flippant <a href='tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a>. The Scholars explain that when a person makes his walaa and baraa upon other than the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah then this is hizbiyyah and this is what al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen innovated in the 20th century and spread through the Ummah. Thus, when we say "<i>Hizbee</i>", it refers to someone whose foundational love, hate, loyalty and allegiance with respect to others is not based upon the usool of the Sunnah fundamentally, but upon other considerations (which can be of many types but can be categorized under one word, <i>desires</i>). This is why <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> (and those like him) are hizbees, <b>and this is what we shall outline and establish in this article inshaa'allaah</b>. For the past ten years at least he has been operating an <a href=index5fe5.html?cotrs>online slanderhouse</a> in which he has wilfully allowed alleged sins of Salafi callers to be propagated in the open. He has maintained this evil behaviour because he has intense animosity and hatred towards those who value clarity in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and manhaj and who hold fast to the Scholars who bring firm evidences against those who abandon the Sunnah and choose bid'ah. This hatred is inherited from <a href='tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a>. <b>Sajid Kayum lives in two worlds</b>. <u><b>The first world</b></u> is the face he shows to those in the Indo-Pak subcontinent and to the expatriates from those lands who work in the Gulf states. Here he presents himself as an upholder of the Salafi way, refuting the Tablighis, the Soofees and others, and likewise refuting people such as <b>Zakir Naik</b> for their oppositions to the Salafi methodology. In this world, when he receives objections from others about "<i>slandering other callers</i>", and "<i>causing splits amongst Muslims</i>" - as can be seen from his various discussions - he responds with reasoning similar to that of the Salafis (whom he hates with a fanatical type of hate) when they receive objections in the face of their refutations of opposers to the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a> such as <a href='tags/abu-al-hasan-al-maribee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ribee</font></a>, Adnaan Ar'oor and others (all of whom have been refuted by Major Scholars with clear evidences). So he explains to his opponents  or those who raise these objections in this first world that making the truth clear is an obligation, that there is absolutely no compromise in the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a>, and that taking the detailed criticism based upon proof is necessary and what is similar to this type of speech. <u><b>In the second world</b></u>, <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> employs the same objectionist rhetoric which his detractors direct to him in the first world <u>against the Salafis in the West</u> who are with the Scholars refuting the misguided callers who are upon innnovated methodologies in da'wah and false, corrupt principles. These misguided callers oppose the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a> in the clearest of ways with their innovated principles and methodologies, their da'wah, their behaviour and their walaa and baraa. <b>Note, these are the same affairs for which he refutes the likes of Zakir Naik in his first world where he markets himself to an Indo-Pak subcontinent audience as a champion and upholder of the Salafi manhaj</b>. In this second world he uses a variety of ways and means in order to attack the Salafis in the West who value this clarity in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and manhaj. One of the main reasons for this is that the clarity provided by those Salafis (as it relates to those who choose misguidance) will in turn indicate (to many in his first world) that <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> himself is upon the very same misguidance for which he is refuting the likes of Zakir Naik - which is that he and his likes operate upon Ikhwani hizbee principles in their behaviour and defend, support and praise the people of deviation and misguidance and make walaa for them over and above Salafis who are clear in their <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and manhaj and da'wah and who are upon what the Major Scholars are upon in the actual usool (foundations), loving and hating for the sake of these usool. <b>The illustrative example which is the basis of this article will establish this in the clearest of ways</b>. From the ways he has employed historically to attack the Salafis is to operate a <b>Slanderhouse</b> in which free reign has been given for over ten years for the propagation of alleged sins of Salafis, which include allegations of adultery, fornication and attacks upon the honours of individual callers and in some cases their families and wives (<a href=index5fe5.html?cotrs>see here</a>). At the same time he presents a face of piety by exhorting other Muslims not to expose and spread the sins and errors of others. This is rank hypocrisy. Also from ways is to pick out certain incidents which are misconstrued or misrepresented or where the full picture is concealed, <b><u>or deliberately not completed</u></b>, allowing him to use such incidents to launch his  attacks against those Salafis who value clarity in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, manhaj and da'wah. <b>It is this approach we are going to actually illustrate in this article. There are many instances of this, our intent is  to get you to understand the true nature of the activities of these people by way of the illustrative example in this article. So what is this example?</b>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Salmaan al-Awdah and <a href="tags/muhammad-al-areefee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Muhammad al-Areefee</font></a></font>    <P>
To grasp and figure out the nature of the activities of this <a href=index5fe5.html?cotrs>Slanderhouse Master</a>, we need to understand the reality of these two men, <b>Salmaan al-Awdah</b> and <b><a href='tags/muhammad-al-areefee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad al-Areefee</font></a></b>. <u>In fact we need to do more than that</u>. We also need to understand the philosophy of the highest-level Ikhwani thinkers of today and what steps they have laid down for al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen - at an organizational level - of methodologies for the 21st century. So we will do these two things in this introduction before we proceed:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/nafeesee-book.gif align=right vspace=6 border=1 style="margin-left:10px;" border=0><font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Qaradaawee, al-Nafeesee and the 21st Century Ikhwani Agenda</font>    <P>
To the right is a book that was recently pointed out by Shaykh Aa'id al-Shimree (hafidhahullaah)   (<a href=assets/audio/shimree-nafeesee-book.mp3>listen to highly beneficial audio here</a> regarding the way of al-Qaradawi, al-Nafeesee, al-Awdah and al-Areefee and others). This book, "<i>al-Harakah al-Islaamiyyah, Ru'yah Mustaqbaliyyah</i>" (The Islamic Movement, Future Vision), published in 2012 - following the revolutions in Tunisia, <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> and <a href='tags/libya.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Libya</font></a> - is a compilation of essays from key Ikhwani figureheads who are outlining and recommending strategic objectives and directions for the activities of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen for the 21st century. Abdullaah al-Nafeesee (the editor) from Kuwait, along with Yusuf al-Qardawi, are from the highest level of theoreticians, thinkers and leaders of al-Ikhwaan. <u>The general gist is this</u>: It is not possible for al-Ikhwan to be successful except by taking a new direction which overcomes the problems encountered in previous activities. The states in which they faced problems (and they mean here the Gulf States including <a href='tags/saudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi</font></a> Arabia) are well-structured from a security point of view and they have many resources at their disposal to counter dissension. Because of this, the strategic objective is to make alliances with other groups and orientations so as to amass as much ground power as possible. On their own, they simply do not have enough manpower. <b>Hence, working with <u>the Soofees</u>, <u>the Shi'ites</u>, and the <u>Liberalists</u>, <u>Secularists</u> and <u>Modernists</u> is something that is laid down as a necessary measure</b>. The Ikhwani Khawaarij in <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> such as <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a> (see   <a href=indexe1e2.html?brqlm>here</a> and <a href=indexa627.html?zdsnn>here</a>) and others, have been working to this agenda for many years now. It is for this reason that <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> has been making inroads into the <a href='tags/shiites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shi'ites</font></a> and the Soofees and also the Liberalists. These activities are part of a sophisticated and wider agenda. These people have realised that their method in the 1990s was not fruitful. <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> personally led demonstrations (you can see this on Youtube videos) and they tried to rouse the society into dissent. But it did not work, the Major scholars figured out what they were up to and Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baaz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baaz</font></a> ordered their detention, and the whole thing came to an end. Their followers then turned towards the more extreme <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> like Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, and they lost a very large following. When they came out of prison and changed somewhat some of their former followers made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of them, saying they had sold out of their da'wah, meaning the Khaarijee da'wah that is. <u>The harakah ended in failure!</u> They have realized that the route and path of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> (open <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, violent revolution) is never going to work. States, with all their powers and resources, can easily deal with these types of attempts, even if they suffer a little bit of harm. This is why people like Qaradawi do not mind criticising <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> to make people think he is not upon the same <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and revolutionary way of thinking. In reality he is but upon a different methodology, the route of Hassan al-Banna. <b>Through experiences over the decades they have firmly realized that they need to make alliances, to get as much ground power as possible, and to make use of entry into democracy for that purpose.</b>   Further, they don't mind sharing the cake afterwards with other factions. Hence, they have realized and come to the conclusion that a much broader methodology is needed, a more inclusive one that relies upon a much wider segment of the society. Now, If you believe that these things aren't taking place and that Ahl al-Bid'ah do not have plans and designs against the people of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and the Sunnah (and their scholars and rulers), <u>then please go back to cloud cuckoo land</u>. Forget all of history and forget the plots and plans of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in 8th century Shaam or the plots and plans of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> against Abu Ismaa'eel al-Harawi in 5th century Khurasaan. Forgot what the heretical Jahmites of North Africa did to the Murabitoon (who were upon the Sunnah) and go back and read your bedtime stories and just stay in your comfort zone of the kindergarten where the world is so lovely, nice and kind. If however, you are still with us in <u>actual reality</u> and you are an <i>'aaqil</i> (someone with intelligence and reason), then you should now be in a better position to understand the reality of who <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> is [and likewise his student Muhammad al-Areefee]. These are individuals who are caught up in what is essentially an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> originating movement of passing judgement upon the <a href='tags/saudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi</font></a> state in particular because it is a Salafi, Sunni, Athari state. Those Asharites were grieved because their <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, Maturidi Ottoman empire collapsed in the 1920s. They consider the <a href='tags/saudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi</font></a> state to be a disbelieving state and its rulers as apostates. This is the reality of their belief even if many of them will not express it openly. To this end they entered the land of <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> in the 1960s when their Marxist, Communist, Leninist methodologies did not work in <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a>. They made inroads into <a href='tags/saudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi</font></a> and then poisoned some of its youth with this same <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>. From these people were <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> and others. They failed in the 1990s to implement their goals, using the Gulf War as a starting point. It ended disastrously in that all the Major Scholars including Shaykhs <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> and <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a> - despite much confusion through those ten years - eventually spoke on the misguidance of these individuals (Safar, Salman and others) by the turn of the 21st century. But these people continue today altering and changing their methodologies (like chameleons), upon the principle that <i>the end justifies the means</i> - exactly as <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a> described the activities of <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and <a href='tags/abdur-rahmaan-abdul-khaaliq.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq</font></a> around 15 years ago. For this reason, when we see certain statements emanating from certain directions, we, following our Scholars, are not dumb, naive and foolish to pass them off as innocent statements and slips of the tongue.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Back to <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and <a href="tags/muhammad-al-areefee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Muhammad al-Areefee</font></a></font>    <P>
We are now one step closer to grasping the activities of these two individuals and putting their statements into context. Ealier this year, <b><a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a></b> began giving an explanation to the hadeeth of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) which is a thorn in the throat of all fanatical <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a>, the hadeeth of Hudhaifah bin al-Yamaan (radiallaahu anhu) in which the Messenger advised hearing and obeying the ruler (<span class='arb'>&#1608;&#1573;&#1606; &#1590;&#1585;&#1576; &#1592;&#1607;&#1585;&#1603; &#1608;&#1575;&#1582;&#1584; &#1605;&#1575;&#1604;&#1603;</span>), "<i>Even if your back is beaten and your wealth is confiscated</i>." So <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> came out with a <i>bid'iyy</i>, <i>khaarijiyy</i> interpretation -  one that is founded upon the notion of the "<a href="tags/social-justice.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Social Justice</font></a>" of secular atheist, materialist Marxist, Communist Jews, the same notion that <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, the Baatinee, <a href=indexd945.html?pfwuf>Raafidee Khabeeth</a>, used in his attacks against Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu) and on the basis of which he negated the Islam of Mu'awiyyah (radiallaahu anhu) and the Bani Umayyah. This interpretation (<a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a>) is that this command is only in relation to a sole individual when the ruler oppresses him specifically in a matter that is between him and the ruler, he is ordered to hear and obey. But as for when the rights of the society at large are affected, then this hadeeth does not apply to this situation, here the general Qur'anic texts which order with the fulfilling of rights, and judging by what Allaah has revealed and so on, they come into play and as such it is necessary and take measures to restore those rights. This <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> is no doubt, leading to <a href='tags/khurooj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Khurooj</font></a> (revolt). After this, <b><a href='tags/muhammad-al-areefee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad al-Areefee</font></a></b> (student of Salman al-Awdah), came out with the same <i>bid'iyy, khaarijiyy</i> explanation (<a href=assets/audio/areefee-hukkaam-claim.mp3>listen to audio</a>). Al-Areefee says that the hadeeth only applies to a specific individual who has a problem with the ruler. Then he goes on to to mention how the rulers say we have no money because the economy is bad, then all of a sudden they announce a 20% increase in (government) salaries. Al-Areefee says, "<i>so where has the money come from now, did it come from the sky?</i>" He says "<i>it was there all along, in the banks and in foreign banks</i>". This is from the same fountain as the saying of <b>Dhul-Khuwaysarah</b> against the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), "Fear Allaah and be just",  that of "<a href="tags/social-justice.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Social Justice</font></a>". This was the saying of the Marxists, Communists and <a href='tags/leninists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Leninists</font></a> whose books <b><a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></b> was gulping down for 15 years of his life, that of "social justice." <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> wrote books on it and through this Communist, Marxist filth, he attacked the honour of Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu) made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of Mu'awiyyah and Bani Umayyah. This was the saying of <b>Muhammad Suroor</b>, the Qa'di Kharijee. This was the saying of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> of <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> who were labelled "<i>Khawaarij of the Era</i>" by Imaam al-Albaani. And today, this is the saying of <a href='tags/muhammad-al-areefee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad al-Areefee</font></a> - it is all under the banner of "social justice." What we are seeing here in the form of <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and <a href='tags/muhammad-al-areefee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad al-Areefee</font></a> are small Shaytanic whisperings and doubts which constitute the <u>ideological tarbiyah</u> (nurturing) through which the "<i>dogs of hellfire</i>" rear their heads in every age and era. Please, please do yourself a favour and read <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?zyxuc>this article</a> in which there is the hadeeth of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> will never cease to appear in each century until the Dajjaal appears in their midst. <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> don't appear and grow like shoots from nowhere. The right ideological framework has to be present before they doctrines appear and they raise their heads to start amassing followers.     <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Let's Take Up Our Story From Here...</font>    <P>
We are now in a position to take up our story with <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a>, the hypocritical <a href=index5fe5.html?cotrs >Slanderhouse Master</a> and look at his antics which are in reality a reflection of the reality of his teacher and mentor, the mentally unstable <a href='tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a>, who allies and defends with the innovators against the people of the Sunnah and who positions himself and conducts himself - when certain situations arise - in a way that gives support and lenience for the true mischief makers and deviants and finds fault with those who are upon the truth and have love and zeal for it. For al-Farsee is one who defends or speaks well of the people of bid'a and furqah such as <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a> (those who call for nearness and understanding with Sufis and Shi'ites) whilst showing enmity and hatred towards Salafis who value clarity in the usool and who show rejection against these deviants, following their scholars in  that. And in turn, this is how his ignorant followers conduct themselves. As a result, whenever an issue arriss (such as the one we are discussing in this article) you will see them employing the issue in a way to distort the truth, paint the worst possible picture of the people of the truth and give excuses, lenience, defence, praise and support to the true and real mischief-makers and liars and opponents to the usool (foundations) of Ahl al-Sunnah.  </blockquote>  </div>    <P>
<blockquote>  <font class='titleHeadline'>Sajid Kayum the Slanderhouse Master and The 21st Century Khawaarij Trying to Play with the Sunnah of Allaah's Messenger and Attributing Lies to Great Scholars Such as Imaam al-<a href="tags/nawawi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Nawawi</font></a></font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/sq-areefee-fawzan2.gif align=right border=1 vspace=6  style="margin-left:10px;" border=0> To the right you will see an article posted by <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> dated 8th June 2012. The intent behind is to defend al-Areefee who lied against the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), and lied against Imaam al-Nawawi (rahimahullaah). What happened is that al-Areefee got slapped down in an instant when his bid'ah was rightfully taken to the Major Scholars and some of them, such as Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> described the author of the innovated explanation of the hadeeth of Hudhayfah bin al-Yamaan as a "<b>person of desires</b>" who is "<b>saying upon the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) what he did not say</b>" (<a href=assets/audio/fawzan-areefee-hukkaam.mp3>listen to audio</a> - first part of audio is al-Areefee's innovated explanation). Al-Areefee says that the hadeeth only applies to a specific individual who has a problem with the ruler. Then he goes on to to mention how the rulers say we have no money because the economy is bad, then all of a sudden they announce a 20% increase in (government) salaries. Al-Areefee says, "<i>so where has the money come from now, from the sky?</i>" He says "<i>it was there all along, in the banks and in foreign banks</i>." Now this is part of a devised agenda because <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> came out with this <i>bid'iyy distortion</i> first, and then the student began to propagate it and they had hoped they could cause doubt about the Sunnah of Allaah's Messenger in this way - upon the way of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah, Khawaarij of old - using their desire and their reason to challenge and abolish the Sunnah.     <P>
When this bid'ah (innovated) was slapped down, al-Areefee, in order to do some damage limitation went to see Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> and to make a "clarification". <b>So his clarification was that he had not brought this from  himself but he based it upon some speech of Imaam al-Nawawi (rahimahullaah) which he merely quoted</b>. This was given some online coverage (<a href=assets/images/fawzan-areefee-visit.jpg>see this article</a>). In the article to the right, the <a href=index5fe5.html?cotrs >Slanderhouse Master</a> positions himself in this incident in a way where he is finding fault with those (Arab brothers) who took this kalaam to the Major Scholars and rightfully spread their clarifications. <b>Sajid Kayum is blaming them for this action</b>. Namely, when someone brings <u>a tahreef and ta'weel</u> of the speech of Allaah's Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) not known in any books of the  Salaf or by any scholar from Ahl al-Sunnah, and spreads it to millions of viewers on satellite channels, <b>it is evil and wrong for people to take it to the Major Scholars</b>. <u>This is what we mean and is the key point you have to understand here</u>, that you have to look at how these people behave and position themselves in these types of situations. Their orientations are towards <u>defence of baatil and its people, making excuses for them, lavishly praising them</u> and finding fault with truth and those who wish for it to be known and manifest. So those Arab brothers who approached all those Scholars, Shaykh <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a>, the Muftee, Shaykh Ubayd, Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee and others, they are mischief-makers, they were not motivated by zeal and jealousy for the Sunnah of the Messenger but were just intent on bringing individuals down as if this Farsee Fanatic <u>tore open their hearts and saw what was inside</u>. From this you can see the "spin" which ignorant and blinded individuals like <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> put on events and incidents to give a means of escape for the true and real culprits, whilst vilifying those who love and venerate the Sunnah and wish for clarity from the Scholars and do not accept lies upon Allaah's deen and violation of its mighty and firmly established principles.     <P>
If we pay attention to Sajid Kayum's final remark at the very end, "<i>Of course, the "group" that fanatically spread the refutation of the statements will not spread this clarification</i>,"  he is referring to what is reported about Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan's clarification when al-Areefee went to him. Shaykh Salih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> is reported to have said that he did not mean to label al-Areefee in person as a person of desires but was only addressing the actual incorrect statement and making a general remark when it was brought to him. As far as we know, this is not on tape, but in any case, lets assume it is true for now. [There is a justifiable reason to doubt al-Areefee's integrity and to challenge his honesty, see what follows below of a further clarification which Shaykh <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> himself wrote and put out publicly afterwards which indicates there is lack of integrity on behalf of al-Areefee and those with him].    <P>
<b>So here comes the actual point then.</b> Two weeks <u>before</u> <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> even wrote his article to defend <a href='tags/muhammad-al-areefee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad al-Areefee</font></a>, Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> had already written a clarification statement after he went to Imaam al-Nawawi's explanation of the hadeeth to see if al-Areefee and those with him were telling the truth. <b>The Shaykh felt it important enough to put out a public clarification when he realized they ascribed to al-Nawawi that which he is free of</b>. Of course, when <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> was informed of this, we did not see him fanatically spread the Shaykh's final clarification as fanatically as he wrote his defence of <a href='tags/muhammad-al-areefee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad al-Areefee</font></a> and his attack upon those Arab brothers who rightfully took the matter to the Scholars. In this clarification Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> clarified a great and mighty foundation of Ahl al-Sunnah, one that no Salafi who has read and studied the books of the Salaf can be confused about or can claim to be confused about.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan's Written Clarification (Which Comprises a Rebuttal of the Claim by al-Areefee And Exoneration of Imaam al-Nawawi from the Lie Against Him)</font>    <P>
The Shaykh followed up with a clarification on his website (<a href=http://www.alfawzan.af.org.sa/node/13975>original here</a>) (<a href=assets/images/fawzaan-areefee-claim.jpg>screenshot</a>), dated 27th May 2012:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Notification of an Error Regarding the Explanation of the Hadeeth, "Even if Your Back is Beaten and Your Wealth is Taken"</b>    <P>
All praise is due to Allaah, and may prayers and salutations be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and companions. To proceed: There has come in Sahih Muslim in the hadeeth of Hudhayfah bin al-Yamaan (radiallaahu anhu) regarding tribulations and what is obligatory upon a Muslim when they appear - specifically in relation to what occurs from some of rulers of the Muslims of oppression and tyranny - where the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) in this hadeeth, "<i>Hear and obey the ruler even if your back is beaten and your wealth is taken</i>."    <P>
<b>This became problematic to some of the brothers until some of them said about this hadeeth that it is addressed (only) to an individual present in an Arabic environment which scorns obedience (to the ruler) and rejects oppression, and perhaps that might carry him (individually) to reject obedience (to the ruler) in that which is good, or to split off or to stand up to fight [and  thus constitutes a prohibition at the individual level], and then they began to interpret it upon other than its (actual) meaning so that they can take it away from its apparent (dhaahir) meaning. <u>Then, when objection was made against them, they attributed (this interpretation) to Imaam al-Nawawi</u>, but upon returning to the explanation of Imaam al-Nawawi of Sahih Muslim with respect to this hadeeth, we found that he says in the hadeeth of Hudhayfah (radiallaahu anhu), when he said to the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), "How shall I behave O Messenger of Allaah, if that reaches me" he means what occurs of tyranny from the rulers and their oppression. He replied, "You must hear and obey the ruler even if you back is beaten and your wealth is taken." Al-Nawawi said, "(Even if your back is beaten), unjustly, (and your wealth is taken), without due right, with the verb being constructed upon the passive form in both places, and they comprise the condition (shart) for the response (you must hear and obey) him in what is other than disobedience" - end quote. <u>This is the actual text of the explanation of al-Nawawi upon this hadeeth in that he left it upon its apparent meaning  and import and he did not make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of it to what those brothers said.</u></b>     <P>
This hadeeth and its like comprises <u>a mighty foundation</u> from the foundations of the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah in adhering to the jamaa'ah of the Muslims, having patience upon the tyranny and oppression of the rulers because of what results from that of mighty benefits, such as preserving the blood of the Muslims and protecting their honours, their safety and settlement (in the land). And these are benefits that are above, by a great deal, than the associated harm that comes with them of bearing  their tyranny with patience. More harmful than this (having patience) is the harm of revolting, and  splitting the ranks of the jaamaa'ah. This is from (the principle of) bearing the least of two harms in order to repel the greater of them, <u>and this is a mighty principle from the principles of Islaam</u>. For the purpose of making notification of the error which has occcurred with respect to this  topic from some of the brothers, I wrote about  that.    <P>

From this clarification by the Shaykh, the reality concealed by <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> is made apparent. And this is what we mean in that Hizbees such as <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a>, take certain events, incidents and occurrences, lie about them through distortion or ommission or concealment and then overturn the realities and make the culprit to to be the victim and the one who is right to to be wrong and the one who deserves thanks to be one who deserves criticism and derision. This is because the  hizbiyyah in their hearts has actually blinded them from seeing truth as truth and falsehood as falsehood. There are some <b>hugely important and fundamental lessons</b> that need to be taken from this, because this nicely illustrates the nature of the attacks and polemics made by Hizbees like <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> against the Salafis in the West in particular but to the Salafis in all places more generally. We can finish off this article by listing the key things that should be noted.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>First, Don't Forget History!</b> <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> was amongst those declared to be from the contemporary Khawaarij by Imaam al-Albaanee - a matter well-known - and recorded in that famous statement of 1997. Shaykh Abdul-Azeez bin Baz sanction the detention and imprisonment in 1997 of these <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> - that letter to the Ministry of the Interior is well known and available. Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> around the same time also refuted the mass-takfir of the Ummah present in the statements of these <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a>. Read: <b>Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan's Refutation of Salman al-Awdah's Generalized Mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of All the Muslims</b> - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?qyrnf>see here</a>)  and <b>Shaykh Salih <a href='tags/al-fawzan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/fawzan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Fawzan</font></a></font></a> on Salman al-Awdah's Saying 'The Absent Ummah': This Necessitates the <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Whole Ummah</b> - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?aorjc>see here</a>). <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, along with <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> also had statements in which they were making <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> by way of major sin. From here, you can clearly see that <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> is coming from a particular madrasah (school, orientation). <u>He has not left that madrasah</u>. He is simply working through a different methodology than the one from the 1990s when he was just a stooge for the <i>Qa'di Kharijite</i>s pulling the strings such as Muhammad Suroor. Likewise, <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> was the stooge of Muhammad <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>. More than twenty years on these <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> in turn have their own students who are now appearing on the da'wah scene, making use of the various types of media to amass followers and to spill their poison hoping they won't get noticed. They use the fact that they may have sat in the lessons of Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> or Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a> and others as a means of credibility, but they are actually upon that madrasah of <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>, Ikhwaniyyah. These are the faces we are now seeing, these are the students of those <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> whom the Major Scholars refuted at the end of the 1990s.   </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Important Lessons and Observations That Should Not Be Missed From This Incident</font>    <P>
<b>The First:</b> Look at how <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> brings lavish praises for <a href='tags/muhammad-al-areefee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad al-Areefee</font></a>. He studied with Shaykhs <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a>, Ibn Qu'ud, Barraak and so on. He has a doctorate in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>. He has books on <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, da'wah. He has spoken about the plight of the Syrians and so on. What we are seeing here is the implementation of the bid'ah of al-Muwaazanah. To these people, this is only applied selectively. <u>It is not for the Salafis</u> (Scholars and otherwise) whom people like <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> have hatred and animosity towards. It is only for those people who innovate and invent false ta'weels to nullify the Sunnah of Allaah's Messenger and also feel the need to lie upon Scholars such as Imaam al-Nawawi (rahimahullaah) when corrected and refuted. How can a person with a doctorate in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, having studied with Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> and other scholars for so long come out with such a lie? Even a Salafi in the West who has only read translated works of some of the books on creed, knows that the hadeeth of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) regarding hearing and obeying even when oppressed applies to the whole society and is taken upon its apparent meaning, that it is exactly as it says it is. These credentials are in fact against a person when he chooses misguidance in a matter that is such a great and mighty foundation of the deen and in which there is no ambiguity. Of what benefit were the credentials of Husayn al-Karaabeesee (associate of Imaam al-Shaafi'ee and Imaam Ahmad) when he inherited the madhhab of Bishr al-Mareesee. Or al-Haarith al-Muhaasibee (associate of Imaam Ahmad) when he took to kalaam? None! So we see here <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> making light this affair and making huge muwaazanah for al-Areefee, and as always this love, lenience, sympathy, support, excuse and defence is always for those who oppose the usool of the Sunnah, who fabricate lies against the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the Salaf, but as for the Salafis, only scorn, vilification and judging their intentions.    <P>
<b>The Second:</b> When a person makes a mistake in an obscure, detailed matter then yes, an excuse can be made, that he erred genuinely. But when person makes a blunder in <u>one of the greatest and mightiest foundations of Islaam</u> which has been explained and clarified <u>the world over</u>, <i>again and again</i>, over many centuries, and there is hardly a book of <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> except that this issue is present and clarified within it, and in which there is absolutely no confusion or ambiguity, then there is little excuse for a doctor in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> to bring a <i>bid'iyy ta'weel</i> with respect to this matter. <b>This becomes even more suspect when we realise that he is a student coming from the madrasah (school) of an individual (al-Awdah) refuted by the Major Scholars for statements of mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> by way of major sin and labelled as "Contemporary Kharijites" by greatest Imaam of Hadeeth in the era, (al-Albaanee), and who himself came out leading demonstrations against the rulers in the 1990s (videos available on Youtube).</b>  This matter is <u>so clear</u> that the mistake al-Areefee fell into would not be far off in similarity to the case where he came along and made <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of a hadeeth mentioning one of the attributes of Allaah, and then when refuted he comes with the excuse that "<i>al-Nawawi said it</i>." Except that in this case, he would probably be speaking the truth <u>whereas</u> in the case of the hadeeth of Hudhayfah, he has clearly uttered a lie!    <P>
<b>The Third:</b> <u>And this really is the key point which is being demonstrated in this article</u>: Look at how these people align themselves straight away, how they speak and write, and whom they defend and whom they assault when certain incidents occur. <b>It is not based upon the actual usool of the Sunnah or around truth and falsehood</b>. It is based upon a pre-existing hizbiyyah, a pre-existing animosity and hatred they have towards others whom they want to vilify and attack in every situation and incident. As for <u>the actual usool (foundations)</u> of the Sunnah that are <u>at stake</u> in the particular incident in question, then no, it does not really concern them. Let's elaborate upon this, there are two orientations, <b>a Salafi, Sunni, Athari orientation</b> and a <b>Hizbiyy, Mumayyi', Ikhwani orientation</b>:    <P>
<ul><li>  <u>The Salafi, Sunni, Athari Orientation, Alignment, Positioning and Way of Thinking</u>: Salafis hear a student of one of the heads of the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> (and the teacher himself) invent a lie against Allaah's Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and say what he did not say in the hadeeth of Hudhayfah (radiallaahu anhu) and thereby oppose what is an explicit and manifestly clear foundation from the foundations of the Sunnah. They are concerned that this baatil is spread to millions through satellite channels, online video sites and elsewhere, because they venerate the mightiest of usool of this religion. So just as the people of Iraaq came to Abdullah bin Umar (radiallaahu anhu) to ask about people who were casting doubt regarding al-Qadar, these Salafis went to the people of knowledge and accurately conveyed the statement of this student (of the Kharijite teacher). One of the Shaykhs (<a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a>) responds and says, (<span class='arb'>&#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1589;&#1575;&#1581;&#1576; &#1607;&#1608;&#1609; &#1610;&#1585;&#1610;&#1583; &#1571;&#1606; &#1610;&#1601;&#1587;&#1585; &#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1585;&#1587;&#1608;&#1604; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1607;&#1608;&#1575;&#1607; &#1608;&#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1591;&#1604;&#1576;&#1607; &#1548; &#1605;&#1575; &#1610;&#1580;&#1608;&#1586; &#1607;&#1584;&#1575;&#1548; &#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1610;&#1602;&#1608;&#1604; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1585;&#1587;&#1608;&#1604; &#1605;&#1575; &#1604;&#1605; &#1610;&#1602;&#1604; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1589;&#1604;&#1575;&#1577; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1548; &#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1582;&#1591;&#1585; &#1593;&#1592;&#1610;&#1605;</span>), "<i>This is a person of desire, he wishes to explain the speech of the Messenger upon his own desires and upon his objective. This is not permissible. This one says about the Messenger (alayhis salaatu wassalaam) what he did not say, this is great danger</i>." And the Shaykh spoke truth indeed. And many others also demolish this bid'ah (such as the Muftee, <u>Shaykh Abdul-Azeez Aal al-Shayk</u>h, <u>Shaykh Ubayd al-Jaabiree</u>, <u>Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee</u> and <i>Shaykh Hamad al-Ateeq</i> who demanded the originator of this bid'ah to "bring someone from the Salaf who preceded him in this "<i>new innovated understanding</i>"). So the truth is established and <u>the bid'ah is demolished</u> and the masses are saved from the whisperings and doubts of Shaytaan in the form of these "reformers" claiming rectification and their so-called [Marxist] "social justice." Further, the people now recognize who are <u>the true and real scholars</u> and who are <u>the ignoramuses</u> who are not rooted and grounded at all and are prone to doubts and innovations and false ta'weels they originate from themselves and falsely impute to great Scholars. This is how a Salafi, Sunni, Athari sees the situation and praises and thanks Allaah that the Scholars have clarified this matter and that the Scholars are distinguished from the pseudo-scholars who despite twenty or so years apparently studying <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and usool pretended not to know that in 1200 years of the compliation of books of <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, not a single Salafi, Sunni, Athari scholar brought the <i>bid'iyy ta'weel</i> they (al-Areefee and al-Awdah) tried to invent and impute to al-Nawawi (rahimahullaah). Further, one of those Scholars who clarified the truth (<a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a>) felt it important enough to make a public, open clarification on the matter in which he alluded to the incident, and this only validates that the way, orientation and way of behaving of the Salafis in this matters was correct and truth and justice from the beginning to the end.    <P>
<li><u>The Hizbiyy, Mumayyi', Ikhwani Positioning, Orientation and Alignment</u>: The issue of whether an asl (foundation) from the great usool of the religion has been attacked and invalidated and the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) has been lied upon and a great Scholar of Islaam (al-Nawawi) has been lied upon and imputed with what he is free of matters little, because the issue here <u>is not about usool</u>. <b>It is about personal interests, hatreds and animosities</b>. Hence, the incident which occurred can be utilized (and distorted through concealment and ommission of some of its details) to maintain that position of revilement, abuse and belittlement of those upon the aforementioned Salafi, Sunni, Athari way. "<i>They are mischief-makers</i>", "<i>They are tale-carriers</i>" it is broadcast (by Hizbees such as Sajid Kayum) and so on. You get the picture. In other words, because the hearts of these people are clearly not grounded upon <u>making al-walaa and al-baraa upon the actual usool (foundations of the religion)</u>, they are subsequently blinded in <u>not reading a situation for what it actually is</u> and hence, who is the criminal and who is the victim and who is the oppressor and who is the oppressed and who is the one upon truth and who is the one upon falsehood, who deserves commendation and who deserves rebuke, all of this becomes confused and overturned for them. In fact this is actually a punishment because when a person chooses deviation (zaygh) in his heart, as in he chooses not to make his love and hate, loyalty and disownment purely upon the usool of the Sunnah, he is made to inherit blindness in his basr (vision) and baseerah (insight). This is the path of  people like <a href='tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a> and <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> and others who have demonstrated that they follow their desires and choose falsehood over truth and that they are the most hypocritical and contradictory of people in their da'wah, in their positions and in their love and hate.</ul>    <P>
<b>The Fourth:</b> We make mention of a strategic Ikhwaani methodology which the Salafis should not be ignorant of, and this is written and outlined in their books, those of the Ikhwanis, and is not something hidden. From their strategies is to take issues that are <u>in the hearts</u> of the Muslim masses, to speak about them, author works in respect to them and to draw the masses to themselves in this way through those issues. This is a calculated methodology. The aim here is to raise themselves above and over the Scholars and Imaams of the Sunnah who are an obstacle because these Scholars, by virtue of adhering to the sunan and aathaar, are not opposed to the rulers, rather they adhere to the foundations of the Sunnah with respect to the rulers because they venerate the wahy (revelation) of Allaah. Hence, the aim of these Ikhwanis is to win mass populist support that is <u>as broad as possible</u> and from every segment of society (irrespective of creed) and to have a much greater attachment to the masses than the masses have to the Scholars. For this reason they:    <P>
<ul><li> Focus on current affairs and speak about issues such as <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a>, <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a>, <a href='tags/libya.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Libya</font></a> and often precede the Major Scholars in speaking about these issues. In the 1990s the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> used the Gulf War as an ideal opportunity to come out and call to their da'wah and claim that the Scholars do not really know what is going on began to mobilize the youth against the Scholars and rulers. This is one tact. So here, what the likes of <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and his student <a href='tags/muhammad-al-areefee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad al-Areefee</font></a> are really saying in essence is that "<i>We are the ones who know what is going on regarding the injustice of these rulers, they hoard the wealth, forget the people, commit injustice and tyranny, and these ahaadeeth do not really apply to them. As for those scholars (like the Muftee, and <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> and al-Ghudayaan and others), they don't really know what is going on, <u>we are the ones who know what is going on</u>, we know these rulers have bank accounts in which the wealth is hoarded, we know they are unjust, we know they tell lies, and we know how these ahaadeeth are really understood, they don't apply to these situations, regarding the society as a whole, when it is oppressed, upon hunger and fear </i>..." all of this is <u>the unspoken word and the unspoken meaning</u> which is being conveyed (non-verbally) through certain positions and interpretations they put out to the masses, and this little incident of their's with respect to this <i>bid'iyy ta'weel</i> of hadeeth of Hudhayfah bin al-Yamaan (radiallaahu anhu) is an illustration of what these people are upon.    <P>
<li> Focus on certain topics such as "<i>how to live a happy life</i>", "<i>how to become confident</i>", "<i>how to be a good speaker</i>" and social issues that pertain to personal development and marriage and likewise to come out as champions of women's rights, their betterment, empowerment and development. Through these types of publications they win mass acclaim, and they often go to non-Muslim authors who have written popular books on these topics and then adapt them for an Arab audience. That is why you see <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a> taking this approach. You will not go to any bookstore except their books (on topics such as these that relate to personal development) with their faces on the covers are plastered all over the place. This is part of their strategy through which they earn a place in the hearts of the people that is greater than that of the true and real Scholars and Imaams of the Sunnah. In the West, we see individuals upon this same manhaj like Shadeed Muhammad who claimed in essence that books such as <i>Thalaathat ul-Usool</i> and <i>Kitab al-Tawhid</i> do not solve social problems, and that we need to tackle these social issues directly. He speaks and promotes works such as those of Dale Carnegie that relate to self-development, and comes out to champion, as he claims, the needs of women. Now, we do not deny these things have a place and context within Islaam, but to these people, these approaches are merely means by which to appeal to the masses. They have an underlying manhaj behind which are goals and objectives that are not in line and in accordance with Prophetic methodology (of rectification) in reality. Thus when <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> says "You can teach <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> in ten minutes" as he used to say in the 1990s and when the likes of Shadeed Muhammad says in essence that the books of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> don't really do anything to build communities, then this is an indication that there is something in their hearts towards the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah and in rectification, and the stench of Ikhwaniyyah in their da'wah is readily apparent.</ul>    <P>
So the intent here is that when we hear <i>bid'iyy statements</i> (such as those of <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and Muhammad al-Areefee) we are not naive and stupid to think these are innocent mistakes, because men in positions like these in front of the masses are not stupid people. They know what they are saying. They have been trained to become leaders and spokesmen and they are upon methodologies they are working to in the long term. They know that ultimately, they want to win the ears, eyes and hearts of the masses. They can nurture them more easily and start making ta'weels of the Sunan in order to invalidate them - just like all the innovators of old, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Muta'zilah, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and others make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of that which their souls do not agree with from the Sunan of Allaah's Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). And it is here that they can bring what has occurred in Tunisia, <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> and <a href='tags/libya.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Libya</font></a> to the Gulf states which are their actual targets, whereby the masses no longer have obstacles in front of them that will prevent them from participating in demonstrations and demanding their rights and so on.    <P>
<b>The Fifth:</b> It is established and proven that the refutations by <b><a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a></b> against the new face of Ikhwanis - <i>Safar al-Hawali, <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a>, <a href='tags/abdur-rahmaan-abdul-khaaliq.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq</font></a>, Adnan Ar'oor, Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ribee</i>, from those who brought the fitnah of Hassan al-Banna and <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> into the ranks of the Salafis in <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a>, the Gulf States, Yemen, Sudan, and the Western lands and subsequently launched a whirlwind of tribulations and splitting  in the ranks of the Salafis -  that the Shaykh has been proven and vindicated to have been correct in all of that walhamdulillaah. This is because the reality of those Hizbees and deviants has manifested itself (see the sick condition of al-Ma'ribee for example in <a href=indexfdb8.html?nvskb>this article</a>). <b>The Shaykh defended the usool of the Sunnah and the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a> and was not merely attacking personalities</b>.

Then in addition to <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a>, the other scholars when we put them all together, we find that they each refuted at least some of those hizbees and deviants mentioned earlier, and these scholars include Imaams al-Albaani, Bin Baz, Ibn al-Uthaymeen, Muqbil and Shaykhs Muhammad Amaan al-Jaamee, Shaykh Saaalih <a href='tags/al-fawzan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/fawzan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Fawzan</font></a></font></a>, Shaykh Ahmad al-Najmee, Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin al-Abbaad, Shaykh Ubayd al-Jaabiree, Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee, Shaykh Saalih al-Suhaymee, Shaykh Zayd al-Madkhalee and numerous others. All of those deviants people brought false usool (foundations) and opposed the way of the Salaf and were justly and rightly refuted after they were given years and years of advice. They were not dealt with unjustly  in the least and were not attacked personally. It was a matter of the deen. We established in a recent article how <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> was correct regarding al-Ma'ribee and Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin al-'Abbaad was mistaken (<a href=indexfdb8.html?nvskb >see article here</a>). Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin failed to see that the orientation of al-Ma'ribee and many of his principles were the same as the principles of Adnan Ar'oor, whom Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin himself had warned against previously. Not every scholar will have detailed knowledge of every one who has chosen misguidance after guidance and has deviated and for that reason when differences arise between the Scholars of the Sunnah, we are obligated to follow the one who brings evidence. Refer to (<a href=indexfdb8.html?nvskb >this article</a>) for an elaboration of this matter.     <P>
The key point being made here is this:     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Essential Key Point:</b> When you have fathomed and grasped how individuals like <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> behave and position themselves in the midst of these types of issues and incidents through our illustration with what al-Areefee and <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> tried on with their <i>bid'iyy ta'weel</i> - (which is that people like <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> misrepresent, half-represent, and distort incidents, using a twisted scale of judgement, vilify the party which is correct yet make excuses for the party that is wrong and deserves rebuke and criticism - <b>and show absolutely no concern for the actual underlying asl (foundation) of the religion that is under discussion, rather they shove that under the carpet as if it is a insignificant side-issue</b>) -  then you will be in a position to realize that <b>this is exactly what they have been doing in all previous fitnahs</b>. Further, they deliberately spread lies and propaganda to conceal and confuse the true and real underlying issues, which are in fact great and mighty foundations (usool) of the Sunnah. So if you now just reflect for example on some of the key books written by <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> for example. He defended <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> of Allaah's Messenger (in the book <i>Mataa'in <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> Fil-Sahaabah</i>) from the Marxist, Communist, Socialist vengeance inherent in Sayyid Qutb's works . He defended against the lie of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq against Allaah and His Messenger in that splitting and sectarianism is allowed in Islam and is a positive thing, this is in the book <i>Jamaa'ah Waahidah Laa Jamaa'aat</i> (to which Shaykh <a href='tags/al-fawzan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/fawzan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Fawzan</font></a></font></a> wrote an introduction - <a href=index6fd1.html?mvazr>see here</a>). He defended against the lie of <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a>, and Suroor who portrayed the Messengers as having come with revolutions and attempts at snatching power from the tyrants (in his book <i>Manhaj al-Ambiyaa</i>, for which Shaykh <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> also wrote an introduction). <b>You get the picture, you can see that all of these matters relate to the most fundamental, mightiest, greatest foundations of our deen, these are not personal issues.</b> The Shaykh was supported by all the Major Scholars in these affairs for which he refuted those deviants. So here what we are dealing with are usool, <b>and the Salafis make walaa and baraa based around usool</b>. However, diseased individuals such as al-Farsee (who wilfully chose misguidance after guidance) and his fanatical teaspoons in the form of <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> and others, they see something else. They are blinded because their walaa and balaa and their overriding concerning is <u>not actually based around the usool of the Sunnah</u>. Rather, they have hizbiyyah. For this reason how they position themselves in issues will take on certain direction and to whom they show love or hate or loyalty or allegiance or praise or criticism or commendation or belittlement. <b>All of that is not based around the actual usool that  pertain to the incident or matter at hand</b>. And as for their apparent speech about the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, their attachment to it and teaching of it, it is just like the issue of eemaan to the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, in that eemaan is mere ma'rifah (acquaintance) in the heart of certain facts. Facts which are neutral and do not produce any actions of the heart which necessitate becoming pleased or angry (inwardly and outwardly) on the basis of those facts (i.e. usool of the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and manhaj). This is why we see this outward hypocrisy and contraiction in their behaviour. What makes plain the hypocrisy of Hizbees like <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> is that in his Indo-Pak subcontinent and expatriate world of the Gulf, he champions himself as one who defends the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a> from the likes of Zakir Naik and in these activities of his he makes acceptable for himself that for which he vilifies and attacks the Salafis. </div>    <P>
<b>The Sixth:</b> To conclude our article, those traversing the way of the Khawaarij of our times and their students tried to invalidate the Sunnah of Allaahs' Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) through a <i>bid'iyy ta'weel</i> not known to anyone in 14 centuries of Islaam. They were then slapped down by the Scholars, one of whom (<a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a>) declared that the author of this statement is "<i>a person of desires</i>" who has attributed to the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that which he did not say and another whom declared the author of the statement as a "<i>misguided, misguiding liar</i>". Then when the author of this statement engaged on a public relations mission to mend his image after it was battered by a mighty statement from that Scholar, he forged a lie against Imaam al-Nawawi as a means of trying to absolve himself, claiming that what he said came from al-Nawawi not himself. The Shaykh (<a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a>) took him at face value but the Shaykh is not naive and heedless and so he went back to al-Nawawi's explanation and found that the claim of al-Areefee is false. <b>The Shaykh then went out of his way to make a public statement actually referring to this whole thing and making it known that that person (al-Areefee) made a false <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a>, was corrected for it, then claimed it came from al-Nawawi, and that upon verification, al-Nawawi does not actually say what was claimed</b>. Then Shaykh <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> emphasized that this is one of the greatest usool of Ahl al-Sunnah and one of the greatest foundations of the religion.  The question that one must beg is how did a doctor in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> who apparently studied with the Major Scholars such as Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> - as <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> flatters about al-Areefee - speak with such baatil in the first place? It's not a slip of the tongue. It's an underlying methodology. <b>The fact that Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> went out of his way to make this clarification and make the actual incident known like this reveals a great deal indeed for the one who has the sincerity and the sense to see that.</b>     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>From all the above we see Hizbees like <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> for the dishonest, ignorant, crooked people that they truly are. We learn how they employ certain incidents for their own crooked agendas which are not based around genuine love and concern for the usool of the Sunnah because if there was genuine love and concern in which their is consistency (instead of contradiction and hypocrisy), their understandings, interpretations and positions with respect to these events and incidents and speaking and writing about them would be much different. We see them wearinng the cloak of Salafiyyah whereas their behaviour, positioning and manner of speaking in issues and incidents that arise only expose their hypocritical nature and prove that the last thing they are concerned with is the actual sanctity of the usool of this religion and the greatest thing they are concerned with is venting their frustration, anger and venom towards the Salafis in whose hearts is the greatest of veneration of those usool. In reality, we are dealing with Hizbees who use Salafiyyah as a cloak for their own personal and perverse desires.</div>    <P>
