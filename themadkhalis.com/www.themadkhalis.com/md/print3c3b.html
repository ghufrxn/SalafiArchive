We see the emergence of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> nowadays (see <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?jqpkg //>here</a>, <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?hulwt >here</a>, <a href=index49f2.html?xwcmm >here</a>, <a href=index7e0b.html?sxptl >here</a> and <a href=index0ec1.html?blaok >here</a> for proof that the Scholars recognize them and label them as a faction with this <u>name</u> and <u>methodology</u>), they are rushing towards the blogs and forums, in order to make defenses, apologetical writings, and expressing sentiments towards their figureheads who are Jahmite <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a>, together with what they expressed of  the bid'ahs of the <u><a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a></u>, the bid'ahs of the <u>Khawaarij</u>, the bid'ahs of the <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Mu'tazilah</u>, <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Jabariyyah</u>, <u>Mutasawwifah</u> and statements of expression of the bid'ahs of the Ittihaadiyyah, let alone other outright statements of kufr. These people have come out not for the sake of defending the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> or because of jealousy towards <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> of Allaah's Messenger (alayhis salaam) <u>but only because</u> it grieves them that sincerity of purpose is given to the Ummah in warning against the misguidance and deviations found in the <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i> (ideology) of the 20th century ignoramuses whom they have taken as their symbolic figureheads (rumooz).     <P>
In this series of articles we will document and highlight, in no particular order, what they have testified upon themselves, <b>through their own actions and activities</b>, of the following of desires and aiding and supporting falsehood, upon knowledge and intent. <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>The Method of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> in Faking Attachment to the Scholars of <a href="tags/saudi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Saudi</font></a></font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><a href=indexacc3.html?shufz >Please read Part 1 of this article</a></div>    <P>
Before proceeding to present the advice of the Muftee, Shaykh Abdul-Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh that the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> are using, it is necessary to mention a few words about the nature of this current attachment of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> to these Scholars in general:    <P>
You should know with certainty that these people are not with the Muftee Abdul-Azeez, nor are they with the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah in those methodologies that clash with their methodologies that have come to them through the <i>fikr </i>of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a> and others, and then distilled and refined for them further through the more recent <i>tabaqaat</i> of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> Bannaawiyyah. They are not really with <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a> <u>in his da'wah</u> and nor with Shaykh's <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> or <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a>, or Shaykh Salih <a href='tags/al-fawzan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/fawzan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Fawzan</font></a></font></a> or Shaykh Abdul-Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh, the current Muftee, nor with <a href='tags/al-ghudayan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghudayan</font></a>, nor with al-Luhaydaan or any of the other major scholars for that matter - who all have a clear distinct da'wah collectively which is what is essentially found in the book of <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a>, "<b>The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah</b>", and indeed that is what the da'wah of Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab was founded upon.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The da'wah of these people is based around the <i>fikr </i>of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a>. They are not bending over backwards and almost killing themselves in defending <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a> for no reason. Their da'wah here in the West and in the East, and their perceptions and activities are all built upon the <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i> of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a>. They  make a display of association with and loyalty for the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, reflected in their refutations of the Ash'arites, Deobandis, Sufis, Rafidi Shias and the likes - all of which lacks congruency and consistency with their loyalty, allegiance, love and passion for Jahmites, <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> and Rafidis, such as <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and Jahmite, <a href='tags/sufi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sufi</font></a> <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Mufawwids like <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
This "<i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>" (i.e. their da'wah) takes events and occurrences <u>as the fundamental starting points</u> upon which their perception, priorities and course of da'wah, and specific activitites are constructed - and thus they will permit affairs like multiple groups and parties in Islam and justify working with them (like Hizb ut-Tahrir for example), in order to address and rectify these contemporary events and occurrences, and this is profound jahl of the numerous foundations of the religion and is not something that can be addressed in this article but requires numerous articles on its own.</div>    <P>
What we see from the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> of gathering and compiling the various statements of the Shaykhs of Ahl us-Sunnah these days, it's all fake, its a stage-act, because they are not with these scholars in their methodologies. <u>Most of them actually dislike these scholars</u>. Many of them make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Muftee and the other Scholars. Others amongst conceal this <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> but do not reveal it. Others consider them stooges and pawns or have resentment and hatred towards them, and if they see <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> being made of these scholars (which is abundant on their forums), you will not see a fair share of them disagreeing with this <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>. Rather, they will happily post in the same threads and not batting an eyelid to what they see of attacks or insults upon these scholars. So you have to understand these people are simply <u>opportunists</u> and they are just out merely to collect the mutashaabihaat, through which they can confuse others, and make propaganda in favor of their figureheads and their "<i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>" and against the true Scholars of the Sunnah - who are upon the methodology of the Prophets in da'wah and rectification.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Their <b>approach</b> can be likened in certain respects to the approach of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who come along and they will say to you: "<i>at-Tabari made <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of hand, and al-Bukhari made <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of al-wajh</i>" - and so they will continue in this manner gathering all the isolated statements of these scholars - even if some of these statements are not established from the scholars, and even if these scholars have explicit other statements in which they establish <u>the actual usool</u> regarding the subject - but the point here is <b>to speak about the approach</b> in general of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> - which is that their methodology is to flee from the <u>clear decisive statements</u> of the Scholars which establish and lay down, in clear explicit terms, <b>the actual usool (foundations) and manaahij (methodologies)</b> of the Salaf and instead go to isolated statements that are simply responses to questions that relate to perceptions of events and occurrences, and which may vary from one Shaykh to the next based upon a variety of differing factors and circumstances. So if you go to Muftee Abdul-Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh he will have one perception, but if yo went to <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> (rahimahullaah) he would have told you something altogether different, and if you went to another Scholar he would perhaps say something else - however, despite these different perceptions and views on these event<u>s, occurrences, they are nevertheless </u>absolutely united on the underlying usool.</div>    <P>
So instead of, for example, going to the sayings of the Muftee that would relate to, say, making <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the entire Ummah (the madhhab of the Khawaarij), or making <a href='tags/khurooj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Khurooj</font></a> against the hukkaam, or whether <a href='tags/saudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi</font></a> is an apostate state, and regarding the terrorism carried out in <a href='tags/saudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi</font></a> (by those tainted with the <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i> of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> for example) and so on and the likes, in which the Muftee would give a clear answer upon the foundation of Ahl us-Sunnah and which would convict anyone who spoke or propounded such things, they will instead compile and gather the types of things you see them gathering in order to portray, fraudulently, a picture that they are with the Muftee or with the Scholars.     <P>
So while the statements of the Muftee Abdul-Azeez or the statements of Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> (see   <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?owscq>here</a>, <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?srjss>here</a> and <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?eoizx>here</a>) that pertain to <u>actual usool</u> - in the sense that they corroborate the actual usool - would convict their figureheads in reality, they will instead rush to an altogether different category of statements, simply as a means of defending their rumooz (figureheads), and not because they genuinely want corroboration of the truth regarding the actual usool in which differences have occurred (as a result of the innovations like those of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and Banna).     <P>
To give you a quick illustration of what is meant, go and read each of these three articles:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>Shaykh Ibn Jibreen:</b> Usamah bin Laden and Followers Make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Muslims - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?owscq>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Shaykh Ibn Jibreen:</b> Calls Them 'The Kharijite, Terrorist, Dogs of Hellfire', Those Who Revolt Against the Rulers - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?srjss>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Shaykh Ibn Jibreen:</b> On Those Who Rule By <a href='tags/secular-laws.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Secular Laws</font></a> - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?eoizx>see here</a>)  </ul>    <P>
Now, when you take these statements that relate to actual usool, you realize that they absolutely demolish the entire foundation of the ideologies of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> - in a single sweep they wipe out the very foundations for it. But, you won't see the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> investigating matters from <i>an usoolee</i> point of view. Their activities are simply to confuse and deceive in order to protect their figureheads and their books and their ideologies.    <P>
This approach is not unlike what the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> of today do, of claiming the madhhab of the Salaf was <i>tafweed </i>and <i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a></i> and deceiving the Ummah into thinking they are upon the way of the Salaf, hunting, compiling and gathering statements of the Salaf in that regard. Then likewise these <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> fraudulently portray that they are with the Scholars of <a href='tags/saudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi</font></a> or with the likes of Imaam al-Albani and upon their da'wah and manhaj, when in reality the two da'wahs are not the same, one is "<i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>" the other is "Shar'iyy <i>ilm</i> (knowledge)" - <a href=indexf862.html?umiea>see this excellent article</a>. So these people do not have any scholars actually with them, and they only use and propagate those sayings of the Scholars of <a href='tags/saudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi</font></a> <u>in which they find utility for their own Haraki da'wah</u>, the overall purpose of which is simply to defend their figureheads such as <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a> and use it as a means to prevent these figureheads from criticism, so as to allow <u>the continued circulation</u> of the books of these people and the  methodologies of these people, which in their foundations, <b>oppose the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah</b>, and that's really what the crux of the dispute is about, and thus you see, their resentment towards the books of <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> like these:    <P>
<ul><li>The book called called (<span class='arb'>&#1605;&#1606;&#1607;&#1580; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1606;&#1576;&#1610;&#1575;&#1569; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1593;&#1608;&#1577; &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1601;&#1610;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1603;&#1605;&#1577; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1602;&#1604; </span>) "<i>Manhaj al-Anbiyaa fid-Da'wah ilallaah</i>" (<b>The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah</b>) in which he refuted the secular atheist Jewish manifesto found in the books of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> of the revolutionary vanguard, the <a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a> of <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a> and the secular, pluralistic political (Machiavellian) methodologies espoused and enacted by <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a> - all of which are the underlying causes of the presence of the splitting, enmity, hatred found in <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a>, the very one that the Shaykh is warning against. For the people in <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> were united and upon a single jamaa'ah until the <i>fikr </i>of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a> and <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a> came to them.    <P>
<li>The book called (<span class='arb'>&#1580;&#1605;&#1575;&#1593;&#1577; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583;&#1577; &#1604;&#1575; &#1580;&#1605;&#1575;&#1593;&#1575;&#1578; &#1608;&#1589;&#1585;&#1575;&#1591; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583; &#1604;&#1575; &#1593;&#1588;&#1585;&#1575;&#1578;</span>) "<i>Jamaa'ah Waahidah, Laa Jamaa'aat Siraat Waahid, Laa Asharaat</i>" (<b>A Single Jamaa'ah, not Many Jamaa'ahs, A Single Path, not Tens of [Paths]</b>), in refutation of the pluralist, secularist da'wah of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq al-Misree who was simply continuing the work of <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a> and his secular, pluralistic da'wah which called for the unification of all creeds and affiliations, including the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a>, for working together to establish the khilaafah!</ul>    <P>
And it is <b>exactly this</b> that they are waging a war against! This is what their problem is about. It clashes with the "<i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>" and the <i>haraki da'wah</i> that springs from the works of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a> and it is <b>for this reason</b> they are waging this campaign.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Another example of <b>the true nature of the activities of these people</b> that can be given is like what the Ashaa'irah will do, they will find generalized ambiguous statements from some Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah and in which they see the opportunity to claim that these Scholars have said the <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> are from Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, and that there is goodness in them and so on, and they try to get as much mileage out of these types of statements as possible. This is despite the fact that in their books, the <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a>, they hold the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to be created (see <a href=indexb620.html?vlffh>here</a> and <a href=index9400.html?waqwg>here</a> [from Qutb]), and make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of Istiwaa (see <a href=index6ffe.html?kxsoa>here</a> and <a href=index283f.html?ebzdi>here</a> [from Qutb]) and other attributes, and deny Allaah's Uluww (see <a href=index3395.html?tkptu>here</a>, <a href=index5824.html?taifd>here</a> and <a href=indexd1fd.html?pgpti>here</a> [from Qutb]), and reject the aahaad hadith in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> (see <a href=index69c9.html?lalhx>here</a> [from Qutb]), and so on, from the innovations and misguidance of the Ash'arites. So knowing that these <u>ambiguous statements</u> of these Scholars will allow them to deceive the people and allow them to defend and propagate their da'wah, the Ash'arites gather them and present them to the people.     <P>
<b>The same here with the Qutbiyyah</b>. What do you see in the books of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and Banna? Major innovations, calamities, misguidances, those of Soofiyyah, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Jabariyyah, the Communists and others, alongside the secular, non-Islamic methodologies they innovated into the deen. And then these people will come along and say, "<i>Hey the Muftee Abdul-Aziz said <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> was a man of thaqaafah and well-read and you may benefit from some of his literary excellence....</i>" and so on, and they will gather statements likes these - and their objective - just like the objective of the Ash'arites - is to say "<i>Hey Qutb's works are fine. Refer to them, study them, benefit from them and all the <a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a> that they contain, because that's real da'wah, and that's the real fiqh ul-waqi'</i>" and <b>this is the only reason</b> that they are using the statement of the Muftee. </div>    <P>

Note that this "group" he is talking about are those who are upon what Imaam al-Albaani, Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> and Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a> were upon - as we have corroborated elsewhere - and likewise a large group of major Scholars of having corroborated <u>the true methodologies</u> in calling to Allaah, rectifying the society, having pointed out the deviations of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a> and their being far from the methodologies of Islaam in this regard and far from the correct Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, and having convicted the likes of Safar and Salman of calling to a "<i><a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a></i>" and being "<i>Khaarijiyyah  Asriyyah</i>", and of the falsehood of "<i>multiple jamaa'aat</i>" and the hizbiyyaat  (of Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaliq) that are integral to the da'wah of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a> - so this "group" he is referring to are those who are with the Major Scholars as a whole, <u>in the truths that they clarified</u> regarding many of the methodologies of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen - and you can see this is clearly <u>a loaded question</u> through what comes next.     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... and they revile the Du'aat and the Mashaayikh ... and they revile Shaykh <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a>, and they revile Shaykh <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, and some of them say that they are astray, leading others astray..." <b>Presenter:</b> [interjecting] "You request some advice..." <b>Questioner:</b> "Yes some advice for them..."  Immediately, <b>the Muftee</b> begins to answer: "O my brothers ...", then the questioner drops in at the very end (after the Shaykh has commenced his speech) "...most of them are the students of Shaykh <a href='tags/rabi-al-madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rabi al-<a href="tags/madkhali.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Madkhali</font></a></font></a>..." </blockquote>    <P>
Note here that the Muftee already started to give advice and it just happened that the questioner inserted his statement regarding "the students of Shaykh Rabi' al-Madkhali".    <P>
As for the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> mentioned by the questioner, (al-Qarnee, al-Awdah etc.) then <u>the Major Scholars</u> already refuted them for their <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Extremism</font></a> and mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Ummah. <b>Shaykh Salih al-Fawzaan</b> refuted the statements of both al-Qarnee and al-Awdah, as found in the book al-Ajwibah al-Mufidah - <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?aorjc>see this article</a>, and also <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?qyrnf>this article</a> for his refutations upon statements of mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>. and <b>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen</b> warned from the cassettes of <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> and from their "<b><a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a></b>" (see   <a href=index33d0.html?tjmrl>here</a>), and <b>Imaam al-Albani</b> called them "<i>Khaarijiyyah Asriyyah</i> (the Khawaarij of the Era)", as is too well known and famous to even mention, and <b>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen</b> and <b>Shaykh al-Fawzaan</b> both corroborate the existence of a "<a href="tags/qutbi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutbi</font></a>" manhaj, and its followers the they both commend and authorize warning from it (see   <a href=index0ec1.html?blaok>here</a>, <a href=index7e0b.html?sxptl>here</a> and <a href=index49f2.html?xwcmm>here</a>) ... and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on. All that is from close to ten years ago.     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Muftee: My brothers, I hope we fear Allaah with respect to ourselves, and that we do not publicize these types of affairs, when we know of their existence, we strive to rectify them, as for publicizing them and making them open, then this is not befitting.[It's not befitting] that Muslims should have these hatreds and disputes.</blockquote>    <P>
Now, here is where it get's interesting. If the Muftee is advising that such an issue is not befitting to be raised, and publicized, and there are other ways and means, then is what these people (the Qutbiyyah) are doing in accordance with the spirit of the Shaykh's naseehah? Remember, these are the people who are propagating this advice and portraying it as <u>a warning</u> against the <a href='tags/madkhalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhalis</font></a>, despite the fact that the Shaykh did not mention any "<a href="tags/madkhalis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Madkhalis</font></a>", and nor did he pass any judgements within his advice.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>O my brothers, the one who desires the truth and rectification, then this has its ways and the one who desires publicizing [of these matters] and belittlement, then this has its ways.</blockquote>    <P>
Now you to remember these are the people who are faking rectification and faking arriving at the truth, through their activities. <b>If you were genuine, would you have used the advice of the Shaykh in this manner?</b> Rather, you only made use of this occurrence as a means of publicizing these matters and belittlement and inducing hate and the likes. Remember, these are the people <u>claiming</u> rectification as well as attachment to the Shaykh despite the fact that these people are the furthest from this advice as is clear from their actions.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The student of knowledge is not concerned and occupied with belittling so and so and so and so, but he occupies himself with rectification and calling to good.</blockquote>     <P>
What they are doing is clearly not rectification and nor calling to it if they were to judge their own actions through the words of the Muftee. But as we said, this is only a fake attachment, they are not with the Muftee, the Muftee's words <u>are of use to them from the angle of political expediency</u>, not because they <u>actually value</u> and <u>eagerly desire to act</u> upon the advice of the Shaykh. That's plain obvious for anyone to see.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>All of us are prone to error (i.e. sin) and the best of those who err are those who (continuously) repent. And none amongst us is infallible from error. Imaam Malik (rahimahullaah) said: "Each of us can refute or be refuted except Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). So we are not free from errors. As for dividing the people, this one is Salafi and this one is not a Scholar, this is not appropriate. All brothers ought to be occupied with knowledge, we ask Allaah for success, guidance, steadfastness. And if someone perceives an error from his brother, he should advise him and contact him, and let us seek refuge in Allaah from hizbiyyaat, gatherings, and formations. In all of them there is not any good.</blockquote>    <P>
General principles concerning erring, advice, rectification, correcting and refuting errors and so on. A person is a Salafi who adheres to the sum whole of what the Salaf were upon in their <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, manhaj, da'wah and someone leaves Salafiyyah (if they were upon it) by opposing an <i>asl</i> from the <i>usool</i> of the religion, such as making <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the sinners, or making <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>, or speaking with the other major innovations and the likes. But here the Shaykh is referring to genuine mistakes that are made and which are not persisted upon, and which require advice, correction and so on in the correct manner. Again these people are claiming attachment to the Muftee and his advice, it's a shame the attachment is only a fake one because if they were sincerely after rectification and unity, <u>they would have implemented the advice of the Shaykh</u> in their actions instead of using it, <u>wrongly</u>, for a purpose <u>completely in contradiction</u> with the spirit of the Shaykh's advice.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We should mention the saying of Allaah, the Majestic and Exalted, "<b>Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects (all kinds of religious sects), you (O Muhammad) have no concern in them in the least. Their affair is only with Allaah, Who then will tell them what they used to do</b>." (Al-An'am 6:159). And He said, "<b>And do not be of the Mushrikeen. Of those who split up their religion and became sects, each sect rejoicing in that which is with it</b>." (Ar-Rum 30:31-32)</blockquote>    <P>
Alhamdulillaah, these verses are the very ones that the likes of Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baaz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baaz</font></a> and Imaam al-Albani and Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a> and Shaykh Salih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> and many others used to refute the doctrine of "<i>the multiplicity of groups</i>", and upon which <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> wrote his refutation of <a href='tags/abdur-rahmaan-abdul-khaaliq.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq</font></a> "<b>A Single Jamaa'ah not Multiple Jamaa'ahs</b>", which was commended by the other Scholars, when the latter tried to revive and re-innovate the bi'dah of pluralism of <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a> into the deen of our Lord. The unity that the Shaykh is speaking of is one that <u>does not make admissible</u> these types of doctrines that allow for splitting and hizbiyyaat, and formations and gatherings and the likes. And the hizbiyyaat and formations of gatherings and the likes only arise when they make their attachments, love and hate based around other than the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So [we] Scholars and callers to Allaah, it is desirable for every one amongst them, that his goal is to call to Allaah, his goal is to rectify the society, his goal is to unite the word and to rectify the saff (line, rank) and to unify the aim. His goal should be that he is envious for this Muslim land with an envy that leads him to soften the hearts and halting everything that disturbs [one's] thought, so that the word can be united, so that the rank can be unified, and that we stand together all as one against those who threaten our religion, our security, our stability and our economy.</blockquote>    <P>
Alhamdulillaah, this is the truth - and for an excellent defence of <u>this very truth</u>, refer to the two books of Shaykh Rabee:    <P>
<ul><li>The book called called (<span class='arb'>&#1605;&#1606;&#1607;&#1580; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1606;&#1576;&#1610;&#1575;&#1569; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1593;&#1608;&#1577; &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1601;&#1610;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1603;&#1605;&#1577; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1602;&#1604; </span>) "<i>Manhaj al-Anbiyaa fid-Da'wah ilallaah</i>" (<b>The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah</b>) in which he refuted the secular atheist Jewish manifesto found in the books of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> of the revolutionary vanguard, the <a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a> of <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a> and the secular, pluralistic political (Machiavellian) methodologies espoused and enacted by <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a> - all of which are the underlying causes of the presence of the splitting, enmity, hatred found in <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a>, the very one that the Shaykh is warning against. For the people in <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> were united and upon a single jamaa'ah until the <i>fikr </i>of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a> and <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a> came to them.    <P>
<li>The book called (<span class='arb'>&#1580;&#1605;&#1575;&#1593;&#1577; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583;&#1577; &#1604;&#1575; &#1580;&#1605;&#1575;&#1593;&#1575;&#1578; &#1608;&#1589;&#1585;&#1575;&#1591; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583; &#1604;&#1575; &#1593;&#1588;&#1585;&#1575;&#1578;</span>) "<i>Jamaa'ah Waahidah, Laa Jamaa'aat Siraat Waahid, Laa Asharaat</i>" (<b>A Single Jamaa'ah, not Many Jamaa'ahs, A Single Path, not Tens of [Paths]</b>), in refutation of the pluralist, secularist da'wah of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq al-Misree who was simply continuing the work of <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a> and his secular, pluralistic da'wah which called for the unification of all creeds and affiliations, including the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a>, for working together to establish the khilaafah!</ul>    <P>
And alhamdulillaah, these books were praised and met with great acceptance for they corroborated and established the truth.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...so that the word can be united, so that the rank can be unified, and that we stand together all as one against those who threaten our religion, our security, our stability and our economy.</blockquote>    <P>
From amongst those who threaten the security in that land (<a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a>), the stability and economy are the <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> and Khawaarij, and the Irhaabiyyoon (Terrorists). And all of these people, their spring and fountain is the the <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i> of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>. And all of the Scholars of <a href='tags/saudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi</font></a> without exception have stood against this particular threat, united therein. And we do not see these <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> spreading with such vigour and zeal all the very strong condemnations of the Muftee Abdul-Aziz Aal ash-Shaykh against the Irhaabiyyoon and their evil deeds within <a href='tags/saudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi</font></a>, and we don't even need to elaborate upon the reason for that.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for occupying ourselves with each other, with this one reviling that one and that one reviling this one and all of these [types of] affairs, these are [matters] that do not serve any goal and nor allow us to actualise the goal.... I mean to actualise a praiseworthy goal ...</blockquote>    <P>
Again, as the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> are the ones who are parading this particular advice of the Shaykh, using it simply as a political tool to vent, anger, hatred and frustration and to attack a Scholar from the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah, <u>not because the advice entered and touched their hearts and humbled them</u>! Because if it did, they would not be using it in this manner.    <P>
As we have said before, these truths are written <b>all over the actions</b> of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>, it's all plain obvious, and even after you make excuses, it is still hard to interpret the actions of these people (who are using this advice of the Shaykh for point-scoring) as being genuine and sincere.   <P>
