<div class='sidebar'>  <font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction and Background</font>    <P>
<blockquote>A few days ago (<i>this article is a year old September 2012</i>), some blind-followers of <a href='../tags/abdullah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah al-Farsee</font></a> in Kuwait published a video in which <a href='../tags/abdullah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah al-Farsee</font></a> made some false allegations against <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> 'bin Haadee (hafidhahullaah) regarding the issue of iqaamat ul-hujjah (establishment of the proof) in relation to <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of one who falls into <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a>. This was in fact one of many false allegations made in that same video. <a href='../tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a> is <u>an ignorant, confused and mentally disturbed individual</u> whose history has shown that he is ready to flip in an instant. <b>Flashback:</b> This is the same person who made <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of Abdur-Raheem al-Tahhaan and then had to take it back. He is the same person who refuted the Turathis and others in the lecture "<i>Ma'naa Qawl al-Hizbiyyeen: Wasaa'il al-Da'wah Ijtihaadiyyah</i>..." and then he threatened legal action if the transcript of his lecture was not removed because he no longer critizes Turaath! This is the type of character we are dealing with here. In this article we will drive a stake into this slander which came from this flippant pseudo-scholar a few days ago.     <P>
<b>The Issue in a Nutshell:</b> <a href='../tags/abu-al-hasan-al-maribee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ribee</font></a> wrote a book "<i>al-Siraaj al-Wahhaaj Fee Bayaan al-Minhaaj</i>" and <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> advised him on many shortcomings in the book that needed to be corrected. The Shaykh advised him in secret in 1997. One of the issues was that al-Ma'ribee made a point that making <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='../tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> and tafseeq of them (as a whole) is something that requires iqaamat ul-hujjah before <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> is made of a person, and he cited as his source, the book "<i>al-Sarim al-Maslul</i>" of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>. So <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> advised him and told him to faithfully and accurately convey the actual view of Shaykh al-Islaam in this matter, which is that Shaykh al-Islaam did not specify establishment of the proof in this issue. Al-Ma'ribee did not heed this observation and correct himself (not even till five years later in 2002). Then when he began to dispute and wrangle about the matter openly (at the height of his fitnah in 2002), he began to change the actual issue from what it was (i.e. that he cited <i>al-Saarim al-Maslul</i> and should therefore <u>accurately convey</u> what is in it and not distort Ibn Taymiyyah's speech) and turned it instead into an issue of whether there is ikhtilaaf in the matter or not (on whether iqaamat ul-hujjah is required for the one who makes <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of all or most of the Sahaabah). <a href='../tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a> has not grasped this matter at all and has told a great lie by claiming that <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> was refuting al-Ma'ribee on specifying iqaamat ul-hujjah for the one who falls into <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a>.   </blockquote>  </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Gross Slander of the Ignorant, Confused <a href='../tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a> That Has Been Recorded by the Angels and Will Be Brought Out on Yawm ul-Qiyaamah</font>    <P>
<img src=../assets/images/farsee-slander-vid.gif align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0> The video to the right was published on 8th August 2012 by a Turathi Ikhwani organisation masquerading behind Sunnah and Salafiyyah whilst attacking some of the leading scholars of the Sunnah who have great efforts in protecting Islam, Sunnah and Salafiyyah from the contemporary Innovators from al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen and others. This faction has taken the confused and ignorant <a href='../tags/abdullah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah al-Farsee</font></a> (a mentally unstable individual) as its leader and guide. <a href='../tags/abdullah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah al-Farsee</font></a> haphazardly makes accusations and makes claims that are not referenced and he puts words into the mouth of <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> which the Shaykh never said. The video is aimed at evaluating "<i>Madkhali criticisms</i>" and "<i>reviewing this group's unprincipled accusations</i>". Let us jump straight into the first 6 minutes where <a href='../tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a> is going to teach us how "<a href="../tags/madkhalis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Madkhalis</font></a>" play about with the religion. The discussion is regarding the issue of iqaamat ul-hujjah (establishment of the proof):    <P>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="../mp3player.swf" width="200" height="20"><param name="movie" value="../mp3player.swf" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http://spubs.com/farsee-iqamatul-hujjah2.mp3&amp;showvolume=1&amp;loadingcolor=ff75ff" /></object>    <P>
Inshaa'Allaah we will comment on this ignorant rant in what follows so that the reality is made clear that <a href='../tags/abdullah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah al-Farsee</font></a> has lost his marbles. He says at the beginning:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>This group of extremists actually, although they are called extremists, but I call them players, they play with the religion of Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta'aalaa) for their own desires. One day you will see them going this extreme and then all of a sudden go the other extreme, the opposite extreme, you see.</blockquote>    <P>
A <u>great roar of laughter first and foremost here</u>, where al-Farsee is actually describing himself, he is a great entertainer. He has forgotten his <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> he made of Abdur-Raheem al-Tahhaan upon other than Sharee'ah principles then was forced to retract it. Then he has forgotten how he used to assault Turaath and make cassettes refuting the false principles of the Hizbiyyeen such as his lecture "<i>Ma'naa Qawl al-Hizbiyyeen: Wasaa'il al-Da'wah Ijtihaadiyyah</i>..." in which he refuted Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaliq and <a href='../tags/ihyaa-al-turaath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ihyaa al-Turaath</font></a> amongst others.  Then he turns around and sends Maktabah Salafiyyah <a href=../../../www.salafitalk.net/st/uploads/myjourneybacktoturaathsikhwaanimanhaj.gif>an email</a> from his address mecons99@hotmail.com dated 27th September 1998 threatening legal action if we don't take his speech regarding <a href='../tags/ihyaa-al-turaath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ihyaa al-Turaath</font></a> down! And then he writes an introduction for the English translation of Shaykh Rabee's book "<b>The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah</b>" (which was - alhamdulillaah - never included in the printed version but saved nevertheless!) and in which there occurs his statements:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>The Shaykh has clearly proven in his wonderful work, the deviation of the so-called contemporary groups of da'wah who have turned da'wah into a means of seeking power using all means possible even if they were to be corruption...Recently, Abdul-Rahman Abdul-Khaaliq has falsely accused [Shaykh Rabee'] of "emptying" Tawheed of the concept of Rulership of Allah - this was what Shaykh Abdul-Rahman Abdul-Khaaliq said in his book "<i>Ar-Radd Al-Wajeez</i>", p.15,16 (This book was published in 1996, First edition)... In conclusion to this small introduction, I would like the reader to get the correct message from this great book of <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> and compare every existing da'wah to the true criterion of da'wah that is explained in this book and supported by many proofs from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the messenger and the way of <a href='../tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>. To save yourself the time and effort, I can tell you that all the so-called "groups of da'wah" have deviated from the path of the prophets in their beginning, the means and the goal. I ask Allah that you may benefit a great deal by our Shaykh's book and may Allah reward him with the best...</blockquote>    <P>
Then <a href=../../../www.salafitalk.net/st/uploads/myjourneybacktoturaathsikhwaanimanhaj.gif>he flips and turns on his heels</a>, contradicts himself and invalidates everything he spoke with before. One day he is attacking Safar and Salmaan, the <a href='../tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> of <a href='../tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a>, then another day  he is praising them. This is an unstable man, a mentally unstable man. This is leaving aside the way <u>he has been battered, bruised and humiliated</u> in the various Arabic forums in which he used to participate and from which an entire catalogue of his ignorance, confusion, lies and outright stupidity can be produced. But of course, his Muqallidah who do not speak or understand Arabic do not see the other universe of <a href='../tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a> and so they remain stooped in their ignorance and misguidance.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Issue of Iqaamat al-Hujjah (Establishment Of the Proof) And Abdullaah al-Farsee's Jahl (Ignorance), Hawaa (Desire) and Hamaaqah (Stupidity)</font>    <P>
Let's now get into the main issue and here it is, this is <a href='../tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a>, making a display of himself:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>And they do both ways in the name of the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and the consensus of the Salaf. Because this is their only way to pass those thoughts, to attribute them to the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah and the way of the Salaf, this is the only way they can market them, those rules for example regarding which is the first fundamental of Islaam and yet they have played with it. One day they say that someone who makes clear <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a> like worshipping the graves then by the consensus of the scholars he is a mushrik and he does not need that the proof should be established upon him before calling him a mushrik, this is for example when their head, Rabee' al-Madkhali replied on al-Ma'ribee. He blamed him for not considering people like grave worshippers to be mushriks until the proof is established. He said, "Who said that, it is the concensus of the Salaf that they are Mushriks" which is true. But then later on when they accused him of declaring the Barelwis as kafirs, Ikhwanis as kafirs, others (as) kafirs, he wanted to defend himself. So he said "I don't declare those who worship the graves like the Barelwis  before establishing the proof so how do you accuse me of declaring those people kafirs" and then he said "What i am saying is not only my position, this is what Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said and this is the consensus of the Salaf." You see how they are playing with the religion. Meaning, here he says "The consensus of the Salaf, you should call them mushriks, there is no need to establish the proof" and here he said, "It is the consensus of the Salaf that you cannot call them Mushriks except after establishing the proof" and this is <a href='../tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, the <a href='../tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of Allaah, the first fundamental of Islam. And then in a third position, when he wants his followers not to dispute amongst each other and not to be harsh for each other, he says, "Look my brother, the scholars of Najd have differed in this issue, and yet they remained polite towards each other , respecting each other." Now there is a third position. First there is a concensus here, second there is a consensus in the opposite way and now there is a difference. What kind of a religion is this. What kind of Salafiyyah is this. And if you dare to do this with the most important fundamental of Islam, then what are you going to do with the rest of Islam? Playing with everything as you desire. Here you want to prove al-Ma'ribee wrong, you make <a href='../tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> look this way. Here you wany to make yourself innocent from <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, you put it like you want and you say the opposite of what you said there. Then in a third place, you say something altogether different, subhanallaah.</blockquote>    <P>
Let's make sure we have got this clear in our minds:  Al-Farsee is alleging that <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> <u>first</u> showed rejection against al-Ma'ribee for specifying establishment of the proof for those who fall into <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a> (pay attention to this). Then he says that <u>secondly</u> <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> began to affirm the requirement of the establishment of the proof when accusations of <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> were made against him. And then <u>third</u>, al-Farsee says that <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> started saying that there is a difference regarding the issue of establishment of the proof. Al-Farsee then says that this is an issuee connected to <a href='../tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and portrays as if <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> is changing views and "playing around." Make sure you have grasped all of this!    <P>
We will deal with this matter in the following way: <u>Firstly</u>, we will establish the realities by quoting directly from the corrections of <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> to al-Ma'aribee so we can see that al-Farsee is a great liar indeed. <u>Secondly</u>, we will then address the actual issue of <u>establishment of the proof</u>, citing  Shaykh Rabee's detailed treatment of it in a specific article and make clear by way of this as well that al-Farsee is a scheming liar.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>A Clarification of the True Realities And Merciful Guidance For the Confused Billy-Goat (al-Farsee) Banging Its Head on the Mountain (Rabee')</font>    <P>
Further below we present to you six scanned pages from the advice (to al-Ma'ribee) that had been sent by <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> bin Haadee in private many years prior to it being made open and public when <a href='../tags/abu-al-hasan-al-maribee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ribee</font></a> did not accept the criticisms and advice he was given. This was published separately online during the early 2000s and it is also available in Volume 13 of <i>Majmu' Kutub wa Rasaa'il wa Fataawaa of Shaykh Rabee'</i> (pp. 250-276).     <P>
<img src=../assets/images/iqam-hujjah-sw--252.gif align=right hspace=8 border=0> First on pages 252-253 (see image to the right) we see the Shaykh briefly alluding to this issue in the opening part to his small treatise before he goes into detail about the various issues. He says, "... <b>such as that issue in which he (al-Ma'ribee) opposed the Salaf, Shaykh al-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> declared to be a disbeliever the one who doubted the kufr of the one who spoke with that (issue), which is the issue of the <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the <a href='../tags/sahaabah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sahaabah</font></a>, or the  majority of them, or who made tafseeq of them. For the one from whom that occurs disbelieves, and whoever doubts in the disbelief of such a one, then his kufr too is designated. But Abu al-Hasan refused to accept this observation and he published his book upon his anvil (printing press). And when this book appeared without taking this observation I made him aware verbally (directly) and I believe this was two or three times, but he did not raise his head for this and continued to publish the book, despite its obvious flaws, reaching three editions</b>..."    <P>
The issue here is pertaining to <a href='../tags/takfeer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfeer</font></a> of the <a href='../tags/sahaabah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sahaabah</font></a>, and this is addressed in more detail in what is to follow in the Shaykh's observations on al-Ma'ribee's book "<i>al-Siraaj al-Wahhaaj Fi Bayaan al-Minhaaj</i>." The issue of <a href='../tags/takfeer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfeer</font></a> and iqaamat ul-hujjah was addressed by <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> numerous times within this advice to al-Ma'ribee in relation to a number of different issues: <u>a)</u> <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the <a href='../tags/sahaabah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sahaabah</font></a>, <u>b)</u> revilement of Allaah and His Messenger and <u>c)</u> beliefs and actions of kufr and <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a>.     <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Translation and Explanation of What is Above</font>    <P>
<b><u>First Merciful Indication to al-Farsee to Stop Banging His Head on the Mountain:</u></b> From the middle of page 256, <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> lists the 3rd of the 44 observations to be made on al-Ma'ribee's book, and it is the issue of the ruling on the one who reviles Allaah or the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> pointed out a subtle issue regarding anger (ghadab) that al-Ma'ribee did not pick up on and the Shaykh cited from Shaykh al-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> in that regard in which Shaykh al-Islaam is refuting the one who made  istihlaal (to declare as lawful) a condition in the <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of such a person (as in a person becomes a kaafir only when he makes it lawful to revile Allaah and His Messenger). The Shaykh cited from the book of Shaykh al-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> "<i>al-Saarim al-Maslool</i>" (p. 516) to clarify the issue of "anger", and <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> says (on page 257):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>The shaahid (point of evidence from Ibn Taymiyyah's words) is that he considered the one who claimed his revilement (of Allaah and His Messenger) was because of anger to be a kaafir, even if he believed that this is unlawful, and al-ghaydh is anger, rather  more severe than (anger)...</blockquote>    <P>
Here we see that the matter pertains to revilement of Allaah and His Messenger and some tafseel regarding the issue of anger, and the issue of istihlaal from the speech of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>. Other matters pertaining  to a) <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the <a href='../tags/sahaabah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sahaabah</font></a> as a whole and b) matters of kufr and <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a> are mentioned separately by <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> - see points below.    <P>
<b><u>Second Merciful Indication to al-Farsee to Stop Banging His Head on the Mountain:</u></b> On page 257 <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> mentions the 4th observation, regarding the saying of al-Ma'ribee, "<i>And the people of the innovations that expel from Islaam, then they are not from these sects (i.e. the seventy-two sects)</i>" - in which some ambiguity and confusion may arise, so the Shaykh stated:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>Do not forget that the people of innovation from the Khawaarij, the Mu'tazilah, the Ashaa'irah and the Soofiyyah have with them innovations that expel from Islaam, such as denial of the attributes, the statement of rejecting al-Qadar, the statement of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being created and the various types of actions of <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a> they fall into. <b>However, we do not make <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of them except after the establishment of the proof against them. Hence, this is to be made clear as has been corroborated by the Scholars of Islaam such as <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, Ibn al-Qayyim and before them both, al-Shaafi'i</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
Here the issue is very apparent and clear in that he is speaking about matters which are kufr but which require the establishment of the proof and this includes beliefs of kufr that are held and actions of <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a> that may be committed. The issue of revilement of Allaah and His Messenger and likewise <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the <a href='../tags/sahaabah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sahaabah</font></a> as a whole are separate matters having their own discussion - and <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> was alluding that about those matters, you have to be precise and accurate and correctly convey what the great Imaams  have clarified in those issues (in particular, <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, whom al-Ma'ribee was claiming to reference for those points). As for the other issues, then the Scholars of the Sunnah are agreed that the proof should be established before <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> is made. So, has <a href='../tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a> been honest and truthful in correctly conveying what <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> actually said to al-Ma'ribee? Of course not, he is a scheming liar.    <P>
<b><u>Third Merciful Indication to al-Farsee to Stop Banging His Head on the Mountain:</u></b> At the bottom of page 258 and moving into page 259,  in the 7th observation, <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> cites the statement of al-Ma'ribee, "<i>We do not make <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of a Muslim on account of a major sin he committed which is not kufr</i>", so the Shaykh commented upon this saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>I believe that there is need for this qualification "<i>which is not kufr</i>" because even if it was something that expels from Islam then a person would not disbelieve until after the establishment of the proof. <b>For the one who falls into kufr is not declared a disbeliever immediately, rather it is vital for <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> that the conditions of <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> are fulfilled and the barriers are removed</b>. Hence, here to keep it unqualified (as in to limit oneself in saying, "<i>We do not make <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of a Muslim on account of a major sin</i>") is more befitting and the Salaf also stated this (matter) by keeping it unqualified, and in them there is a model (to be followed).</blockquote>    <P>
Here the Shaykh affirms once more the issue of establishment of the proof contrary to what the confused, ignorant yet oppressive al-Farsee has falsely claimed. By this point in the article it should already start to become clear that someone needs to make tawbah, to apologise and to make amends.    <P>
<b><u>Fourth Merciful Indication to al-Farsee to Stop Banging His Head on the Mountain:</u></b> Also on page 259 in the 8th observation the Shaykh writes:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>... also if you remove this qualification, '<i>And he did not associate partners with Allaah</i>', <b>for a person may fall into a type of <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a> whilst the proof has not been established against him, hence prayer is performed over him - and how numerous are these types (of people)</b>. But whoever fell into <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a>, and you knew that the proof had been established against him, then it is not permissible that you pray over him. In any case, it is safer to keep (the statement) unrestricted...</blockquote>    <P>
This is the greatest of what establishes that <a href='../tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a> is a great liar, deceiver and swindler. He is speaking to a group of ignorant youths who have little knowledge, do not speak or read Arabic for the most part, at least enough to grasp and understand adequately, and who are not in any position to understand these subtle issues. But here we see that <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> is saying the exact opposite of what al-Farsee claimed. Al-Farsee stated that the first position of <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> when he refuted al-Ma'ribee was to deny and reject the necessity of establishment of the proof upon an individual. A great lie as  you can see already. What has happened is that the confused billy-goat, due to either a) ignorance or b) following desires or c) senility, did not distinguish between the issues of <u>making <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of all of the Companions</u> which is where <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> found fault with al-Ma'ribee for not accurately conveying the opinion of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and the other <u>general issues of falling into beliefs and actions of kufr and shirk</u> in which <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> clearly affirms that establishment of the proof is necessary. Even in this above statement <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> affirms that someone who might have fell into <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a> but without the hujjah being established upon him, he is still prayed over. This scenario becomes more clear when you read the clarification of <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> on the issue of establishment of the proof (see the detailed article cited from him at end of this article) and in which he gives a scenario of people who come to Islam, say through Jamaa'at ut-Tabligh or the Soofees, and they are led to believe this is the correct Islaam and they may be introduced to actions which are <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a>. So they die thinking this is the authentic Islam without being told or made aware they are opposing the deen of the Messengers. So in the observation <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> is saying that in light of this type of circumstance, you should not add the qualification '<i>And he did not associate partners with Allaah</i>' because of the issue of establishment of proof. Meaning that even if someone committed <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a>, his expulsion from Islaam would require establishment of the proof, and thus it is better to leave out that qualification so as to be more accurate and precise. Here we see the great insight of <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a>, a mountain of knowledge, whilst al-Farsee the billy-goat is grazing down below, in blissful compound ignorance surrounded by his flock of muqallid followers!    <P>
<b><u>Fifth Merciful Indication to al-Farsee to Stop Banging His Head on the Mountain:</u></b>  We now come to <u>the major issue</u> on the basis of which <a href='../tags/abdullah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah al-Farsee</font></a> - as indicated earlier - either due to <u>ignorance</u>, <u>following desires</u> or <u>senility</u> - lied upon <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> and confused the  matter with something else. In the 13th observation (page 260) <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> makes an important clarification regarding the saying of al-Ma'ribee in his book, "<i>So whoever reviled <a href='../tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> and declare explicitly their disbelief or of most of them, then he is a rejector of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> which declared them honest, upright. Thus, the proof is to be established against him, so either he repents or he disbelieves. And if he reviles them with what necessitate their fisq (being sinful people) then there is dispute about his kufr</i>..." and al-Ma'ribee referenced "al-Sarim al-Maslul" the book of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> as his source for this point. So <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> followed him up with this (middle of page 260):     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>The expression of Shaykh al-Islaam is very clear in making <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of whoever made <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of them (<a href='../tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>) or who declared them all to be sinners (faasiqs) without specifying the establishment of the proof as a condition, wherein he (<a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>) said after the previous speech [of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> quoted by al-Ma'ribee]:    <P>
<blockquote>And as for the one who went beyond that until he claimed that they apostated after the Messenger of Allaah (alayhis salaatu wassalaam) except a very small faction of them that do not reach ten-odd persons, or that the vast majority of them became faasiqs (sinners) then there is no doubt about the disbelief of this one either, because he is a rejector of what the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> has explicitly stated inmore than one place of [Allaah] being pleased with them and praising them. Rather, the one who doubts about the disbelief of the likes of this person, then is disbelief is designated (also), because the essence of this saying is that the transmitters of the Book and the Sunnah are disbelievers or sinners and that this verse which is "<b>You are the best nation brought out for mankind</b>" (3:110), and the best of this (ummah) is the first generation, that the generality of them were disbelievers or sinners, and likewise the essence of this saying is that this ummah is the worst of all nations and that the foremost of this ummah are the worst of them. The disbelief of such a person is from that which is known by necessity from the deen of Islaam...</blockquote>    <P>
[Shaykh Rabee' continues] So Shaykh al-Islaam corroborates that the disbelief of this type (of person) is from what is known by necessity in the religion because he is one who rejects with clear takdheeb (denial, rejection) that which is textually stated in the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in more than one place of [Allaah] being pleased with them and praising them, and [that] whoever doubts about the kufr of such a one, his disbelief too is designated...to the end of it. And this is the same type as the one who rejects a matter known from the religion by necessity such as the obligation of the five prayers, or the obligation of the zakaah or fasting or the hajj or that Muhammad is the Messeennger of Allaah and so on to the rest of the  necessities. Hence it is more befitting that you quote with respect to this important matter this speech of Shaykh al-Islaam, may Allaah grant you success.</blockquote>    <P>
So here <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> corrected al-Ma'ribee in that he did not accurately convey what <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> actually said on the issue despite him referencing the book "<i>al-Saarim al-Maslool</i>" of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and as such he ascribed to <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> that which <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> did not say, rather <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> treated the matter of declaring all <a href='../tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> to be Kuffaar (disbelievers) to be a matter known to be disbelief by necessity in the religion as it is clear takdheeb of the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. Unfortunately, the ignorant <a href='../tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a> has confused the issue or lied deliberately and made it look as if <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> was refuting al-Ma'ribee for affirming the issue of establishment of proof in the matters of <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a> - when this is not the case. Rather <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> said in the very same set of corrections to al-Ma'ribee that establishment of the proof is required for whoever falls into kufr or <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a>. This is the difference between the scholar and the fake pseudo-scholar. <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> has diqqah (precision) and al-Farsee is lost in his mind somewhere in a parallel universe, waiting for his next big flip.    <P>
<b>Summary:</b> It is clear that al-Farsee has falsified and distorted the realities because <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> corrected al-Ma'ribee regarding establishment of the proof in relation to the issue of making <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the generality of <a href='../tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> (radiallaahu anhum) when al-Ma'ribee did not accurately convey the opinion of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> despite referencing <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> as the basis for this particular point. Al-Farsee, due to ignorance, following desires or senility, confused this issue with the more general issue of establishment of proof for falling into kufr and <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a>. <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> is of the view that establishment of the proof is necessary in those matters. We can now get some further clarity from <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> in this matter:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Regarding the Issue of Establishment of the Proof and the Difference of Opinion Therein</font>    <P>
This issue is very clear and many of the Scholars have spoken about it. You may read the explanations of Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin, Shaykh al-Islaam Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhaab and Shaykh <a href='../tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a> (see   <a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?uncnb>here</a>, <a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?wwqny>here</a> and <a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?xwouo>here</a>). <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> (hafidhahullaah) said as occurs in the first volume of his Fataawaa, <i>Fataawaa Fadheelat al-Shaykh Rabee bin Haadee Umayr al-Madkhalee </i>(two volumes, Dar al-Muhsin, 2010) in response to a question about the excuse of ignorance (1/309-312):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>This issue, the issue of the excuse of ignorance [in matters of disbelief] or the absence of the excuse [of ignorance], there are people of tribulation who revolve around it! They desire to separate the Salafees and cause some of them to strike others! I used to be in al-Madinah and (the brother) Riyaadh al-Sa'eed contacted me, and he is known and present in al-Riyaadh now and he said, "<i>There are here in al-Taa'if, fifty youths, all of them make <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of al-Albaanee!!</i>" Why!? Because he does not make <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the grave-worshippers and applies the excuse of ignorance to them!!    <P>
Fine, those people (in reality must) also make <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and Ibn al-Qayyim and many of the Salaf because they grant the excuse of ignorance, and they have evidences, from them,  "<b>And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)</b>" (17:15), and from them, "<b>And whoever contends with the Messenger after the guidance has been made plain to him and chooses a path other than that of the Believers, we shall leave him in the path he has chosen and burn him in the Fire, what an evil refuge?</b>" (4:115) and from them, "<b>And never does Allaah misguide a people after He guides them until He makes clear to them what they should avoid</b>" (9:115).    <P>
And there are other texts which indicate that a Muslim does not disbelieve due to anything of kufr he has fallen into, we say, fallen into kufr, this kufr which he has fallen into due to ignorance for example, then we do not make <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of him until we make the proof clear to him and establish the proof against him. If he then shows stubborn opposition, we make <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of him. This is the saying that a number of the Imaams of the da'wah of Najd are upon, and some of them, their speech may vary, making the establishment of the proof conditional at one time, and another time saying the excuse of ignorance is not given! So some people cling to the sayings of the one who does not give the excuse of ignorance, yet neglects the clear texts about the establishment of the proof being a condition and that <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> is not made of a Muslim who falls into a mukaffir (nullifier) until the proof is established upon him. And from them is what I mentioned from Imaam al-Shaafi'ee (rahimahullaah), and the texts which I mentioned to you.    <P>
I used to know an esteemed Shaykh who did not give the excuse of ignorance, and we used to study in Saamitah, and this Shaykh visited us (there) and he used to carry this notion! However, he would not kindle tribulations and would not dispute or argue or declare astray the one who would give the excuse of ignorance. And we lived as friends for close to forty years! He died recently, may Allaah have mercy upon him. I once sat in one of the gatherings and one (of the people in the gathering) affirmed the absence of the excuse of ignorance. So I mentioned to him these proofs and I mentioned to him that the Scholars of Najd know each other and some of them (affirm) the excuse of ignorance and some of them do not (affirm the) excuse, yet they are bonded (as brothers), there are no differences, nor arguments, nor matters stirred (between them) and nor (this) and nor (that)... So he remained quiet and did not argue because he did not want tribulation. So we know that this difference (of opinion) is found in Najd between some of the Mashaayikh and other than them, however, there is no dispute and no declaring astray and no war or tribulation (between them).     <P>
But this is the way of the Haddaadiyyah O brothers! The conniving, misguided Haddaadi faction has been devised in order to kindle tribulation between Ahl al-Sunnah and for them to strike one another! <b>And they are (in reality) concealed <a href='../tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a>, and they have other calamities possibly besides takfir</b>. They use the vilest form of deception (taqiyyah) as a veil for their vile methodology and their corrupt goals! I saw a youth affected by this methodology and he would carry a book in which there were selected sayings about the absence of the excuse of ignorance, and he would travel between al-Riyaadh, al-Taa'if, Makkah and al-Madinah and so on. He would be with us and study with us, then we but perceived that he was carrying this idea in this manner. So I debated him a number of times and I explained to him the methodology of Shaykh al-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and the methodology of the Salaf and the evidences, yet he would argue. I said to him, "Who is your Imaam (in this matter)?" He would say, "So and so and so and so." I researched and I found - by Allaah - that they (those cited) had conflicting statements, excusing due to ignorance at one time and not excusing due to ignorance at another. He said to me, "So and so is with me (on this matter)," I said to him, "This is the speech of so and so - I have got it ready for you - this so and so, he excuses due to ignorance and makes the establishment of the proof to be a condition." He said, "No, I am with Ibn al-Qayyim." I said to him, "But from time, you rejected Ibn al-Qayyim! Ibn al-Qayyim specifies the establishment of the proof as a condition," and so he was confounded, but he persisted upon his misguidance. He stubbornly rejected and he (happened to be) expelled from the country and later returned. And in my debate with him I said to him, "A disbelieving people in a peninsula somewhere, in Britain or the Pacific Ocean or other than it, none of the Salafees have come to them, but Jamaa'at al-Tabligh come to them and teach them and they (the Tablighis) say that this is Islaam, and within (this Islaam they teach) are deviations, innovations and affairs of <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a>, and within it are misguidances and within it is such and such... and they say to them, 'This is Islaam.' So they accept it (as such), and seek nearness to Allaah (through that) and they worship Allaah upon this religion which has been called Islaam, do you declare them to be disbelievers, or do you clarify for them and establish the proof against them?" He said, "They are disbelievers and establishing the proof is not a condition!" I said to him, "Go to <a href='../tags/algeria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Algeria</font></a> for you are more severe than those revolutionaries now, you are more severe in <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> than them, go to them for there is no place for you in this country."    <P>
<b>The madhhab of Shaykh al-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and Ibn al-Qayyim regarding this is established upon proofs and evidences, and it is the madhhab of the Salaf - if Allaah wills - and whoever founded (his madhhab) and was satisfied with other than this and remained silent, we have no concern with him, however, that he goes and kindles tribulations and declares (others) as astray and declares (others) as disbelievers, then no, no by Allaah, silence should not be held regarding him.</b>    <P>
I advise the youth that they leave this matter because it is a way from among the ways of the people of evil and tribulation which they spread amongst the Muslims. Fine, eras have passed over you from the time of the Imaam Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhaab to this day of ours, there were not any battles between them on this matter at all. The one who made ijtihaad and held this view he kept silent and went on his way, he affirmed it in his book and spread it, that's it, and he went on his way. And the one who opposed him, he went on his way, all of them are brothers, there are not any differences (in the hearts) between them, and nor disputations and nor did anyone declare another to be misguided or to be a disbeliever. As for these, then they declare (others) to be disbelievers (on this issue)! Look at this - through this they reached the level of making <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the leading scholars of Islaam, which indicates the vileness of their orientations and the evil of their goals. So I advise the Salafi youth that they should not delve into this matter.     <P>
As for <b>the strongest madhhab</b> (in this matter): It is requiring establishment of the proof to be a condition (prior to <i>takfir bil-ayn</i>), and when it does not appear to be stronger to him, then upon him is to remain silent and to respect his other brothers. He should not declare them astray, because they have the truth, and with them is the Book of Allaah, and with them is the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and with them is the methodology of the Salaf. And the one who wishes to make <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, he (ought to) make <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Salaf! And make <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and Ibn Abd al-Wahhaab as well! The Imaam Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhaab said, "We do not make <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of those who make tawaaf around the graves and who worship them until we establish the proof against them, because they have not found one who would clarify (the matter) for them."</blockquote>    <P>
From this you have probably become wise as to what al-Farsee has done. Because <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> clarified this issue of establishment of the proof and addressed the difference of opinion regarding it (as have other scholars such as Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin) al-Farsee accused <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> of "playing around!" Now, every time a scholar speaks about the difference of opinion in a matter (and clearly outlines his own position) is it fair to say to he "playing around" just because he discussed the actual issue of difference? What a great deceiver and liar al-Farsee is. To see this more clearly, please go and read the following two articles:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>Takfir and the Excuse of Ignorance: </b>Shaykh Abd al-Muhsin al-Abbaad - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?uncnb>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Takfir and the Excuse of Ignorance:</b> Shaykh <a href='../tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a> - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?xwouo>see here</a>)  </ul>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Closing Remarks</font>    <P>
<blockquote>Abdullah al-Farsee, an ignorant, flippant and mentally unstable man, has committed a great slander and fabrication against <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a>. His ignorant muqallidaah recorded it. They put this recording on Youtube. Before all of that, the Angels recorded it. And it will come out in the scrolls of <a href='../tags/abdullah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah al-Farsee</font></a> on Yawm al-Qiyaamah. Through this article we have come to learn the precision and accuracy of <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> in knowledge-based matters and that <a href='../tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a>, a fake pseudo-scholar is in cloud-cuckoo land somewhere in another universe. He confused <u>between</u> the issue that making <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of all of <a href='../tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> (radiallaahu anhum) is disbelief that is known by necessity in the view of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (rahimahullaah) - and <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> was simply asking al-Ma'ribee to do justice and accurately convey what <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said - and <u>between</u> the more general issue of establishing the proof when a person falls into kufr or <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a> - which is what Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is upon too. So when <a href='../tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a> is attacking <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> in this five minute clip, in reality, he is attacking Shaykh al-Islaam <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>, because <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> was simply clarifying the positions of <a href='../tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and advising al-Ma'ribee in that regard.     <P>
As for the difference of opinion on the issue of establishment of the proof in matters of <a href='../tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a> then as the scholars affirm and establish, from them Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin and Shaykh <a href='../tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a>, that there is a difference of opinion, even amongst the Scholars of Najd. So how can <a href='../tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a> use the fact that <a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> pointed out this matter in the context of warning against trouble-making <a href='../tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> and Haddadis who raise this issue to cause confusion amongst Ahl al-Sunnah as a means to claim he (<a href='../tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a>) is playing around in the issue of "<a href="../tags/tawhid.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Tawhid</font></a>"?! This man is a fool and has clearly lost his marbles.  </blockquote> <P>
