We see the emergence of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> nowadays (see <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?jqpkg //>here</a>, <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?hulwt >here</a>, <a href=index49f2.html?xwcmm >here</a>, <a href=index7e0b.html?sxptl >here</a> and <a href=index0ec1.html?blaok >here</a> for proof that the Scholars recognize them and label them as a faction with this <u>name</u> and <u>methodology</u>), they are rushing towards the blogs and forums, in order to make defenses, apologetical writings, and expressing sentiments towards their figureheads who are Jahmite <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a>, together with what they expressed of  the bid'ahs of the <u><a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a></u>, the bid'ahs of the <u>Khawaarij</u>, the bid'ahs of the <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Mu'tazilah</u>, <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Jabariyyah</u>, <u>Mutasawwifah</u> and statements of expression of the bid'ahs of the Ittihaadiyyah, let alone other outright statements of kufr. These people have come out not for the sake of defending the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> or because of jealousy towards <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> of Allaah's Messenger (alayhis salaam) <u>but only because</u> it grieves them that sincerity of purpose is given to the Ummah in warning against the misguidance and deviations found in the <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i> (ideology) of the 20th century ignoramuses whom they have taken as their symbolic figureheads (rumooz).     <P>
In this series of articles we will document and highlight, in no particular order, what they have testified upon themselves, <b>through their own actions and activities</b>, of the following of desires and aiding and supporting falsehood, upon knowledge and intent. <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>A Few Notes on the Current Activities of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> Ikhwaaniyyah</font>    <P>
We see the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> coming out today in the blogs and forums with a fake display of jealousy for <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> of Allaah's Messenger (alayhis salaam) and jealousy for the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> - and <u>it burned them</u> that they were described as such - but deep inside their own souls, they know that what they doing nowadays of claiming to defend Mu'aawiyah (radiallaahu anhu) <u>is not genuine</u> and it is not characterized by sincerity, and you might ask, how can you make such a judgment, and how can you make such a claim? The answer is that our deen is not the deen of the <a href='tags/murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Murji'ah</font></a> where we expel the actions of the heart from eemaan, <u>such that</u> we consider it plausible, admissible, acceptable and logical that:    <P>
<blockquote><font style='font-size:19px;line-height:26px;'>Zayd knows full well for 10-15 years that <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> accused Mu'aawiyah of <u>ghish, khadee'ah, and nifaaq (deception, treachery, hypocrisy)</u>, and that he made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/abu-sufyan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Sufyan</font></a> and the whole of Bani Umayyah, and described Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu) as a feeble, senile incapable old man, a plaything for those around him (to abuse and use) and one who used to dip his hand into the bayt ul-maal for the benefit of his family, <u>and knowing all of this and what is much more than this</u>, Zayd launched the severest of wars against <u>the very Shaykh</u> who was not the first one to bring Qutb's poison of the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a> to light, but he assaults, attacks, reviles, slanders, backbites and scorns this Shaykh, in private and in public, in writing and in speech, spending from his wealth to do so <u>only because</u> this Shaykh wrote books in the early 1990s in defence of Uthmaan, <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> and others and in defence of the Prophetic Methodology in calling to Allaah, [and showing enmity to the Shaykh] <u>out of anger for the sake of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and out of resentment that Qutb's status was diminished</u> - proving <u>that it angered him more</u> that <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> refuted <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> than it angered him that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> reviled Mu'aawiyyah and Bani Umayyah and Uthmaan and others - and then after all those years, continuing upon this way, upon this anger and resentment (not for the sake of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> but for the sake of Sayyid Qutb), Zayd now comes along and starts displaying (fake) jealousy for Mu'aawiyah, claiming to be hurt by criticism against Mu'aawiyah (with crocodile tears), whilst at the same time <u>continuing</u> to attack, scorn and warn people from that Scholar (<a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a>) who wrote a whole book "<i>The Revilements of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> upon the Sahaabah</i>" in which the honors of <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> and the other Companions were exonerated. And alongside all of this he claims "<i>I love <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, I'm defending Mu'awiyah</i>". </font></blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Deen of the Ghullaat al-<a href="tags/murjiah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Murji'ah</font></a></font>    <P>
And this is the deen of the <u>Ghullaat ul-Murji'ah</u> who expelled <u>the actions of the heart</u> from eemaan. You see, as <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> pointed out, there is no such thing as just "<i>pure knowledge</i>", rather all knowledge is such that it <u>implies and necessitates</u> the actions of the heart (unless there are barriers present like arrogance and hatred which prevent the expression of those actions necessitated by the knowledge). This is unlike what the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the Ghullaat al-Murji'ah presumed that mere knowledge in the heart can exist without necessitating the actions of the heart, and through which obligatory or perfect eemaan can be attained.     <P>
<u>And thus</u> when the Sharee'ah knowledge reaches you of the status of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>, it necessitates the actions of the heart of loving them, defending them, honoring them and so on. Now, when you are angry and resentful that the Rafidee poison of a 20th century ignoramus is refuted and that his accusation against Mu'aawiyyah of <i>ghish, khadee'ah</i> and <i>nifaaq</i> (deception, treachery and hypocrisy) is exposed, as well as his negation of Islam from <a href='tags/abu-sufyan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Sufyan</font></a> and Bani Umayyah as a whole (but it did not make you shake, shudder and scream in disgust <u>that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> actually said that</u> and <u>persisted upon that</u> after the hujjah was established) and further, that you revile, assault, attack defame and take every opportunity to belittle that very Shaykh who defended the honour of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> and refuted <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, alongside your knowledge that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> was refuted forty years ago in his lifetime by <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a>, and never recanted but persisted upon that until his death - and then at the same time you claim  you love Mu'aawiyah and <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> and claim that you have brought al-eemaan al-waajib with respect to this matter - then you are <b>the greatest of liars</b>, and you are extreme in your <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a>, the <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a> of the Ghullaat, Ghullaat ul-Murji'ah who claim the attainment of obligatory eemaan in the absence of the actions of the heart. And you are a shyster and insincere follower of desires, who is motivated not by jealousy for the Companion Mu'aawiyah, <b>but for jealousy and anger for the sake of Sayyid Qutb</b>, and it is nothing but jealousy for <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and hatred for that Scholar that is behind all your current activites. And all praise is due to Allah who exposed you in broad daylight through your own actions!    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>An Illustration</font>    <P>
Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in Kitaab ul-Imaan (7/187-188):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And it is from here that the error of the saying of Jahm Ibn Safwaan and whoever followed him becomes apparent, in that they thought that <a href='tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a> is merely the <i>tasdeeq</i> (assent) of the heart and its <i>ilm</i> (knowledge), and they did not make the actions of the heart to be from <a href='tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a>, and they thought that a person can be a believer, perfect in his <a href='tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a> (kaamil ul-Imaan) with his heart, and then alongside this he can revile Allaah and His Messenger, show enmity to Allaah and His Messenger, and show enmity to the Awliyaa of Allaah, and then he show loyalty to the enemies of Allaah, kill the Prophets, destroy the mosques, show disrespect to the Masaahif (pl. of mus.haf, i.e. qur'aan), honour the Kuffaar with great kindness, and disdain the believers with the greatest of disdainment. So they say that all of this is disobedience that does not negate the <a href='tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a> that is in his heart</blockquote>    <P>
Whilst noting here that Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is demonstrating the repugnance of the Ghullaat al-Murji'ah through giving examples which are major kufr to illustrate how they divorced the actions of the heart from its speech, and thus, in turn, from the outward actions - the general principle (<b>of the talaazum between the speech and action of the heart, and between the heart and the outward actions</b>) nevertheless, <u>still applies</u>, and so we are going to illustrate here what these people are upon today of expelling the actions of the heart from eemaan, so here goes:    <P>
<blockquote><font style='font-size:19px;line-height:26px;'>Hey, we have <i>ilm</i> and <i>ma'rifah</i> in our hearts regarding the status of Mu'aawiyah, and we acknowledge that he was the trusted scribe of the Messenger (alayhis salaam) who wrote down the revelation, (and what a lofty and honourable position of trust that is), and we know that the Messenger supplicated for him asking Allaah  (<span class='arb'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;&#1605; &#1575;&#1580;&#1593;&#1604;&#1607; &#1607;&#1575;&#1583;&#1610;&#1575;&#1611; &#1605;&#1607;&#1583;&#1610;&#1575;&#1611;</span>) "<i>O Allaah, make him a guide, guiding others, and guided himself</i>", and also we acknowledge that Mu'aawiyah is the Uncle of the Believers and we also have <i>ilm</i> and <i>ma'rifah</i> in our hearts regarding the status of Amr bin al-Aas, that the Messenger (alayhis salaam) said about the two sons of al-Aas (<span class='arb'>&#1575;&#1576;&#1606;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1575;&#1589; &#1605;&#1572;&#1605;&#1606;&#1575;&#1606;</span>), "<i>The two sons of al-Aas are believers</i>", and we also acknowledge that the Messenger also said (<span class='arb'>&#1571;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1575;&#1587; &#1608;&#1570;&#1605;&#1606; &#1593;&#1605;&#1585;&#1608; &#1576;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1575;&#1589;</span>), "<i>The most submissive (in Islam) and believing of people is Amr bin al-Aas</i>", and we also have <i>ilm</i> and <i>ma'rifah</i> in our hearts that the Messenger said (<span class='arb'>&#1593;&#1605;&#1585;&#1608; &#1576;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1575;&#1589; &#1605;&#1606; &#1589;&#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1610; &#1602;&#1585;&#1610;&#1588;</span>), "<i>Amr bin al-Aas is from the righteous of the Quraish</i>".     <P>
Alongside all of this <i>ilm </i>and <i>ma'rifah</i> and <i>tasdeeq</i> (assent) in our hearts, we are enraged, angry and furious that a Scholar amongst the Scholars, <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee-bin-haadee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee bin Haadee</font></a> al-Madkhali, has dared to point out what <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> fell into of reviling Mu'aawiyah and Amr bin al-Aas, accusing them both of lying (<i>kadhib</i>), deception (<i>ghish</i>), treachery or trickery (<i>khadee'ah</i>), hypocrisy (<i>nifaaq</i>), and taking bribes (<i>rishwah</i>) - <a href=index2099.html?pidmx>see this article</a>, and of what he said about Uthmaan (radiallahu anhu) that he was a feeble, senile old man, who got taken advantage of in his old age, was not fit for the rule, and would often dip his hands into the Bayt ul-Maal for the expediency of his family, and that those who revolted him were driven by the spirit of Islam of "eschewing evil". And it enrages us that this Shaykh wrote almost 200 pages as an encyclopedia of Sayyid Qutb's revilement upon those promised Paradise, "<i>Mataa'in <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> Fis-Sahaabah</i>". So we are going to set up in our hearts for this man a good share of enmity, rank hatred and scorn. But we won't stop there. We will then start ringing up other Scholars to try and cast aspersions about him so that the position of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> does not diminish in the eyes of the people. We are going to spend from our wealth in this regard, and we will work with all the guile, deception and trickery in trying to bring this man down. We will generate an atmosphere of animosity and hate that will lead the ignorant to make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of this man who dared to speak about our pole and axis, and which will lead the people to accuse him of being a stooge and pawn and a hypocrite who praises the leaders. We will write on blogs, on forums, we will make propaganda for <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> to try and defend him to the utmost, and alongside all of this "<i>We love you Mu'aawiyah and we love you Amr bin al-Aas</i>".     <P>
Then we are going to spend from our wealth and be willing to pay the search engines in order to avert and divert the people away from the website where the honor of <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> was being defended <u>in truth and in all sincerity of purpose to Islaam and the Muslims</u>, and instead to our own fake (display) of love for <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, <u>the true and real intent</u> of which is to purely scorn and vilify that same Shaykh and to defend <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, and so the companion <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> is really just a means to an end for us, and alongside all of this, "<i>We love you Mu'aawiyah and we love you Amr bin al-Aas</i>". And we will continue upon this, dedicated to this, for years and for years, venting our anger, frustration and scorn towards that Shaykh whilst allying with <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>.     <P>
Thereafter, when it even becomes clear to us Shaykh al-Abani praised this Scholar for exposing Qutb's ignorance and deviation from the foundations and branches of Islaam (<a href=indexa0fc.html?iosjk>see here</a>), and when it becomes clear to us that <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> defended this Scholar with a defence that constituted a smiting of our lips (<a href=indexb09a.html?epluy>see here</a>), and when it became clear that <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> preceded this Scholar by forty years in refuting <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> for the very same (see <a href=index2199.html?mslqe>here</a> and <a href=index0657.html?qodiy>here</a>) - then alongside the <i>ilm</i>, <i>ma'rifah</i> and <i>tasdeeq</i> of all of this, <u>we are only going to increase in our enmity, hatred and opposition to this Scholar</u>, and step up our efforts, all for the sake of that 20th century ignoramus non-Scholar in whose books there is nothing, after we take out the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the <u><a href='tags/rafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rafidah</font></a></u>, except the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Mu'tazilah</u>, <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Jabariyyah</u>, expressions of the <u>Ittihaadiyyah</u> and what is worse than the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the Khawaarij. So we are going to continue our allegiance for this man, and we are going to start appearing on the blogs and forums, with the aim of spreading shubuhaat and work stratagems and plots all aimed at fooling the naive and gullible and aimed at defending <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, drawing people towards his books as opposed to away from them, through the utility we find in some isolated, qualified sayings of some of the Scholars. And alongside all of these efforts to defend <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and to scorn that Shaykh, "<i>We love you Mu'aawiyah and we love you Amr bin al-Aas</i>".    <P>
<u>Then we are not going to stop there</u>, we are going to trawl through all of the sayings and writings of that one Scholar, to see if we can find any hint of speaking ill of any of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>, not because we care about <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>, but because we want to defend our pole and axis, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and if and when we find anything, we are going to publish it, distribute, it and expend the greatest of efforts in letting the entire world know - in manner that <u>we never did</u> and <u>we never will do</u> for the refutations of Shaykh <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> and <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> upon <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> for his evil slanders and revilements upon <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, Amr bin al-Aas and Bani Umayyah - and all of this for the sake of defending <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> (because it really grieves us that people should flee from his books - <a href=index9c1e.html?romka>see here</a>).     <P>
After all of this  "<i>We love you Mu'aawiyah and we love you Amr bin al-Aas</i>", and we have indeed brought the obligatory eemaan (al-eemaan al-wajib) as it relates to these Companions of Allaah's Messenger (alayhis salaam).</font></blockquote>    <P>
This is the reality of these people, be not in doubt, this is what they themselves are saying through their actions, all we have done is to put their actions into writing!     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Convicted By Their Own Actions</font>    <P>
Further, this action (fake display of love and defense of Mu'aawiyah) from these individuals actually proves two things.     <P>
<blockquote><u>Firstly</u>, that <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> was right, and he was preceded in this by Shaykh <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> by more than forty years. So the mere fact that you are faking jealousy for Mu'aawiyah now, is an admission through your action that Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> (<a href=index2099.html?pidmx>see here</a>), and Shaykh <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> (<a href=index0657.html?qodiy>see here</a>) and <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> and others were all correct.     <P>
<u>And secondly</u>, following on from the first point, that these individuals are insincere. They are not doing this out of sincerity and out of love of Mu'aawiyah and concern for the honour of Mu'aawiyah, but it is out of venting anger, frustration <u>and seeking revenge for the sake of Sayyid Qutb</u> and <b>NOT</b> for the sake of the honour of Mu'aawiyah (radiallaahu anhu). What is the proof?

So this makes a lot of things clear. The truth is clear and the actions of these people are clear.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>When you understand what <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> has said, and also what Shaykh Muqbil has said (<a href=index9c1e.html?romka>see here</a>) and also what Shaykh al-Albaani said about those who criticise <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a>, then you will be upon baseerah as to why these shysters have decided, after 10-15 years to come out of the woodwork, start appearing on the blogs and forums and started to display jealousy for <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> and for the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>. And what passes judgement upon them and seals their fate is not what we are merely claiming about them, <u>but it is their own actions themselves</u> that expose them and expose their hypocrisy (in action) and their fake jealousy for <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>. For if they were genuine in their jealousy for <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>, you would never have seen this behavior from these people at all. Rather, they would have taken a correct Sunni, Salafi, Shar'iyy stance in this matter upon the evidence they find in the speech of Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baaz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baaz</font></a>, <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a>, <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> and countless others. </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Intellectual Dishonesty</font>    <P>
Further, when you start using statements of the Muftee, Shaykh Abdul-Aziz Aal ash-Shaykh, in order to attack <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> then there is some psychology behind this, and there is a thought process behind this. And so it becomes clear that you have accepted that the saying of Shaykh is good enough for you to try and tarnish another Shaykh - that much is clear just by the fact that you are using the Muftee's statements. Now this shows that you are prepared to attack <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> and defend <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> through the mere use of a Scholar's statements, devoid of investigating the underlying evidences on issues of usool. Further, considering <u>the fact</u> that what you are bringing of these shubuhaat actually <u>pale into insignificance</u> compared to <u>the multitude</u> of the <u>very specific praises and defenses</u> of the Imaams and Shaykhs of the Religion of our times for <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a>, which are very specific and relate to the corroboration of very specific criticisms and refutations by <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> upon <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, such as in his <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the <a href='tags/rafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rafidah</font></a> and his <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the <a href='tags/khawarij.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Khawarij</font></a>, <u>which are major innovations for which <i><a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a></i> or <i>ijtihaad</i> is not an excuse by Ijmaa' of Ahl us-Sunnah</u>, then given the fact that you are already aware of this and have been aware of this for many long years and despite that, you have seen fit to use these general  statements from the Muftee, <u>without affording the same value</u> to all those multiples of other statements of the other Scholars that relate to <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a>, then all this <u>only proves you are fake</u>. <b>You are a shyster</b>. You are <u>insincere</u> in what you are doing. You are not doing this out of jealousy for <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> or jealousy for the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>. Because if you were, you would have been the first to recognize the truth of what <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> criticized <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> for, this would have been a proof that the knowledge in your heart has produced the necessary actions of the heart that would have translated into outward actions of acceptance, love and praise for what <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> did in defending Mu'aawiyah, Amr bin al-Aas and the Bani Umayyah and Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhum). So our deen is not the deen of the Ghullaat al-Murjiah, who expel the actions of the heart from eemaan.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Stretching the Rope And Giving Them A Little More Does Not Even Benefit These People</font>    <P>
Now lets go further, <b>even if we push everything else aside</b> - lets throw out <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a>, and lets throw out Qutb's bid'ah of the negation of "<i>hawaadith</i>" following the way and style of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, and all the Jahmee, <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, Mu'tazili doctrines found in az-Zilaal, and let's restrict ourselves <u>to only two things</u>, Qutb's <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of <u>the Rafidah</u> and his <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of <u>the Khawaarij</u>, and he died upon these things, then that would be enough for you <b>to consider him an Innovator, who died an Innovator</b>, for he never recanted from his Rafd and nor from his Khaarijiyyah which was worse and more severe than that of the very first Kharijite "<i>Dogs of Hellfire</i>", and upon whom, <u>therefore</u>, all of the usool of Ahl us-Sunnah apply as it relates to the Innovators and their books. So the fact that these people are willing to swim the oceans, conquer the mountains, enter into the deep and dark recesses of the earth, and venture out in sub-zero temperatures all for the sake of a 20th century ignoramus innovator, <u>is sufficient to pass judgment upon them with following of desires</u> - even if they try to deceive the people with the statement of this Shaykh and that Shaykh, drawing upon mere shubuhaat to defend a man in whose books there is nothing left of value (after taking out the greatest of misguidances found therein) except some cultural, literary excellence, and the skillful use of language.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So this proves, <u>without any shadow of doubt</u>, that your activities are fake, you actions are <u>not sincere</u>, they are only to take revenge against <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> <u><b>because</b></u> he spoke and wrote about your rumooz (symbolic figureheads), <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a>. Don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise, and Allaah will reckon you. If you have any intelligence you will realize this is actually sincere advice for you.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>It's All Fake ...</font>    <P>
We never saw you displaying jealousy for Mu'aawiyah by setting up Google Ads to defend the honour of Mu'aawiyah, rather you only spent from your wealth to defend those figureheads who displayed actual hatred in their hearts towards Mu'aawiyah and the Bani Umayyah (see <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> <a href=index0657.html?qodiy>break it down here</a>), [those figureheads] who persisted upon this hatred, accusing Mu'aawiyah of deception, hypocrisy and treachery. <b>So you spend from your wealth to divert and avert the people away from websites and articles (i.e. this one) that do nothing but defend the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> from these excesses and which contain nothing but statements from the Imaams and Scholars of the religion</b>. And you are doing all of this <u>not for Mu'aawiyah or for the Islamic aqidah</u>, but it is to express your rage, revenge, anger, resentment and hatred for a particular Scholar. <b>Vain deeds, vain deeds, vain deeds</b>. And putting all of our differences aside, if you actually have any intelligence coupled with even the slightest speck of the fear of Allaah, you will know deep inside your soul that this could not have been a more accurate characterization of you, meaning what has been said by <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexb09a.html?epluy>see here</a>), and what we have explained above in this aticle (and further below) on the basis of what <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> and others have said.    <P>
So all of this helps us to understand the true nature of the activities of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> who have come out of the woodwork and are now showing up on the blogs and forums. They only showed up because through this website, the "<i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>" (ideology) - <a href=indexf862.html?umiea>see excellent article here</a> by Shaykh Saalih Aal ash-Shaykh, and the Rafidi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and the Kharijite <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> is being exposed, alongside the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Ittihaadiyyah, Jabariyyah and others whose expressions are found in the works of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>. This is why these people have come out of the woodwork now, <b>only to defend <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and to create shubuhaat and to spread shubuhaat about Shaykh Rabee'</b>. That is their sole motivating factor, <u>be not in any doubt about it</u>, and they themselves know it deep in their souls. It is not because they are jealous for Mu'aawiyah (radiallahu anhu) and jealous for the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>. So we say once again, our deen is not the deen of the <a href='tags/murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Murji'ah</font></a> who expel actions of the heart from eemaan, and it is  your own actions and activities that have passed judgment upon you, and have rendered you liars. walilllaahil-hamd. <P>
