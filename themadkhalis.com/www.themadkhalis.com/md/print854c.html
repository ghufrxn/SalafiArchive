<img src=assets/images/baraa-ah-cover.gif border=1 align=right border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah Min Tazkiyah Ahl il-Bid'ah wal-Mudhammah</font>    <P>
To the right is the cover for the second edition of "<i>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah Min Tazkiyah Ahl il-Bid'ah wal-Mudhammah</i>" (The Innocence of the Scholars of the Ummah from the Commendation of the People of Innovation and Censure). This book was prepared by Isaam bin Abdullaah as-Sinaanee. It contains a refutation of the one who used the intercession of Shaykh Bin Baaz (rahimahullaah) for <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> as a proof for the 'adaalah (integrity) of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and commendation of his (Qutb's) manhaj, when it is not a proof at all.    <P>
The book, after compilation and authorship was sent to <b>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</b> who checked over it and made recommendations, and also suggested an improvement to the title of the book. Then it was read by <b>Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen</b> (rahimahullaah), who made his own written notes on the pre-print copy that was sent to him, and he also advised that the section titled "The Salafi Manhaj", <u>should be placed before</u> "The Qutubi Manhaj" and not after it, unless the author had a specific reason for doing that. And images of these hand-written notes are included at the end of the book. We will be quoting from this book inshaa'Allaah in this series. <b>Both of these scholars endorsed the contents of this book and the purpose for which it was to be published and distributed</b>. <u>And the purpose is clearly outlined in the title of the book itself</u>. Namely, to declare the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah free and innocent (in particular Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baaz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baaz</font></a>, and the other scholars in general) of having made tazkiyah (i.e. given adaalah) to those who are from the people of innovation: In this case <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, who aside from writing his commentary on the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> upon an <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> creed, added other great calamities, some of which are serious enough that they cannot really be excused by mere ignorance, such as accusing the Scribe of the Prophet (alayhis salaam) the Uncle of the Believers, <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> - whose integrity is attested to by the Prophet himself -  of treachery, deception and hypocrisy.     <P>
<b>And this book essentially <u>sunk their ship</u>, leaving them only <u>the flotsam</u> to hold onto thereafter, which is what they have been doing since then.</b>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> Whilst many of the biased-partisans use the word "<i><a href='tags/madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhali</font></a></i>" as a derogatory phrase to attack one particular Scholar, everyone should realize that <u>this is simply a cover and a veil</u>. Their hatred and resentment goes way beyond just one particular scholar and <u>it is towards the Scholars of the Sunnah in general</u> for the the fact that the majority of them eventually spoke about <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> specifically and the methodologies of al-Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen in general, after the truth became clear to them. The word "<i><a href='tags/madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhali</font></a></i>" is used in a derogatory way that simply represents this hatred, resentment and jealousy. These people don't have a group of scholars that <u>represent</u> the manhaj they are upon. <i>They have isolated statements here and there from some Scholars in isolated issues by which they cause confusion</i>, but certainly they cannot point to a group of known major scholars and say, "<i>Their manhaj in da'wah is the same as our manhaj in da'wah</i>". <b>By the way, Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> who erred in defending <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> against those who refuted him has statements that contain refutations of these people. Be sure about that! Go and read <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?eoizx >this article</a> and <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?srjss >this article</a></b>. So they have no Scholars guiding and leading them in their manhaj. And for this reason, they have to attack the truth with false labels in order to cut off the people from recognizing the overall broad methodologies that all of those scholars are united upon and which differ from the methodologies of the secular atheist Jews and Christians that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and Bannaa innovated into the religion.</div> <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Abdul-Azeez Bin Baz on <a href='tags/mockery.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mockery</font></a> of Prophet <a href='tags/moses.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Moses</font></a> and the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of the <a href="tags/jahmiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Jahmiyyah</font></a></font>    <P>
As well as in the book above, it is also recorded. You can download the <a href=assets/audio/bin-baaz-sayyid-qutb-companions-moses.ram>audio recording here</a>, it is in the second half.    <P>
Shaykh Abdul-Aziz bin Baz (rahimahullaah), when asked about the speech of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> concerning the saying of Allah - the Most High - "<b>ar-Rahmanu 'alal Arsh istawa</b>", <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> said in <i><a href='tags/az-zilal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>az-<a href="tags/zilal.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Zilal</font></a></font></a></i> (4/2328 & 6/3408 - 12th edition, 1406H, Daar ul-'Ilm):    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> upon the Throne, then we are able to say: It is a metaphor for His mastery over the creation.</blockquote>     <P>
So the Shaikh replied:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This is all a futile saying - that this means His mastery. He has not affirmed 'al-Istiwaa. - which means a denial of Istiwaa,  which is known and means His ascension upon the throne. [What he has said] is futile and shows that he is destitute with regard to tafseer and lost in that regard.</blockquote>    <P>
Then one of those present mentioned that some people always advise that this book should be read, so he said:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>That which he says is an error. No! An error. That which he says is an error. We will soon write in that regard - if Allah wills.</blockquote>    <P>
Then in the same lesson some parts of the book of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>,  <i>at-Tasweer al-Fannee fil-Qur'aan</i> were read to him such as his speech about <a href='tags/moosaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Moosaa</font></a> -(alayhis salaam) upon whom he said:     <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Let us take <a href='tags/moosaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Moosaa</font></a> - as the example of the leader of excitable nature - and this excitable impulse quickly passes away and he regains his composure, as is the case with the excitable folk.</blockquote>    <P>
Then he said with regard to the Saying of Allah - the Most High - "<b>He remained in the city fearful</b>...(28:18), in <i>at-Tasweer al-Fannee fil-Qur'aan</i>: p.200, 201, 203. 13th edition)    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This is the description of a well known state: the restlessness or fear of one expecting evil at every turn - and this is the characteristic of the excitable folk.</blockquote>    <P>
So the Shaikh replied to this:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Mockery of the Prophets is apostasy in its own.</blockquote>    <P>
And is was said to him that Shaikh Rabee' al-Madhkhalee has written a refutation of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, so the Shaikh said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Rebuttal of him is good.</blockquote>    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Whoever reviled the Prophets is to be killed for violating the sanctity of the one who sent them, and his belittling of his right, and that is kufr. Al-Qusayree said,     <P>
<blockquote>Harming the Prophets with revilement or other than it such as criticising anything from them is kufr, until even the one who said regarding the Prophet 'His thawb is dirty', desiring by that to find fault with him, is to be killed for kufr, not as a <a href='tags/hadd.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hadd</font></a> punishment. And his repentance is not accepted in the view of a group of the Scholars, but the Shaafi'iyyah accepted it (the tawbah).</blockquote>  </blockquote>    <P>
Whether <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> wrote these things in his early days or not, the prohibition of revilement and <a href='tags/mockery.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mockery</font></a> of the Prophets is known by necessity in the religion, and it is for this reason you see the above types of viewpoints amongst the Fuquhaa. However, the problem is not with <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, for he has passed away, and his affair is between him and His Lord, and we ask Allaah to show mercy upon him for what he fell into, but it is the Ghullaat who are the problem who describe him as "an Imaam of Guidance" and who propagandize for his methodology which is nothing but what he acquired from Leninist <a href='tags/marxism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Marxism</font></a>, and their defence of him is for no other reason except that that they wish to nurture the people upon his revolutionary ideologies. <P>
