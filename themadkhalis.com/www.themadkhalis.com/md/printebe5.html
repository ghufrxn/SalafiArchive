Following the <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Extremism</font></a> of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, the likes of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq and others innovated a new category for Tawheed, called "<i>Tawheed al-Haakimiyyah</i>", and this was simply a stratagem through which the doctrines of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> could be made palatable to a Salafi audience. When they started to propagandize for Sayyid Qutb's exaggerated doctrine of "al-Haakimiyyah", Ahl us-Sunnah took the issue to the Major Scholars. The verdicts of the Scholars started to appear from around 1996-1997, and prior to this time, many speakers in the West were propagandizing for this "fourth" category of Tawheed and explicitly stating it to be an independent fourth category of Tawheed. Ali al-Timimi was one of the movers and shakers in this regard and in 1996, he said in his theatrical performance:    <P>

<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Now somebody might ask, <b>of the four types of Tawhid</b> that they mentioned, <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> ur-Ruboobiyyah, <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> ul-Ibaadah, <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> ul-Asmaa' was-Sifaat and <a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a>, why did they pay so much attention to <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> ul-Haakimiyyah. What's the secret behind this. The secret behind this is because those who have falsely attributed these ideas to Salafiyyah have tried to argue that <a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a> is not from <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, and that to state <a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a>, <b>some of them have said that this is a bid'ah</b> and some of them have said that this should be reduced to the principles of fiqh.</blockquote>    <P>
Here, Ali al-Timimi was commenting on a small treatise written by some Kuwaitis in which certain issues and their importance were being highlighted. Now, you have to understand what is going on here, and let us illustrate.     <P>
<blockquote>A Tablighi in <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> can write a treatise in which he brings evidences for and emphasizes the importance of the kalimah, khushoo' in the prayer, knowledge and remembrance, honouring the Muslims, being sincere in one's intentions, and going out and striving in the path of Allaah, providing evidence for each issue from the texts and sayings of the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah. He can then take it to a Shaykh and say, "What do you say about this advice" and any Shaykh will say, "This is great advice, it contains benefit for the Muslims". Then the Tablighi can go and explain those generalized subjects upon his particular innovation and call to his innovation through this by claiming that the Shaykh supports him in both the general and specific details of what he is calling to.</blockquote>     <P>
And what Ali al-Timimi was reading from was precisely this, a generalized advice which no two Muslims would disagree upon. There is no mention of the label "<i><a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a></i>" in the tract he was reading from, but just quotations from the Scholars, like Imaam ash-Shanqiti, and Shaykh Ibn Ibraaheem, emphasizing the importance of ruling by what Allaah has revealed, and its being a part of Tawheed. With the audience unawares, he brought his own speech with certain particulars, and the audience left with the understanding, "<i>Hey <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> speaks with <a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a>, as a separate category of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and so do those other scholars</i>". And of course, Ali al-Timimi was explaining these generalized points (which no two Muslims would disagree over in their generality), <u>upon the methodologies of al-Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen</u>, upon the doctrines and methodologies of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and Hassan al-Banna, which came to him from the likes of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq and others. The proof for this is extensive and firmly established and will be dealt with elsewhere, as we cannot digress here. However, it is important that the reader understand the context and what was going on here. The <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> (see <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?jqpkg //>here</a>, <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?hulwt >here</a>, <a href=index49f2.html?xwcmm >here</a>, <a href=index7e0b.html?sxptl >here</a> and <a href=index0ec1.html?blaok >here</a>) were responded to by the Scholars in the following verdicts:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul><li> <b>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</b>: Isolating <a href='tags/haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haakimiyyah</font></a> As a Separate Category of Tawheed Comes From a 20th Century Ignoramus - (<a href=indexf9e0.html?nspvn>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Shaykh al-Albaani</b> on <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> al-Haakimiyyah: A Political Tool Used to Make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Rulers - (<a href=indexebe5.html?tjxlr>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen</b>: <a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a> As a Fourth Category Is the Saying of an Ignorant Strayer - (<a href=index5fb6.html?pmcwq>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen</b>: <a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a> As a Fourth Category Comes from an Ignorant Mubtadi' - (<a href=index6f86.html?prtli>see here</a>)  <li> <b><a href='tags/shaykh-abdul-aziz-bin-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Abdul-Aziz Bin Baz</font></a></b>: The Categories of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> are Not Four In Number, They Are Three - (<a href=index1b08.html?ucvlc>see here</a>)</ul></div>    <P>
When the Major Scholars<b> declared such people to be Innovators</b>, they quickly <u>retreated</u> to teaching just "two categories" of Tawheed <u>and denied</u> ever having even spoken of a fourth category of Tawheed called "<i>Tawheed al-Haakimiyyah</i>". This is why the more shrewd amongst the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> made a hasty retreat and backed off, even if some of them continued their deception by trying to use the issue of Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> writing an introduction for a book of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq in which the latter makes reference to "Tawheed al-Hukm", as justification for their innovation of making "<i><a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a></i>" into <u>an independent fourth category</u>. There is a difference between speaking of a certain notion and its importance (i.e. you could emphasize the importance of tawheed udh-dhabh, tawheed al-isti'aanah), and dedicating a few pages to it, and between making it <u>an independent fourth category of Tawheed in addition to the three agreed upon by ijmaa' which comprise every aspect of Tawheed already</u>. But this was just one of many types of deceptions of these people which will be covered elsewhere.  <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh al-Albaani on <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> al-Haakimiyyah: A Political Tool Used to Make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Rulers</font>    <P>
Shaikh Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee was asked,     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Our Shaikh, may Allaah bless you, the scholars of the Salaf, may Allaah have mercy upon them, mention that Tawheed is of three types: '<i>ar-Ruboobiyyah</i>', '<i>al-Uloohiyyah</i>' and '<i>al-Asmaa was-Sifaat</i>', so is it correct for us to say that there is a fourth Tawheed that is '<i>Tawheedul-Haakimiyyah</i>' or 'Tawheed of Judgement'? </blockquote>    <P>
So he replied:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>'<i>Al-Haakimiyyah</i>' is a branch of the branches of Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah, and those who focus their attention upon this newly invented saying in the present age use it as a weapon not to teach the Muslims the Tawheed that all of the Prophets and Messengers came with, but rather as a political weapon. So if you wish I will establish for you what I have just said, even though this question has repeatedly been answered by me, many times - or if you wish we will continue upon our topic.    <P>
I have said in similar circumstances, as support for what I have just said, that usage of the word '<i>al-Haakimyyah</i>' is part of the political da'wah that is particular to some of the parties present today; and I will mention here something that occurred between myself and someone who gave the khutbah in one of the mosques of Damascus. So on the day of Jumu'ah he gave a khutbah which was all about judgement being for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. But this person made an error with regard to a matter of fiqh. So after he had finished the prayer I went forward to him and gave him 'salaam,' and said to him, 'O my brother, you did so and so, and that is contrary to the Sunnah.' So he said to me, 'I am a Hanafee, and the Hanafee madhhab says what I have done.' So I said, 'Subhaanallaah! <b>You have given khutbah that judgement is just for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, but you only use this word to attack those rulers whom you think are Unbelievers because they do not rule according to the Islamic Sharee'ah. But you have forgotten about yourselves - that Allaah's judgement covers every Muslim</b>. So why, when I say to you that the Messenger did so and so, why do you say, 'But my madhhab is such and such.' Then you have contradicted that which you call the people to.'    <P>
So if it were not for the fact that <u>they use this saying as a tool for political propaganda of theirs</u>, then we would say, 'This is our merchandise that has been returned to us.'</blockquote>    <P>
