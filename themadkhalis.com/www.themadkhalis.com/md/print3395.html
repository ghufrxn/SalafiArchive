From the greatest of distinctions between the true followers of the Messengers and Prophets (in beliefs and methodologies) and those besides them is their affirmation of whatever Allaah affirmed for Himself and which His Messenger (alayhis salaam) affirmed for him in the revealed texts, of Names, Attributes and Actions.    <P>
From the greatest of these is Allaah's Uluww (above the heaven, above the Throne, with His Essence). This is a matter that all revealed books and all sent messengers were agreed upon, <u>until the appearance of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the Mu'tazilah</u>. On the basis of an intellectual proof they devised - based upon the language, terminology and classification of the atheist philosophers - to prove the universe is created, they denied much of what has come in the Book and the Sunnah pertaining to Allaah's Names, Attributes and Actions, in order to avoid invalidating their rational proof.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And From amongst the greatest of the affairs that they denied were <u>Allaah's Uluww</u>, and likewise, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being Allaah's Speech (and hence <u>uncreated</u>). The Salaf's rejection of these people was extremely severe, and they did not hesitate to declare these beliefs as kufr (disbelief). </div>    <P>
These people were opposed by the entirety of the Salaf, and in the third century, a faction of the Ahl al-Kalaam called <u>the Kullaabiyyah</u>, named after Abdullaah bin Sa'eed bin Kullaab (d. 240H), opposed the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah by being the first of the Mutakallimeen to affirm something of Allaah's Attributes. They refuted the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah on the issue of Allaah's Uluww and in the rejection of the Sifaat Dhaatiyyah. However, uable to counter the arguments of the Mu'tazilah, they denied the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (actions tied to Allaah's will) and through this rejection, concurred with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us <u>is created</u>, whilst affirming something additional that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah did not affirm, which is that there is another uncreated <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the meaning present with Allaah's Self form eternity which they called "kalaam nafsee". These doctrines of the Kullaabiyyah were taken on by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (d. 324H) after his split with the Mu'tazilah and they became popularized through the label of "<u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>". The essence of the Kullaabi (then Ash'arite) creed was to negate "events (hawaadith)" from Allaah, since to them, everything in the universe is but an event. The early <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> remained upon the creed of the Kullabiyyah in the bulk, affirming Allaah's Uluww and the sifaat dhaatiyyah (such as Face, Hands, Eyes) however, the later <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> reverted back to the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah on these specific issues, and adopted the very ta'weels of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah that the early Kullaabi <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> refuted. Thus, unlike the early Kullaabi <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a>, they denied Allaah is above the Throne, with His Essence and instead adopted the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>,  Mut'azilah and Kafirs like Ibn Sinah (d. 429H) - <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?mrsit>see here</a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This then became the standard <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> doctrine, and all <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> from that time have been upon these doctrines, which include the saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (present with us, recited, heard, memorized and written) is created, the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> and the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of Allaah's Uluww as a means of negating what is manifest in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the Sunnah and the Ijmaa' of the Salaf, that Allaah Himself, with His Essence, is above the heaven, above the Throne. The <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> continued to propound and propagate these doctrines in the various lands. In <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> in the early 20th century, a number of <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> such as <b><a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></b>, <b><a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a></b>, and the Maturidi, <b>Muhammad Abduh</b>, continued to propagate the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah in their works. </div>    <P>
These very <u>Ash'ari, Maturidi, Mu'tazili</u> figureheads were the same people responsible for the birth and growth of the destructive political movements of the 20th century, and whereas in previous centuries, those assuming the label of "<a href="tags/asharis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'aris</font></a>" had  departed from his creed and corrupted the beliefs of the Muslims with their hybrid Jahmee, Mu'tazilee, Kullaabi, <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> creed,  in the twentieth century, this same line of <s><a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a></s> <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> also corrupted the deen of the Muslims in the field of rectification and reform, infusing non-Muslim ideologies, and innovating two strains of deviation: <u>Firstly</u>, Leninist-Marxism, a <a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a> to snatch power from the authorities, which gave birth to the madhhab of the Khawaarij, and <u>secondly</u>, mass-populist political activation as a means to work through the existing secular political framework (by hook or crook) to arrive at power, inclusive of what these two strains may have required of secrecy, deception, pledges of allegiance, assassinations, intrigues, entry into democracy and so on. And whoever reads the biographies of these two particular <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> will not see anything but that. <P>

<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So an individual faces the qiblah when he turns to Allaah completely (in all ways), with his heart, with his senses, with his limbs.

This is one of the core foundations of the deen of the Mu'attilah, the Salaf's rejection of it was severe.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Refutation of the Deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> of Negating Allaah's Uluww (Being Above the Creation)</font>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>A quick piece of genuinely sincere advice:</b> It's from the intelligence of a man to recognize and realise when he is defeated and when the preponderance of evidence is against him. Engaging in such childish activities - after or whilst these types of affairs (i.e. the subject of this article) are made clear -  is simply a representation of the basest, meanest and lowest of human characteristics, and it is feared that Allaah may cause an individual's heart to die on account of such behaviour.     <P>
We ask Allaah to make it sufficient honour for us for defending this <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and that He places us by the sides of the Prophets and Messengers, and the Imaams of the Salaf. Conversely, sufficient ignominy and humiliation is it that an individual be raised alongside the the ranks of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah as a result of making his <u>loyalty and disownment</u>, <u>love and hate</u> based around a man who is from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (ignorant ones at that). <b>A man will be with those whom he loves</b>. You can't claim to love the Imaams of the Salaf and the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> they defended and then ally with the deniers of Allaah's uluww, the propounders of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, the negators of the attributes, the mockers of the Prophets, the revilers of Uthmaan, the mukaffirs of Banu Umayyah, the accusers of Mu'aawiyah, the Uncle of the Believers and Scribe of the Prophet, of having nifaaq, ghish and khadee'ah (hypocrisy, deception, trickery), the speakers with the creation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and what is more than that. So it is from the intelligence of a man to realize that its time to stop and submit to the truth.</div>    <P>
The Shaykh, Abdullaah ad-Dawaish, may Allah reward him immensely, stated, in refuting this asl of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, in his book concerning the errors in az-Zilaal, "al-Moorid az-Zalaal" (pp. 19-20):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This is the saying of Ahl ul-Bid'ah such as the <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Mu'tazilah</u> and <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>. As for Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, then they do not describe Allaah except with what He described Himself and with what His Messenger described Him with. They do not go beyond the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Hadeeth, so they affirm the uluww of the Lord, Mighty and Majestic, and His istwaa over His Throne, just as He said, "<b>And He is al-Aliyy al-Kabeer</b>", and He also said, "<b>And He made istiwaa over the Throne</b>".</blockquote>    <P>
And he continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for the people of innovation then they do not affirm what has been reported or they affirm some of the attributes as opposed to others, and they innovate ambiguous words by which one may think that they are purifying the Lord, the Mighty and Majestic from deficiencies and shortcomings. But their intent is to negate the attributes, [the words they use], such as al-jism, at-tahayyuz, al-jawhar, al-'arad.     <P>
Shaykh Taqi ud-Deen (<a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a>) said, after some speech of his in refutation of the one who said, "<i>He is not a jism, nor a jawhar nor an 'arad</i>", he said (rahimahullaah):    <P>
<blockquote>These words, such as al-jawhar, al-jism and al-hayyiz and what is similar to them, their affirmation or negation are not applied unrestrictedly...</blockquote>    <P>
up until Shaykh ul-Islaam said:    <P>
<blockquote>And the intent is that the Imaams such as Ahmad and others, the people of innovation mentioned generalized (ambiguous) words to them, such as the word al-jism, and al-hayyiz, but they did not agree with them, neither their absolute application and nor in absolute negation of them.</blockquote>    <P>
End quote from ad-Durar as-Sunniyyah (2/360). And Shaykh ul-Islaam also said, after some speech of his that preceded regarding the Mu'tazilah:    <P>
<blockquote>And likewise, when they say "<i>Indeed Allaah is purified of <a href='tags/hudood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudood</font></a> (limits), and spaces (ahyaaz) and jihaat (directions)</i>", they make the people to presume that their intent behind this is that the created things (makhlooqaat) do not encompass him, and the manufactured, created things (masnoo'aat) do not contain him. And this meaning is correct, but their intent is that He is not distinct, from the creation, nor separate from it, and that there is no Lord above the heavens, and no deity above the Throne, and that Muhammad did not ascend to Him, and that nothing came down from Him, and nothing ascends to Him, and nothing comes closer to Him, and that the hands are not raised towards him [in reality] in supplication or other than it, and other such meanings of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
From the book "al-Aql wan-Naql", Allaah knows best</blockquote>    <P>
There are a people who expend great efforts in refuting the As'hariyyah <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> who speak with what <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>  has spoken with of expressing the negation of "<a href="tags/makaan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Makaan</font></a>" and "tahayyuz" and they show great earnest and zeal in refuting whatever these <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> bring with respect to this belief, scorning this belief, despising it, declaring it's intended meaning as kufr, mocking those who speak with it, feeling proud of having refuted them and repelled and considering all of this as jihaad in the path of Allaah. However, the sincerity of these actions are put to trial when it comes to Qutb's Zilaal considering that it is spread the world over, and read the world over, and used to nurture generations upon generations upon a particular way of thinking. If their refutations and efforts against the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> are sincere, then we would see exactly the same towards the Jahmite doctrine that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> makes references in a manner that conveys that it is a standard, accepted truth, and which would certainly misguide people who read it, considering at the same time, that this book is published in the millions and is spread the world over.    <P>
As for the isolated opinion of one or two of the Scholars, and the attachment of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> to them, then it is a sign of utmost desperation, and the opposer, if he stands in front of Allaah and passes his soul through a moment of honesty and sincerity, will have yaqeen regarding that. <P>
