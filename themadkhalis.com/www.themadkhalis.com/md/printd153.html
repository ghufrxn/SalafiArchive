<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>First, before you go any further, you must read this article: <b>The Words of Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> Falling on Those (<a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>) Who Lied Upon Him (Safar al-Hawali, <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, <a href='tags/muhammad-saeed-al-qahtani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Sa'eed al-Qahtani</font></a>, <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a>, Abdur-Razzaq ash-Shayijee): Callers of Falsehood and Stirrers of the Murky Waters</b> (<a href=index088b.html?qvrrm>see here</a>). <b>Why?</b> Because it will teach you that history repeats itself and that the ways and methods of the liars and deceivers, when they wish to malign and attack the Scholars of the Sunnah, don't change. The article about Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> and the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> will give you an insight as to what is going on today, with a people using the speech of Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a>, its the same thing.    <P>
Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah)   <a href=indexb09a.html?epluy>explains</a> the reality of the  matter regarding why people attack Shaykh Rabee':     <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right'>&#1585;&#1571;&#1610;&#1606;&#1575; &#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1594;&#1604;&#1591; &#1608;&#1582;&#1591;&#1571; &#1593;&#1592;&#1610;&#1605;&#1548; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1610;&#1582; &#1585;&#1576;&#1610;&#1593; &#1605;&#1606; &#1593;&#1604;&#1605;&#1575;&#1569; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1577; &#1608;&#1605;&#1606; &#1571;&#1607;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1582;&#1610;&#1585; &#1608;&#1593;&#1602;&#1610;&#1583;&#1578;&#1607; &#1587;&#1604;&#1610;&#1605;&#1577; &#1608;&#1605;&#1606;&#1607;&#1580;&#1607; &#1602;&#1608;&#1610;&#1605;&#1548; &#1604;&#1603;&#1606; &#1604;&#1605;&#1575; &#1603;&#1575;&#1606; &#1610;&#1578;&#1603;&#1604;&#1605; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1576;&#1593;&#1590; &#1575;&#1604;&#1585;&#1605;&#1608;&#1586; &#1593;&#1606;&#1583; &#1576;&#1593;&#1590; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1575;&#1587; &#1605;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1578;&#1571;&#1582;&#1585;&#1610;&#1606; &#1608;&#1589;&#1605;&#1608;&#1607; &#1576;&#1607;&#1584;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1610;&#1608;&#1576;&#1548; &#1571;&#1593;&#1585;&#1601;&#1578;&#1567;</div>    <P>
<blockquote><b>We consider this to be a great error and mistake. Shaikh Rabee' is from the Ulamaa of the Sunnah, and from the people of goodness. His <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> is sound and his manhaj is strong and sound. However, when he began to speak about some of the symbolic figureheads of some of the people, from amongst the latecomers  they began to tarnish him with these faults. Do you know [this] now?</b></blockquote>    <P>
With the knowledge that Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a>, a year or so before his death, wholeheartedly warned from the <a href='tags/qutbi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi Manhaj</font></a> as evidenced by his checking and commendation of a particular book, refer to the article "<b>Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen Distinguished Between The <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a> and The <a href='tags/qutbi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi Manhaj</font></a> and Wholeheartedly Reccommended Warning From the <a href='tags/qutbi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi Manhaj</font></a> After Detailed Study and Consideration</b>" (<a href=index49f2.html?xwcmm>see here</a>).    <P>
Now this phenomenon of a people attacking <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> because he refuted - and rightly so - the misguidance of their figureheads, did not stop with <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, but continued as <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> performed the obligation of defending the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and manhaj and defending the honour of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> (radiallaahu anhu) by first advising for many long years, then refuting those others who stubbornly opposed the private advice and clung to their baatil (falsehood) stubbornly. From them Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaaliq (<a href=http://www.ikhwanis.com/tags/ihyaa-al-turaath.cfm>see here</a>) al-Maghrawi, al-Ma'ribee, al-Halabi, al-Hajuri and others.   </blockquote></div>    <P>

In a very recent question and answer session that took place through a satellite channel, Shaykh Salih <a href='tags/al-fawzan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/fawzan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Fawzan</font></a></font></a> was asked regarding a piece of advice he gave a year earlier and which people interpreted in a certain way in order to attack and malign <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a>. Here is the audio (<a href=assets/audio/fawzan-rabee-advice-apply-rejection.mp3>Download File</a>):     <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Translation:</font>    <P>
Questioner:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Our respected Shaykh, father, may Allaah preserve you,  you directed, may Allaah preserve you, a precious word and beneficial advice at the end of the dawrah at the University of  Malik Saud in Jeddah... and from what you advised with, after the taqwa of Allaah and persistence in seeking knowledge, was to abandon the quarrelling that is taking place now between the students of knowledge and which has split the ummah and has split the students of knowledge such that (it is said) so and so should be warned against and so and so should not be sat with and so and so should not be accompanied. And that it is obligatory to respect the Scholars and not speak ill of them and not to warn against them.  And when separation occurs between the Scholars and students of knowledge, who will remain for the Ummah? So then some people - and regretfully O respected Shaykh, father -  began to explain your speech that you intended by speech to warn against some Scholars, those whose refutations against the people of falsehood and callers to (their) desires are abundant, such as <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> al-Madkhalee...</blockquote>    <P>
The Shaykh's answer:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The affair is as you mentioned that quarrelling (comprising hatred) is not permissible between the students of knowledge in that which is between them or between them and the scholars, for the students of knowledge and the scholars are the most worthy ones of spreading love and cordiality (brotherhood) for the sake of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and to abandon hatred and cutting off between themselves. However, when it is the case that a person errs, his (error) is made clear to him privately, or a letter is written to him, or he is spoken to through the means of communication, he is spoken to privately between the one who is advising and the one being advised and he is notified of the error which occurred from him. This is when he has an actual error, practically (i.e. an actual error has occurred). As for some students of knowledge and some of the tullaab (students) and some of the beginners, then everything is an error to them, and he does not know whether something is a mere error or an innovation (<i>bid'ah</i>). This matter is not permissible, to hasten in passing judgements and to hasten in speaking about people, or about scholars and students of knowledge. This is a rejected matter, Allaah, the Lofty and Exalted said, "<b>O you who believe, if a faasiq (sinful person) comes to you with news, then verify it,  harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful to what you have done</b>" (49:6). And in my speech that you alluded to I did not specify anyone, so whoever comes and specifies, then he specifies from his own desire, and its (burden of) sin is upon him.    </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Note</font>    <P>
<blockquote>This practice has been very common ever since the first Gulf War when the extremist <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> and Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq (see here) made their debut and attempted to bring the methodologies of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> (takfir, haakimiyyah) and <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a> (accommodation of groups, sects of innovation and misguidance) into Salafi audiences. Part and parcel of this was to attack and bring down the major scholars as being people ignorant of the realities (not having "<i>fiqh al-waaqi</i>"). When the Scholars, and at the head of them, <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a>, stood to defend the Salafi creed and methodology, many of these figureheads and their followers began their shuttle missions to the Major scholars like Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> and others, in order to complain and to elicit warnings from these Shaykhs against <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a>. They were not successful, even though they managed to cause a great deal of confusion, but by the end of the century, just before the three Imaams passed away (al-Albani, <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a>, Ibn al-Uthaymeen) each one of them had vindicated <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> and saw and recognized the truth of what he had been writing about, especially regarding <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and the Ikhwan.     <P>
However, there appeared other figureheads who were upon doctrines similar to those of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> or <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a>, and they came out openly after the death of those three Imaams. And when they were refuted and spoken against, their followers did the same thing. They tried to elicit speech against <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> in order to defend their figureheads who were rightly criticised not just for mere errors, but actual innovations (<i>bid'ah</i>). Note how Shaykh Salih <a href='tags/al-fawzan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/fawzan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Fawzan</font></a></font></a> made a distinction between genuine errors (on account of which their should never be splitting and separation and warning) and between what amount to innovations, the Scholars distinguish between things. So what <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> refuted all those people for were major innovations, the innovations of the khawaarij, the innovation of attacking the honour of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>, the innovation of justifying splitting and the existence of groups, sects and parties in the Muslim Ummah, the innovations of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in the books of certain figureheads of the Harakiyyeen and so on.     <P>
When these people could not elicit speech directly, they then began to find generalized statements and advices from some of the Scholars and then tried to twist them <u>and apply them in a way that the Shaykh did not intend</u>. And history repeats itself, just go and read this article and how they tried this with Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> (rahimahullaah) and it backfired upon them (<a href=index088b.html?qvrrm>see here</a>), just like it has backfired upon them with respect to Shaykh Salih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a>. So the one who tries to use the speech of Shaykh Salih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> and twist it and apply it in a way that the Shaykh does not intend, then he is following his desires and the burden of sin is upon him    <P>
Further, you can refer to the following articles too, just by way of example, there are plenty of similar statements out there:     <P>
<ul><li> Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan's Support and Praise of Shaykh Rabee's Refutation of <a href='tags/hasan-al-maalikee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Maalikee</font></a> - (<a href=index1e40.html?zdgbo>see here</a>)  <li> Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> Supported <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> Against <a href='tags/abdur-rahmaan-abdul-khaaliq.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq</font></a> (Refutation of  <a href='tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a>, Abu Usaamah Khaleefah And Others) - (<a href=index6fd1.html?mvazr>see here</a>)  <li> Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/fawzan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Fawzan</font></a></font></a> on Using the Labels of 'Jaamiyyah' and 'Madaakhilah' - (<a href=indexf905.html?zvrzr>see here</a>)  </ul>    <P>
<u>Finally</u>, it is known full well about <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> that he spends years and years of advising privately. Then he starts advising those who are close to an individual to start advising him as well to correct his mistakes. And when all of that fails, after many long years, he starts writing articles in order to correct the errors, and it is here that the reality of the invidual he tried to advise comes out in that person exposes himself as a stubborn opposer and follower of desires as happened with al-Ma'ribee, al-Maghrawi and the others that followed, ending with al-Hajuri most recently, who has been advised for seven years or so.     <P>
