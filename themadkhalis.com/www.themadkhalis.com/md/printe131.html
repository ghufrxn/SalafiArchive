From the greatest of distinctions between the true followers of the Messengers and Prophets (in beliefs and methodologies) and those besides them is their affirmation of whatever Allaah affirmed for Himself and which His Messenger (alayhis salaam) affirmed for him in the revealed texts, of Names, Attributes and Actions.    <P>
From the greatest of these is Allaah's Uluww (above the heaven, above the Throne, with His Essence). This is a matter that all revealed books and all sent messengers were agreed upon, <u>until the appearance of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the Mu'tazilah</u>. On the basis of an intellectual proof they devised - based upon the language, terminology and classification of the atheist philosophers - to prove the universe is created, they denied much of what has come in the Book and the Sunnah pertaining to Allaah's Names, Attributes and Actions, in order to avoid invalidating their rational proof.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And From amongst the greatest of the affairs that they denied were <u>Allaah's Uluww</u>, and likewise, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being Allaah's Speech (and hence <u>uncreated</u>). The Salaf's rejection of these people was extremely severe, and they did not hesitate to declare these beliefs as kufr (disbelief). </div>    <P>
These people were opposed by the entirety of the Salaf, and in the third century, a faction of the Ahl al-Kalaam called <u>the Kullaabiyyah</u>, named after Abdullaah bin Sa'eed bin Kullaab (d. 240H), opposed the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah by being the first of the Mutakallimeen to affirm something of Allaah's Attributes. They refuted the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah on the issue of Allaah's Uluww and in the rejection of the Sifaat Dhaatiyyah. However, uable to counter the arguments of the Mu'tazilah, they denied the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (actions tied to Allaah's will) and through this rejection, concurred with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us <u>is created</u>, whilst affirming something additional that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah did not affirm, which is that there is another uncreated <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the meaning present with Allaah's Self form eternity which they called "kalaam nafsee". These doctrines of the Kullaabiyyah were taken on by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (d. 324H) after his split with the Mu'tazilah and they became popularized through the label of "<u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>". The essence of the Kullaabi (then Ash'arite) creed was to negate "events (hawaadith)" from Allaah, since to them, everything in the universe is but an event. The early <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> remained upon the creed of the Kullabiyyah in the bulk, affirming Allaah's Uluww and the sifaat dhaatiyyah (such as Face, Hands, Eyes) however, the later <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> reverted back to the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah on these specific issues, and adopted the very ta'weels of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah that the early Kullaabi <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> refuted. Thus, unlike the early Kullaabi <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a>, they denied Allaah is above the Throne, with His Essence and instead adopted the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>,  Mut'azilah and Kafirs like Ibn Sinah (d. 429H) - <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?mrsit>see here</a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This then became the standard <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> doctrine, and all <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> from that time have been upon these doctrines, which include the saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (present with us, recited, heard, memorized and written) is created, the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> and the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of Allaah's Uluww as a means of negating what is manifest in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the Sunnah and the Ijmaa' of the Salaf, that Allaah Himself, with His Essence, is above the heaven, above the Throne. The <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> continued to propound and propagate these doctrines in the various lands. In <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> in the early 20th century, a number of <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> such as <b><a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></b>, <b><a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a></b>, and the Maturidi, <b>Muhammad Abduh</b>, continued to propagate the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah in their works. </div>    <P>
These very <u>Ash'ari, Maturidi, Mu'tazili</u> figureheads were the same people responsible for the birth and growth of the destructive political movements of the 20th century, and whereas in previous centuries, those assuming the label of "<a href="tags/asharis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'aris</font></a>" had  departed from his creed and corrupted the beliefs of the Muslims with their hybrid Jahmee, Mu'tazilee, Kullaabi, <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> creed,  in the twentieth century, this same line of <s><a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a></s> <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> also corrupted the deen of the Muslims in the field of rectification and reform, infusing non-Muslim ideologies, and innovating two strains of deviation: <u>Firstly</u>, Leninist-Marxism, a <a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a> to snatch power from the authorities, which gave birth to the madhhab of the Khawaarij, and <u>secondly</u>, mass-populist political activation as a means to work through the existing secular political framework (by hook or crook) to arrive at power, inclusive of what these two strains may have required of secrecy, deception, pledges of allegiance, assassinations, intrigues, entry into democracy and so on. And whoever reads the biographies of these two particular <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> will not see anything but that. <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Between <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a>, <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> and <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> - The Texts of the Attributes Are Imaginary Depictions Without Realities</font>    <P>
We have covered in previous articles what is explicitly stated by the likes of <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) and <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H), two Imaams for the <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a>, that the texts of the attributes are such that Allaah has deliberately used such language so as to induce <a href='tags/faith.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Faith</font></a> in "dumb commoners" (i.e. the awaam, which is the likes of us and you), and that the <i>tajseemi</i> (anthropomorphic) language has been used due to necessity and so as not to make the people flee to atheism, and if such language was used that actually described the realities (Allaah is not a jism, nor an 'arad, nor a jawhar, nor outside the universe, nor inside the universe and so on), then out of a thousand people all of them would turn to atheism except perhaps one.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul><li> <b>Fakhr ud-Din ar-Razi</b> (Imaam of the Later Asharis): If the Common Folk Were Invited to Belief in Allaah Through the Language and Terminology of the Ash'arites They Would Fall Into Atheism - (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?yiwxz>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Abu Hamid al-Ghazali</b> (Imaam of the Later Ash'aris): If the Prophet Invited to Belief in Allaah Through the Language and Terminology of the Ash'arites,  Not even One in a Thousand Would Accept It! Rather the Majority Would Tend to Atheism! - (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?ykoxo>see here</a>)</ul></div>    <P>
Being an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, it is no surprise that <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> presents a similar concept in his works which continue to be published, distributed and propagated. Below is the book "<b>at-Tasweer al-Fanni Fil-Qur'an</b>" (<i>A Depiction of Art in the Qur'an</i>), <u>and this is a 2002, 16th edition print</u> - you see forty years after Qutb's death, these books continue to be printed and distributed.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/tasweer-fanni-cover.gif border=1 border=0> <img src=assets/images/tasweer-fanni-cover-inside.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
In this book (p. 71) <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> has a chapter called (<span class='arb'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1582;&#1610;&#1610;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1587;&#1610; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1580;&#1587;&#1610;&#1605;</span>), and essentially, the general theme is the same as what the <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> we have quoted above have explained, however <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> here is presenting the same idea but from a modern, literary aspect. In his book he even refers to the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> as "magic" repeatedly, from the angle of showing its literary excellence, and this is a clear error, for such words are not applied to the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. But in this chapter, he explains the meanings of <i>takhyeel hissee</i> (depiction as physical art form) and <i>tajseem</i> (embodiment of meanings) and brings what are illustrations to him of such concepts. <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> essentially outlines the idea that these techniques have been used in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to allow imagination and conceptualization in the mind of the reader, through tangible physical illustrations, to give full expression and understanding in the mind of the reader, even if these are nothing but pure meanings in and of themselves (i.e. without a reality, or without a reality that is known). This is essentially the same as what <a href='tags/al-ghazali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ghazali</font></a> (d. 505H) and <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) and also kafirs like Ibn Sina (d. 429H) believe.    <P>
After giving many examples, amongst them the Scales and weighing of the deeds, which according to him would be ma'nawiyy only (meanings only) and not something that is physical, he brings a collection of verses which are the verses of the attributes.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/tasweer-fanni-sifaat-takhyeel.gif border=0>    <P>
We see here that he has brought the verses that relate to the following: Allah's Hand, Allaah being over the Throne which is over the water, the Kursee, Allaah's Istiwaa over the Arsh, Allaah grasping the Earth with His Hand and the heavens being rolled up in His Right Hand, Allaah coming on the Day of Judgement (and the Angels), Allaah's Two Hands, Allaah raising Eesaa up unto Himself    <P>
And after bringing them all he remarks:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And whatever disputation was unleashed, was unleashed regarding these words ....</blockquote>    <P>
He means here the dispute between Ahl us-Sunnah and the Innovators, and <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> was not ignorant of the madhhab of the Salaf as we have proven <a href=index283f.html?ebzdi>in another article</a>, wherein he said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the saying that "<i>We believe in <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> and we do not know its kaifiyyah</i>" does not explain His, the Most High's saying, "<b>then he made istawaa</b>". And it is more appropriate that we say: It is an indirect expression for control, dominion, authority (haymanah) as has we have mentioned.</blockquote>    <P>
So <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> was upon what he was upon <u>with the knowledge of the way of the Salaf</u>, which he dismissed. And here (in "<i>at-Tasweer al-Fanni fil-Qur'an</i>"), he says:    <P>
