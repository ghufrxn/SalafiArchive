<p>Dr. <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> said, proudly boasting, and addressing <a href='tags/george-bush.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>George Bush</font></a> in his well-known, well-distributed letter to him dated 15th October 2001:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We Muslims eagerly desired to see you elected and we possess evidences that the votes which gave you victory <u>were our votes</u>, and <b>I personally advised Muslims to vote for you</b>. </blockquote>    <P>
Thank you Dr. Hawali. Hope you can sleep well at night after your advices to the Algerian people in the 1990s in your aid and support of the movements of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> in <a href='tags/algeria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Algeria</font></a>, and them taking you and your comrades as leaders and guides, and your encouragement for them to traverse other than the Prophetic methodology in da'wah and reform, and your preaching of <b><a href=index33d0.html?tjmrl>revolutionary ideologies</a></b> to the Algerians through your lectures and cassettes. Hope you can also sleep smugly at night, with the knowledge of the "freedom and democracy" that came to the Iraqi people through "<i>your votes</i>", and you even "<i>possess evidences</i>" that they were indeed your votes, how proud you must feel. If it was the case that the war-mongers specifically needed Bush to get into power to launch all these wars in that eight year period - which is what is apparent - then truly the Muslims are indebted to you for the freedom and democracy they now have the privilege of having, all thanks to you!     <P>
Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a> <b><a href=index33d0.html?tjmrl>saw through you in the end</a></b> ... and he exposed the <a href='tags/qutbi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi Manhaj</font></a> you were pushing to the Algerians, and the lies that you and your comrades were using to deceive the Muslims (see   <b><a href=index0ec1.html?blaok>here</a></b> and <b><a href=index49f2.html?xwcmm>here</a></b>), and did you forget how a clarification made by Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> <b><a href=index088b.html?qvrrm >convicted you all</a></b>, as a matter of fact, as liars, <u>du'aat of baatil</u> (callers of falsehood) and <u>stirrers of murky waters</u> way back in 1992 (1412CE), after the Shaykhs of Madinah had already figured you out, when you took the Gulf war as a means to come out openly with your <b><a href=index74ea.html?rhmeq>Leninist</a></b> <a href='tags/qutbi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi</font></a> da'wah?      <P>
You came out, belittling the scholars in the name of "<i>fiqh ul-waaqi'</i>", but the reality is that you were the ones who did not understand anything about "<i>fiqh ul-waaqi'</i>" as is very abundantly clear from your disgraces.    <P>
