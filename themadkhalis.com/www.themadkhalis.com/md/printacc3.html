We see the emergence of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> nowadays (see <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?jqpkg //>here</a>, <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?hulwt >here</a>, <a href=index49f2.html?xwcmm >here</a>, <a href=index7e0b.html?sxptl >here</a> and <a href=index0ec1.html?blaok >here</a> for proof that the Scholars recognize them and label them as a faction with this <u>name</u> and <u>methodology</u>), they are rushing towards the blogs and forums, in order to make defenses, apologetical writings, and expressing sentiments towards their figureheads who are Jahmite <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a>, together with what they expressed of  the bid'ahs of the <u><a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a></u>, the bid'ahs of the <u>Khawaarij</u>, the bid'ahs of the <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Mu'tazilah</u>, <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Jabariyyah</u>, <u>Mutasawwifah</u> and statements of expression of the bid'ahs of the Ittihaadiyyah, let alone other outright statements of kufr. These people have come out not for the sake of defending the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> or because of jealousy towards <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> of Allaah's Messenger (alayhis salaam) <u>but only because</u> it grieves them that sincerity of purpose is given to the Ummah in warning against the misguidance and deviations found in the <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i> (ideology) of the 20th century ignoramuses whom they have taken as their symbolic figureheads (rumooz).     <P>
In this series of articles we will document and highlight, in no particular order, what they have testified upon themselves, <b>through their own actions and activities</b>, of the following of desires and aiding and supporting falsehood, upon knowledge and intent. <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Concerning the General Advice of the Muftee Shaykh Abdul-Aziz Aal ash-Shaykh</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> are using a statement of Shaykh Abdul-Aziz Aal ash-Shaykh which we have mentioned in a few previous articles, we will come to this after an important background and introduction.     <P>
To understand why the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> are operating from the sewers in this manner you have go back into history and realize how they were forced down there to begin with. So what we are going to do here is simply give some background to help you understand the true nature of their activities today and what specifically they are in response to.     <P>
<b>Here's the answer:</b>    <P>
These people are upon the "<i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>" (not Sharee'ah ilm, knowledge - <b><a href=indexf862.html?umiea>see this excellent article here</a></b>) that came to them from <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a> and their likes. These were 20th century non-Scholars, but "Islamic thinkers" and "Islamic writers" who devised ideologies and political methodologies by fusing the products of their own minds (after reflection upon society, civilization and so on) with secular ideologies, philosophies and political methodologies of the time.     <P>
<b>The goal of all of them was to establish the khilaafah, and as the khilaafah was the ultimate objective, being concerned about <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> was essentially a waste of time - and this is manifest in what these people wrote and said. As a result of this, they utterly laid to waste and annihilated the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of al-walaa wal-baraa as it relates to the affairs of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>.</b>    <P>
Qutb held that with the entire world "apostate" (according to him), its pointless dealing with <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and fiqh matters. And <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a> likewise, worked to unite all the groups of innovation as well as non-Muslims (grave-worshippers, <a href='tags/shiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shiah</font></a> etc.), putting all differences in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> aside, to work for the greater objective. As a result of this "<i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>" and making their own ideological language to be <u>the conceptual framework upon which value judgements were made</u>, we saw some of these people enter into very serious affairs - that's after we put aside their ignorance in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> (they were Ash'aris). So on the basis of their own extreme, exaggerated, innovated notions of "<i><a href='tags/al-adaalah-al-ijtimaaiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Adaalah al-Ijtimaa'iyyah</font></a></i>" (<a href='tags/social-justice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Social Justice</font></a>), "<i><a href='tags/jaahiliyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jaahiliyyah</font></a></i>", "<i><a href='tags/haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haakimiyyah</font></a></i>", the likes of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> negated Islam from <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, his parents <a href='tags/abu-sufyan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Sufyan</font></a> and <a href='tags/hind.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hind</font></a>, Amr bin al-Aas and the Bani Umayyah. He reviled Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu) and he also made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the entire Ummah and also called for Leninist type revolutions (the manifestos of atheist secular Jews) to be unleashed in all the Muslim lands). Something similar excesses occurred from <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a>, but much less severe than those of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>.    <P>
And as for <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a>, then he explicitly stated that his call is not to any particular creed, or against any particular religion, but rather it calls for the unity of everyone and so his way was to lay down methodologies and structures through which the jamaa'aat and madhaahib could all be fused into one for a common purpose.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Leaving out a lot of the details this "<i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>" became popular as it spawned the hundreds, if not thousands of the so called "Islamic" political, activist movements that were essentially all based around the broad concept of "return of the khilaafah" and <u>fantasy dream-concepts</u> of a "united Ummah". We say "dream-concepts" because the foundations and premises upon which this entire call was founded upon is baatil (false) and <u>is built upon other than that which true unity is founded upon</u>, as per the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allah, and as per the usool of the Book and the Sunnah in this regard. This "<i>fantasy fikr</i>" in its spirit, continues in the minds of millions, due to the presence of individuals, organizations, parties and groups who propagandize for this "<i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>", it's proponents, and the books in which it is contained.</div>    <P>
Again, we are leaving out a lot of details for the purpose of brevity, but there occurred a situation when after <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> fell out with Jamal Abdul-Nasser, <u>after helping to get him in power through a Leninist revolution in July 1952</u>, he fell out with him and was later imprisoned.     <P>
By the 1960s Nasserite <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> was not a friendly environment for the Ikhwan, so a lot of them fled, some to <b><a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a></b>, others to <b><a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a></b>, others to the <b>Emirates</b> and so on. And <u>they began recruiting in those areas</u>, and affecting the locals with this same "<i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>", until in <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> there emerged a generation of individuals, by the late 1980s, who, whilst demonstrating a Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, were tainted with this "<i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>", as a result of which the two main ideological trends of the Ikhwan, "<i>the takfiri, revolutionary mindset</i>" and "<i>the lenience towards the innovators and sects and gathering them all together for important political work</i>"  began to manifest - the former being that of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and the latter being that of <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>These people began raising these 20th century ignoramuses such as <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a> to the status of the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-hajr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Hajr</font></a> and <a href='tags/an-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>an-<a href="tags/nawawi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Nawawi</font></a></font></a> and other hadith giants, and likewise they began to compare <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> with Shaykh ul-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (what an insult!) and Shaykh ul-Islam Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhab (what an insult!), until one of them put <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> along with the two Shaykhs of Islaam as "<i>the Imaams of Guidance</i>".</div>    <P>
After the Scholars of Madinah began to advise these individuals, <b>in private and in person and through writing</b> (the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> of today won't tell you that) for a long time,  having patience with them, and these "<a href="tags/qutbiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutbiyyah</font></a>" failed to heed, then it became clear that there was more to these individuals than meets the eye, for they made manifest signs of hizbiyyah. So the Scholars, at the head of them, <a href='tags/shaykh-rabi-bin-hadi-al-madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/rabi-bin-hadi-al-madkhali.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Rabi bin Hadi al-<a href="tags/madkhali.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Madkhali</font></a></font></a></font></a>, <u>began to write numerous books</u> as a refutation of the methodologies of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen and their figureheads.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Some of the Books of <a href="tags/shaykh-rabi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shaykh Rabi</font></a></font>    <P>
From the the most important of what <a href='tags/shaykh-rabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabi</font></a> did was that:    <P>
<ul><li> <u>He wrote a book</u> called (<span class='arb'>&#1605;&#1606;&#1607;&#1580; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1606;&#1576;&#1610;&#1575;&#1569; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1593;&#1608;&#1577; &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1601;&#1610;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1603;&#1605;&#1577; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1602;&#1604; </span>) "<i>Manhaj al-Anbiyaa fid-Da'wah ilallaah</i>" (The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah) in which he refuted the secular atheist Jewish manifesto found in the books of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> of the revolutionary vanguard, the <a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a> of <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a> and the secular, pluralistic political (Machiavellian) methodologies espoused and enacted by <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a>.    <P>

And this was after a people were propagandizing for <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, being treacherous to the Ummah by putting <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> alongside Shaykh ul-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and Shaykh ul-Islam Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhab, and parading him as one of the "Imaams of Guidance"!    <P>
<li> <u>He wrote a book</u> called (<span class='arb'>&#1580;&#1605;&#1575;&#1593;&#1577; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583;&#1577; &#1604;&#1575; &#1580;&#1605;&#1575;&#1593;&#1575;&#1578; &#1608;&#1589;&#1585;&#1575;&#1591; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583; &#1604;&#1575; &#1593;&#1588;&#1585;&#1575;&#1578;</span>) "<i>Jamaa'ah Waahidah, Laa Jamaa'aat Siraat Waahid, Laa Asharaat</i>" (A Single Jamaa'ah, not Many Jamaa'ahs, A Single Path, not Tens of [Paths]), in refutation of the pluralist, secularist da'wah of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq al-Misree who was simply continuing the work of <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a> and his secular, pluralistic da'wah which called for the unification of all creeds and affiliations, including the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a>, for working together to establish the khilaafah!  </ul>    <P>
As soon as the Shaykh started upon this path, the <i>Qutbi Qiyaamah</i>, was unleashed. Rank hatred, enmity and resentment was apportioned for the Shaykh, and this then began the long war of these people in trying their utmost, using every guile, stratagem, deception and cunning, in both knowledge-based matters (in inventing new false principles to defend their capital), and in their behaviour, to try and bring <a href='tags/shaykh-rabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabi</font></a> down and to turn the other Scholars against him through cowardly means, and we will give examples of this including what happened with Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd (rahimahullaah), who was not actually with these people. To see one example in the early 90s of this type of behavior refer to this article:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul><li> <b>The Words of Imaam Ibn Baz</b> Falling on Those (<a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>) Who Lied Upon Him (Safar al-Hawali, <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, <a href='tags/muhammad-saeed-al-qahtani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad Sa'eed al-Qahtani</font></a>, <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a>, Abdur-Razzaq ash-Shayijee): Callers of Falsehood and Stirrers of the Murky Waters - (<a href=index088b.html?qvrrm>see here</a>)</ul></div>    <P>
And that specific behavior that you see in that article above is the same type of behavior that has continued over the two decades since this all came out in the open after the first Gulf War in 1990.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Rabi Vindicated</font>    <P>
Now, by the end of the decade (2000CE), the major Scholars and at the head of them, the three great giants, Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a>, Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a>, and Imaam al-Albani, the remainder of the Salaf in our times, had praised, commended and vindicated <a href='tags/shaykh-rabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabi</font></a> in his Jihad against the Innovators, in each and every single issue, in his corroboration of the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah (<a href=index01b7.html?ebhen>see here</a>), his refutation of the mistakes and innovations of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> (see <a href=indexb09a.html?epluy>here</a>, <a href=index74f3.html?oplui>here</a>), his corroboration that Islaam only knows one Jamaa'ah, not tens of them, and in his defence of the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> from the bid'ahs of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Jabariyyah and others (see <a href=indexa0fc.html?iosjk>here</a>, <a href=index2156.html?jufol>here</a> and <a href=index64ec.html?fufhr>here</a>), and we can document much more but we don't want to lengthen the affair here.    <P>
So these people became more resentful and hateful and then continued with every guile and deception to carry on the objectives that their figureheads had failed miserably to complete, walhamdulillaah.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Coming to the Issue</font>    <P>
This now brings us to this particular issue and the documenting of another instance of the talbees of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>, which is their use of a statement by Shaykh Abdul-Aziz Aal ash-Shaykh that was elicited through a loaded question, but which alhamdulillaah, did not benefit these people in any way whatsoever.    <P>
The point however, in this article, is for you to understand <u>the nature of the talbis and what actually is going on here</u>. Now, after we have explained all of the above, and looking at all of the writings of <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> for which these people have shown enmity towards him, you would think these people are going to bring some strong usoolee stuff, some evidences and proofs, right? And you would think that they would have refuted each of those books, in detail by now right? And you would be thinking that for them to show such rage and hatred, then there must be some extremely strong usoolee types of issues they've got in their pockets to bring out.    <P>
Well, sorry to disappoint you, but this is what they came up with - and it never came from themselves, you see, as they are spiteful, resentful individuals, they've just been going to the Haddaadee Arabic websites looking for "dirt" so to speak with which they can confuse a Western audience - so here is what they came with:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Saying of the Muftee, Shaykh Abdul-Aziz Aal ash-Shaykh</font>    <P>
Some general advice the Muftee, Shaykh Abdul-Aziz Aal ash-Shaykh gave on 15/11/1427H in response to a (loaded) question over the telephone broadcast on television, and here is the question:    <P>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="mp3player.swf" width="200" height="20"><param name="movie" value="mp3player.swf" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/assets/audio/muftee-question-rabee.mp3&amp;showvolume=1&amp;loadingcolor=ff75ff" /></object>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Questioner:</b> "O Shaykh there is a group, who claim Salafiyyah...</blockquote>    <P>
Note that this "group" he is talking about are those who are upon what Imaam al-Albaani, Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> and Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a> were upon - as we have corroborated elsewhere - of having convicted the likes of Safar and Salman of calling to a "<i><a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a></i>" and being "<i>Khaarijiyyah  Asriyyah</i>", and the likes - and you can see this is clearly a loaded question through what comes next.     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... and they revile the Du'aat and the Mashaayikh ... and they revile Shaykh <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a>, and they revile Shaykh <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, and some of them say that they are astray, leading others astray..." <b>Presenter:</b> [interjecting] "You request some advice..." <b>Questioner:</b> "Yes some advice for them..."  Immediately, <b>the Muftee</b> begins to answer: "O my brothers ...", then the questioner drops in at the very end (after the Shaykh has commenced his speech) "...most of them are the students of Shaykh <a href='tags/rabi-al-madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rabi al-<a href="tags/madkhali.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Madkhali</font></a></font></a>..." </blockquote>    <P>
Note in the recording that as the Muftee was commencing his advice, the questioner dropped in his statement "...most of them are the students of Shaykh <a href='tags/rabi-al-madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rabi al-<a href="tags/madkhali.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Madkhali</font></a></font></a>...". The Muftee advised the questioner at the beginning that these types of things ought not to be brought out openly but can be resolved in other ways without publicizing them to the people in this manner.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Muftee: My brothers, I hope we fear Allaah with respect to ourselves, and that we do not publicize these types of affairs, when we know of their existence, we strive to rectify them, as for making them publicizing them and making them open, then this is not befitting...</blockquote>    <P>
After this, the Shaykh gives a general naseehah (advice) which is not directed at anyone in particular, but is a general naseehah to everyone, and if you actually reflect upon the advice of the Shaykh, it is actually <u>against them</u>, not for them - refer to <a href=index3c3b.html?vckiw>Part 2 of this article</a> for that.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b> The point being here, that bringing this saying of the Muftee, Shaykh Abdul-Aziz,is an example of "<i>their knowledge-based response</i>" to the sum of what <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> bin Haadee wrote less than 20 years ago and what he continues to write in defence of the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and manhaj against the <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i> of the Ikhwan, and to the sum of what is found in the sayings, clarifications of the Major Scholars regarding the issues of Qutb's books, his <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Ummah, his deviations in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, regarding the jamaa'aat such as ikhwaan and so on. So as you can see, their pockets are empty and these people are as cheap as you can get.</b></div>    <P>
As for the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> mentioned by the questioner, (al-Qarnee, al-Awdah etc.) then <u>the Major Scholars</u> already refuted them for their <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Extremism</font></a> and mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Ummah. <b>Shaykh Salih al-Fawzaan</b> refuted the statements of both al-Qarnee and al-Awdah, as found in the book al-Ajwibah al-Mufidah - <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?aorjc>see this article</a>, and also <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?qyrnf>this article</a> for his refutations upon statements of mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>. and <b>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen</b> warned from the cassettes of <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> and from their "<b><a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a></b>" (see   <a href=index33d0.html?tjmrl>here</a>), and <b>Imaam al-Albani</b> called them "<i>Khaarijiyyah Asriyyah</i> (the Khawaarij of the Era)", as is too well known and famous to even mention, and <b>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen</b> and <b>Shaykh al-Fawzaan</b> both corroborate the existence of a "<a href="tags/qutbi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutbi</font></a>" manhaj, and its followers the they both commend and authorize warning from it (see   <a href=index0ec1.html?blaok>here</a>, <a href=index7e0b.html?sxptl>here</a> and <a href=index49f2.html?xwcmm>here</a>) ... and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on. All that is from close to ten years ago.     <P>
So you can see that this is just a cheap attempt by these people to cast aspersions upon the people of knowledge.    <P>
