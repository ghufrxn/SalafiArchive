<img src=assets/images/baraa-ah-cover.gif border=1 align=right border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah Min Tazkiyah Ahl il-Bid'ah wal-Mudhammah</font>    <P>
To the right is the cover for the second edition of "<i>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah Min Tazkiyah Ahl il-Bid'ah wal-Mudhammah</i>" (The Innocence of the Scholars of the Ummah from the Commendation of the People of Innovation and Censure). This book was prepared by Isaam bin Abdullaah as-Sinaanee. It contains a refutation of the one who used the intercession of Shaykh Bin Baaz (rahimahullaah) for <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> as a proof for the 'adaalah (integrity) of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and commendation of his (Qutb's) manhaj, when it is not a proof at all.    <P>
The book, after compilation and authorship was sent to <b>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</b> who checked over it and made recommendations, and also suggested an improvement to the title of the book. Then it was read by <b>Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen</b> (rahimahullaah), who made his own written notes on the pre-print copy that was sent to him, and he also advised that the section titled "The Salafi Manhaj", <u>should be placed before</u> "The Qutubi Manhaj" and not after it, unless the author had a specific reason for doing that. And images of these hand-written notes are included at the end of the book. We will be quoting from this book inshaa'Allaah in this series. <b>Both of these scholars endorsed the contents of this book and the purpose for which it was to be published and distributed</b>. <u>And the purpose is clearly outlined in the title of the book itself</u>. Namely, to declare the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah free and innocent (in particular Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baaz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baaz</font></a>, and the other scholars in general) of having made tazkiyah (i.e. given adaalah) to those who are from the people of innovation: In this case <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, who aside from writing his commentary on the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> upon an <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> creed, added other great calamities, some of which are serious enough that they cannot really be excused by mere ignorance, such as accusing the Scribe of the Prophet (alayhis salaam) the Uncle of the Believers, <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> - whose integrity is attested to by the Prophet himself -  of treachery, deception and hypocrisy.     <P>
<b>And this book essentially <u>sunk their ship</u>, leaving them only <u>the flotsam</u> to hold onto thereafter, which is what they have been doing since then.</b>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> Whilst many of the biased-partisans use the word "<i><a href='tags/madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhali</font></a></i>" as a derogatory phrase to attack one particular Scholar, everyone should realize that <u>this is simply a cover and a veil</u>. Their hatred and resentment goes way beyond just one particular scholar and <u>it is towards the Scholars of the Sunnah in general</u> for the the fact that the majority of them eventually spoke about <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> specifically and the methodologies of al-Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen in general, after the truth became clear to them. The word "<i><a href='tags/madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhali</font></a></i>" is used in a derogatory way that simply represents this hatred, resentment and jealousy. These people don't have a group of scholars that <u>represent</u> the manhaj they are upon. <i>They have isolated statements here and there from some Scholars in isolated issues by which they cause confusion</i>, but certainly they cannot point to a group of known major scholars and say, "<i>Their manhaj in da'wah is the same as our manhaj in da'wah</i>". <b>By the way, Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> who erred in defending <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> against those who refuted him has statements that contain refutations of these people. Be sure about that! Go and read <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?eoizx >this article</a> and <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?srjss >this article</a></b>. So they have no Scholars guiding and leading them in their manhaj. And for this reason, they have to attack the truth with false labels in order to cut off the people from recognizing the overall broad methodologies that all of those scholars are united upon and which differ from the methodologies of the secular atheist Jews and Christians that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and Bannaa innovated into the religion.</div> <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Saalih Aal as-Shaykh on Sayyid Qutb's <a href="tags/ghuluww.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ghuluww</font></a></font>    <P>
Shaykh Saalih Aal ush-Shaykh commented on the <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Extremism</font></a> of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> in making <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the people of sin using the issue of "obedience" and applying it absolutely:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/baraa-ah-saalih-aal-shaykh-1.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And amongst [those matters] is that in the issue of obedience to the Mushrikeen, he did not understand the tafseel of the people of knowledge concerning it. So it is what is understood from his words is that which is in agreement with some of the Extremists (Ghullaat) on the  issue of obedience (taa'ah), that is obedience to the Mushriks. Or obedience to the priests and rabbis (i.e. scholars).     <P>
And from the examples of this is what he has mentioned in Surat ul-An'aam concerning the verse, "<b>And if you were to obey them, you would be Mushriks</b>", so he says many things about this verse.     <P>
And amongst them is the issue of the clothing of the fashion women and models, which are designed by the fashion agencies in Paris - using his (i.e Qutb's) expression. So he says that those who legislate for the women their clothing, such that in the morning they should wear such and such type of clothing, and in the evening this type of clothing and in the night this type of clothing, and at work this type of clothing and so on... <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> says, that this group of people, meaning the fashion designers, that they are gods (aalihah, plural of ilaah) because they have made the haraam to be halaal and so they are obeyed in that, and they made the halaal to be haraam, and so they are obeyed in that. So he (<a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>) says, that the Muslim woman who obeys them in this has taken them as objects of worship (aalihah), because she has obeyed them in making lawful what is unlawful and making unlawful what is lawful.     <P>
And there is no doubt that these words are baatil (false). Because when a woman wears forbidden clothes which have come from the direction of those designers, this does not at the same time mean she has believed that they are lawful (halaal) for her to wear. For the issue of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> is in relation to the belief that this thing that Allaah, the Majestic and Exalted, has made unlawful is actually halaal... So for example, a woman who wears clothing that reveals her bosoms somewhat and her legs, in front of the foreign men, following the fashion designers in this, then if she believes that this act is haraam, yet she is overcome and her eemaan is weak, then this is not kufr and she has not worshipped them. So he (<a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>) has made <u>mere obedience</u> to be kufr, and some of the Jamaa'at have adopted this saying from him, those who have exaggerated in the issue of ruling by other than what Allaah has revealed, (they have taken from him) in the issue of obedience, that is obedience to the fashion designers and the promoters...</blockquote>    <P>
