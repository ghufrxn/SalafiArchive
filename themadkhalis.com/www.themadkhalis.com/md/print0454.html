<img src=assets/images/baraa-ah-cover.gif border=1 align=right border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah Min Tazkiyah Ahl il-Bid'ah wal-Mudhammah</font>    <P>
To the right is the cover for the second edition of "<i>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah Min Tazkiyah Ahl il-Bid'ah wal-Mudhammah</i>" (The Innocence of the Scholars of the Ummah from the Commendation of the People of Innovation and Censure). This book was prepared by Isaam bin Abdullaah as-Sinaanee. It contains a refutation of the one who used the intercession of Shaykh Bin Baaz (rahimahullaah) for <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> as a proof for the 'adaalah (integrity) of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and commendation of his (Qutb's) manhaj, when it is not a proof at all.    <P>
The book, after compilation and authorship was sent to <b>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</b> who checked over it and made recommendations, and also suggested an improvement to the title of the book. Then it was read by <b>Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen</b> (rahimahullaah), who made his own written notes on the pre-print copy that was sent to him, and he also advised that the section titled "The Salafi Manhaj", <u>should be placed before</u> "The Qutubi Manhaj" and not after it, unless the author had a specific reason for doing that. And images of these hand-written notes are included at the end of the book. We will be quoting from this book inshaa'Allaah in this series. <b>Both of these scholars endorsed the contents of this book and the purpose for which it was to be published and distributed</b>. <u>And the purpose is clearly outlined in the title of the book itself</u>. Namely, to declare the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah free and innocent (in particular Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baaz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baaz</font></a>, and the other scholars in general) of having made tazkiyah (i.e. given adaalah) to those who are from the people of innovation: In this case <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, who aside from writing his commentary on the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> upon an <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> creed, added other great calamities, some of which are serious enough that they cannot really be excused by mere ignorance, such as accusing the Scribe of the Prophet (alayhis salaam) the Uncle of the Believers, <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> - whose integrity is attested to by the Prophet himself -  of treachery, deception and hypocrisy.     <P>
<b>And this book essentially <u>sunk their ship</u>, leaving them only <u>the flotsam</u> to hold onto thereafter, which is what they have been doing since then.</b>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> Whilst many of the biased-partisans use the word "<i><a href='tags/madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhali</font></a></i>" as a derogatory phrase to attack one particular Scholar, everyone should realize that <u>this is simply a cover and a veil</u>. Their hatred and resentment goes way beyond just one particular scholar and <u>it is towards the Scholars of the Sunnah in general</u> for the the fact that the majority of them eventually spoke about <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> specifically and the methodologies of al-Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen in general, after the truth became clear to them. The word "<i><a href='tags/madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhali</font></a></i>" is used in a derogatory way that simply represents this hatred, resentment and jealousy. These people don't have a group of scholars that <u>represent</u> the manhaj they are upon. <i>They have isolated statements here and there from some Scholars in isolated issues by which they cause confusion</i>, but certainly they cannot point to a group of known major scholars and say, "<i>Their manhaj in da'wah is the same as our manhaj in da'wah</i>". <b>By the way, Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> who erred in defending <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> against those who refuted him has statements that contain refutations of these people. Be sure about that! Go and read <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?eoizx >this article</a> and <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?srjss >this article</a></b>. So they have no Scholars guiding and leading them in their manhaj. And for this reason, they have to attack the truth with false labels in order to cut off the people from recognizing the overall broad methodologies that all of those scholars are united upon and which differ from the methodologies of the secular atheist Jews and Christians that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and Bannaa innovated into the religion.</div> <P>

In the book "<i>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah</i>" - (this is the book that sunk the flag-ship "<i>the Qutbiyyah</i>", <a href=index74f3.html?oplui >learn more about it here</a>) - there is the statement of Shaykh Muhammad bin <a href='tags/jameel-zainoo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jameel Zainoo</font></a>, author of numerous beneficial works on the subject of <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, in which there occurs:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/zainoo-mohammad-qutb-wahdat-ul-wujood.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Shaykh Jameel said [in one of his printed works], under the title "Wahdat ul-Wujood in az-Zilaal":    <P>
1. I used to be very fond of Zilaal al-Qur'an of its author, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, and when I read it I found <u>[the doctrine] of Wahdat ul-Wujood</u> in Surah al-Hadid and Surah al-Ikhlas along with other errors which contradict the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of Islaam, such as his saying about the tafsir of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> which occurs in numerous verses: "A (figurative) allusion for control, dominion", and this is opposed to the tafsir which occurs in al-Bukhari['s] [Sahih], from Mujahid, from Abu al-Aaliyah, regarding His saying, "<b>He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He '<i>istawaa</i>' towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything</b>." (Al-Baqarah 2:29) - Mujahid and Abu al-Aaliyah said: (<span class='arb'>&#1593;&#1604;&#1575; &#1608;&#1575;&#1585;&#1578;&#1601;&#1593;</span>) "<b>He rose and ascended</b>". See Kitab at-Tawhid, 8th Volume.    <P>
2. I mentioned that to his brother, <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, and I said to him: "Comment on the speech of your brother in az-Zilal". He said to me: My brother will bear the responsibility of his own speech".     <P>
And after some years one of the publishing houses requested from me that they [acquire the right to] distribute my new book, "<i>The Testimony That None Has the Right To Be Worshipped Except Allaah and Muhammad Is the Messenger of Allaah</i>", [and in which] I mentioned <u>[the doctrine of] wahdat ul-wujood</u> present with the Sufis from amongst the nawaaqid (nullifiers) of the two testimonials (of faith). And I read in the book "<i>Laa ilaaha illallaah, in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, Sharee'ah, Manhaj and Life</i>" by its author, <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, in which he mentioned the nullifiers of [the testification] "Laa ilaaha illallaah", but he did not mention <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a>. So I contacted him over the phone, and said to him:     <P>
<blockquote>You are the mushrif (director, supervisor) of the print by [Dar] ash-Shurooq (the publishing house) of "Fee <a href='tags/zilal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Zilal</font></a> il-Qur'an". I ask you to make comment in the margin, fulfilling the command of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), who said, "<i>Whoever amongst you sees an evil amongst you, then let him change it with his hand, and if he is not able, then with his tongue, and if he is not able, to [dislike it] with his heart, and that is the weakest of faith</i>". And you are able to change it with [both] your tongue and your pen.</blockquote>     <P>
So he said to me: "Thanks to Allaah for your effort", so I thanked him [for him obliging] and I requested him [to send me] a copy [of az-Zilal] in which he [said he would] put his commentary upon [the doctrine] of <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a>, and I ask Allaah to grant him success in doing that.</blockquote>    <P>
Then in the footnote, the compiler of the book "al-Baraa'ah", Isaam bin Abdullaah as-Sinaanee, writes:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Its compiler says: And I bear witness that around the year 1406H I witnessed a lecture of <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> in the residence of the students in the University of King Saud in Riyaadh. A question was put to him, asking him to comment upon the errors his brother, and he promised with good i.e. obliged). And we have now entered into the year 1420H, and he has not done anything.</blockquote>    <P>
