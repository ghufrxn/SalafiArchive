Following the <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Extremism</font></a> of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, the likes of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq and others innovated a new category for Tawheed, called "<i>Tawheed al-Haakimiyyah</i>", and this was simply a stratagem through which the doctrines of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> could be made palatable to a Salafi audience. When they started to propagandize for Sayyid Qutb's exaggerated doctrine of "al-Haakimiyyah", Ahl us-Sunnah took the issue to the Major Scholars. The verdicts of the Scholars started to appear from around 1996-1997, and prior to this time, many speakers in the West were propagandizing for this "fourth" category of Tawheed and explicitly stating it to be an independent fourth category of Tawheed. Ali al-Timimi was one of the movers and shakers in this regard and in 1996, he said in his theatrical performance:    <P>

<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Now somebody might ask, <b>of the four types of Tawhid</b> that they mentioned, <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> ur-Ruboobiyyah, <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> ul-Ibaadah, <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> ul-Asmaa' was-Sifaat and <a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a>, why did they pay so much attention to <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> ul-Haakimiyyah. What's the secret behind this. The secret behind this is because those who have falsely attributed these ideas to Salafiyyah have tried to argue that <a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a> is not from <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, and that to state <a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a>, <b>some of them have said that this is a bid'ah</b> and some of them have said that this should be reduced to the principles of fiqh.</blockquote>    <P>
Here, Ali al-Timimi was commenting on a small treatise written by some Kuwaitis in which certain issues and their importance were being highlighted. Now, you have to understand what is going on here, and let us illustrate.     <P>
<blockquote>A Tablighi in <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> can write a treatise in which he brings evidences for and emphasizes the importance of the kalimah, khushoo' in the prayer, knowledge and remembrance, honouring the Muslims, being sincere in one's intentions, and going out and striving in the path of Allaah, providing evidence for each issue from the texts and sayings of the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah. He can then take it to a Shaykh and say, "What do you say about this advice" and any Shaykh will say, "This is great advice, it contains benefit for the Muslims". Then the Tablighi can go and explain those generalized subjects upon his particular innovation and call to his innovation through this by claiming that the Shaykh supports him in both the general and specific details of what he is calling to.</blockquote>     <P>
And what Ali al-Timimi was reading from was precisely this, a generalized advice which no two Muslims would disagree upon. There is no mention of the label "<i><a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a></i>" in the tract he was reading from, but just quotations from the Scholars, like Imaam ash-Shanqiti, and Shaykh Ibn Ibraaheem, emphasizing the importance of ruling by what Allaah has revealed, and its being a part of Tawheed. With the audience unawares, he brought his own speech with certain particulars, and the audience left with the understanding, "<i>Hey <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> speaks with <a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a>, as a separate category of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and so do those other scholars</i>". And of course, Ali al-Timimi was explaining these generalized points (which no two Muslims would disagree over in their generality), <u>upon the methodologies of al-Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen</u>, upon the doctrines and methodologies of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and Hassan al-Banna, which came to him from the likes of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq and others. The proof for this is extensive and firmly established and will be dealt with elsewhere, as we cannot digress here. However, it is important that the reader understand the context and what was going on here. The <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> (see <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?jqpkg //>here</a>, <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?hulwt >here</a>, <a href=index49f2.html?xwcmm >here</a>, <a href=index7e0b.html?sxptl >here</a> and <a href=index0ec1.html?blaok >here</a>) were responded to by the Scholars in the following verdicts:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul><li> <b>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</b>: Isolating <a href='tags/haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haakimiyyah</font></a> As a Separate Category of Tawheed Comes From a 20th Century Ignoramus - (<a href=indexf9e0.html?nspvn>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Shaykh al-Albaani</b> on <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> al-Haakimiyyah: A Political Tool Used to Make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Rulers - (<a href=indexebe5.html?tjxlr>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen</b>: <a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a> As a Fourth Category Is the Saying of an Ignorant Strayer - (<a href=index5fb6.html?pmcwq>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen</b>: <a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a> As a Fourth Category Comes from an Ignorant Mubtadi' - (<a href=index6f86.html?prtli>see here</a>)  <li> <b><a href='tags/shaykh-abdul-aziz-bin-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Abdul-Aziz Bin Baz</font></a></b>: The Categories of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> are Not Four In Number, They Are Three - (<a href=index1b08.html?ucvlc>see here</a>)</ul></div>    <P>
When the Major Scholars<b> declared such people to be Innovators</b>, they quickly <u>retreated</u> to teaching just "two categories" of Tawheed <u>and denied</u> ever having even spoken of a fourth category of Tawheed called "<i>Tawheed al-Haakimiyyah</i>". This is why the more shrewd amongst the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> made a hasty retreat and backed off, even if some of them continued their deception by trying to use the issue of Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> writing an introduction for a book of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq in which the latter makes reference to "Tawheed al-Hukm", as justification for their innovation of making "<i><a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a></i>" into <u>an independent fourth category</u>. There is a difference between speaking of a certain notion and its importance (i.e. you could emphasize the importance of tawheed udh-dhabh, tawheed al-isti'aanah), and dedicating a few pages to it, and between making it <u>an independent fourth category of Tawheed in addition to the three agreed upon by ijmaa' which comprise every aspect of Tawheed already</u>. But this was just one of many types of deceptions of these people which will be covered elsewhere.  <P>

This is from an discussion recorded on audio.<BR>  <a href=assets/audio/fawzaan-haakimiyyah.ram>Download the Realaudio File here</a>    <P>
Questioner 1:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There is someone who has made a fourth category for Tawheed and called it Tawheed al-Haakimiyyah</blockquote>    <P>
Shaikh Fawzaan:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>[interjecting]... This is misguidance..., this is misguidance. This is misguidance and an [unnecessary] addition, which the people of knowledge have not affirmed. Tawheed is but two or three categories... this is contradictory, one person says Tawheed is only one category and another says it is four categories. All of this is misguidance.</blockquote>    <P>
Questioner 1:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This person's evidence is that the basis for this categorisation...</blockquote>    <P>
Shaikh Fawzaan:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>[interjecting]... [words unclear].. Tawheed ul-Haakimiyyah an independent category and it does not enter into Tawheed ul-Uloohiyyah? It enters into Tawheed ul-Uloohiyyah! It is a type of worship and is a type of devotion to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</blockquote>    <P>
Questioner 2:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He says that these three categorisations, al-Uloohiyyah, ar-Ruboobiyyah and al-Asmaa was-Sifaat, he says that this is a matter which is arrived at by the ijtihaad of the scholars, or by way of investigation and analysis (istiqraa').</blockquote>    <P>
Shaikh Fawzaan:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>That is sufficient for us, we will not add to what they have unanimously agreed upon, and they agree upon this.. <b>[then] there comes an ignoramus in the twentieth century... he says 'I am a Mujtahid and I will add to what the People of Knowledge have agreed upon'. This is misguidance</b>...</blockquote>    <P>
Questioner 2:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>[interjecting]...</blockquote>    <P>
Shaikh Fawzaan:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This is clear error! Because al-Haakimiyyah enters into Tawheed ul-Uloohiyyah. Who has made it another category or made it an independent category? Will he make the prayer into a fifth or sixth category and jihaad a seventh category? [Because] all of the types of worship are from the types of Tawheed? This is not correct...</blockquote>    <P>
Questioner 2:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So this is an innovated saying, this saying [Tawheed ul-Haakimiyyah]?</blockquote>    <P>
Shaikh Fawzaan:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Yes, there is no doubt in this, it is in opposition to the Ijmaa [of Ahl us-Sunnah]. None of the people of knowledge have ever spoken with it. It is in opposition to the Ijmaa.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Reasons for the Exaggeration in al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font>    <P>
All of this came from the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>, those affected with the teachings of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, and they tried to bring this evil da'wah and evil manhaj into the ranks of the Salafis through the 80s and 90s. They took their opportunity especially after the first Gulf War in 1990. A great deal of turmoil was caused during the course of this decade as a result of these people who were really toying with the Kharijite doctrines of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>. They were the likes of <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a>, <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, <a href='tags/abdur-rahmaan-abdul-khaaliq.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq</font></a>, Adnaan Ar'oor, <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a>, Muhammad al-Maghrawi and many others, and the Major scholars convicted their statements of being tantamount to mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and calls for revolutions (along the lines of what <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> proposed as part of his ideology). Here are some articles on Qutb's revival of the madhhab of the Khawaarij, albeit with a Leninist <a href=index74ea.html?rhmeq >mix</a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul>  <li> <b>Fareed Abdul-Khaliq</b> (Former Murshid of Ikhwaan): The Emergence of the Doctrines of Jaahliyyah, <a href='tags/haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haakimiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of All Societies - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?pmjvl>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Yusuf al-Qaradawi</b>: Groups Known as 'the Qutbiyyoon' Found in Various Places Harboring the Doctrines of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> Found in az-Zilaal - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?hulwt>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Ali Juraisha</b> (Major Ikhwaani Figurehead): Emergence of the <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> Who Made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of Whole Societies - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?vdeiu>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Fareed Abdul-Khaliq</b> (Former Murshid of Ikhwaan): The Origins of Mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of Muslim Societies Lie In the Books of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?ezjol>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Yusuf al-Qaradawi</b>: The <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of All Societies and Announcement of Destructive Revolutions In the Final Works of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?wmagi>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Yusuf al-Qaradawi</b>: The New 'Qutbi' Understanding of Tawheed - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?jqpkg>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Yusuf al-Qaradawi</b> on Sayyid Qutb: All Muslims Are Apostates (Kuffaar, Mushrikeen) Except Those Who Agree With My Ideology and Join My Group - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?lyhev>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Yusuf al-Qaradawi</b>: <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> Makes it Explicitly Clear That All Muslims Today Are Disbelievers - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?xbnsa>see here</a>)  </ul></div>    <P>
However, by the year 2000 and just shortly after, the deviations of these people (neo-Qutbiyyah) had been convicted through <u>the hundreds of statements of the major Scholars</u> that crossed a wide range of issues of methodology, and which <u>laid down a clear criterion between the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, da'wah and manhaj and the Ikhwaani da'wah and manhaj</u>, in its two strains of <b>Bannaa'iyyah</b> and <b><a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a></b>. Bannaa'iyyah is to try and establish a khilaafah through involvement in political processes (by hook or by crook) within the existing secular political framework, and <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> is to establish a khilaafah through the manifestos of secular atheist Jews, such as Vladimir Lenin, by staging violent revolutions, to smash and destroy all current structures and to replace them with the khilaafah. All activist movements of the twentieth century derived their methodologies from these two strains of thought.    <P>
And these methodologies are in opposition to the methodologies of the Prophets and of the righteous Salaf of this Ummah in rectifying the servant and the land. <a href=index0ec1.html?blaok >See here for a comparison</a>.     <P>
