<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Concerning the Behaviour of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> Towards the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/shipwreck-qutbiyyah.gif border=1 hspace=8 vspace=6 align=right border=0>We see today the drowning <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> - their flag-ship vessel "<i>the Qutbiyyah</i>" washed ashore, she is battered and in ruins - unable to explain why they were unable for the past 15 years to show sincerity of purpose to Allaah and His deen in rushing to defend the honours of <a href='tags/moses.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Moses</font></a> (alayhis salaam), Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu), Mu'aawiyah (radiallaahu anhu) Abu Sufyaan (radiallaahu anhu), <a href='tags/hind.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hind</font></a> (radiallaahu anhaa), the Bani Umayyah and others, but instead they spent from their wealth and made such effort that would have conquered the mountains, seas and oceans, for the sake of an individual who <u>reviled and abused</u> some of those mentioned and <u>made takfir</u> of others amongst them!     <P>
With the <i>hawaan </i>and <i>dhull </i>(ignominy, humiliation, disgrace) they invited upon themselves through these actions of theirs, today, we see these people left with no refuge except to bark at the people of the Sunnah:     <P>
<blockquote><i>So, are you saying <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> was a kaafir then! Go on say it, stop messing around, was he a kaafir or not?!!  Just say it! Why are you holding back! Please, now, say it. I beg you! Go on, say he was a kaafir, I'm desperate now, and I'll even beg you. You see I'm feeling a little vulnerable and exposed now and if you make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of him, then being a good little coward, I can then run with it to the world. Please?! You see I'm sat here behind my keyboard and I'm really cringing and biting at my fingers, please relieve my of my agony and distress. Just say "kaafir"!</i>.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>To understand what these defeated, humiliated, thrown-in-the-ditch, chained and subjugated losers <u>are actually up to</u> we need to take a lesson from history. Here is an incident that took place over twenty years ago, between Imaam al-Albaani (rahimahullaah) and Abdullaah Azzaam.</b></div>    <P>
As a little background, Imaam al-Albaani, <u>the Imaam of Hadeet</u>h - whose word is taken with acceptance in the entire dunyaa regarding the sayings of Allaah's Messenger (alayhis salaam), and what an honourable position of <b>trustworthiness and veracity</b> it is for it to be said (<span class='arb'>&#1589;&#1581;&#1581;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1604;&#1576;&#1575;&#1606;&#1610;</span>) - was the subject of <b>an organization-wide boycott</b> by al-Ikhwaan al-Mufliseen, and they warned against his da'wah (the Rabbaanee, Prophetic da'wah, in which there is wisdom and intellect) and also ordered the boycott of anyone who subscribes to the da'wah of the Shaykh - all because Shaykh al-Albaani pointed out the doctrine of <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a> in the statements of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Quick Sidenote:</b>    <P>
A number of the scholars confirm that what they find in the writings of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> does not leave leave a person except with the understanding that he is expressing and speaking with <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a>. From them <u>Shaykh al-Albaanee</u>, and also from them <u>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen</u>. And also <u>Shaykh Abdullaah ad-Dawaish</u>, <u><a href='tags/shaykh-muhammad-amaan-al-jaamee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Muhammad Amaan al-Jaamee</font></a></u>, <u>Shaykh Saalih Aal ash-Shaykh</u>.    <P>
And also <u>Shaykh Muhammad bin Jameel Zainoo</u> who pointed out the presence of the doctrine of <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a> in Qutb's early poetical writings, and pestered  Qutb's brother, <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, on many occasions to clarify this mistake of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, to put it in writing, and add clarifications to the printed works that get distributed. But despite promising to do so, <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> never fulfilled his promise, even after more than a decade passing by. This will be dealt with in another article inshaa'Allaah.</div>    <P>
Abdullaah Azzaam, although previously attending the lessons, <u>acted upon this boycott and never showed up anymore</u>. The Shaykh provides more details on the matter in what follows below. He had pointed out that it is not possible to understand from the writings of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> in certain parts in "<i><a href='tags/az-zilal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>az-<a href="tags/zilal.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Zilal</font></a></font></a></i>" except that he speaks with <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a>. Within this context, we'll let the Shaykh carry on with the details through a recording of his in the cassette "<i>Mafaaheem Yajib an Tusahhah</i>".    <P>
In the book "<i>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah</i>" (<a href=index74f3.html?oplui >see here</a>), there occurs the following in relation to Imaam al-Albani (rahimahullaah) and this incident (see pages 34-36 2nd edition).     <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Explanation of What Appears Above</font>    <P>
This is a summary of what is above with much of it being a verbatim translation, in any case the original sources are there (audio and text) for you to refer to and read directly:    <P>
<blockquote>Shaykh al-Albani mentions how seven or eight years prior (to the date of the cassette recording) al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen issued <u>an organization-wide boycott against al-Albani</u> and his lessons and against anyone who ascribed to his da'wah.    <P>
Abdullaah Azzaam despite being an eager attendant, acted upon the boycott and <u>did not attend the Shaykh's lessons any more</u>, at all.    <P>
Shaykh al-Albani met Abdullaah Azzaam at Masjid Suhayb, whilst departing from the prayer, the Shaykh gave him salaam, and Abdullaah Azzaam replied back with some element of shame (hayaa), because he did not want to break the order of the boycott. The Shaykh said to him "Is this what Islam orders you?" to which Azzaam replied, "The clouds of summer will soon be dispersed".    <P>
The Shaykh then said that after some days had passed, Azzaam came to visit him at his house, but did not find him there. So he then began to ask around and finally found out that the Shaykh was in his son-in-law's house, Nidhaam. Finally reaching the Shaykh a discusion ensued.    <P>
The Shaykh said to him, "What is the meaning of this boycott?". To which Azzaam replied, "You made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> (declared a kaafir) upon Sayyid Qutb". The Shaykh said to him, "Where did I make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of him", and Azzaam said, "Because you say <u>he affirmes the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of wahdat ul-wujood</u> in the tafsir of, firstly, Surah al-Hadid, and secondly, in "Qul huwallaahu ahad".    <P>
The Shaykh continues and affirms that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> quoted the speech of the Soofees and that:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>It is not possible except for it to be understood that he speaks with <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a>, but that from our principle is - and you (Azzaam) are the most knowledgeable of people regarding that because you attend my gatherings - that we do not make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of a person who fell into kufr except after the establishment of the proof. So how can you announce this boycott whilst I am present right amongst you.</blockquote>    <P>
The Shaykh mentions that they could have sent a person to investigate whether it is true that he makes <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>. The Shaykh also mentions that on that same day, a brother, called Alee as-Sataree, also was present with Azzaam, and that he (the Shaykh) said to him, "Sayyid <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> says such and such in surah such and such" and Alee as-Sataree <u>diverted to another area of discussion</u> saying that the man (<a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>) believes in Allaah, and the Messenger and in <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and so on. The Shaykh said that "We said to him, O Brother, we do not reject the truth that he says but we reject this baatil that he said".    <P>
The Shaykh then goes on to say - <b>and this is the crux of the matter and the main point of this article of ours</b> - that despite this gathering, Abdullaah Azzaam, later went on to spread two or three successive magazine articles in the Ikhwani magazine "<i>al-Mujtama'</i>" in Kuwait, with a big bold title, "<b>Shaykh al-Albani makes <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of Sayyid Qutb</b>".    <P>
The Shaykh says the story is a long one, but the important point that the Shaykh wishes to draw from this is that,     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The one who takes (from this) that al-Albani makes <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> is just like the one who takes (and goes with the saying) that <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a> praised <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> in a specific place. These people are people of desires my brother! We have no way of standing in their path except that we supplicate to Allaah for them alone. "<b>Will you then compel the people until they become believers?</b>" (Yunus 10:99)</blockquote>  </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Moral of the Above</font>    <P>
When you see prominent figureheads like Abdullaah Azzaam prepared to slander scholars like Imaam al-Albani, and choose hizbiyyah and party-spirit in boycotting others, in opposition to what Islam requires of Muslims, then it is not surprising one little iota that you see the minions displaying the same behavior like for like, craving to get an explicit statement of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, which they can run with to the whole world. Dishonesty and deception is written all over their actions, yet they are so blind to it!    <P>
    <P>
   <P>
