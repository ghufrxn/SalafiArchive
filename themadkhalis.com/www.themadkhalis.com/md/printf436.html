<div class='sidebar'>  In this article we have a number of different issues to address and they can be summarized as follows:    <P>
<ul><li> <b><a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></b> and <b>Nawab Safawi al-Shi'iyy</b> - two characters with parallel lives - both agitated (Leninist) revolutionaries harboring the poison of rafd and contempt of <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> (radiallaahu anhu) and the Bani Umayyah. Both these Raafidees considered Mu'awiyyah and Bani Umayyah to be kafirs.    <P>
<li> Two of the contemporary <a href='tags/ghulaat-al-murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghulaat al-<a href="tags/murjiah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Murji'ah</font></a></font></a> who - <u>practically speaking</u> - implement the <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a> of Jahm bin Safwan and the Ash'arites in their behaviour, even if they may protest against it by the tongue and pen. The actions of these astray liars over the past ten years (at least) indicates - without any shadow of doubt - that <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> al-Rafidee  holds more worth in their hearts and eyes than Uthmaan (radiallahu anhu), <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> (radiallaahu anhu) and that Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu), Mu'aawiyah (and his parents and the Banu Umayyah), their honour, worth and status are more insignificant to them than that of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>. A person will only come to this realization as a matter of fact after surveying the activities of these people since the late 1990s right until this day of ours. To gain some background into this, we suggest you read the most popular article on this website which is this one here: <b>A Picture Paints (Characterizes) a Thousand Qutbis:</b> <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/abu-ala-mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu A'la <a href="tags/mawdudi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mawdudi</font></a></font></a>, the <a href='tags/rafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rafidah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/iranian-revolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Iranian Revolution</font></a> (<a href=indexc150.html?oyama>read here</a>).    <P>
<li> The claim that <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> recanted from his <a href='tags/takfeer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfeer</font></a> of <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, Abu Sufyaan, <a href='tags/hind.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hind</font></a> and the Bani Umayyah and his revilements upon Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu).</ul>    <P>
We shall take these three issue up in this article inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Introducing the Agitated Leninist Revolutionaries <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> al-Raafidee and <a href='tags/nawab-safawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nawab Safawi</font></a> al-Shi'iyy.</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qutb-safawi.jpg align="right" style="margin:8px 0px 8px 15px;" border=1 border=0> To the right is a picture from 1953 of two Rafidi Innovators and deviants. The first is <b><a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></b>. He was poisoned by Western, European materialist philosophies in the early part of his life, and in particular <a href='tags/socialism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Socialism</font></a> and <a href='tags/communism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Communism</font></a>, and this ideological nurturing carried through into his Islamic days when he started writing his manhaj of the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a> and the Khawaarij in his books, from the earliest ones (late 40s early 50s) to the hardcore Kharijite books in the 60s. The Shaykh, <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> refuted this <a href=indexd945.html?pfwuf>Rafidi Khabeeth</a> in 1952 when a written battle took place in Egyptian newspaper columns between Shakir and <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>. We have documented some of that in other articles in more detail (<a href=series/sayyid-qutb-and-the-aqidah-of-the-rafidah-in-reviling-and-abusing-the-companions.html>see this series</a>). <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of some of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> and belittled Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu) upon <u>an ideological conviction</u> and not <u>a mere slip of the tongue</u>. That ideological conviction was a Marxist, Communist notion of <a href='tags/social-justice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Social Justice</font></a> and <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> evaluated early Islamic history upon those ideas (<a href=indexbee3.html?dsppw>see here</a>), leading him into his Rafidee poison, which <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> aptly described as the "<i>malice of the idolatrous western civilisation manifesting explosively in the heart of one claiming da'wah</i>". Out of resentment <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> altered some of the wordings he used in some of his books. The written record and Qutb's response to Shakir proved that he resented being corrected and he never removed the ideological conviction from his books which he published (in numerous editions) <u>right until the end of his life</u>. In fact, it was not possible for him to remove the ideological conviction since his books were actually founded upon it in the first place, which means that he could never really retract from reviling those Companions. At the end of the article, inshaa'Allaah, we will lay to waste the claim that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> recanted through a few simple observations.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> have tried bending over <u>backwards</u>, <u>forwards</u> and <u>sideways</u> to try, vainly, to prove that <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> made tawbah from his <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of some of the Sahabah and belittlement of others amongst them. We have addressed some of these vain attempts by the <a href='tags/ghulaat-al-murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghulaat al-<a href="tags/murjiah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Murji'ah</font></a></font></a> in these articlels (see   <a href=indexc226.html?kjxfr>here</a>,  <a href=indexa2d2.html?fhmqo>here</a>,  <a href=indexb1fe.html?alkbq>here</a> and  <a href=index001c.html?pcihb>here</a>). Two drowning <a href='tags/qutbis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbis</font></a> involved in these vain activities are Abu Zubayr <a href='tags/saleem-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saleem Begg</font></a> (London, UK) and Abu Fatimah <a href='tags/salman-awan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman Awan</font></a> (Mobile, Alabama) - both of these envious and hate-filled <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> spent time in Makkah (Salman Awan is still there) where they often huddled under the wings of that kadhdhaab <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> from whom they learnet <u>the art and science of practical irjaa'</u> that we alluded to earlier (see further below for a detailed treatment of it).  </div>    <P>
The second heretic in the picture is <b>Nawab Safawi al-Shi'iyy</b>. He was a revolutionary who was trying to ferment a revolution against the Shah of Iran and was a leading member of the <i>Fedayeene Islami</i> (a revolutionary group like Sayyid Qutb's Ikhwan) and was involved in assassinations. Like his friend, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, he was imprisoned numerous times for his activities. <a href='tags/nawab-safawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nawab Safawi</font></a> was also an associate and ally of Ayatullah <a href='tags/khomeini.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Khomeini</font></a> who later led the Iranian revolutoin in 1979. It is also interesting to note that the concept of <a href='tags/jaahiliyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jaahiliyyah</font></a> (all modern societies are disbelieving societies) was common between <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a>, <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and Safawi and upon this ideology rested their revolutionary methodologies.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/nawab-safawi.jpg align="right" width="200" style="margin:8px 0px 8px 10px;" border=1 border=0>In 1955 <a href='tags/nawab-safawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nawab Safawi</font></a> was involved in an assassination attempt upon Hussain Alaa, the Chief of Ministers, and he was subsequently given the judgement of execution along with three others. The Ikhwan al-Muslimeen in <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> were part of a group that tried to convince the government of the Shah to excuse him from execution, but this was not granted and <a href='tags/nawab-safawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nawab Safawi</font></a> was executed in 1956. <a href=http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/نواب_صفوي>See this resource</a>.     <P>
A statement related from <a href='tags/nawab-safawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nawab Safawi</font></a> is: (<span class='arb'>&#1605;&#1606; &#1571;&#1585;&#1575;&#1583; &#1571;&#1606; &#1610;&#1603;&#1608;&#1606; &#1580;&#1593;&#1601;&#1585;&#1610;&#1575;&#1611; &#1581;&#1602;&#1610;&#1602;&#1610;&#1575;&#1611; &#1601;&#1604;&#1610;&#1606;&#1590;&#1605; &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1589;&#1601;&#1608;&#1601; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1582;&#1608;&#1575;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;&#1610;&#1606;</span>), "<i>Whoever wishes to be true Ja'fari (Shi'ah), then let him join the ranks of the Muslim Brotherhood</i>" as occurs in <i>Mawqif Ulamaa al-Muslimeen Min al-Shi'a</i> of Izz al-Deen Ibraaheem (p. 15). And Umar al-Tilmisani, the third supreme leader of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen wrote in his book "<i>Dhikriyaat, Laa Mudhakkaaraat</i>" (p. 131), (<span class='arb'>&#1603;&#1575;&#1606; &#1591;&#1604;&#1576;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1582;&#1608;&#1575;&#1606; &#1610;&#1581;&#1578;&#1601;&#1604;&#1608;&#1606; &#1576;&#1584;&#1603;&#1585;&#1609;  &#1606;&#1608;&#1575;&#1576; &#1589;&#1601;&#1608;&#1610;  &#1585;&#1574;&#1610;&#1587; &#1580;&#1605;&#1593;&#1610;&#1577; &#1601;&#1583;&#1575;&#1574;&#1610;&#1575;&#1606; &#1573;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1610;&#1593;&#1610;&#1577; &#1601;&#1610; &#1573;&#1610;&#1585;&#1575;&#1606;</span>), "<i>The students of al-Ikhwaan used to celebrate the mention of <a href='tags/nawab-safawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nawab Safawi</font></a>, the leader of the Jam'iyyah Fedaa'iyaan Islaam al-Shi'iyyah in Iraan</i>." He also said in the same book, (<span class='arb'>&#1608;&#1604;&#1605; &#1578;&#1601;&#1578;&#1585; &#1593;&#1604;&#1575;&#1602;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1582;&#1608;&#1575;&#1606; &#1576;&#1586;&#1593;&#1605;&#1575;&#1569; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1610;&#1593;&#1577; &#1601;&#1575;&#1578;&#1589;&#1604;&#1608;&#1575; &#1576;&#1570;&#1610;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;  &#1575;&#1604;&#1603;&#1575;&#1588;&#1575;&#1606;&#1610;  &#1608;&#1575;&#1587;&#1578;&#1590;&#1575;&#1601;&#1608;&#1575; &#1601;&#1610; &#1605;&#1589;&#1585; &#1606;&#1608;&#1575;&#1576; &#1589;&#1601;&#1608;&#1610; &#1548; &#1603;&#1604; &#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1601;&#1593;&#1604;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1582;&#1608;&#1575;&#1606; &#1604;&#1575; &#1604;&#1610;&#1581;&#1605;&#1604;&#1608;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1610;&#1593;&#1577; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1578;&#1585;&#1603; &#1605;&#1584;&#1607;&#1576;&#1607;&#1605; ! &#1548; &#1608; &#1604;&#1603;&#1606;&#1607;&#1605; &#1601;&#1593;&#1604;&#1608;&#1607; &#1604;&#1594;&#1585;&#1590; &#1606;&#1576;&#1610;&#1604; &#1610;&#1583;&#1593;&#1608; &#1573;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1573;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605;&#1607;&#1605; &#1608;&#1607;&#1608; &#1605;&#1581;&#1575;&#1608;&#1604;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1602;&#1585;&#1610;&#1576; &#1576;&#1610;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1584;&#1575;&#1607;&#1576; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605;&#1610;&#1577; &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1571;&#1602;&#1585;&#1576; &#1581;&#1583; &#1605;&#1605;&#1603;&#1606;</span>), "<i>And the connection between the Ikhwaan and the leaders of the Shi'ah did not slacken.

All of this was done by Ikhwaan  not in order to make the Shi'ah leave their madhhab but they did this with a noble objective which their Islam called them to, which is to try and bring closeness between the Islamic madhhabs to the closest level possible</i>."      <P>
All the above quotes reveal to us the true and real relationship between al-Ikhwaan and the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a> in general and between <a href='tags/nawab-safawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Nawab Safawi</font></a> and <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> on this occasion and some of the objectives behind the meetings taking place.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>A common element between both the Ikhwaan and the Fedayeene Islamee is that both attempt to use the issue of Palestine as a means of wider public support for their own party and to try to legitimize their corrupt, innovated, harmful methodologies which they took from secular atheist Jews such as Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky and <a href='tags/karl-marx.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karl Marx</font></a>. All "Islamist" parties of the early to mid-20th century were in fact affected by these ideologies including <b>Abu A'laa Mawdudi</b> and <b>Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani</b>. These innovators were responsible for bringing the poison of "<u><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></u>" into the Ummah by which they eroded the usool of the Sunnah in matters of methodology. All of them were <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> Maturidis in creed, making them the descendants of the Ahl al-Kalaam of old who brought the poison of "<u>kalaam</u>" into the Ummah with which they eroded the usool of the Sunnah in matters of creed. These types of people and their followers find accommodation, love and respect from the two <a href='tags/ghulaat-al-murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghulaat al-<a href="tags/murjiah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Murji'ah</font></a></font></a> (Saleem Begg and Salman Awan) - as is clear from their Ikhwani Awakening forums - whereas the people of the Sunnah receive nothing but scorn, <a href='tags/mockery.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mockery</font></a> and ridicule. </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Just Read the Argument of This Raafidee Regarding Sayyid Qutb's <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> and Others</font>    <P>
In the book "<i>al-Salafiyyah Bayn Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Imaamiyyah</i>" (see inset of picture below) the Shi'ite author, Muhammad al-Katheeree, develops an argument in defence of the attacks of the Shi'ah against the <a href='tags/sahaabah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sahaabah</font></a>. His argument is: So what if the Shi'ah protest the oppression of <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, Amr bin al-Aas and others, these Companions were guilty of that and rightly criticised and if you criticize us then what about <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> who explicitly made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of these Companions for the very same for which we criticize them?!     <P>

Yet they resent and hate that this book of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> (al-Dhilaal) should be refuted and warned against because at the same time, it contains that Leninist, Marxist, Trotskyite manhaj of revolution that al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen and the <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> in general operate upon - and thus it is also of value for its <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and Kharijiyyah. So this proves that the concern with the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> for these people is just an academic one, and <u>their real preoccuptions</u> are the practical elements of the manhaj of <b>Hasan al-Bannaa</b>, <b>Abu A'laa Mawdudi</b>, <b>Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani</b>, and <b><a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></b>, all Ashari Maturidis (!!!) and all of whom effectively incorporated the methodologies (and in some cases, ideological precepts) of secular Atheist Jews into their so called "da'wah to Allaah."

So, there are two issues in front of us here. <u>First</u>, that these individuals love <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> more than they love <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> and Abu Sufyaan (radiallaahu anhum) and <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> from Banu Umayyah (Qutb negated Islaam from all of them) - as evidenced by their own activities over many long years. And the <u>second</u> connected point, is that they are <a href='tags/ghulaat-al-murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghulaat al-<a href="tags/murjiah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Murji'ah</font></a></font></a> practically speaking. Let us address these two issues, with the following notes:    <P>
The history of activity of <a href='tags/saleem-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saleem Begg</font></a> al-Azzaamee and Salman Awaan is <u>a disgraceful and criminal one</u> and one that convicts them squarely of loving <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> more than <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> (radiallaahu anhu). Many people reading this article will not know the historical background of these individuals, in particular that of <a href='tags/saleem-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saleem Begg</font></a>, from the late 1990s, through the 2000s and into this decade.  One has to be in the know of this history to truly  appreciate this observation.    <P>
Shaykh Rabee' bin Haadee al-Madkhalee (hafidhahullaah) wrote a number of books (in the mid 1990s) refuting <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> in defence of the honour of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> and also highlighted Qutb's revilements upon <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>. He was not the first to do so, as <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> had already refuted Sayyid Qutb's Rafidee poison over forty years earlier. From this point, the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> waged an intense war against the Shaykh which they continue up until this day, except that that they have been exposed thoroughly and the only thing keeping them going is the increase in hate and rage after seeing that whilst in the early 90s Sayyid Qutbs books could be easily promoted (and hence used strategically for the Leninist, Marxist, Trotsyite revolution they envisage to help them establish al-Haakimiyyah) - after the effects of Shaykh Rabee's book, the Ikhwanis, <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> in general became scared of mentioning the name of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, it became a liability and was rendered toxic and harmful to the cause. With their flagship "<a href="tags/qutbiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutbiyyah</font></a>" destroyed and ruined, only the arrogant rats remain in the shipwreck of <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>, and that is what we are dealing with in this article.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><img src=assets/images/shipwreck-qutbiyyah.gif align="right" style="margin:8px 0px 5px 15px;" border=0> The ship was battered and pushed ashore, and then burnt in flames - due to the books of <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a>. In particular, <u>the book</u> refuting Sayyid Qutb's revilement of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>, <u>the book</u> defending and protecting the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah from the Leninist, Marxist, Trotskyite methodologies of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a>, and <u>the book</u> establishing that there is only one Jamaa'ah and one Siraat (path) acceptable to Allaah, not the many of Hassan al-Banna and his later reappearance in the personage of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq of <a href='tags/ihyaa-al-turaath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ihyaa al-Turaath</font></a> in the 80s and 90s.   </div>    <P>
Whilst, these individuals should have been shocked at Qutb's <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, <a href='tags/abu-sufyan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Sufyan</font></a>, <a href='tags/hind.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hind</font></a>, Amr bin al-Aaas and Bani Umayyah, (and at Abu A'laa Mawdudi's similar ideological line) they instead waged an intense and severe war against <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a>, reviling him, abusing him and accusing him of every loathsome thing. This does not even need any proof, <u>their activities are open and well known and they make a public display of this</u>, it is an openly known matter it is mutawaatir about them. This is a clear indication that their activities are motivated by love, veneration and defence of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and this in turn proves that <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> is more beloved in their hearts than those Companions whom <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of, a matter he never made tawbah from, and the proof is upon the claimant. Almost 50 years after the Rafidee's execution, and we still do not have any evidence of a tawbah.     <P>

You see, as <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> pointed out, there is no such thing as just "<i>pure knowledge</i>", rather all knowledge is such that it <u>implies and necessitates</u> the actions of the heart (unless there are barriers present like arrogance and hatred which prevent the expression of those actions necessitated by the knowledge). This is unlike what the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the Ghullaat al-Murji'ah presumed that mere knowledge in the heart can exist without necessitating the actions of the heart, and through which obligatory or perfect eemaan can be attained.     <P>
<u>And thus</u> when the Sharee'ah knowledge reaches you of the status of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>, it necessitates the actions of the heart of loving them, defending them, honoring them and so on. Now, when you are angry and resentful that the Rafidee poison of a 20th century ignoramus is refuted and that his accusation against Mu'aawiyyah of <i>ghish, khadee'ah</i> and <i>nifaaq</i> (deception, treachery and hypocrisy) is exposed, as well as his negation of Islam from <a href='tags/abu-sufyan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Sufyan</font></a> and Bani Umayyah as a whole (but it did not make you shake, shudder and scream in disgust <u>that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> actually said that</u> and <u>persisted upon that</u> after the hujjah was established) and further, that you revile, assault, attack defame and take every opportunity to belittle that very Shaykh who defended the honour of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> and refuted <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, alongside your knowledge that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> was refuted forty years ago in his lifetime by <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a>, and never recanted but persisted upon that until his death - and then at the same time you claim  you love Mu'aawiyah and <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> and claim that you have brought al-eemaan al-waajib with respect to this matter - then you are <b>the greatest of liars</b>, and you are extreme in your <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a>, the <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a> of the Ghullaat, Ghullaat ul-Murji'ah who claim the attainment of obligatory eemaan in the absence of the actions of the heart. And you are a shyster and insincere follower of desires, who is motivated not by jealousy for the Companion Mu'aawiyah, <b>but for jealousy and anger for the sake of Sayyid Qutb</b>, and it is nothing but jealousy for <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and hatred for that Scholar that is behind all your current activites. And all praise is due to Allah who exposed you in broad daylight through your own actions!    <P>

Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> said in Kitaab ul-Imaan (7/187-188):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And it is from here that the error of the saying of Jahm Ibn Safwaan and whoever followed him becomes apparent, in that they thought that <a href='tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a> is merely the <i>tasdeeq</i> (assent) of the heart and its <i>ilm</i> (knowledge), and they did not make the actions of the heart to be from <a href='tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a>, and they thought that a person can be a believer, perfect in his <a href='tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a> (kaamil ul-Imaan) with his heart, and then alongside this he can revile Allaah and His Messenger, show enmity to Allaah and His Messenger, and show enmity to the Awliyaa of Allaah, and then he show loyalty to the enemies of Allaah, kill the Prophets, destroy the mosques, show disrespect to the Masaahif (pl. of mus.haf, i.e. qur'aan), honour the Kuffaar with great kindness, and disdain the believers with the greatest of disdainment. So they say that all of this is disobedience that does not negate the <a href='tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a> that is in his heart</blockquote>    <P>
Whilst noting here that Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> is demonstrating the repugnance of the Ghullaat al-Murji'ah through giving examples which are major kufr to illustrate how they divorced the actions of the heart from its speech, and thus, in turn, from the outward actions - the general principle (<b>of the talaazum between the speech and action of the heart, and between the heart and the outward actions</b>) nevertheless, <u>still applies</u>, and so we are going to illustrate here what these people are upon today of expelling the actions of the heart from eemaan, so here goes:    <P>
<blockquote><p><font style='font-size:19px;line-height:26px;'>Hey, we have <i>ilm</i> and <i>ma'rifah</i> in our hearts regarding the status of Mu'aawiyah, and we acknowledge that he was the trusted scribe of the Messenger (alayhis salaam) who wrote down the revelation, (and what a lofty and honourable position of trust that is), and we know that the Messenger supplicated for him asking Allaah  (<span class='arb'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;&#1605; &#1575;&#1580;&#1593;&#1604;&#1607; &#1607;&#1575;&#1583;&#1610;&#1575;&#1611; &#1605;&#1607;&#1583;&#1610;&#1575;&#1611;</span>) "<i>O Allaah, make him a guide, guiding others, and guided himself</i>", and also we acknowledge that Mu'aawiyah is the Uncle of the Believers and we also have <i>ilm</i> and <i>ma'rifah</i> in our hearts regarding the status of Amr bin al-Aas, that the Messenger (alayhis salaam) said about the two sons of al-Aas (<span class='arb'>&#1575;&#1576;&#1606;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1575;&#1589; &#1605;&#1572;&#1605;&#1606;&#1575;&#1606;</span>), "<i>The two sons of al-Aas are believers</i>", and we also acknowledge that the Messenger also said (<span class='arb'>&#1571;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1575;&#1587; &#1608;&#1570;&#1605;&#1606; &#1593;&#1605;&#1585;&#1608; &#1576;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1575;&#1589;</span>), "<i>The most submissive (in Islam) and believing of people is Amr bin al-Aas</i>", and we also have <i>ilm</i> and <i>ma'rifah</i> in our hearts that the Messenger said (<span class='arb'>&#1593;&#1605;&#1585;&#1608; &#1576;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1575;&#1589; &#1605;&#1606; &#1589;&#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1610; &#1602;&#1585;&#1610;&#1588;</span>), "<i>Amr bin al-Aas is from the righteous of the Quraish</i>".     <P>
Alongside all of this <i>ilm </i>and <i>ma'rifah</i> and <i>tasdeeq</i> (assent) in our hearts, we are enraged, angry and furious that a Scholar amongst the Scholars, <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee-bin-haadee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee bin Haadee</font></a> al-Madkhali, has dared to point out what <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> fell into of reviling Mu'aawiyah and Amr bin al-Aas, accusing them both of lying (<i>kadhib</i>), deception (<i>ghish</i>), treachery or trickery (<i>khadee'ah</i>), hypocrisy (<i>nifaaq</i>), and taking bribes (<i>rishwah</i>) - <a href=index2099.html?pidmx>see this article</a>, and of what he said about Uthmaan (radiallahu anhu) that he was a feeble, senile old man, who got taken advantage of in his old age, was not fit for the rule, and would often dip his hands into the Bayt ul-Maal for the expediency of his family, and that those who revolted him were driven by the spirit of Islam of "eschewing evil". And it enrages us that this Shaykh wrote almost 200 pages as an encyclopedia of Sayyid Qutb's revilement upon those promised Paradise, "<i>Mataa'in <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> Fis-Sahaabah</i>". So we are going to set up in our hearts for this man a good share of enmity, rank hatred and scorn. But we won't stop there. We will then start ringing up other Scholars to try and cast aspersions about him so that the position of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> does not diminish in the eyes of the people. We are going to spend from our wealth in this regard, and we will work with all the guile, deception and trickery in trying to bring this man down. We will generate an atmosphere of animosity and hate that will lead the ignorant to make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of this man who dared to speak about our pole and axis, and which will lead the people to accuse him of being a stooge and pawn and a hypocrite who praises the leaders. We will write on blogs, on forums, we will make propaganda for <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> to try and defend him to the utmost, and alongside all of this "<i>We love you Mu'aawiyah and we love you Amr bin al-Aas</i>".     <P>
Then we are going to spend from our wealth and be willing to pay the search engines in order to avert and divert the people away from the website where the honor of <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> was being defended <u>in truth and in all sincerity of purpose to Islaam and the Muslims</u>, and instead to our own fake (display) of love for <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, <u>the true and real intent</u> of which is to purely scorn and vilify that same Shaykh and to defend <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, and so the companion <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> is really just a means to an end for us, and alongside all of this, "<i>We love you Mu'aawiyah and we love you Amr bin al-Aas</i>". And we will continue upon this, dedicated to this, for years and for years, venting our anger, frustration and scorn towards that Shaykh whilst allying with <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>.     <P>
Thereafter, when it even becomes clear to us Shaykh al-Abani praised this Scholar for exposing Qutb's ignorance and deviation from the foundations and branches of Islaam (<a href=indexa0fc.html?iosjk>see here</a>), and when it becomes clear to us that <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> defended this Scholar with a defence that constituted a smiting of our lips (<a href=indexb09a.html?epluy>see here</a>), and when it became clear that <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> preceded this Scholar by forty years in refuting <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> for the very same (see <a href=index2199.html?mslqe>here</a> and <a href=index0657.html?qodiy>here</a>) - then alongside the <i>ilm</i>, <i>ma'rifah</i> and <i>tasdeeq</i> of all of this, <u>we are only going to increase in our enmity, hatred and opposition to this Scholar</u>, and step up our efforts, all for the sake of that 20th century ignoramus non-Scholar in whose books there is nothing, after we take out the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the <u><a href='tags/rafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rafidah</font></a></u>, except the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the <u><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Mu'tazilah</u>, <u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>, <u>Jabariyyah</u>, expressions of the <u>Ittihaadiyyah</u> and what is worse than the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the Khawaarij. So we are going to continue our allegiance for this man, and we are going to start appearing on the blogs and forums, with the aim of spreading shubuhaat and work stratagems and plots all aimed at fooling the naive and gullible and aimed at defending <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, drawing people towards his books as opposed to away from them, through the utility we find in some isolated, qualified sayings of some of the Scholars. And alongside all of these efforts to defend <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and to scorn that Shaykh, "<i>We love you Mu'aawiyah and we love you Amr bin al-Aas</i>".    <P>
<u>Then we are not going to stop there</u>, we are going to trawl through all of the sayings and writings of that one Scholar, to see if we can find any hint of speaking ill of any of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>, not because we care about <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>, but because we want to defend our pole and axis, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and if and when we find anything, we are going to publish it, distribute, it and expend the greatest of efforts in letting the entire world know - in manner that <u>we never did</u> and <u>we never will do</u> for the refutations of Shaykh <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> and <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> upon <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> for his evil slanders and revilements upon <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, Amr bin al-Aas and Bani Umayyah - and all of this for the sake of defending <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> (because it really grieves us that people should flee from his books - <a href=index9c1e.html?romka>see here</a>).     <P>
After all of this  "<i>We love you Mu'aawiyah and we love you Amr bin al-Aas</i>", and we have indeed brought the obligatory eemaan (al-eemaan al-wajib) as it relates to these Companions of Allaah's Messenger (alayhis salaam).</font></blockquote>    <P>
This is the reality of these people, be not in doubt, this is what they themselves are saying through their actions, all we have done is to put their actions into writing!     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Convicted By Their Own Actions</font>    <P>
Further, this action (fake display of love and defense of Mu'aawiyah) from these individuals actually proves two things.     <P>
<blockquote><p><u>Firstly</u>, that <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> was right, and he was preceded in this by Shaykh <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> by more than forty years. So the mere fact that you are faking jealousy for Mu'aawiyah now, is an admission through your action that Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> (<a href=index2099.html?pidmx>see here</a>), and Shaykh <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> (<a href=index0657.html?qodiy>see here</a>) and <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> and others were all correct.     <P>
<u>And secondly</u>, following on from the first point, that these individuals are insincere. They are not doing this out of sincerity and out of love of Mu'aawiyah and concern for the honour of Mu'aawiyah, but it is out of venting anger, frustration <u>and seeking revenge for the sake of Sayyid Qutb</u> and <b>NOT</b> for the sake of the honour of Mu'aawiyah (radiallaahu anhu). What is the proof? Because we have not seen this same fervor, zeal, the spending of wealth (paying for Google ads), the setting up of websites, blogs and forums, in refuting what was said by <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> against Mu'aawiyah, and how vile was the speech of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, rather we have <b>only ever</b> seen this activity to defend <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and to attack the one who refuted him! And these people know it, they are witnesses over themselves.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Why the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> Attack <a href="tags/shaykh-rabee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shaykh Rabee'</font></a></font>    <P>
The activities of these people that we see now on the blogs and forums <u>are only taking place</u> because <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> refuted their symbolic figureheads whose ideologies they are actually upon - <u>they are not upon the methodologies of the Salaf</u>- from the greatest of which is to shun the Innovators and their books, especially those that contain the major innovations whose deviation is famous and well-known such as the bidah's of the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a> and the khawaarij. <b>Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a> explained why these people attack <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> and it pretty much ends this entire matter</b> - <u>you don't need any more reasons and explanations as to why these people are doing what they are doing</u>, they've already been <b>convicted</b> by the perspicacious and deeply insightful statements of the Imaams of the religion. <a href=indexb09a.html?epluy>Go to this article and read</a> what <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> said about these people in explanation of the reason for them trying to tarnish <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> with faults. <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> said in response to a question regarding those who attack Shaykh Rabee'    <P>

Further, considering <u>the fact</u> that what you are bringing of these shubuhaat actually <u>pale into insignificance</u> compared to <u>the multitude</u> of the <u>very specific praises and defenses</u> of the Imaams and Shaykhs of the Religion of our times for <a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/shaykh-rabee.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a>, which are very specific and relate to the corroboration of very specific criticisms and refutations by <a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/shaykh-rabee.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> upon <a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/qutb.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, such as in his <a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/aqidah.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the <a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/rafidah.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rafidah</font></a> and his <a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/aqidah.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the <a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/khawarij.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Khawarij</font></a>, <u>which are major innovations for which <i><a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/taweel.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a></i> or <i>ijtihaad</i> is not an excuse by Ijmaa' of Ahl us-Sunnah</u>, then given the fact that you are already aware of this and have been aware of this for many long years and despite that, you have seen fit to use these general  statements from the Muftee, <u>without affording the same value</u> to all those multiples of other statements of the other Scholars that relate to <a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/shaykh-rabee.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a>, then all this <u>only proves you are fake</u>. <b>You are a shyster</b>. You are <u>insincere</u> in what you are doing. You are not doing this out of jealousy for <a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/the-companions.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> or jealousy for the Islamic <a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/aqidah.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>. Because if you were, you would have been the first to recognize the truth of what <a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/shaykh-rabee.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> criticized <a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/qutb.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> for, this would have been a proof that the knowledge in your heart has produced the necessary actions of the heart that would have translated into outward actions of acceptance, love and praise for what <a href='//www.themadkhalis.com/md/tags/shaykh-rabee.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> did in defending Mu'aawiyah, Amr bin al-Aas and the Bani Umayyah and Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhum). So our deen is not the deen of the Ghullaat al-Murjiah, who expel the actions of the heart from eemaan. //--->    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Stretching the Rope And Giving Them A Little More Does Not Even Benefit These People</font>    <P>
Now lets go further, <b>even if we push everything else aside</b> - lets throw out <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a>, and lets throw out Qutb's bid'ah of the negation of "<i>hawaadith</i>" following the way and style of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, and all the Jahmee, <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, Mu'tazili doctrines found in az-Zilaal, and let's restrict ourselves <u>to only two things</u>, Qutb's <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of <u>the Rafidah</u> and his <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of <u>the Khawaarij</u>, and he died upon these things, then that would be enough for you <b>to consider him an Innovator, who died an Innovator</b>, for he never recanted from his Rafd and nor from his Khaarijiyyah which was worse and more severe than that of the very first Kharijite "<i>Dogs of Hellfire</i>", and upon whom, <u>therefore</u>, all of the usool of Ahl us-Sunnah apply as it relates to the Innovators and their books. So the fact that these people are willing to swim the oceans, conquer the mountains, enter into the deep and dark recesses of the earth, and venture out in sub-zero temperatures all for the sake of a 20th century ignoramus innovator, <u>is sufficient to pass judgment upon them with following of desires</u> - even if they try to deceive the people with the statement of this Shaykh and that Shaykh, drawing upon mere shubuhaat to defend a man in whose books there is nothing left of value (after taking out the greatest of misguidances found therein) except some cultural, literary excellence, and the skillful use of language.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So this proves, <u>without any shadow of doubt</u>, that your activities are fake, you actions are <u>not sincere</u>, they are only to take revenge against <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> <u><b>because</b></u> he spoke and wrote about your rumooz (symbolic figureheads), <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a>. Don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise, and Allaah will reckon you. If you have any intelligence you will realize this is actually sincere advice for you.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>It's All Fake ...</font>    <P>
We never saw you displaying jealousy for Mu'aawiyah by setting up Google Ads to defend the honour of Mu'aawiyah, rather you only spent from your wealth to defend those figureheads who displayed actual hatred in their hearts towards Mu'aawiyah and the Bani Umayyah (see <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> <a href=index0657.html?qodiy>break it down here</a>), [those figureheads] who persisted upon this hatred, accusing Mu'aawiyah of deception, hypocrisy and treachery. <b>So you spend from your wealth to divert and avert the people away from websites and articles (i.e. this one) that do nothing but defend the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> from these excesses and which contain nothing but statements from the Imaams and Scholars of the religion</b>. And you are doing all of this <u>not for Mu'aawiyah or for the Islamic aqidah</u>, but it is to express your rage, revenge, anger, resentment and hatred for a particular Scholar. <b>Vain deeds, vain deeds, vain deeds</b>. And putting all of our differences aside, if you actually have any intelligence coupled with even the slightest speck of the fear of Allaah, you will know deep inside your soul that this could not have been a more accurate characterization of you, meaning what has been said by <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexb09a.html?epluy>see here</a>), and what we have explained above in this aticle (and further below) on the basis of what <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> and others have said.    <P>
So all of this helps us to understand the true nature of the activities of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> who have come out of the woodwork and are now showing up on the blogs and forums. They only showed up because through this website, the "<i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>" (ideology) - <a href=indexf862.html?umiea>see excellent article here</a> by Shaykh Saalih Aal ash-Shaykh, and the Rafidi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and the Kharijite <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> is being exposed, alongside the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, Ittihaadiyyah, Jabariyyah and others whose expressions are found in the works of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>. This is why these people have come out of the woodwork now, <b>only to defend <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and to create shubuhaat and to spread shubuhaat about Shaykh Rabee'</b>. That is their sole motivating factor, <u>be not in any doubt about it</u>, and they themselves know it deep in their souls. It is not because they are jealous for Mu'aawiyah (radiallahu anhu) and jealous for the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>. So we say once again, our deen is not the deen of the <a href='tags/murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Murji'ah</font></a> who expel actions of the heart from eemaan, and it is  your own actions and activities that have passed judgment upon you, and have rendered you liars. walilllaahil-hamd.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Alleged Retraction of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> al-Rafidee</font>    <P>
The two aforementioned <a href='tags/ghulaat-al-murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghulaat al-<a href="tags/murjiah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Murji'ah</font></a></font></a> (practically speaking) have attempted to present as defence of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, three statements, one from <u>Yusuf al-Qaradawi</u>, one from <u>Abdullah al-Aqeel</u> and one from <u><a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></u> (Sayyid Qutb's brother). The common theme in each of these three statements is that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> had two stages, his early stage (in the early 1950s) and a later stage and that he allegedly stated that only his later books should be distributed and considered, and that these are six books in number.     <P>
They have presented this as an alleged retraction and repentance when it is absolutely nothing of the sort, and the hard facts and realities falsify these claims. These claims are part of the propaganda to defend <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> against all odds and to keep people attached to his heretical books.     <P>
In response the following points can be made:    <P>
<ol><li> When you  make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, his parents, Amr bin al-Aas, and the Banu Umayyah, then simply stating that "<i>only my later books represent my true methodology</i>" is not an acceptable and legitimate shar'iyy repentance, and this is known to the lowest student of knowledge of the usool of Islaam and Sunnah.     <P>
<li> As such, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> did not make any tawbah - rather he persisted in his ideological poison right until his death, continuing to publish those very same books until they reached numerous editions. We have addressed this issue in some of these articles (see   <a href=indexc226.html?kjxfr>here</a>,  <a href=indexa2d2.html?fhmqo>here</a>,  <a href=indexb1fe.html?alkbq>here</a> and  <a href=index001c.html?pcihb>here</a>).    <P>
<li> If  <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> had any remorse and desired repentance and recantation for his Rafidee, Baatinee poison, he would have actually written it in his lifetime and would have distributed it and would have prevented his books from being published or he would have removed that poison completely and fully from his books. But how can that be when his books are actually based upon a <u>full ideological conviction</u> founded upon a Marxist, Leninist Communist notion of <a href='tags/social-justice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Social Justice</font></a>, through which he evaluated and judged Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu) and made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Mu'aawiyah, his parents, Amr bin al-Aaas, and the Banu Umayyah - and he was adamant right until his death that they did not represent the "spirit of Islaam" and all he did was  to make some of his remarks a bit milder so as to deflect criticism, not because he actually changed his vile, filthy Rafidee Baatinee views.    <P>
<li> The book "<i><a href='tags/al-adaalah-al-ijtimaaiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Adaalah al-Ijtimaa'iyyah</font></a></i>" (<a href='tags/social-justice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Social Justice</font></a>) in which <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> unleashed his Marxist, Communist malice and poison against <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>, making <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of some of them, was one of the last books published by <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>. The very first edition was published in 1949 before he went to America. It was published in numerous editions reaching <b>the 1964 edition</b> in which <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> modified some words (without actually recanting from what he had written of poison against the Companions). You can see examples of those modifications in these articles (see   <a href=indexc226.html?kjxfr>here</a>,  <a href=indexa2d2.html?fhmqo>here</a>,  <a href=indexb1fe.html?alkbq>here</a> and  <a href=index001c.html?pcihb>here</a>). This indicates that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> did not make any tawbah and he continued to push that ideological conviction of malice towards <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> upon a Marxist, Communist reading of history.     <P>
<li> The only reason why these defences and excuses are being presented and distributed now by these <a href='tags/ghulaat-al-murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghulaat al-<a href="tags/murjiah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Murji'ah</font></a></font></a> is because the world at large has become aware of Qutb's <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, his parents, Amr bin al-Aas and his blanket <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> from Banu Umayyah and the fact that he maintained this malice right until the last editions of his book(s). If <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> had truly repented then these people would have had that spread and distributed in the decades before his realities started to become clear in the mid 1990s. This further proves that they are not motivated by defence of the honour of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> but out of defence and veneration of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>.   </ol>    <P>
 And with this we establish that these continued activities from Abu Zubair <a href='tags/saleem-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saleem Begg</font></a> and Abu Fatimah Salman Awaan prove that they are <a href='tags/ghulaat-al-murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghulaat al-<a href="tags/murjiah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Murji'ah</font></a></font></a>, filled with hate and resentment for the Salafi da'wah, its scholars and its callers, their actions being clear proof in broad daylight to all people of sane mind of this fact and that defence of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, washing his ideological Marxist Communist socks (of social justice) and licking his Rafidee boots is a loftier activity and more beloved to them than defending the honour of <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> and his parents (radiallaahu anhum). By Allaah, they have passed judgement upon themselves by their own activies over the past years - <u>their own actions speak of their conviction</u> and all we have done here is to put in writing what their actions have dictated to us!   <P>
