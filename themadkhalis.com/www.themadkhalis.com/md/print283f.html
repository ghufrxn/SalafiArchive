From the greatest of distinctions between the true followers of the Messengers and Prophets (in beliefs and methodologies) and those besides them is their affirmation of whatever Allaah affirmed for Himself and which His Messenger (alayhis salaam) affirmed for him in the revealed texts, of Names, Attributes and Actions.    <P>
From the greatest of these is Allaah's Uluww (above the heaven, above the Throne, with His Essence). This is a matter that all revealed books and all sent messengers were agreed upon, <u>until the appearance of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the Mu'tazilah</u>. On the basis of an intellectual proof they devised - based upon the language, terminology and classification of the atheist philosophers - to prove the universe is created, they denied much of what has come in the Book and the Sunnah pertaining to Allaah's Names, Attributes and Actions, in order to avoid invalidating their rational proof.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>And From amongst the greatest of the affairs that they denied were <u>Allaah's Uluww</u>, and likewise, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> being Allaah's Speech (and hence <u>uncreated</u>). The Salaf's rejection of these people was extremely severe, and they did not hesitate to declare these beliefs as kufr (disbelief). </div>    <P>
These people were opposed by the entirety of the Salaf, and in the third century, a faction of the Ahl al-Kalaam called <u>the Kullaabiyyah</u>, named after Abdullaah bin Sa'eed bin Kullaab (d. 240H), opposed the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah by being the first of the Mutakallimeen to affirm something of Allaah's Attributes. They refuted the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah on the issue of Allaah's Uluww and in the rejection of the Sifaat Dhaatiyyah. However, uable to counter the arguments of the Mu'tazilah, they denied the <a href='tags/sifaat-filiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sifaat Fi'liyyah</font></a> (actions tied to Allaah's will) and through this rejection, concurred with the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> present with us <u>is created</u>, whilst affirming something additional that the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah did not affirm, which is that there is another uncreated <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the meaning present with Allaah's Self form eternity which they called "kalaam nafsee". These doctrines of the Kullaabiyyah were taken on by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (d. 324H) after his split with the Mu'tazilah and they became popularized through the label of "<u><a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a></u>". The essence of the Kullaabi (then Ash'arite) creed was to negate "events (hawaadith)" from Allaah, since to them, everything in the universe is but an event. The early <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> remained upon the creed of the Kullabiyyah in the bulk, affirming Allaah's Uluww and the sifaat dhaatiyyah (such as Face, Hands, Eyes) however, the later <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> reverted back to the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah on these specific issues, and adopted the very ta'weels of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah that the early Kullaabi <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> refuted. Thus, unlike the early Kullaabi <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a>, they denied Allaah is above the Throne, with His Essence and instead adopted the saying of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>,  Mut'azilah and Kafirs like Ibn Sinah (d. 429H) - <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?mrsit>see here</a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This then became the standard <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> doctrine, and all <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> from that time have been upon these doctrines, which include the saying that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> (present with us, recited, heard, memorized and written) is created, the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> and the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of Allaah's Uluww as a means of negating what is manifest in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, the Sunnah and the Ijmaa' of the Salaf, that Allaah Himself, with His Essence, is above the heaven, above the Throne. The <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> continued to propound and propagate these doctrines in the various lands. In <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> in the early 20th century, a number of <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> such as <b><a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></b>, <b><a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a></b>, and the Maturidi, <b>Muhammad Abduh</b>, continued to propagate the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and Mu'tazilah in their works. </div>    <P>
These very <u>Ash'ari, Maturidi, Mu'tazili</u> figureheads were the same people responsible for the birth and growth of the destructive political movements of the 20th century, and whereas in previous centuries, those assuming the label of "<a href="tags/asharis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ash'aris</font></a>" had  departed from his creed and corrupted the beliefs of the Muslims with their hybrid Jahmee, Mu'tazilee, Kullaabi, <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> creed,  in the twentieth century, this same line of <s><a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a></s> <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> also corrupted the deen of the Muslims in the field of rectification and reform, infusing non-Muslim ideologies, and innovating two strains of deviation: <u>Firstly</u>, Leninist-Marxism, a <a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a> to snatch power from the authorities, which gave birth to the madhhab of the Khawaarij, and <u>secondly</u>, mass-populist political activation as a means to work through the existing secular political framework (by hook or crook) to arrive at power, inclusive of what these two strains may have required of secrecy, deception, pledges of allegiance, assassinations, intrigues, entry into democracy and so on. And whoever reads the biographies of these two particular <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> will not see anything but that. <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>The <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> in Qutb's Commentary on the <a href="tags/quran.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qur'an</font></a></font>    <P>
Sayyid <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> wrote in his commentary on Surah al-Furqaan (25:59):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qutb-zilal-25-istiwaa.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> over the Arsh, then it is the  meaning of superiority (in rank) and control, authority and the word "thumma" (then) does not indicate tarteeb (order) in time, but it indicates the dimension of rank (status), the rank of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> and al-Isti'laa.</blockquote>    <P>
And he also wrote in his commentary on of Surah al-Hadeed (57:4)    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qutb-zilal-57-istiwaa.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And likewise the Arsh, we believe in it as He has mentioned it, but we do not know its reality. As for <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> over the Arsh, we are able to say: It is an allusion (indirect expression) of the control, dominion, authority (haymanah) over this creation. [This is] founded on what we know from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, out of certainty that Allaah, the Sublime, circumstances do not change for Allaah. Hence, He is not in the state of the absence of istiwaa over the Throne, which is then followed by the state of istiwa. And the saying that "<i>We believe in <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> and we do not know its kaifiyyah</i>" does not explain His, the Most High's saying, "then he made istawaa". And it is more appropriate that we say: It is an indirect expression for control, dominion, authority (haymanah) as has we have mentioned. And the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> (figurative explanation) here does not depart from the methodology that we have indicated just now, because it does not spring from the corroborations and conceptions from our own selves. It is founded upon the corroborations of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> itself, and upon the conception that it inspires from the Essence of Allaah and His Attributes.</blockquote>    <P>
From these quotes the following points can be made:    <P>
<b><u>Point 1: The Rejection of al-Istiwaa</u></b>    <P>
Sayyid <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> wrote in his commentary upon Surah al-Furqaan:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> over the Arsh, then it is the meaning of superiority (in rank) and control, authority.</blockquote>    <P>
And likewise in his commentary on Surah al-Hadeed:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> over the Arsh, we are able to say: It is an allusion (indirect expression) of the control, dominion, authority (haymanah) over this creation.</blockquote>    <P>
This is a clear rejection of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> which the Salaf unanimously affirmed and which the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and all the factions of kalaam rejected, and for which the Salaf refuted them, rebuked them and warned against them. And <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> is an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> and in his commentary upon Surah al-Hadeed, there is what indicates clearly that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> knew the way of the Salaf on this issue and deliberately opposed it, showing that on this particular issue, the proof is established against him, and this is made clear by:    <P>
<b><u>Point 2: Deliberate Opposition to the Salaf</u></b>    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the saying that "<i>We believe in <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> and we do not know its kaifiyyah</i>" does not explain His, the Most High's saying, "then he made istawaa". And it is more appropriate that we say: It is an indirect expression for control, dominion, authority (haymanah) as has we have mentioned.</blockquote>    <P>
This quote, taken from his commentary on Surah al-Hadeed (57:4) indicates clearly that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> knew the way of the Salaf, which is to affirm <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> and to negate the kaifiyyah and this is the way of all of the Salaf, with the broad principle in this regard found in the famous saying of Imaam Maalik, "<i>al-Istiwaa is known by the kayf is unknown</i>". <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> says that this does not really explain the saying of Allaah, so he is not pleased with what the Salaf were pleased with and were united upon, with consensus. In this issue, the hujjah (proof) is established, and we do not say in all issues, because <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> was a non-Scholar, he was ignorant of the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, his affair is between him and Allaah, but on some issues, the hujjah is established, through his own words in this case.    <P>
<b><u>Point 3: Rejection of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> from the Jahmite Angle of "Hulool ul-Hawaadith"</u></b>    <P>
Qutb said in what has been quoted from him above:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...and the word "thumma" (then) does not indicate tarteeb (order) in time, but it indicates the dimension of rank (status), the rank of <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> and al-Isti'laa (both meaning superiority in rank).</blockquote>    <P>
And also:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>[This is] founded on what we know from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, out of certainty that Allaah, the Sublime, circumstances do not change for Allaah. Hence, He is not in the state of the absence of istiwaa over the Throne, which is then followed by the state of istiwa.</blockquote>    <P>
In both of these statements <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> is bringing the doctrine of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> (and those who followed them) in negating what they deem to be "hawaadith" (events, occurrences), and this follows on from Aristotle's Ten Categories (al-Maqoolaat al-Ashar) upon which the deen of the Mutakallimeen is based, meaning that Tawheed to them is negating these Ten Catgories that characterize the universe from Allaah, and all the Mutakallimeen and Kafirs like Ibn Sina (d. 429H) are united in this approach. They just differ with each other on issues that branch of from this foundation. So one of the issues that Allaah can't have actions or be subject to actions, and thus, to them Allaah's istiwaa (an action) has to be denied by figurative interpretation, and likewise that Allaah loves, is pleased, and becomes angry, all actions, have to be interpreted as well, otherwise this would mean "affection (infi'aal)" one of Aristotle's categories, and it would therefore mean that Allaah is a jism (body), because all of these denote change (taghayyur), in the view of the Mutakallimeen.    <P>
And <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> has expounded this doctrine, not once but at least a few time in his commentary on different verses in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. And as the Scholars have mentioned, those who propagate, aggrandize and introduce others to his tafseer, then they contribute to the spread of the deen of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and by reading this commentary, people who lack knowledge are led to the doctrines of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> of negating Allaah's uluww, and speaking with the creation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the rejection of aahaad hadeeth in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and many other affairs.    <P>
And the difference between the books of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and those of true Scholars such as Ibn Hajar and <a href='tags/an-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>an-<a href="tags/nawawi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Nawawi</font></a></font></a>, is that if you take away the  mistakes found in their works, what is left is an ocean of knowledge. But if you take away the mistakes of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, you are not left actual knowledge but just literary style which is effective in affecting the emotions, there is no actual knowledge, and we are speaking here just of his commentary. As for his other book <a href='tags/milestones.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Milestones</font></a>, then that is a Leninist Manifesto  that has simply been Islamicized by <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, by which he intended the instigation of revolutions in <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> specifically, but the whole world. And all of that is not from the deen of Islaam, this is known by aql as well as naql.    <P>
<b><u>Point 4: Arguing for the Madhhab of Ta'weel</u></b>    <P>
Sayyid <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> wrote:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> (figurative explanation) here does not depart from the methodology that we have indicated just now, because it does not spring from the corroborations and conceptions [arising] from our own selves. It is founded upon the corroborations of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> itself, and upon the conception that it inspires from the Essence of Allaah and His Attributes.</blockquote>    <P>
What he has stated here is the standard <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> apologeticism for taw'eel as a broad methodology for dealing with those texts they believe give the presumption of "hawaadith" (events, occurrences) and tajseem (anthropomorphism) which is that when they make <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a>, they are not inventing interpretations from their own imaginations and thoughts, but rather from other meanings that are afforded by the revelation itself. As for the methodology of the Salaf, then it is to take the texts upon their dhaahir whilst negating likeness  to the creation, and this has been dealt with in detail elsewhere. The point being here is that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> is an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> and is outlining and defending the standard <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> dogma in his words above.    <P>
