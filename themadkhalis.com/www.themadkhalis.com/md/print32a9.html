<img src=assets/images/shipwreck-qutbiyyah.gif align=right hspace=8 vspace=8 border=0><font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
After the Imams, Mashayikh and students of knowledge of Ahl al-Sunnah silenced and laid to rest the slander perpetrated by <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> al-Ash'ari against the leading Scholars of the followers of the way of the Salaf, in particular, against Imaam al-Albani, there remained but rodents and scavengers in the shipwreck, manifested in the form of gormless Hawaalians muttering "shart kamaal, shart sihhah, al-Albani did have some expressions of <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa</font></a>." These mutterings serve as a means of psychological comfort to avoid facing up to the realities of their disgraceful past. So here it is important to drive the stake into this devious doubt, and send these rodents, the by-product of 20th century As'harites (<a href=index1bd3.html?muqxd>see here</a>) who entered turmoil into the da'wah of Ahl al-Sunnah, on their way into the dustbin of history.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The Shaykh and Muhaddith Hammaad al-Ansari (rahimahullaah) said, "<i>Muhammad Qu&#7789;b is an Ash&#703;ar&#299;</i>" and he also said, "<i>Muhammad Qu&#7789;b, Sayyid Qu&#7789;b's brother, is a dangerous Ash&#703;ar&#299;</i>." Refer to the biographical compilation regarding the Shaykh, al-Majm&#363;&#703; F&#299; Tarjamah al-&#703;All&#257;mah al-Mu&#7717;addith al-Shaykh &#7716;amm&#257;d bin Mu&#7717;ammad al-An&#7779;&#257;r&#299; compiled by his son, &#703;Abd al-Awwal bin &#7716;amm&#257;d al-An&#7779;&#257;r&#299;, (1st edition, 2002)  2/752, 2/617.    <P>
As for the Hawalian <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>, no one should be deceived by their refutations of the Asharites, for that is just a veil. Their real intent is to promulgate the methodologies of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen (takfir, rallies, demonstrations and the likes) as a counter to the da'wah of tasfiyah and tarbiyah of the likes of al-Albani, <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> and <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a>. <b>Their refutations of the Asharites are purely academic exercises devoid of any notions of al-walaa wal-baraa</b>. They make a display of countering the Ash'arites in matters of creed but then laud, aggrandize and defend 20th century Ash'arites like <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and also <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a> who was grieved by the demise of the <a href='tags/sufi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sufi</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, Maturidi Ottoman state, wishing for its revival, and these figureheads (Qutb, Banna) made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of all nations and societies, including the state of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> present right next to them which was founded upon the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the Salaf. To this end, they brought the political philosophies of the non-Muslims into the ranks of the Muslims, and worked strategies to ferment ideological revolutions in the land in which the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> was the foundation and the ahkaam and <a href='tags/hudood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>hudood</font></a> were established (despite deficiencies). The gormless Hawalians committed a further atrocity by trying to compare these 20th century ignoramuses, seekers of the thrones of power and authority, tainted with western materialist secular political philosophies and a secular materialist reading of history, with great giants like Ibn Hajar and al-Nawawi, who had real and true knowledge and served the ummah greatly (see <a href=index1cf0.html?rangs >here</a> and <a href=index8fea.html?pewxy >here</a>).    <P>
So if you are wise and respect your intelligence, do not be deceived by those who come out in the name of refutation of the Ash'arites, its just a veil and a cover. Their true and real allegiance lies with the Ash'arites, <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, Hassan al-Banna and their methodologies of reform (taken from the politics of the non-Muslims) and they do resent the da'wah of al-Albani, <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a>, and <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a> considering it passive, defeatist and so on. This is what they truly believe in their  souls and it is written all over their actions, and the tongue of their disposition, and the severity of their hatred and disdain of those who did not join their ranks or spoke against them and exposed their deviation. Overtly they make a display of association with these Scholars because not doing so is not conducive for their Ikhwani da'wah. </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a> on Shart Kamal, Shart Sihhah, <a href='tags/imaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaan</font></a> and <a href="tags/irjaa.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Irjaa</font></a></font>    <P>
In his explanation of the 34th hadith in an-Nawawi's al-Arba'in, <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> said:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/uthaymin-shart-sihhah.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
This translates as:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And there is no need for  us to say what is circulating now, between the youth and the students  of knowledge: Are actions from the perfection of eemaan or from the validity of eemaan? There is no need for this question, meaning that a person asks you and says: Are actions a condition of perfection of eemaan or a condition of the  validity of eemaan?</blockquote>    <P>
This was not initiated except by the Jamaa'ah of <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> who was the first [along with Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaliq] to accuse those not making <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the rulers with <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a>. This bandwagon was then led by his students, chief amongs them <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a>. They raised these issues and then started attacking Imaam  al-Albani after isolating some of his statements. In particular his position on the one who abandons prayer, and other matters related to <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, as well has his speaking with this issue of shart kamal and shart sihhah.     <P>
The da'wah of Ikhwan is antithetical to the da'wah of al-Albani and al-Albani called to tasfiyah and tarbiyah. For this reason, he pointed out what is contained in the books of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> of deviations, such as the statement of wahdat al-wujood. When he did this, he was subject to a organization level boycott by the Ikhwaan (read all about it <a href=index49db.html?vqtmh >here</a> and <a href=index38cd.html?hmoxm >here</a>). So this attack upon al-Albani and his da'wah (which is the da'wah of Ahl al-Sunnah) is not without history and background. <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> found some stooges in the form of Hawali, Awdah and others who were tutored through the 80s prior to the Gulf War, who were used to propagate the Leninist methodology of his brother (<b>social and political justice through through an ideological, leading to a physical revolution</b>). All of the Scholars (Al-Albani, <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a>, <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a> etc.) eventually exposed these stooges  by the turn of the new century after a decade of turmoil following the Gulf war. There is plenty of evidence in the rest of this site in this regard, and this movement, spawned by the Ash'arites of <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> in <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a>, was identified and referred to as <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> (by Shaykh <a href='tags/al-fawzan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/fawzan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Fawzan</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> and many others prior to them).    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We say to him: <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> (radiallaahu anhum) are more noble than you, more knowledgeable than you, and more eager than you for goodness. And they did not ask the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) this question. Therefore, what suffices them suffices you.    <P>
<b>When evidence shows a person leaves Islam by this action then it becomes a condition for the validity (sihhah) of eemaan. And when evidence shows that he does not exit (Islaam) it becomes a condition of the perfection (kamaal) of eemaan. The topic has ended.</b></blockquote>    <P>
Here, the axe has fallen on the Gormless Hawalians who to this day are still muttering "shart kamaal, shart sihhah, al-Albani took it from Ibn Hajar, so he did have some aspect of <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a> at least." These are just the ramblings of rodents on a shipwreck who were washed ashore by the sheer power of the defence of the Scholars of al-Albani. Left in ruins and deserted on their forums, they mutter these statements out of reminiscence of the days gone by in the 90s when <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> had not discovered the truth about Hawali, Awdah and others who allied with the <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> agitators and their Leninist methodologies in order to cause turmoil in the land to tear the youth away from the true and real scholars.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for trying to contend and refute and make disputation, such that whoever opposes you, you say this one is a Murji' and whoever agrees with you, you are pleased with him, and if he adds, you say this one is from the Khawaarij, then this is not correct.</blockquote>    <P>
It was <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and his bandwagon who initiated this matter, and they were the first to raise these issues and as it has been rightly said by some of the people of knowledge, it was from Safar al-Hawali's qillat ul-'aql (deficiency in intellect) that he used the issue of the abandonment of prayer in order make the accusation of <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a> against Imaam al-Albani.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>For this reason, my counsel to the youth and students of knowledge is that you leave investigation of this matter, and that we say: What Allaah, the Exalted and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) have made a condition for the validity of eemaan and its remaining, then it is condition, and whatever has not [been made a condition], then no, [and through this] we settle the matter</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
That really is the absolute end of this matter, and since the guillotine has come down on this cadaver (dead body) for good, we can clean up efficiently:    <P>
<ul><li> Imaam al-Albaani for all of his life has been defending the actions of the Sunnah and explaining that they are from eemaan.    <P>
<li> The view of the abandonment of prayer (while affirming its obligation) not being major kufr (to those who hold that) is not an issue that can be used to make the accusation of <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a> since this is a fiqh position and not one that pertains to <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> or eemaan itself, since those who hold this view from Ahl al-Sunnah affirm that actions are from eemaan. Those who erroneously used it as matter pertaining to the creedal discussion of emaan and <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a> were a sect of the <a href='tags/khawarij.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Khawarij</font></a> called the Mansuriyyah - and that's who <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and al-Hawali were following in their innovated saying.    <P>
<li> Al-Albani, like Shaykh Ibn Ibraaheem and others, classifies kufr as a) al-kufr  al-i'tiqaadee (kufr of  belief, or major disbelief) and b) al-kufr al-'amali. In the first he includes <u>beliefs</u>, <u>statements</u> and <u>actions</u> which expel from Islaam and in the second he includes actions which do not expel from Islaam. Gormless <a href='tags/qutbi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi</font></a> Hawalians were not able to grasp his speech on this subject and on that of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, it confused them, because they could not separate between the various classifications of kufr used and that in the speech of the scholars one needs to be aware of how they classify kufr, because this allows the determination of their intent behind their discussions on the subject.    <P>
<li> Likewise, Gormless <a href='tags/qutbi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi</font></a> Hawalians, deficient in intellect,    wrongly interpreted his statements to do with the barriers and conditions of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> (ilm, qasd) and the ruling upon an action as to whether it is kufr or not and through this, they accused al-Albani with the <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a> of Jahm bin Safwan.    <P>
<li> Al-Albani was refuting the Hanafi Murjites for expelling actions from eemaan whilst the bandwagon of al-Hawali were either in nappies or not even born.  </ul>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Finally, after a Sunni, Salafi, Imaam affirms that eemaan consists of belief, speech and action, that it increases and decreases, and that exception (istithnaa') in eemaan is permissible, and that kufr is belief, speech and action - the use of the phrases "shart kamal" and "shart sihhah" is purely a technical issue. Upon Shaykh al-Albani's classification (that kufr of belief includes <u>beliefs</u>, <u>statements</u> and <u>outward actions</u> which are said to be such because of the <i>talaazum</i> between the outward and the inward - and that kufr of action is whatever is besides kufr of belief), then when he says the individual actions are shart kamal, then he means that the absence of such individual actions (which in his view are not from the major kufr as just defined) does not invalidate eeman, but makes it deficient. So in reality, his view is absolutely the same as the rest of Ahl al-Sunnah, its just a matter of deciphering their classifications and terminologies. And this is the very matter that <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> has just explained.    <P>
This is very different the contemporary <a href='tags/murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Murji'ah</font></a> from the Maturidiyyah who say emaan is tasdiq (belief) and iqraar (speeech) only and who may use the phrase "shart kamal" <u>The two are not the same</u>. So the issue is not the use of these terms in and of themselves which do contain a degree of ambiguity, but what is intended by the one using them. And here we have <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> using these terms shart sihhah shart kamaal in exactly the same way as <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a>. If only these <b>gormless by-products of the Ash'arites of <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> (Banna and Qutb)</b> had any grasp or sense of justice, they would have saved themselves from having to answer to Allaah on the day when neither wealth nor offspring will avail. For how much turmoil they brought into this da'wah - may Allah fight them - and then they have the audacity to lay the blame on their opponents from the followers of the methodology of the Prophets for causing turmoil.</div>    <P>
