<font class='titleHeadline'>Sajid Kayum and the Amwaat.Morg Slanderhouse</font>    <P>
Sajid Kayum is the owner / operator of a forum and website that was established in the late 1990s and is affiliated with a group known as "Ahl al-Hadeeth Youth Association" and also "Iyhaa al-Turaath." These are Ikhwani organizations wearing the mask of Salafiyyah making a broad generalized attachment of the Salafi Scholars and whose statements, rulings and advices they often misconstrue and take out of context to justify their intense hatred and enmity towards Salafis who value clarity in their <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, manhaj and da'wah. <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> and those with him (in Kuwait) began to follow <a href='tags/abdullah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah al-Farsee</font></a> (<a href=indexd7ab.html?kgihm >see one small part of his reality here</a>) in the late 1990s who led them to believe Imaam al-Albaani (rahimahullaah) had <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a> (see more on al-Farsee below). What has happened historically is that this slanderhouse forum <u>has attracted many different networks and pockets of people</u> who are characterized with <u>a)</u> cowardice, <u>b)</u> weak or introvert personalities, <u>c)</u> diseased with personal grievances, <u>d)</u> holding onto unhealthy resentments because certain personal agendas clothed with an outer layer of "da'wah work" were not decreed by Allaah to be successful for them. As a result, this forum became a gathering place for diseased hearts that needed an outlet for their frustration, anger and resentment. In short, these are <b><u>wimps</u></b> who do not have the manhood to come up to any of these callers <u>face to face</u> and make such accusations or to bring up and discuss their grievances. <b>From here began the long history of posting alleged sins, slanders, speaking about the personal lives, and even families of many of the callers (du'aat), accusing them of fornication, adultery and other major sins all from unnamed people hiding behind these forums</b>. This is despite the fact that fornication and adultery require <u>four witnesses</u> who have actually witnessed the event <u>with their eyes</u> or a person admitting that he has actually committed the act of fornication or adultery after verification that this person making the admission has not lost his faculties and is not intoxicated. And even then, it is still not permissible to spread this type of news amongst the Believers. The activities of these people even reached the level of making <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of some of the Salafi callers and comparing some of them with hypocrites such as Abdullah bin Ubayy. <b>Such was the level of ghaydh (raging anger) in the hearts of some of these sick people - no doubt this reaches the level of a serious and fatal disease of the heart needing urgent psychological and psychiatric help</b>. This activity has been allowed to continue by this <u>hypocritical coward</u> known as <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> for well over 10 years. This is a matter so well-known and firmly established it does not even require any documentation (however, we do have everything saved nevertheless!). Further, some of the brothers who were slandered wrote emails to this forum owned and operated by <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> but to no avail. Worse still, these gross slanders and lies have subsequently been taken by <u>the greatest enemies</u> of the Salafi da'wah, from the <b><a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a></b> and <b><a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a></b> and <b>Soofiyya</b>h and <b>Khawaarij</b> and others, and further used to attack those callers and to prevent others from the Salafi da'wah. <b>All of this will be on the shoulders of this coward on the Day of Judgement and likewise each participant on that slanderhouse will bear his own burden. Further, the subsequent transmission of these lies in the forums of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Soofiyyah and Khawaarij - enemies of the da'wah of Ahl al-Sunnah will multiply the burdens of all those involved, multiple times over, what an evil condition and state to meet one's Lord!</b> The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<i>The servant speaks words, the consequences of which he does not realize, and for which he is sent down into the depths of the Fire further than the distance between the east and the west</i>." Related by al-Bukhari and in a version of al-Tirmidhi, "<i>The servant says something that he thinks is harmless, and for which he will be plunged into the depths of the Fire as far as seventy autumns</i>."     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Who is Abdullah al-Farsee?</font>    <P>
We don't have time for any comprehensives here but in short: <b>An ignorant, confused, unstable individual who will flip unexpectedly</b>. He's that bold that he will even make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> (like he did of Abdur-Raheem  Tahhaan), then do a backflip and take it back very shortly thereafter indicating his jahl of the usool (foundations) and dawaabit (principles) of Ahl al-Sunnah. He had a stretch in the mid 1990s when he was refuting the new face of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen such as <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a>, <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, Nasir al-Umar, Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq and others (<a href=indexc7a5.html?qizzj>see this article</a> to read a transcript of lecture he gave around 1996). Then in the late 1990s he got close to <a href='tags/ihyaa-al-turaath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ihyaa al-Turaath</font></a> and changed colors. Al-Turaath is an Ikhwani organization showing two faces, one of Salafiyyah outwardly, and the other of Ikhwaniyyah inwardly. It deceives some of the Salafi scholars with its Salafi face whilst continuing to push its Ikhwani methodologies through its activities in the background. Al-Farsee fell into the snares of people like Muhammad <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> and others and began to ascribe al-Irjaa' to al-Albaani in the late 1990s. Over time his reality became more and more apparent until recently he has become <u>a distinguished poster</u> on the forum of Ali al-Halabi despite being his opponent and disputant (even if they hate each other's guts, the people of desires have utility from each other when it comes to attacking Salafis!). He has scores of calamities which are a witness against himself and his unstable wavering heart. As an  example, on that forum he praises or defends some of the callers to innovation such as: <b><a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a></b> - hypocritical <a href='tags/qutbi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi</font></a>, wrote a book on the  <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> [intended against the Quranic commentary work of contemporary <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> al-Muhammad al-Sabuni], but praises an even greater <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> (<a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>) whose <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> commentary contains much more tajahhum than that of al-Sabuni, yet he lauds <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> as an Imaam of Guidance and out of sheer hypocrisy does not show that boldness in defending the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the Salaf from the calamities in Qutb's commentary. <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> became a plaything for his teacher, <u><a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></u> who used al-Hawali to attack those who opposed the Ikhwan and criticised his brother <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> such as Imaam al-Albaani. This is where the accusation of <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a> originated from these people, when al-Albani refuted <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> for speaking with wahdatul-wujood. In turn <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> used his stooges to start attacking Shaykh al-Albaani. <b><a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a></b> - calling for nearness and cooperation with <a href='tags/shiites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shi'ites</font></a>, Sufis and Liberalists [as part of the 21st century Ikhwani agenda]. <b><a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a></b> - an Ikhwani with errors in matters of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, calls to understanding with <a href='tags/shiites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shi'ites</font></a> of <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a>. <b>Nabil al-Awadi</b> - a Turathi, Ikhwani, commends the Raafidee Hizbollah for some of their activities, makes excuses for non-Iranian Raafidis, makes <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> an independent fourth category [Ibn Uthaymin declared such a person an innovator and ignoramus], his errors were mentioned to Shaykh al-Ghudayaan who said the cassettes of such a person should not be listened to. <b>Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq</b> - the Hassan al-Banna of the late 20th century, an innovator, makes splitting in the deen of Allaah lawful, innovated a fourth category for <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> (and was hastily slapped down by all the major scholars in their fatwas on this topic), split Salafis in many places in the world by bringing an Ikhwani manhaj to them packaged with the label of Salafiyyah, as part of his wider Ikhwani agenda. <b>Muhammad Hassan</b> - Egyptian <a href='tags/qutbi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi</font></a>, upon the manhaj of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen. <b>Abdul-Hamid Kishk</b> (Sufi, <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> from Egypt), al-Farsee ascribes Salafiyyah to him! <b>This is Abdullah al-Farsee</b>. Yet on the other hand he belittles or attacks other Shaykhs who refute these aforementioned Ikhwanis out of defence and veneration of the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and manhaj. From here, the disease of these ignorant youth should be apparent from the disease of al-Farsee, their teacher. It is for this reason they have always spread doubts against <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> (hafidhahullaah) with lies and slanders - but the Scholars defended <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> from these people - see Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen's  (rahimahullaah) defence by way of example ((see   <a href=indexb09a.html?epluy>here</a> and <a href=index01b7.html?ebhen>here</a>).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Sajid Kayum, Exposing Alleged Sins of Other Muslims and Rank, Stinking Hypocrisy</font>    <P>
Once all the above is understood, we are in a position to understand the reality of this <u>hypocritical individual</u>. He recently reposted an admonition regarding exposing the sins of others in his Facebook account:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/sq-expose-sins.gif width=860 border=1 border=0>    <P>
The Facebook post was linked to an article, you can view a screenshot of the article here: <a href=assets/images/sq-sins-article.gif>Do Not Expose the Sins of Your Fellow Muslims</a>. And it is reproduced below in text form.  </blockquote>  </div>  <blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Article Posted on Exposing Sins</font>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Do NOT EXPOSE Sins and Errors of your fellow Muslims!</b>    <P>
To further what we stressed upon in the last note about keeping one's sins a secret... <b>If we become aware of SOMEONE else's SIN or ERROR, we should keep it a SECRET too! </b>    <P>
Allah's Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) encouraged this when he said: "...<b>he, who covers a Muslim (meaning his sins, mistakes and shortcomings), Allah will cover him in the Dunya (world) and in the Hereafter</b>" [Saheeh Muslim (2699)] and the the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) also warned against exposing our fellow Muslims saying: "<b>Do NOT put the Muslims to shame</b> (by exposing their faults/sins), for he, who follows (seeks out) the errors of his brother, <b>Allah will follow his errors</b>, and he whom Allah follows his errors, <b>He will EXPOSE him</b>, even if he was in the midst of his home." [Mishkat (5044) - Saheeh al-Jamee] Our wrongdoings being exposed causes embarrassment, and the fear of being humiliated is amongst those crucial causes, which deter us from committing sins! However, if the sinner knows that the people are already aware of his sins; he does not experience the same agitation and shame as before - <b>and this might even encourage him to commit sins openly! It might also reduce the chances of him regretting and making Tawbah (repentance)!</b> So, if someone becomes aware of another's sins or shortcomings, then he should NOT EXPOSE him. Allah, the Exalted, has not only condemned committing sins but He has also condemned those, who mention sins in public; "Verily, those who like that Fahishah (evil-talk) should be circulated among those who believe, <b>they will have a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter</b>" [Soorah an-Nur (24): 19] - (this warning is for), those who like to see evil talk about them (i.e., the believers) appear (in public). [See, Tafseer Ibn Katheer] Pointing fingers is so very common nowadays! We have to remember ourselves, and also remind others that Allah's Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) not only discouraged revealing one's own sins in public; but he (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) has also STRONGLY discouraged exposing others!!</blockquote>    <P>
We need to understand the implication of this article which <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> reposted. First we will address the issue of the actual sins committed by a Believer and the ruling of Allaah and His Mesenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) with respect to them and the explanations of the Salaf and of the Scholars of the Ummah. Then we will take a look the type of filth that the Slanderhouse Master (<a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a>) allows to be posted on his forums - something even Rupert Murdoch would be proud of. And from this we will understand the reality of this individual and his fake display of concern for the honours of other Muslims.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Regarding Actual Sins Committed by a Believer</font>    <P>
The severe threats and warnings in the revealed texts cited in this short article reposted by the gross hypocritical coward, <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a>, apply to <u>actual sins committed by a believer</u>.

Imaam al-Sa'dee says in his tafseer of this verse:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>"<b>Verily, those who like that <i>al-faahishah</i> should be propagated</b>", meaning (by al-faahishah) grave, repugnant and reprehensible affairs (i.e. acts of sin), so (such people being referred to) like it (in their hearts) that [knowledge of] such faahishah should become widespread "<b>amongst those who believe, they will have a painful torment</b>..." Meaning, painful to the heart and body. This is due to his treachery towards his Muslim brothers, and liking evil for them, and boldly attacking their honours. So when this threat is for merely liking (in the heart) that al-faahishah should be spread (about a believer), and for the heart being delighted by that, then how about what is greater than that of actually bringing it out openly and transmitting it? Irrespective of whether the faahishah (act in question) actually occurred or not.</blockquote>    <P>
<u>Al-Imaam Al-Bukhaaree</u> brings a chapter in his book Al-Adabul-Mufrad titled: "<b>Those who hear about an illicit act and spread it</b>." He brings the statement of Alee ibn Abee Taalib: "<i>The one starts the speech about an illicit act, and the one who spreads it are equal in sin</i>." Also on the authority of 'Ataa who said: "<i>There is a punishment for the one who circulates speech of illicit acts even if he has spoken truthfully</i>." On the authority of Khaalid ibn Mi'daan who said: "<i>Whoever informs the people about what his eyes have seen, or his ears have heard, then he is from those who love that illicit acts be propagated amongst those who believe</i>." And al-Albaanee (rahimahullaah) graded all of them saheeh (<a href=http://www.salafitalk.net/st/viewmessages.cfm?Forum=6&amp;Topic=2991>see full thread here</a>).     <P>
This indicates that <u>these people who post on these forums</u> have been mentioned by Allaah, the Exalted in His Book and they have been mentioned by the Salaf in their explanation of this verse. So when it is the case that even if one of these people <u>had actually seen with his own eyes or heard with his own ears</u> another Muslim committing a sin and then began to spread it, he is under this very severe threat. <u>However</u>, what we are dealing with here are slanders, fabrications, lies and alleged sins based upon hearsay which are publicized online and which are approved (threads are moderated) on the forums that <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> runs. No doubt, the punishment for this is even more severe! And it does not end there either. The threat of punishment in the verse is for those who merely (<span class='arb'>&#1610;&#1615;&#1581;&#1616;&#1576;&#1615;&#1617;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614;</span>), "love, or like" <u>in their hearts</u> that (knowledge of) al-faahishah should be spread. As for those who actually spread it, then their punishment is even more severe, and from Allaah is the refuge! As for the one who maintains a platform where this type of action is given the green light (because he actually moderates and approves of such posts) then his punishment is actually multiplied many times over. This is like the comparison between the one who drinks alcohol and the one who does not drink alcohol necessary but loves that others should do so and opens a venue for its propagation and drinking. Even though he himself may not touch a drop, the burden on his shoulders is much greater. <b>Such is the example of this hypocritical, disgusting coward who loves that such matters should be spread amongst the Muslims about other Muslims.</b>    <P>

Rather, any speech about individuals will only ever be in relation to oppositions in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and manhaj (or open calling to sin, such as the one who calls Muslims to drink, listen to music, fornicate the likes - which walhamdulillaah is very rare). As for one who commits sins that others may see or hear or come to learn about,  then the Salafi forums do not ever use these as points to attack an individual. This in itself is a clear proof that people such as <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> and the diseased of heart gathered together in his slanderhouse are the greatest of hypocrites (in their actions) when for example they speak of the book of Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin al-Abbaad, "<i>Rifqan Ahl al-Sunnah bi Ahl il-Sunnah</i>" yet they are the greatest of wilful and stubborn opposers to it with their vile actions.</b>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Istihlaal of What Allaah Made Haraam?</font>    <P>
It is firmly established that this action of spreading al-faahishah amongst the believers is haraam, and its explanation is explicitly clear in the speech of the Salaf and the Scholars of the Sunnah as has preceded. Therefore these people who engage in this activity on the forums of <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> under his watchful eye (and <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> himself) can be from one of two groups of people:    <P>
<ul><li> <u>A group</u> who deems it to be halaal (lawful) in the Sharee'ah of Allaah to engage in this activity. This is making halaal  what Allaah made haraam and is major kufr. So if  - in the presence of his knowledge of this aayah and its explanation by the Sahabah, Tabi'ieen and the Scholars and after the Scholars have refuted the misconception of legitimizing this act through the claim of it being  "<a href=http://www.salafitalk.net/st/viewmessages.cfm?Forum=6&amp;Topic=2991>permissible backbiting of the faasiq</a>" - a person still believes that <u>it is lawful in the Shari'ah of Allaah</u> for him to make accusations of <i>al-faahishah</i> without having four witnesses who have seen the act with their eyes or without a determined specific self-admission of the act from the person in question, <b>or that it is lawful in the Shari'ah of Allaah to spread this amongst the Muslims (<i>even if it were true</i>)</b> then we do not doubt about the kufr of whoever is upon this of making halaal what Allaah made haraam. (This is <i>takfir bil-itlaaq</i> and <i>takfir bil-wasf</i> and is not <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of any individual in particular - just an explanation that this is major kufr).    <P>
<li> <u>A group</u> that knows what they are doing is wrong and do not consider this act permissible as matter of belief but the filthiness in their souls has polluted their mental faculties and dominated their hearts leading them to transgress <u>even beyond the act</u> for which the verse made a threat in the first place (i.e. those who merely "like or love" in their hearts that al-faahishah should be spread) and actually go on to bring these affairs into the open and spread them practically and physically. And further, the Scholars explain that this verse applies to actual sins committed (as in even if a believer did commit the sin, the threat still applies). <u>How then when we are dealing with mere allegations, hearsay and slanders from unknown, unnamed individuals!</u> Glad tidings to these people of the threat of Allaah in the verse (24:19) and refuge is with Allaah!</ul>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Refutation of Their Attachment To the Saying of Imaam al-Nawawi (rahimahullaah): </b>There is nothing in al-Nawawi's permitted six forms of backbiting which justifies the evil actions of these people. Regarding that which they cite from the fourth permissible type, which al-Nawawi divides into a further four types, he says, "<b>The Fourth: Warning the Muslims from evil, and giving them advice</b>..." and he mentions a) disparagement of the narrators of hadeeth and those giving witness (in disputes, judgements), b) when consulted about suitability of a person in terms of company, doing trade and so on, c) when seeing a student visiting and taking knowledge from an innovator or open sinner and he fears this person will be harmed, so he gives him nasihah with the condition that he intends sincere advice and then he mentions <u>the fourth one</u> - and this is the one being used by these people to justify their evil, disgraceful actions which Shaytaan has made them believe they will be rewarded for - so al-Nawawi says,     <P>

And from them is that when he has authority (wilayah) which he does not fulfil in the desired manner, either because he is not qualified for it, or he is an open sinner (faasiq) or he is heedless and the likes. So it is obligatory to mention that to the one who has a general authority over him so that he can remove him and place one who is fit, or so that he (the one to whom complaint is made) comes to know of this so he can deal with him  (the one being backbitten in this instance) in accordance to what his situation requires and so that he (the one with general authority being complained to) is not deceived by him (the one being complained against), and so that he strives to encourage him to rectify his condition, or to replace him.</blockquote>    <P>
So here, al-Nawawi mentions that this matter is referred to one who has general authority in the matter. Opening blogs, and making forum posts and spreading matters to the whole world does not enter into this. And the purpose behind taking it to such a person with general authority is that either the one being spoken of can be removed or advised to mend his ways by the one with that general authority. Now, this means that there is a certain code of conduct for the one who is going to backbite (in this type of situation) and there is nothing in that code of conduct which allows standing on top of houses, or outside mosques, and in the marketplaces (if we were living hundreds of years ago for example), or on blogs, forums, emails and the likes in our times. Whoever is claiming that al-Nawawi's statement here would justify a person (in the time of al-Nawawi) to stand outside mosques, on top of houses and in the markets in order to scream about the alleged fornication of a mosque Imaam for example, or any other iniquity, then he is a liar. And as for the one who actually did this act (as in openly spread this type of thing), it is known to everyone how such a person would be dealt with by the qaadees and rulers (whether he was right or wrong).  And this makes the way of these people very clear in that their action is nothing but mischief and corruption, and they are not ruling by what Allaah revealed in this matter, but by their desires. All of this should be understood within the broader context of the evil of spreading (information) of <i>al-faahishah</i> amongst those who believe, as has preceded in the verse in Surah al-Nur. This indicates clearly that even <u>the general spirit</u> of what these people are doing has no basis and it is not in lines of what Imaam al-Nawawi has actually clarified.  </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Sajid Kayum and "Tabloid Journalism"</font>    <P>
Sajid Kayum often uses this phrase "Tabloid Journalism" - intending by that what is found on the Salafi forums of criticism and refutation of callers and individuals. The world should know  that the following <u>tabloid journalism</u> was spread through his forums with his full knowledge and all of these are attacks against other Muslims in particular some of the Salafi callers or other than them. In fact, even after many of the Major Scholar's opinions were published on this disgusting activity on this vile forum <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> still did not remove this material and it remained there (Allaah knows best for how long). All these individual posts and threads are <u>saved with their timestamps</u> and authors:     <P>
<blockquote> "<i>...We say again that the narrations of the moviegoers arent accepted (sitdown and grab some popcorn) The fisq of the movies,musical soundtracks,naked women and men, and tasweer no doubt might cause you to pervert and distort narrations...</i>" and "<i>...So what do you when the newscaster with the big breasts and tight blouse comes on...</i>" and "<i>...[name] likes the movies and to taste women too...</i>" and "<i>...also in germantown there was a known fornicator who admitted he was a zani and the women he was with admitted as well,and he impregnated a muslim sister who lived right next door to the masjid...</i>" and "<i>...Another brother who took a muslim sister to the bahamas and bragged how she gave him oral sex on the plane and when they arrived many nights of sex...</i>" and "<i>Then the issue of him requesting the walley of a sister he wanted to marry, to leave the room from there she accused him of fondling her and then he wanted to see her hair the waleey became upset and [name] refuted the waleey publicly and the waleey left salafeeyah.Then there's [name] with the same sort of sickness being infaduated with american movies,and [name] with his controversial divorce of a pakistanian sister directly after he consumated the marriage.

Known and wanted criminal, known Fornicator in and outside of America...</i>"</blockquote>    <P>
Are we reading one of Rupert Murdoch's tabloid newspapers? <u>This is only a small selection</u>. There are hundreds more statements from the many years that this type of activity has been allowed to take place by <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a>, keeping in mind that since 2004 posts have been moderated and are personally approved before appearing and these types of attacks upon the Salafi callers have not ceased but continued. When <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> brandishes this word "<i>tabloid journalism</i>", the stink of hypocrisy is strong enough to knock you out stone cold and leave you with a persistent migraine for weeks on end.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Sajid Kayum: A Witness Against His Own Self</font>    <P>
Alhamdulillaah, through his own actions this individual has been exposed and his blatant hypocrisy has been made clear to the world at large. Each day that every slander, lie and allegation posted on that forum is read and propagated, the burden increases and increases on his shoulders and those who participate in this filth, what an evil maqaam (station) to be in! In his Facebook picture above, <a href='tags/sajid-kayum.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sajid Kayum</font></a> has a child with him, it is only out of <u>pure mercy and compassion</u> that we ask Allaah to save and protect this child (and any others he may have) from his <i>khubth</i> (vileness, filthiness of being pleased and satisfied that such filth should have been spread and divulged) and that He makes them righteous upright Salafis, unaffected by this <i>khubth</i>, ameen.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>As for the Salafis and Their Websites...</font>    <P>
Alhamdulillaah, <u>the Salafi websites and forums are free of any of this type of filth</u>, and even if they knew with certainty about the sins and crimes of any of those whom they otherwise criticize for errors in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> or manhaj then because they judge to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of His Messenger <b>you will not find any of this filth on their websites and forums walhamdulillaah</b>. Their only crime is that they are open and up-front about their manhaj and explain that it is one of clarity and openness and that they refute and criticize the false claimants to Salafiyyah in our times who spread Ikhwani principles to Salafi audiences and those in whose behaviour and walaa and baraa there is blatant contradiction to the Salafi way. But because individuals such as <b><a href='tags/abdullaah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullaah al-Farsee</font></a></b> actually praise and defend these fake claimants to Salafiyyah and these callers to Ikhwaniyyah and callers to nearness and cooperation with the enemies of Allaah, the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a> and other than them, and these individuals have been refuted and exposed by <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> and other scholars - this is the crime that has turned the Salafis into "Ghulaat" (extremists). And then these people in turn allow the type of <b><u>tabloid journalism</u></b> we have just witnessed to take place on their forums - all the while they claim we are "<i>ghulaat</i>" and they are the just, moderate ones!    <P>
