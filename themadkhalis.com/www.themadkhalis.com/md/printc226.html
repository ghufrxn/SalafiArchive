<font class='titleHeadline'>Understanding the Propensity of the Extremist <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> in Defending Falsehood</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> are claiming that <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> repented from his attacks upon the <a href='tags/sahaabah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sahaabah</font></a>, which is an empty claim, devoid of evidences, and the reason why this claim is fraudulent and cannot be sustained is because Qutb's attacks upon <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> Uthmaan, <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, Amr bin al-Aas and the Bani Umayyah were from <b>an ideological conviction</b> derived from the notion of "<a href="tags/social-justice.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Social Justice</font></a>", which came from his Marxist-Socialist-Communist background. So they have no proof unless they bring something that meets the guidelines of a proper repentance (see below).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>So when he was refuted by Allaamah <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> in 1952, <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> responded, defending himself and his stance, and accusing <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> of having impure intentions and of creating tribulation(!), and although he, at a later stage, modified some of the wording, the essence of his position (of malice and hatred and resentment) towards those Companions did not change. And this continued in his books. And his defence was along the lines that the actions of Uthman, <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, Amr bin al-Aas and the Bani Umayyah, cannot be left attributed to Islam, and thus it is necessary to clear and absolve Islam from their actions.</div>    <P>
To learn more about this ideological conviction of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, refer to the following articles:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>Salaah al-Khaalidee</b>: <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> Drank Heavily From the Western Materialist Philosophies Which Led Him To Doubt Islam for 15 Years - (<a href=indexb832.html?edera>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Readings in Elementary Communism</b>: <a href='tags/karl-marx.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karl Marx</font></a>, Freidrich Engels, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, Capitalism, the State, <a href='tags/social-justice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Social Justice</font></a>, Revolution and the <a href='tags/communist-manifesto.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Communist Manifesto</font></a> - (<a href=indexbee3.html?dsppw>see here</a>)  <li> <b>A Picture Paints (Characterizes)  a Thousand Qutbis</b>: <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/abu-ala-mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu A'la <a href="tags/mawdudi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mawdudi</font></a></font></a>, the <a href='tags/rafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rafidah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/iranian-revolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Iranian Revolution</font></a> - (<a href=indexc150.html?oyama>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Sayyid <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and the Revolution</b> Organized in <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a>  Against the Third Khalifah Uthman bin Affaan - (<a href=index4d9d.html?elmbe>see here</a>)</ul>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Requirements of a True Repentance</font>    <P>
Qutb's response to <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> and his persistence upon his ideological conviction regarding those Companions proves that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> did not change, and he did not remove the malice in his heart. Further, if the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> are claiming he repented, then altering some words does not constitute repentance, rather a true repentance is characterized in:     <P>
<ul>  <li> Immediate cessation of the act   <li> Feeling of remorse   <li> Resolve not to do it again   <li> And where it involves the right of others (i.e. Uthman, <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, Amr bin al-Aas), then their right has to be returned, and their honors exonerated, with a refutation of and recantation from one's transgression  <li> And verbally seeking forgiveness from Allaah, and repenting to Him.</ul>    <P>
That's a sign of a true repentance. We will give the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> <u>three years from today's date</u>, 29th January 2010 to provide us with this Sharee'ah repentance that is ascribed to <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> from his attacks against <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>. <P>

This is what he said in <u>the 5th edition</u>.     <P>
In the book "<i><a href='tags/al-adaalah-al-ijtimaaiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Adaalah al-Ijtimaa'iyyah</font></a></i>" (1993CE/1413H, Dar ash-Shurooq), there is a small introduction (p. 5) by <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, which is signed and dated March 1954CE, and in this edition there were some changes in wording. It should be noted that the last edition before Qutb's death was the 6th edition, and that is the one that has continued to be reprinted as further editions. We have with us the <u>13th edition</u> at this point in time.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>For your own <b>corroboration and verification of the facts</b>, you can download the 13th edition right here: <a href=assets/docs/qutb-adaalah-ijtimaaiyyah.pdf>Download the book in PDF format</a>. <b>Update to article:</b> The PDF in this link is the 13th edition, not the 12th, the 12th edition is dated 1989CE/1409H.</div>    <P>
Qutb writes (p. 160-161):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qutb-revolution-uthman-1.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And towards the end, tumult was stirred up against Uthmaan, and in which truth became mixed with falsehood, and good with evil. However, it is vital for the one who looks at the affairs through the eye of Islaam, and perceives the affairs through the spirit of Islaam <b>that he affirms that that revolution, in its generality, was an outburst of the spirit of Islaam</b>, and this is without ignoring the plot of Ibn Saba' - upon him be the curse of Allaah - that was behind it. </blockquote>    <P>
Here, <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> describes the revolution that Ibn Saba' al-Yahudi instigated, ideologically and practically, against Uthmaan, as something that was a manifestation of <u>the real and true spirit of Islaam</u> - <b>which is that spirit fused with Marxist Communist notions of "<a href="tags/social-justice.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Social Justice</font></a>" with a (<span class='arb'>&#1605;&#1586;&#1610;&#1580;&#1575; &#1603;&#1575;&#1605;&#1604;&#1575;</span>), and the spectacles of which <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> is looking through towards <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> when he speaks about them</b> - and <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> described it as such whilst making full admission that it was a revolution instigated by Ibn Saba'. So while he avers the fact that it was plotted by Ibn Saba' he actually agrees with it and is content with it, and considers it in line with the Islamic spirit (of justice). And instead of pouring his scorn upon those vagabonds who made the revolution against Uthmaan, he is actually justifying it and describing it as "an outburst of the spirit of Islaam", which means that this revolution is closer to the spirit of Islam than the actions of Uthmaan - so we so <u>no change</u> in meaning at all.    <P>
And he also says a little later in this same edition (p. 161)    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qutb-revolution-uthman-2.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Uthmaan passed to the mercy of his Lord, and he left the Amawi State in power, by virtue of [his] placing them [in authority] upon the land, and particularly in Shaam, and by virtue of what he had put in place of the Amawi foundations that were alien to the spirit of Islam, of establishing hereditary kingship, and monopolization of maghaanim (war-booties), wealth and other utilities, from those things that brought about a convulsion in the general Islamic spirit.    <P>
And what was spread in the soul (i.e. collectively) of the subjects was no small matter - <b>whether true or false</b> - that the Khalifah was giving preference to his family (relations), and would donate hundreds of thousands to them, and would remove <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> of Allaah's Messenger so that he can put the enemies of Allaah's Messenger in place, and keep the likes of Abu Dharr far away (from authority) because he rejected the hoarding of wealth, and rejected the opulence (luxury) that the rich were steeped in, and called to the likes of what the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) call to of spending, righteousness and modesty.    <P>
And the natural result of the spread of the likes of these ideas - <b>whether true or false</b> - is that the souls would be agitated and that the souls would make presumptions, <b>and that those people whose souls have drunk [from] the spirit of the religion [in terms] of showing rejection and eschewing evil would be stirred</b>, and [likewise] that those souls that [simply] wore the gown of Islaam without it (Islaam) in all its purity, having  mixed with their hearts, would also make presumptions, those who are swept away by the desires of the world, and who saw that they should go with the flow [in taking the path] of decadence - and all of this took place in the final part of the era of Uthmaan.    <P>
And when Alee came along - may Allaah ennoble his face - it was not easy to return the affair back to its origin in its clemency. And those beneficiaries in the time of Uthmaan, and specifically Bani Umayyah, knew that Alee would not remain silent upon them, and so they  withdrew with their disposition and their expediences towards Mu'aawiyah.</blockquote>    <P>
You can see here Qutb's choice of words which contain nothing but a continued belittlement of Uthman, <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a>, Bani Umayyah and glorification of those souls who were stirred by what they saw and were led to revolt, with his full knowledge that it was all instigated by Abdullah bin Saba al-Yahudi. And note his statement "<b>whether in truth or falsehood</b>" and this is a statement that a person whose soul is pure towards <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> would never make. <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> took these stances because of the influence of his Communist Socialist Marxist background, and because of that notion of [Communist] "<a href="tags/social-justice.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Social Justice</font></a>" which led him to transgress against <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> and you will then understand why <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a>, when refuting <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> described Qutb's attacks as "<i>the resentments of the idolatrous western civilization manifesting explosively in the heart of one proclaiming defence of Islam and Jihad in its path</i>" (<a href=index0657.html?qodiy>see here</a>).     <P>
Note the fact that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> did not show anger towards the revolution led towards Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu) and nor the vagabonds who were behind it, rather he praised it, and so his ideological conviction prior to when <a href='tags/mahmood-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mahmood Shakir</font></a> refuted <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> in 1952 remained with him, and on account of it he continued his attacks and belittlements upon Uthmaan (radiallahu anhu) as you can clearly see from what is above (by way of example only).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>These attacks you are seeing against Uthmaan, Mu'aawiyah and Bani Umayyah are just the wrath of a <u>Communist Socialist Marxist</u> mind being unleashed upon "Capitalists" represented in those holding the wealth (Bayt ul-Maal) and "abusing it to maintain their power and class supremacy".

<div class='sidebar'>When these affairs transpired in the  mid-1990s, it was not until around 2002 that they had managed to trawl through all of Shaykh Rabee's cassettes and writings so that they could find anything about <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> which they could then use to attack <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> and defend <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, indicating their nifaaq (hypocrisy in action) and also the <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Extremism</font></a> of their <a href='tags/irjaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Irjaa'</font></a>, <u>for all of this activity was not for the sake of the Companions</u>, but it was for the sake of the honor of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> - to seek vengeance for the fact that Qutb's takfiri, revolutionary, rafidi orientations and methodologies that were derived from a Socialist-Marxist-Communist background, were refuted, and thus the harakah, and sahwah lost its foundational ideological works!</div>    <P>
So they found a few remarks, a few of which were valid criticisms against what were mere slips of the tongue, and the rest were just lies and fabrications.
