<div class='sidebar'><font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction and Background</font>    <P>
<blockquote><b>It is from the rule of Allaah that there is no mubtadi' (innovator) who intends evil for the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and manhaj of the Salaf and for Islam and the Muslims except that Allaah mobilizes one or more from the leading scholars of the Ummah to expose his affair so that it will not remain hidden. No mubtadi' proclaimed his bid'ah and his evil openly and tried to spread it except that a Scholar amongst the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah stood to expose his falsehood and hold him at bay. </b>    <P>
Walhamdulillaah, the Scholars and Imaams of the Salaf in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th centuries waged war against the <u>Ahl al-Kalaam</u> who brought a foreign, poisonous conceptual baggage into the Ummah. For many centuries, they assaulted them, subdued them, made plain their falsehood and their evil and authored works in refutation of their principles and doctrines and their specific callers, leaders and personalities. They stood, and at the head of them, <b>Imaam Ahmad</b>, against the inward projection into Islaam of the conceptual tools, language and terminology of a star-worshipping idolator by the name of Aristotle whose language of metaphysics (al-jawhar wal-'arad) those innovators made to be the foundational basis of debate in matters of theology which in turn led them to commit crimes against the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and the revealed texts. As a result of that great effort by those illustrious Imaams in facing up to these heretics and innovators, <u>we are blessed today</u> with knowing the correct and true Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> through the heritage of works they left in that regard and we have been saved, by Allaah's mercy firstly and then through the efforts of those Scholars of the past, from the throes of <i>ilhaad</i> (deviation) and <i>zandaqah</i> (heresy), walhamdulillaah.    <P>
Likewise in the 20th century, <b>the <u>theological descendants</u> of those heretical kalaam innovators of old, the contemporary <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> agitators and innovators [al-Banna, <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, al-Nabahani] who were grieved by the demise of <u>the <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, Maturidi, Hanafi Ottoman state</u>, they brought the <u><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></u> of atheist, secular, materialist Jews into the Ummah - that of revolution to establish <a href='tags/social-justice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Social Justice</font></a> (Marxism, <a href='tags/socialism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Socialism</font></a>, Communism) - and brought the Ummah into a new era of turmoil and chaos - the era of the innovated  "Islamic political jamaa'ah."</b> As a result of this <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i> they incorporated into their so claimed "rectification of the affairs of the Muslims", they plundered many of the great usool of Islaam and the Sunnah from which are <u>a)</u> clarification and defence of the sound Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, <u>b)</u> holding fast to the Sunnah, <u>c)</u> keeping away from innovation and its people, <u>d)</u> making walaa and baraa around all of that and <u>e)</u> making what has preceded as a basis for the true jamaa'ah of unity. They came with <u>a new meaning and definition</u> for "jamaa'ah"  which opposed that which came in the Sunnah and which was understood by Ahl al-Sunnah and their Imaams for 13 centuries of Islaam. This in turn created <b>a new level of sophistication, deception and conniving in the war of Ahl al-Bid'ah against the adherents to the Sunnah</b>. But by Allaah's praise, there arose Scholars who began to clarify the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and manhaj and distinguish it from what these jamaa'aat were upon of this new alien <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i>. From those scholars in the 20th century was Imaam al-Albaani (rahimahullaah) and his manhaj of <u><i>tasfiyah and tarbiyah</i></u> which is the manhaj alluded by Imaam Malik, "<i>the latter part of this ummah will not be rectified except what rectified its earlier part</i>, " which is in fact synonymous with <i>the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah</i>. At a time when these jamaa'aat were arising (Tabligh, Ikhwan, Tahrir, Sufiyyah etc.) Imaam al-Albaani countered that da'wah through his call to a return to the Book and the Sunnah upon the way of the Salaf and he manifested the ascription to the Salaf - how grievous to all those innovators, parties and groups.  They all came out and made war against him, the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a>, the Ikhwaan, the Soofiyyah, the Muqallidah and other factions and they despised his manhaj. Then towards the end of the 20th century, from those scholars who played and continues to play an instrumental role in defending Islam and the Sunnah from the Marxist, Socialist ideological and practical methodologies that influenced those 20th century <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, Maturidi innovators is the <u>Imaam of al-Jarh wal-Ta'deel</u> of our time, <b>Shaykh Rabee' bin Haadee al-Madkhalee</b> whose efforts are the most pronounced in protecting the deen of Allaah from the external projections of Marxist Socialist <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i> inwards into Islaam in the form of these innovated jamaa'aat whose aim is to unite everyone (irrespective of creed or orientation) into a mass in order to mobilize them into revolutions in order to - as they claim - establish "<i><a href='tags/social-justice.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Social Justice</font></a></i>" and establish "<i><a href='tags/haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haakimiyyah</font></a></i>." So <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> demolished their theoretical works, demolished their idolizing of their figureheads and leaders of misguidance and all of the false principles that clashed with the manhaj of Ahl al-Sunnah. However, every group of people has an inheritor, and just as the Mu'tazilah inherited from the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and the Kullaabiyyah inherited from the Mu'tazilah and the <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> inherited from the Kullaabiyyah, likewise there appeared those who inherited the distillation of that (Socialist, Communist, Marxist) <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i> and its associated necessities and principles clothed in the garb of Islaam and Sunnah from <b><a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a></b>, <b>Abu A'laa al-Mawdudi</b>, <b><a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></b>, <b>Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani</b> - and they are the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> of <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> who were nurtured upon the books and usool of these people and whose minds had been toyed by <b>Muhammad Qutb</b>, a dangerous <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> (<a href=index1bd3.html?muqxd>see here</a>). And likewise <b><a href='tags/abdur-rahmaan-abdul-khaaliq.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq</font></a></b>, an Egyptian Ikhwani wearing the gown of Salafiyyah whilst attempting to import that <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i> of Hassan al-Bannaa and <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> into the ranks of the Salafis. Thereafter, there has not ceased to appear figureheads of misguidance carrying this <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i> or elements of it in the form of innovated corrupt principles which clash with the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a> - just as in early Islamic history their never ceased to appear figureheads of misguidance who continued to carry the innovated kalaam and its associated corrupt usool in the Ummah for many centuries. The aim behind these principles was to compromise the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a> and its people and to open the door for the various jamaa'aat (of misguidance) to enable entry into "political work", participation in democracy as a methodology of rectification in general, populist arisings, revolutions and the likes - thinking this is the way to rectify the Ummah. These people continue to have their evil designs firmly planned and laid out just like the Jahmite <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> had a firmly determined strategy in the late 5th and through the 6th centuries to promulgate their Jahmite creed openly to the public in Baghdaad and Damascus using the medium of "wa'dh" (giving admonition). They had an institution known as the Nidhaamiyyah which supported them in this. So they dispatched a serious of sermon-givers and admonishers to these cities and they began boldly to openly call to their tajahhum, despite having been scorned and despised in the ummah previously. Such is the case with these contemporary innovators too, <u>they lie in wait like scorpions</u>, as Imaam al-Barbahari described them back in the 4th century, and they have defined plans, and they have usool and qawaa'id (foundations, principles) which they aim to propagate amongst the Salafis whom they see as the greatest barrier between them and the actualization of their so-called "<a href="tags/social-justice.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Social Justice</font></a>" and their <b><a href='tags/tawhid-al-haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid al-<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a></font></a></b> as they claim, just as those Jahmite heretics of old saw the Salafis of that time to be the greatest barrier between them and the actualization of their innovated <b>Tawhid of al-Jawhar wal-'Arad</b> (as the great Shafi'i Imaam, Ibn Suraij (d.  306H) described it).    <P>
From the greatest of such heretical, conniving, scheming contemporary innovators is the Dajjaal (arch-liar) known as <b><a href='tags/abu-al-hasan-al-maribee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ribee</font></a></b> - <u>a former Ikhwani Takfiri</u> - who left <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> for Yemen, sat with Shaykh Muqbil for around six months and made three visits to Shaykh al-Albaani (rahimahullaah) as a result of which he gained some prominence in the mid to late 1990s. Whilst the great Scholars were still alive (Albani, Bin Baz, <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a>, Muqbil), this innovator did not come out with his call but manifested Salafiyyah and won the confidence of many. But when they passed away, he announced his revolution with his false corrupt Ikhwani principles thinking he could make inroads into the Salafis, split them and bring his new "<i>vast, broad manhaj</i>" to them, all in order to aid the manhaj of al-Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen which is founded upon the practical (and ideological) elements of the philosophies of secular atheist Jews such as Marx, Engels and Lenin - and which are in fact the foundation of all 20th century so called "Islamic movements" deceptively going under the titles of "<i>jamaa'ah</i>", "<i>tahrir</i>" (liberation), "<i>adl</i>" (justice) and so on - Marxist, Socialist, Communist practical methodologies hidden behind these labels, just as "<i>jism</i>" (body), "<i>jawhar</i>" (substance), "<i>'arad</i>" (incidental attribute) are Greek philosophical conceptual terms used by the ancestors of these contemporary innovators to deceive the Muslims in the earlier centuries of Islaam regarding the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Messengers, and just as the Mu'tazilah used their slogans of "<i><a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a></i>", "<i>adl</i>", "<i>al-amr bil-ma'ruf wal-nahi anil-munkar</i>" to deceive the Muslims in a like fashion.    <P>
So <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> single-handedly - walhamdulillaah - exposed this Dajjaal, Kadhdhaab, <a href='tags/abu-al-hasan-al-maribee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ribee</font></a> and his false corrupt Ikhwani usool (foundations) at a time when many of the other Scholars of the Sunnah were unaware and still maintained good thoughts about him. Since that time - <u>a full ten years on</u> - it has become apparent, rather, it is as clear as the daylight sun, <b>that <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> was 100% correct</b>, and that the truth was with him, and that he displayed in this matter such perspicacity not found with others from the Scholars. It is for no reason that Shaykh Muqbil (rahimahullaah) said about <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> that "<i>he is a sign from the signs of Allaah in recognizing the Hizbiyyeen</i>", and Shaykh al-Albaanee said that <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> is "<i>the Imaam of al-Jarh wal-Ta'deel</i>" and that "<i>the knowledge is with him</i>" and that "<i>those who refute him do not do so upon knowledge</i>" and there are statements from other Scholars too such as Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a> (rahimahullaah) all of which are documented, recorded, spread and well-known.    <P>
This background now leads us to the body of our article: A video around 10 months ago, at the end of 2011CE in which <a href='tags/abu-al-hasan-al-maribee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ribee</font></a> appeared on an Egyptian satellite channel being interviewed about Salafiyyah and politics. We will look at the calamities in this article proving all along that <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> had foresight and was correct in taking a stand against his heretical innovator. After this material has been presented, we will then make some short relevant comments and conclusions inshaa'Allaah.  </blockquote>  </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ribee al-Mubtadi on the Nile Satellite Channel: Interview About Salafiyyah, Politics and the Egyptian Revolution</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/maribee-qunat-neel.gif align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0>This video is on the tube and can be accessed by anyone wanting to verify. Note that these issues al-Ma'ribee speaks of are not isolated statements, they are in fact repeated in other statements of his found in other writings and broadcasts of his and they are not uncommon knowledge.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Ikhwaan and al-Thawaabit</font>    <P>
<blockquote><u>Around 18:37 mark</u>, "(al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen) - all of them represent Islaam (yumaththiloon al-islaam) ... all are agreed upon the <i>thawaabit</i> of the deen..." </blockquote>    <P>
<b>Comment:</b> This is the new language of al-Ma'ribee "<i>thawaabit</i>," he means by this those firmly-fixed aspects of Islaam that do not change and are not areas of ijtihaad, and he is using this new language to indicate that all the various jamaa'aat present today do not oppose the <i>thawaabit</i> and that they are from Ahl al-Sunnah. He is following the way of Salaah al-Saawee, an Ikhwani Innovator who wrote a book "<i>al-Thawaabit wal-Mutaghayyiraat</i>" whose purpose was along the same lines - to lay down theoretical foundations which when promulgated amongst the Muslims will allow them, the Ikhwan, to more easily amass them under their own umbrella for their desired "political work." This is how these people work, they have plans and designs, and they work to lay down theoretical foundations which they can use to soften the people's minds so as to make them more readily enter into their methodologies they have laid down which oppose the Book and the Sunnah and what the Salaf were upon. They operate in the same way as those Kalaam heretics of old who likewise laid down theoretical foundations to justify the language of their heretical theology which the general-folk with intact fitrah would not have accepted otherwise.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Hassan al-Banna was Salafi</font>    <P>
<blockquote><u>Around 23:20 mark</u>, "Hasan al-Bannaa followed the manhaj, path of Salaf (<span class='arb'>&#1575;&#1606;&#1578;&#1607;&#1580; &#1591;&#1585;&#1610;&#1602; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1604;&#1601;</span>) and he gave that some taste through political activist da'wah work, which he took from some of his shaykhs and those present now in the field of da'wah they also follow the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a>  which is tied to the Salaf of the Ummah and not the scholars of <a href='tags/saudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi</font></a>..."</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Comment:</b> He is claiming Hasan al-Bannaa, the <a href='tags/sufi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sufi</font></a> <a href='tags/mufawwidh.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mufawwidh</font></a>, was following the path of the Salaf to which he "gave flavour and taste" through the political activist angle and that those upon that path today in the field of da'wah are also upon the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a>, and he means here the Ikhwanis, <a href='tags/qutbis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbis</font></a>, <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> and their likes.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Benefits of Revolution in al-Ma'ribee's Eyes</font>    <P>
<blockquote><u>Around 27:45 mark</u>, when asked about the revolution, "We are more concerned about our times now, the difficulties, than delving into the past. This revolution has changed a lot of things from the corruption that used to be present. This revolution has opened up door to activity which was completely closed for the people before. This revolution has given certain Egyptian locations that were previously in dishonour some honour, both internally and externally (to the land). So we should safeguard those things this revolution has brought about which will benefit the country."</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Comment:</b> The revolution did not change and remove those idols worshipped besides Allaah, the graves of Badawai, Dusuqi, Sinjar, and others to where millions flock and invoke others besides Allaah, seek aid, assistance, healing, rescue and the likes, and so long as this remains the Egyptian people will remain upon fear (khawf) and poverty (joo') as per the divine rule in Surah al-Nahl (16:112). As for what they see now of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen taking power, just as <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a> (rahimahullaah) perspicuously said about <a href='tags/algeria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Algeria</font></a>, when the activists took power through democracy, that it is "only a mirage" - which is exactly what it turned out to be - this too is a  mirage. However, this is recognized only by one who venerates the Sharee'ah of Allaah and venerates the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a> and judges by it in all of his affairs and makes his walaa and baraa around it. But those whose hearts are blinded by bid'ah and dalaalah they will not see it or they will feign wilful ignorance of it.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Obligatory to Revolt Against a Muslim Oppressive Ruler</font>    <P>
<blockquote><u>From the 32:00 mark</u>, "...If revolting against a Muslim oppressive, tyrannical ruler (<i>al-haakim al-muslim al-dhaalim al-jaa'ir</i>) leads to greater oppression then revelation and reason judges we do not do so. But when it is possible to remove him with evil less than his oppression then it is obligatory... the scholars say when the revolting against an oppressive, tyrannical ruler (wali ul-amr al-jaa'ir al-dhaalim) will lead to greater corruption... they say have patience in this situation..."</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Comment:</b> This is not the saying of the Scholars nor that of the Salaf, it is the saying of the Mu'tazilah, the Khawaarij and the contemporary jamaa'aat of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and revolution - those that were spawned through Sayyid Qutb's infusion of <a href='tags/marxism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Marxism</font></a>, <a href='tags/socialism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Socialism</font></a> and <a href='tags/leninism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Leninism</font></a> into the deen of Islaam to produce his doctrine of  "everyone on this earth is an apostate (except for me of course and my followers) and it is obligatory to launch worldwide revolutions against all contemporary 'apostate jaahilee' societies." So al-Ma'ribee has declared it obligatory to revolt against a Muslim tyrannical ruler and has thus opposed every book written on the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> in history and has opposed the Sunnah of Allaah's Messenger. These considerations mentioned by this innovator actually apply when the matter has been referred to the senior Scholars after it is established that a Muslim ruler has become a kaafir. Then the issue of <u>a)</u> ability (qudrah) and <u>b)</u> weighing the benefit and harm comes into play.     <P>
<blockquote><u>Around the 33:50 mark</u> the presenter interjects after Ma'ribee's last comment and asks a shrewd question, "Does this situation then apply to Syria?" and what he means is that are you (al-Ma'ribee) saying that the Syrians therefore should not revolt because there is clearly greater harm and corruption. Here seeing he is in a difficult position, al-Ma'ribee gives a political answer and says, "This is something that the  people of <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a> should decide as they are living in that situation. This is a fatwa for them not for me sitting here."</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Comment:</b> This is the nature and way of Ahl al-Bid'ah, they do not have any sound principles, do not show consistency and they lie against the deen of Allaah. After having already told a lie against the deen of Allaah by declaring it obligatory to revolt against a tyrannical Muslim ruler (without that ruler having becoming a kaafir), he was asked about <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a> whose ruler is a kaafir by agreement of the Scholars and who is unleashing his army against the population who are revolting. He did not make clear the issue, was not consistent with what he laid down earlier, and instead gave a political answer, "Hey it's up to the Syrians to make the fatwa, they are experiencing what they are experiencing, not me." Whereas a Sunni, Salafi, Athari who has rudimentary knowledge of the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and manhaj will say that although the ruler is a kaafir, revolt is not advised because there is more harm that good as it currently stands, however, each individual is free to defend himself if fitnah comes his way, and this is what the Syrians should abide by. Al-Ma'ribee was not able to say these simple words, because like all Harakiyyeen, it is the sentiments of the people that drive them, they want to keep in line with the sentiments of the general folk which are not in line with sound knowledge.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Ma'ribee on Democracy</font>    <P>
<blockquote><u>Around 36:00 mark</u>, the presenter asks, "What is view of Islam on Democracy?" Al-Ma'ribee responds, "Democracy has tafseel (a detail to it), if it has the meaning of watching over the ruler and judging him, accounting him and overseeing his behaviour and actions, this is in agreement with the Shari'ah. And if it means that declaring lawful and declaring unlawful is taken from other than judgement of Allah and his Messenger, this is in opposition to the Shari'ah.</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Comment:</b> Meaning, democracy is permissible in the deen of Allaah when it is institutionalized within a nation so as to keep an eye on the ruler! So if this is the meaning of democracy, then yes, the existence of competing political parties all vying for rule, and then each party keeping an eye on the ruling party, all of this is permissible in the deen of Allaah, there is nothing wrong with this as democracy!    <P>

<blockquote><u>Around 47:50 mark</u>, al-Maribee says, "Al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen are from people of Islaam, they have positions in aid of the religion, they have history, from the days of Shaykh <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a> rahimahullaah and we (unclear) them from Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, we do not differ with them in..." here the presenter interjects and asks about the political aspect (of al-Ikhwaan), to which al-Ma'ribee responds, "In general, we (i.e. Salafis and Ikhwaan) agree upon the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah ... I personally see that they should all be one and that one party should accommodate the other (<span class='arb'>&#1610;&#1578;&#1606;&#1575;&#1586;&#1604;</span>) [meaning, accommodate by overlooking their faults] and the other party should accomodate the other ... so they should bear some conciliatory (approach) to each other ... all of them should be [such] that [it is as if] they are poured from the same container ... this is from my viewpoint..."</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Comment:</b> The manhaj of Hassan al-Banna for the 21st century, pure and clear. You see dear reader, this is not the greatest calamity. This man split the ranks of Ahl al-Sunnah which was his aim along as he candidly revealed to some people he thought would support him and remain with him during the height of the fitnah in 2002, and as is recorded and documented elsewhere. The greatest calamity is that there many fools and ignoramuses ascribing to the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a> in both the East and West who got taken for a ride and did not grasp the foundations of the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a> and the foundations of al-Jarh wal-Ta'deel and how to behave when there appears apparent praise for a man who has otherwise been exposed in detail for his errors and misguidances. Rather, fools such as Abdul-Qadir Baksh of Luton and Ikhwanis like Abu Usaamah Khaleefah wallowed and stoked this fitnah and supported baatil and its people because of a sickness in their hearts and because they did not possess sound knowledge regarding these crucial matters, or they did, but were following their desires for other reasons.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon and the Jamaa'aat Such as the Soofiyyah</font>    <P>
<blockquote><u>From the 50:20 mark</u>, al-Ma'ribee says, "As for the issue of what is with al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen and the issue also progresses to the jamaa'aat that come after them such as the Soofees and other than that, I, in this position of mine, I love that I bring cordiality and unite, and that I make great the <i>thawaabit</i> (firmly fixed issues of agreement) between these sects, I do not cause the particulars and subsidiary issues that cause splitting to grow... and even if they do not unite, then that their hearts are separated but in them are love, mercy and silence about issues of bickering is better than being separated with all the bickering (taking place)... (52:10) we say that differing is present, the <a href='tags/sahaabah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sahaabah</font></a> differed regarding understanding of the texts, however there is differing in usool and this is not found with most of the Islamic jamaa'aat. And there are differences in matters of ijtihaad, and this is found, and there is no walaa and no baraa, in matters of ijtihaad..."</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Comment:</b> Allaahu Akbar! There are few issues here. <u>First</u>,  we see the word again "<i>thawaabit</i>", meaning that there are things that all these jamaa'aat are agreed upon, the "<i>thawaabit</i>" and we should build unity around that. Yes, it is Hassan al-Banna's "<u>Golden Principle</u>" of, "<i>Let us cooperate in that which we agree and overlook each other in that which we disagree</i>" being expressed in another way. <u>Second</u>, he claims that differing in usool is not to be found amongst these jamaa'aat, in other words the Ikhwaan, Tabligh, Salafis and others, their differences with each other are not in usool. And the <u>third</u> matter is that he says that it is better there is separation but with the presence of love and cordiality and absence of bickering than having separation along with bickering. So we have here the same manhaj of Hassan al-Bannaa (<i>let us cooperate in that which we agree and pardon each other in that which we disagree</i>), a destruction of the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of al-walaa (loyalty) and al-baraa (disownment) and opening the doors for the innovators to have an open field with Ahl al-Sunnah.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
Shaykh Rabee' bin Haadee (hafidhahullaah), when al-Ma'ribee boldly launched his revolution at the turn of the 21st century, characterized him as <b>an Ikhwani plant amongst the Salafis whose aim is to split and divide them and bring the Ikhwani manhaj to the Salafis with the worst and most evil type of plotting</b>. Al-Ma'ribee laid down sophisticated yet false principles in order to defend the heads of innovation like <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, to include the jamaa'aat of misguidance into the Saved Sect and into the ranks of Ahl al-Sunnah (he was carrying on the work of Adnaan Ar'oor and Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq). He cast doubt upon the Sunnah of Allaah's Messenger by adducing all the arguments of the Khawaarij and Mu'tazilah regarding the aahaad hadeeth instead of supporting the Sunnah through the sayings of the Imaams of the Sunnah (that aahaad hadeeth amount to ilm and yaqeen with supporting factors) and many other disgraces and calamities too long to mention here. <b>In short, <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> was 100% correct!</b>. This is one evil, conniving Ikhwani Mubtadi'.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Coming in Part 2 inshaa'Allaah, we have some more material inshaa'Allaah, a discussion forum thread from some of the arch-defenders and allies of al-Ma'ribee during the time that his fitnah was at its peak ten years ago. In this thread they point out the  misguidance of al-Ma'ribee (which <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> was pointing out ten years ago) and for which they are now criticising and condeming al-Ma'ribee. These are the same ones who are now with Ali al-Hasan al-Halabee who is carrying on the same manhaj as al-Ma'ribee! Ajeeb! This is where bidah and hawaa leads people!</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Concluding Points</font>    <P>
There are some important observations here:    <P>
<blockquote><p><b>ONE:</b> <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> bin Haadee was correct in firstly advising over many years, then correcting errors, then openly warning when the stubbornness of al-Ma'ribee became apparent. <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> had detailed knowledge of this individual and his evil intentions. Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin al-Abbaad only saw generalities and did not have the detailed knowledge. As a result, he wrote advice to the generality of Ahl al-Sunnah with advice which, in its proper place, is truly golden - namely, Ahl al-Sunnah should be soft and gentle with each other. <b>However, it was out of place for this particular fitnah - even if the advice, outside of this particular context, is valuable</b>. Some of the people of knowledge (Shaykh Ahmad al-Najmee rahimahullaah) wrote a reply to Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin's understanding of this issue and declared the Shaykh to be erroneous in writing his book. It can be the case that one scholar does not see what another scholar has been able to see purely because of the circumstances and also because some of these evil innovators, they show a face to some of the scholars as part of their evil designs to win sympathy and this is in fact what al-Ma'ribee did with Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin. In any case, the truth always becomes manifest in the end walhamdulillaah.    <P>
<b>TWO:</b> We have not seen any of the people of falsehood who wallowed in the fitnah of al-Ma'ribee make tawbah. From them <b>Abdul-Qadir Baksh</b> of Luton and those with him and the  innovator <b>Abu Usamah Khaleefah</b> (declared innovator by Shaykh Ahmad al-Najmee) - who waged an intense war against Ahl al-Sunnah during 2002 and thereafter, reviling and abusing and name-calling the  callers to Salafiyyah in emails that are preserved from him (all because of his fanatical support of al-Ma'ribee) - and there is no doubt that he is upon the usool of al-Ma'ribee of attacking, reviling and abusing the callers to Salafiyyah whilst praising, defending and excusing the hizbiyyeen and callers to innovation and misguidance. Likewise many of those hizbiyyeen who supported and defended al-Ma'ribee and began to revile and detract from <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> - we have not seem them recant, repent and come to their senses and apologise for the harm they tried to bring upon the Salafi da'wah and to the Salafis in general through their own compound ignorance and following of desires. This opposition from them continued even after hundreds of refutations had been written by scores of scholars and students of knowledge against al-Ma'ribee. We believe that some of these people such as Abu Usaamah Khaleefah <u>may indeed be Ikhwani plants</u>, planted amongst the Salafiyyeen to misguide them from the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah and drive them instead into Ikhwaaniyyah along the lines of what al-Ma'ribee started over a decade ago, indeed all the signs and evidences point towards that.    <P>
<b>THREE:</b> There have appeared others who are continuing the manhaj of <a href='tags/tamyee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tamyee'</font></a> of al-Ma'ribee, from them Ali Hasan al-Halabi using the same sophisticated conniving and deception and false innovated principles in the arena of jarh (disparagement) of the innovators. And there are yet others who - clearly not having the ability and perspicacity as the firmly-rooted Scholars - started writing and authoring in affairs that are beyond them and giving advice with respect to tribulations in which they do not even know who is correct and who is incorrect and who is the oppressor and who is the oppressed and as a result of which they make a mess and fall into mistakes in their writings - and from these people is Ibrahim al-Ruhaylee who is also bringing unrestricted erroneous principles in which there is a departure from that which the Salaf were upon in their behaviour and approach.    <P>
<b>FOUR:</b> Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin al-Abbaad is one of the great scholars of today who has enormous efforts in teaching the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and his manhaj is the same as the rest of the Scholars of the Sunnah, for he has refuted the Ikhwaan and likewise Adnan Ar'oor and others. However, it is a matter of fact and reality that no one scholar on his own is able to comprehend all of truth and all of falsehood and have knowledge of all affairs due to limitations of being human firstly and secondly due to circumstantial reasons. <b>It is for this precise and very reason that we have certain firm foundations in our religion and in the affairs of criticism and disparagement of the innovators that accounts for this reality</b>. These principles and foundations are there to help to preserve the truth and allow it to be transmitted. <u>If this had not been the case, the refutations and warnings against all the innovators and deviants in history would not have been taken with acceptance and the truth, with its people, would have been lost</u>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>A Great and Mighty Admonition From History:</b> <u>Imaam al-Darqutni</u> (d. 385H) in the 4th century hijrah praised <u>al-Baqillani</u> (d. 406H), an <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a> scholar and called him an "Imaam of the Muslims" in front of <u>Abu Dharr al-Harawi</u> (d. 435H) and this is because al-Baqillani would refute the Christians and other non-Muslim factions. As a result of this Abu Dharr al-Harawi took from al-Baqillani and entered into the doctrines of the <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> and he then became responsible for transmitting this belief into the Hijaz and into the Maghrib thereby entering millions into the sayings of the Ash'arites. However, <u>Abu Hamid al-Isfaraa'eenee</u> (d. 406H), an Imaam of the Sunnah, would openly warn against al-Baqillani so much so that al-Baqillani would have to hide if he wanted to go out to the lavatory out of intense fear because of the severity with which Abu Hamid warned against him and his bid'ah. Abu Haamid roused the people against al-Baqillani because his saying was that the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> that we have, recited, heard, memorized is created. For that reason, the warnings of Abu Haamid have been recorded in history and the fateful ealier remark of al-Darqutni (he died in 385H) has also been recorded in history, but we treat that to be from the qadar of  Allaah by which Allaah puts His servants to trial to enable their testing and tribulation, to see who adheres to His wahy (revelation) and who chooses to follow his desires and the opinions of men. The point here is that if these innovated usool of al-Ma'ribee and Ar'oor and al-Banna (and now Ali Hasan al-Halabi) aimed at defending the innovators (and those from Ahl al-Sunnah who become innovators) were correct, then by Allaah, if these usool had been implemented by the Imaams of the Salaf (and free and innocent they are of having such baatil presumed about them) then falsehood would have been victorious over truth and the likes of us and you would not have any Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> to hold on to! Yet Allaah never allowed such baatil principles to appear and gain prominence in that time and nor will Allaah allow them victory in this time, since, as the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<b>There will never cease to be a faction in my Ummah victorious upon the truth, they will not be harmed by those who abandon them or those who oppose them until the command of Allaah arrives</b>," for there will always be Scholars and Imaams of the Sunnah holding these innovators and their false principles and foundations at bay! So the intent here is that just as anyone who clung to the saying of al-Darqutni whilst knowing what had been said by Abu Hamid al-Isfaraa'eenee regarding al-Baqillani would be considered a follower of desires, then likewise when someone clings to the saying of Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin al-'Abbaad whilst knowing what has been established of concrete evidences against this Ikhwani Dajjaal Mubtadi', <a href='tags/abu-al-hasan-al-maribee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ribee</font></a>, by <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a>, he is a follower of desires. That the reality has not become clear to certain other scholars is not a proof for him at all.</div>    <P>
These are the very foundations and principles (relating to disparagement) which these Ikhwani innovators have been waging a war against as part of their aim to defend their figureheads, to dilute and dissolve the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a> and cause wastage to its adherents so as to give a free reign and open field to themselves and their da'wah. So when there appears differing between Scholars then there is a methodology that is to be followed and principles that are to be implemented to allow the evidence and truth to be manifest - and there is no excuse for anyone to use the mere differing in and of itself to justify his non-acceptance of the actual evidence that lies with one particular scholar exclusive to another.  </blockquote>    <P>
