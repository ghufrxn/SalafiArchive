<div class='sidebar'><font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>  <blockquote>    <P>
<b>Shaykh Rabee' bin Haadee al-Madkhalee</b> played an instrumental role in exposing the Heretical <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> and Mu'tazilis who brought the poison of <i><a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a></i> into this Ummah, combining it with the methodologies of organizational secrecy such as those of Jamal al-Din al-Afghani al-Baatinee. Just as the Shaykh has an instrumental role in refuting the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a>, the Sufees, the Khawaarij, the Modernists and other than them from the variuos opposers to the Book and the Sunnah. He was supported by the other Major Scholars in all the major issues of <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and  manhaj with respect to which he refuted those heretical innovators, their institutions, parties and organizations. <b>Those scholars include Imaam al-Albaani, Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a>, Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a>, Imaam <a href='tags/muqbil-bin-haadee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muqbil bin Haadee</font></a>, Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a>, Shaykh Ahmad al-Najmee, Shaykh Saalih al-Luhaydaan and  many others</b>. There are people present today whose hearts are filled with hatred and resentment because their symbolic figureheads were spoken of or because their organizations and institutions which harbour evil partisanship and have oppositions to the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and methodology were spoken of. And thus <u>every faction has a reason for hatred of this Shaykh</u> because he refuted the Jahmite <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> of <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a>, the Sufees, the <a href='tags/khawarij.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Khawarij</font></a> and <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a>, the Modernists and Liberalists, the Ikhwanis, the Tablighis and the enemies of the da'wah of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> in general. These people try to spread doubts and misconceptions not unlike the doubts and misconceptions spread by the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> against Shaykh al-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> (rahimahullaah) - like for like (and that is the subject of an entire book). In this article we present <u>another item of evidence</u> indicating that <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> holds an honourable and praiseworthy position with other Scholars, in addition to the multitudes of other evidences on this website. This is a refutation of the doubt-mongers such as <u><a href='tags/abdullah-al-farsee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah al-Farsee</font></a></u>, <u>Abu Usaamah Khaleefah</u>, <u>Abu Mussab Wajdi Akkari</u> and many others who use numerous methods varying in their sophistication to either make explicit accusations or to mere insinuations against <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee</font></a> in particular and those scholars more generally who have played an instrumental role in exposing the many fake claimants to Salafiyyah who have emerged over the last two decades in order to further the cause of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen within Salafi audiences.  </blockquote>    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan's Praise, Commendation and Support For Shaykh Rabee's Refutation of <a href="tags/hasan-al-maalikee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hasan al-Maalikee</font></a></font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/fawan-rabee-malikee-radd.gif align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0>  <blockquote> Introduction of the Allaamah, the Shaykh Saalih bin Fawzaan al-Fawzaan    <P>
<i>Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</i>    <P>
All praise is due to Allaah and may al-salaat and al-salaam be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and his companions.    <P>
To proceed: Then I have looked at what has the esteemed Shaykh, Rabee' bin Haadee al-Madkhali wrote in his refutation of the book called, "Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhaab is a Reformative Caller and not a Prophet" of the one called Hasan bin Farihaan al-Maalikee. That is the book in which he attacked the Imaam Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhaab making claim (by way of this) to refute his great book, "Kashf al-Shubuhaat". This writer who is put to tribulation did not suffice with this humiliating deed but he further wallowed in his deviation and misguidance, and he attacked the mountains of Islaam with his slander and fabrication. And he tried to criticize what was written by the leading scholars of Islaam and guides of the creation in clarifying the correct authentic creed and refuting the repugnant creeds. So I found that the refutation of <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> - may Allaah preserve him - is sufficient in its field, good in its method, style, and making the opponent dumbstruck (i.e. being confounded and silenced). So may Allaah reward him with the best of rewards and reward him for what he has stood to perform of aiding the truth and repelling falsehood and its people.    <P>
And may Allaah send prayers and salutations upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and his companions.    <P>
Written by: Salih bin Fawzaan bin Abdullah <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a>. Member of the Committee of Major Scholars on 9/8/1423H.</blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote><font class='titleHeadline'>Notes</font>    <P>
Alhamdulillaah, this is another piece in the hundreds of jigsaw pieces through which the true picture begins to slowly emerge and through which the detractors and followers of desires are silenced further and further and their hypocrisy and deception laid bare. These people have shubuhaat (doubts, misconceptions) just like the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> throw <i>shubuhaat</i> against <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a> and just as the grave-worshippers throw <u>shubuhaat</u> against Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab. When <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> opposed and refuted that <a href='tags/fikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fikr</font></a> they brought into this Ummah and its figureheads (all Ash'aris!)  they began to tarnish him with faults, exactly as Imaam Ibn al-Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah) stated (see   <a href=indexb09a.html?epluy>here</a> and <a href=index01b7.html?ebhen>here</a>)!</blockquote> <P>
