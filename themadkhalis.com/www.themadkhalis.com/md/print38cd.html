<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Concerning the Behaviour of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> Towards the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/shipwreck-qutbiyyah.gif border=1 hspace=8 vspace=6 align=right border=0>We see today the drowning <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> - their flag-ship vessel "<i>the Qutbiyyah</i>" washed ashore, she is battered and in ruins - unable to explain why they were unable for the past 15 years to show sincerity of purpose to Allaah and His deen in rushing to defend the honours of <a href='tags/moses.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Moses</font></a> (alayhis salaam), Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu), Mu'aawiyah (radiallaahu anhu) Abu Sufyaan (radiallaahu anhu), <a href='tags/hind.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hind</font></a> (radiallaahu anhaa), the Bani Umayyah and others, but instead they spent from their wealth and made such effort that would have conquered the mountains, seas and oceans, for the sake of an individual who <u>reviled and abused</u> some of those mentioned and <u>made takfir</u> of others amongst them!     <P>
With the <i>hawaan </i>and <i>dhull </i>(ignominy, humiliation, disgrace) they invited upon themselves through these actions of theirs, today, we see these people left with no refuge except to bark at the people of the Sunnah:     <P>
<blockquote><i>So, are you saying <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> was a kaafir then! Go on say it, stop messing around, was he a kaafir or not?!!  Just say it! Why are you holding back! Please, now, say it. I beg you! Go on, say he was a kaafir, I'm desperate now, and I'll even beg you. You see I'm feeling a little vulnerable and exposed now and if you make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of him, then being a good little coward, I can then run with it to the world. Please?! You see I'm sat here behind my keyboard and I'm really cringing and biting at my fingers, please relieve my of my agony and distress. Just say "kaafir"!</i>.</blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>To understand what these defeated, humiliated, thrown-in-the-ditch, chained and subjugated losers <u>are actually up to</u> we need to take a lesson from history. Here is an incident that took place over twenty years ago, between Imaam al-Albaani (rahimahullaah) and Abdullaah Azzaam.</b></div>    <P>
As a little background, Imaam al-Albaani, <u>the Imaam of Hadeet</u>h - whose word is taken with acceptance in the entire dunyaa regarding the sayings of Allaah's Messenger (alayhis salaam), and what an honourable position of <b>trustworthiness and veracity</b> it is for it to be said (<span class='arb'>&#1589;&#1581;&#1581;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1604;&#1576;&#1575;&#1606;&#1610;</span>) - was the subject of <b>an organization-wide boycott</b> by al-Ikhwaan al-Mufliseen, and they warned against his da'wah (the Rabbaanee, Prophetic da'wah, in which there is wisdom and intellect) and also ordered the boycott of anyone who subscribes to the da'wah of the Shaykh - all because Shaykh al-Albaani pointed out the doctrine of <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a> in the statements of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Quick Sidenote:</b>    <P>
A number of the scholars confirm that what they find in the writings of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> does not leave leave a person except with the understanding that he is expressing and speaking with <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a>. From them <u>Shaykh al-Albaanee</u>, and also from them <u>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen</u>. And also <u>Shaykh Abdullaah ad-Dawaish</u>, <u><a href='tags/shaykh-muhammad-amaan-al-jaamee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Muhammad Amaan al-Jaamee</font></a></u>, <u>Shaykh Saalih Aal ash-Shaykh</u>.    <P>
And also <u>Shaykh Muhammad bin Jameel Zainoo</u> who pointed out the presence of the doctrine of <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a> in Qutb's early poetical writings, and pestered  Qutb's brother, <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, on many occasions to clarify this mistake of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, to put it in writing, and add clarifications to the printed works that get distributed. But despite promising to do so, <a href='tags/mohammad-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mohammad <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> never fulfilled his promise, even after more than a decade passing by. This will be dealt with in another article inshaa'Allaah.</div>    <P>
Abdullaah Azzaam, although previously attending the lessons, <u>acted upon this boycott and never showed up anymore</u>. The Shaykh provides more details on the matter and this was covered in part 1 of this article, so please refer to it first:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>Sayyid <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, The Doctrine of <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a>, Imaam al-Albaanee and Abdullaah Azzaam: Part 1</b> - Slandering Imaam al-Albaani Because He Stated <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> Speaks with the Unity of Existence - (<a href=index49db.html?vqtmh>see here</a>)</ul>     <P>
It's a good idea to read the above article in full first so you understand the context of what happened, because here the Shaykh is continuing the story.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh al-Albaanee: Abdullaah Azzaam is a "Dhaalim", He Made a Covenant to Publish a Retraction in the Same Magazine [in Which He Slandered al-Albaanee] But He Did Not Do So</font>    <P>
Here is another audio recording in which Shaykh al-Albaanee explains another encounter he had with <a href='tags/abdullah-azzam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Azzam</font></a> after Azzam had slandered and lied upon <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a> through publishing a series of articles in the Ikhwani magazine "<i>al-Mujtama'</i>" in the 1980s.    <P>
Click on the link below to hear the audio recording (or right click and select "save as" to save locally): <b><a href=assets/audio/albani-qutb-azzam-wahdat-ul-wujood-b.ram>Download Realaudio file here</a></b>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>What Is In the Audio From Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albaanee.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albaanee</font></a></font>    <P>
In a nutshell the Shaykh caught up with <a href='tags/abdullah-azzam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Azzam</font></a> who followed an organization-wide Ikhwani boycott against the Shaykh because the Shaykh pointed out the doctrine of <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a> in the writings of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>. Despite having a meeting with Shaykh al-Albaanee in his son-in-law's house in which the Shaykh clearly explained to him that <b>you know full well we do not make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, and that we do not make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> except with the establishment of the hujjah (proof)</b> - <a href='tags/abdullah-azzam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Azzam</font></a> went on to publish a series of articles in <i>al-Mujtama'</i> magazine with big bold titles, "<b>Shaykh al-Albaanee Makes  <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of Sayyid Qutb</b>".    <P>
So in the above audio someone brings the attention to the Shaykh of a refutation written by Azzam against him, and the Shaykh says that Azzam already wrote against him in the magazine <i>al-Mujtama</i>'. Then he says about Abdullaah Azzaam:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And he (<a href='tags/abdullah-azzam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Azzam</font></a>) is, unfortunately, <u>a dhaalim (oppressor)</u>...</blockquote>    <P>
The Shaykh continues to explain that when he met up with <a href='tags/abdullah-azzam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Azzam</font></a> again and confronted him as to why he did what he did, Azzam claimed that he had heard some youth in Makkah saying that <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a> made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and on that basis he did what he did!!    <P>
The Shaykh then explains that he took a covenant from <a href='tags/abdullah-azzam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Azzam</font></a> that he correct this matter (i.e. his slander against Shaykh al-Albaanee) in the very same magazine by publishing a recantation and clarification,     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...and yet <u>he did not do so</u>, may Allah have mercy upon him.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Moral of the Above</font>    <P>
The moral of the above is that <u>you don't need</u> any further explanations about the actions of the <a href='tags/qutbi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi</font></a> minions today, who having been hurled from their perishing flag-ship "<i>the Qutbiyyah</i>", and who continue the same type of blind bigoted-defence and hizbiyyah for the sake of 20th century ignoramuses who, aside from the innovations of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Mu'tazilah, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a>, brought little else aside from the poison of ar-Rafd and <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and Leninist Revolutions against the Ummah.    <P>
  <font class='titleHeadline'>Update: 5th January 2009</font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> have responded to this article and <a href=index49db.html?vqtmh>the previous one</a> by bringing all the praises that Abdullaah Azzam made for <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a> (rahimahullaah), in reference to Shaykh al-Albani's checkings of hadeeth and so on. Also by saying that <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a> referred to Azzam as a "rajul wadud" (loving man) who used to attend the Shaykh's lectures with a notebook and pen without fail. Well, we already included that <a href=index49db.html?vqtmh>in our article right here</a>, it's there in the Arabic text and in the audio file.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><font style='font-size:19px;line-height:26px;'>And what does all of that avail these Qutbiyyah? Nothing, its all desperation. Because the point is not how <a href='tags/abdullah-azzam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Azzam</font></a> praised <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a>, <b>but it is what <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a> said about <a href='tags/abdullah-azzam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Azzam</font></a>, many years after the death of Abdullah Azzam</b> - even after acknowledging that he was a loving man that used to attend his lessons with a pen and notebook - that <a href='tags/abdullah-azzam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Azzam</font></a> was "a dhaalim" (oppressor) who failed to abide by <u>a covenant</u> that the Shaykh made him take, and who <u>never retracted</u> from his <u>slander</u> against the Shaykh, the one he published in a widely distributed Ikhwani magazine, "<i>al-Mujtama'</i>" over a series of articles, and never ever showed up to the Shaykh's lessons again, at all, out of obedience in the haraam, which was the boycott declared by al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen, at a organizational level, against <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a> and his da'wah!</font></div>    <P>
Now you can go and find all the praises made by Abdullaah Azzaam of <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a> and all the other bits of information to try and deceive people through that same old <a href='tags/qutbi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbi</font></a> fog and mist but it doesn't wash. It just proves your desperation, and it only increases your deception in further clarity to the onlookers.    <P>
The moral here, and the purpose behind this and <a href=index49db.html?vqtmh>the previous article</a> is to look at what hizbiyyah, and bigoted party-spirit can do to individuals, and <u>if this can occur</u> with the likes of <a href='tags/abdullah-azzam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah Azzam</font></a>, may Allaah pardon him, about whom <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a> said what he said in rebuke and criticism many years after Azzaam died, then you can expect what is much worse from the people we have present today, and whose bigotry and partisanship to non-Scholars such as <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> (currently) knows no bounds or limits.   <P>
