<blockquote><font style='font-size:19px;line-height:26px;'>The <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> have tried for 23 years to try and bring down the noble Shaykh Imaam al-Albaanee (rahimahullaah) and his da'wah ever since he pointed out the doctrine of <a href='tags/wahdat-ul-wujood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahdat ul-Wujood</font></a> in the commentary of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> in az-Zilaal, which <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> corroborated in his commentary on Surah al-Hadid and Surah al-Ikhlas in the late 1950s and remained upon this (after having negated it in the very first edition of az-Zilaal in the early 1950s in the very early part of his commentary). <u>The formally declared war of al-Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen against the revival of the Prophetic da'wah began here. When an Imaam of the Sunnah, criticised the words of Sayyid Qutb</u> the Ikhwan issued <u>an organization wide boycott</u> against Imaam al-Albani and his da'wah and anyone who ascribed to it. And they started slandering Shaykh al-Albaani by publishing articles in their magazines such as the Kuwaiti "<i>al-Mujtama'</i>" in order to make people flee from al-Albani and his da'wah. The <u>disclosure</u> of this vile type of hizbiyyah and bigoted party-spirit was <u>the starting point</u> and the instigation of the giving of attention by the Scholars of the Sunnah to these people, their doctrines and methodologies. This led to - despite initial confusion - the gradual emergence of the clarity and separation between the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah (based upon revelation from Allaah) and the methodologies of al-Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen (derived from the prevailing secular, non-Muslim, ideologies, doctrines, philosophies, political methodologies and manifestos, the overall aim of which is to establish a khilaafah "by hook or by crook", literally [its in their books]). Over <u>the next two decades</u> the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah as a whole convicted the evil methodologies of al-Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen in <u>hundreds</u> of their statements, verdicts and rulings, and the more outspoken of <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> were left despised, abased, rejected (and rendered kafirs by a faction of their earlier followers who became disillusioned with what they perceived to be a '<i>sell-out</i>'). So some of them boasted about being instrumental in bringing Bush to power by advising the Muslims of America to vote  him in (<a href=indexe11b.html?tnuzl>Dr. Hawali, the women and children of Iraq love you to bits</a>), and others were found sitting alongside and calling for understanding with the Soofees and <a href='tags/shiites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shi'ites</font></a> (thank you <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, we always knew you had a Bannaawee thing going on there with your distinction between <i>al-Firqat un-Najiya</i>h and <i>at-Taa'ifat ul-Mansoorah</i>).</font></blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>The Boycott Against Shaykh al-Albaani:</b> Listen to <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a> discuss this in his own words <a href=index49db.html?vqtmh >in this article</a> and <a href=index0454.html?ezcyb >this article</a>. </div>    <P>
After the Gulf War, these people came out and started on the other Major Scholars such as <u><a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a></u>, and <u><a href='tags/ibn-uthaymeen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymeen</font></a></u> (rahimahumullaah), when they started to belittle these Scholars. Bigoted partisanship (hizbiyyah) is what led to these people to step up their war when others from the people of knowledge refuted <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> for his encyclopedia of innovations and misguidances which included <a href='tags/mockery.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mockery</font></a> of <a href='tags/moses.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Moses</font></a> (alayhis salaam), revilement of Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu), and Mu'aawiyah (radiallaahu anhu) and his <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of all of Bani Umayyah. His speaking with the innovations of the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> of negating Allaah's uluww, and making <a href='tags/taweel.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ta'weel</font></a> of al-Istwaa, and his innovations of I'tizaal of rejecting aahaad hadeeth in <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, and his casting doubt upon the Sunnah, and statements reaching the level of kufr, and great many other affairs.     <P>
Chief amongst those Scholars was <u>Shaykh Rabee' bin Haadee al-Madkhalee</u>, and when he saw that these people, claiming Salafiyyah, did not make their walaa and baraa for the truth, and for the Salafi <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, but rather for the sake of a man in whose works - <u>after you take out all of the above-mentioned misguidances</u> - there is nothing left in them, except what is worse than the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of the khawaarij, namely <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the entire Ummah, and judging with its complete absence, and judging the Muslims to be upon the <a href='tags/jaahiliyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jaahiliyyah</font></a> of kufr prior to Islaam, rather in a worse <a href='tags/jaahiliyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jaahiliyyah</font></a> than that, and propounding the manifestos of secular atheist Jews in inciting violent revolutions against this Ummah:    <P>

Then when he, <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> saw that, he was resolved to defend the honours of the Prophets, <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> and the sanctity of the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a>, and to protect the Muslims from the evil effects of this evil ideology which brought nothing upon this Ummah but calamity and destruction.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>So in turn, the "<u><a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a></u>" set sail on their flag-ship, "<i>the Qutbiyyah</i>" in the early 1990s in order to wreak havoc, to cause confusion, to deceive and to wage a war against the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah - after their first skirmish against the Imaam, the Muhaddith, the Reviver, Nasir ud-Din al-Albani in the late 1980s. These people did not traverse the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah, rather they adopted the methodologies of <a href='tags/soofee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Soofee</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ari</font></a>, Mu'tazili Innovators, Abu A'laa <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a>, <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> - all of whom took the philosophies and ideologies of the non-Muslims, the Atheists, Secularists and Christians and incorporated them within their own ideas of what constitutes "reform", writing in all of that, out of ignorance, mere opinion, far away from the <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> of Islam and its Prophetic manhaj.</b></div>    <P>
And while this story is long and detailed,  suffice it to say that the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> left no guile, trickery, or deception in trying to cause dissension between <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> and the other Scholars, as part of their evil plot, and as part of their defense of their vile methodologies of hizbiyyah which are alien to Islam and the Sunnah and the way of the Salaf, <u>except that they traversed it</u>. And from these ways was their constant calls to the people of knowledge, asking loaded questions, trying to elicit from them words of dispraise - and they found no way to defend their vile, innovated Ikhwani methodologies except to plot the downfall of the noble Scholars who defended the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and the <a href='tags/salafi-manhaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafi Manhaj</font></a> from the doctrines and innovations of their figureheads. And we see instances of this being circulated today.    <P>
<u>They began with Shaykh al-Albani</u>, then they moved onto the other major Scholars like <u>Shaykh Ibn Baz</u>, <u><a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a></u> after the Gulf War (when the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> made their debut, sailing on the seas), and <u>then</u> they turned to <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> thereafter. <b>Be not deceived about these people - they hate the da'wah and manhaj of Imaam al-Albani, Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a>, and Imaam Ibn Uthaymin</b>, even if they display their (fake) attachment to these scholars - its all in name only, there's nothing behind it of substance, for they are the furthest of people from the manhaj of these Shaykhs. All they do is to pick and choose from the sayings of these Scholars that suit their desires, they are not upon the da'wah and methodology of these Shaykhs, they are upon the da'wah of Hassan al-Banna, <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a>. But when <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> stood to defend the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and to defend the honours of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a>, as had Mahmood Muhammad Shakir forty years earlier in 1952 (<a href=index2199.html?mslqe >see here</a>), then they used <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> <b>as a scapegoat and as a veil</b> to attack all of the Scholars. They hate all the Scholars, resent them and look down upon them, because none of these Scholars are with them upon their da'wah, and because these Scholars actually recommended the books of refutation of <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> against <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, and in his defending the methodology of the Prophets in da'wah.    <P>
But these haters, can't openly proclaim their resentment and hatred, because they know that most Muslims have an attachment and love to these Scholars, and so they conceal it so as not to alert the general people to what their harbor of such enmity.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Even <b>Shaykh Ibn Jibreen</b> and <b>Shaykh Bakr Abu Zaid</b> (may Allaah have mercy upon them both) <u>were not with these people upon their actual methodologies</u> - even if they erred in the matter of defending <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> or <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a>. Look at how Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> referred to these people (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?srjss >in this article here</a>), "<i>Kharijite, Terrorist, Dogs of Hellfire</i>" - he is not with them upon their <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the rulers and their Leninist revolutionary ideologies (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?eoizx >see here</a>), but they saw him slip by being deceived about the likes of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a>, defending them erroneously, and so they took <u>the slip of a scholar</u> as <u>a deen to be followed</u>. Unfortunately, that slip did not remain a slip when Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> thereafter, decided to defend the innovators  and ally with them, so he was refuted by Shaykh Ahmad al-Najmee.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>An Example of Their Deception</font>    <P>
So we come to the subject of this article which is that the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> make use of some general advice the Muftee, Shaykh Abdul-Aziz Aal ash-Shaykh gave in response to a question over the telephone broadcast on television, and here is the question:    <P>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="mp3player.swf" width="200" height="20"><param name="movie" value="mp3player.swf" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/assets/audio/muftee-question-rabee.mp3&amp;showvolume=1&amp;loadingcolor=ff75ff" /></object>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Questioner:</b> "O Shaykh there is a group...</blockquote>    <P>
Note that this "group" he is talking about are those who are upon what Imaam al-Albaani, Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a> and Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a> are upon of having convicted the likes of Safar and Salman of calling to a "<i><a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a></i>" and being "<i>Khaarijiyyah  Asriyyah</i>" and the likes - and you can see this is clearly a loaded question through what comes next.     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...who claim Salafiyyah, and they revile the Du'aat and the Mashaayikh ... and they revile Shaykh <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a>, and they revile Shaykh <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, and some of them say that they are astray, leading others astray..." <b>Presenter:</b> [interjecting] "You request some advice..." <b>Questioner:</b> "Yes some advice for them..."  Immediately, <b>the Muftee</b> begins to answer: "O my brothers ...", then the questioner drops in at the very end (after the Shaykh has commenced his speech) "...most of them are the students of Shaykh <a href='tags/rabi-al-madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rabi al-<a href="tags/madkhali.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Madkhali</font></a></font></a>..." </blockquote>    <P>
The Muftee advised the questioner at the beginning that these types of things ought not to be brought out openly but can be resolved in other ways without publicizing them to the people in this manner.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Muftee: My brothers, I hope we fear Allaah with respect to ourselves, and that we do not publicize these types of affairs, when we know of their existence, we strive to rectify them, as for making them publicizing them and making them open, then this is not befitting...</blockquote>    <P>
After this, the Shaykh gives a general naseehah (advice) which is not directed at anyone in particular, but is a general naseehah to everyone.     <P>
In reality, this advice of the Mufti applies to those who invent labels which the Mufti and the major scholars have not spoken with,  such as the label of "<i><a href='tags/madkhalis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhalis</font></a></i>" which is simply a veil through which to attack the generality of the manhaj of Imaam al-Albani, Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a>, Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a>, the Mufti himself, Shaykh Salih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a>, and all the other Major Scholars, collectively, which clashes with the manhaj of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, <a href='tags/banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Banna</font></a> and <a href='tags/mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mawdudi</font></a> that these people are upon.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>You see, we are dealing with shysters here, they are not genuine</b> because they do not take from these Scholars in their methodologies, and are not really with these scholars at all. They look for sayings of Scholars, such as a couple they found from the Mufti, which they can use, this particular one here and another one in which he says those who have knowledge and can distinguish between truth and falsehood can benefit from the literary and cultural aspects of some of what <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> has written - so they found <u>isolated statements</u> like these, and those of Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> and Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd and ran with them, only testifying for themselves the following of desires. The proof that they are followers of desires in these actions of theirs is that they use these isolated statements to hoodwink and deceive the ignorant and gullible to defend a man who by agreement of all the Scholars was a literary writer but not a Scholar, an ignoramus in fact, <b>whilst at the same time</b>, the great abundance of defenses, praises, commendations that exist for <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> bin Haadee from are large number of the major scholars, including the Imaams who passed away, al-Albani, <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a>, <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a> are ignored or hidden by them, and they are for a Scholar of the Sunnah, a Muhaddith, who spoke and wrote for the sake of the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and honours of the Prophets and Companions, and who is firmly upon the methodology of the Prophets in actualizing <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and calling to it (see the words <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> <a href=index01b7.html?ebhen>about that right here</a>). <b>It's all written on the wall, and it is plain obvious, these people are following desires and they are not being truthful and they know it</b>. Further, these issues were dead and buried a decade ago and Allaah made the truth  manifest through the support, defense and commendation of the refutations of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> by those major Scholars whilst they were alive. Go and take a look at <a href=index01b7.html?ebhen>this statement</a> of <a href='tags/shaykh-ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh <a href="tags/ibn-uthaymin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Uthaymin</font></a></font></a> by way of example. Or <a href=index854c.html?tgdma>this statement</a> of Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baz</font></a>. Or <a href=indexa0fc.html?iosjk>this statement</a> of <a href='tags/shaykh-al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh al-<a href="tags/albani.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Albani</font></a></font></a>. So it is clear, we are dealing with people of desires, not people who sincerely seek the truth.</div>    <P>
As for the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> mentioned by the questioner, (al-Qarnee, al-Awdah etc.) then the Major Scholars refuted them for their <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Extremism</font></a> and mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Ummah. <b>Shaykh Salih al-Fawzaan</b> refuted the statements of both al-Qarnee and al-Awdah, as found in the book al-Ajwibah al-Mufidah - <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?aorjc>see this article</a>, and also <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?qyrnf>this article</a> for his refutations upon statements of mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>. and <b>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen</b> warned from the cassettes of <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> and from their "<b><a href='tags/revolutionary-ideology.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Revolutionary Ideology</font></a></b>" (see   <a href=index33d0.html?tjmrl>here</a>), and <b>Imaam al-Albani</b> called them "<i>Khaarijiyyah Asriyyah</i> (the Khawaarij of the Era)", as is too well known and famous to even mention, and <b>Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen</b> and <b>Shaykh al-Fawzaan</b> both corroborate the existence of a "<a href="tags/qutbi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutbi</font></a>" manhaj, and its followers the they both commend and authorize warning from it (see   <a href=index0ec1.html?blaok>here</a>, <a href=index7e0b.html?sxptl>here</a> and <a href=index49f2.html?xwcmm>here</a>) ... and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on. All that is from close to ten years ago.     <P>
<b>The point here</b>, is that this is just <u>another desperate attempt</u> of these people, in a history of desperate attempts. They go to the Major Scholars knowing full well that all their figureheads were convicted by the Major Scholars many years back of having something of misguidance, deviation and innovation. <u>But they continue to try to get something they can run with</u> - as a means of confusing and deceiving people - because remember, these people are still calling to their baatil, and to do that they need the books that represent contain ideological justifications of mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and the manifestos of secular atheist Jews, like Vladimir Lenin, in secretly working for revolutions - all of which came to them in the works of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>. For this reason, <b>the continued casting of aspersions upon the Sunnah and it's people</b>, is a necessary, in fact, <b>a vital element</b> for the protection and continuation of their da'wah - which clashes with the methodology of the Prophets in da'wah, according to all the Scholars of the Sunnah as pointed out earlier, in fact, by even the Ikhwani figureheads, such as Yusuf Qaradawi, Ali Juraisha, Farid Abdul-Khaliq and others.    <P>
And at the same time remember, <u>to a lot of these people</u>, the Mufti, Abdul-Aziz Aal ash-Shaykh (hafidhahullaah) is a kaafir, apostate, they make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Scholars. And others amongst them do not openly reveal this <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> but conceal it. And yet others amongst them, ally with these people who make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Scholars, they remain silent about them, do not refute them, and continue in their allegiance towards them and giving preference to their company, which indicates that in all likelihood, they also conceal <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Scholars, or tend towards it, if not at least holding resentment and hatred towards those scholars.     <P>
<b>So its all a sham and a scam. Be sure 100% about that, and the strange thing is that these people actually know it</b> . When they read this, deep inside their souls, they know it. The Scholars are just a means to an end for these people. And so they are not with the Muftee, except in isolated statements which they can twist and run with to aid their baatil. In this series we will present the truth regarding the relationship between <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> and all the other Scholars.   <P>
