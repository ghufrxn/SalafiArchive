<img src=assets/images/baraa-ah-cover.gif border=1 align=right border=0> <font class='titleHeadline'>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah Min Tazkiyah Ahl il-Bid'ah wal-Mudhammah</font>    <P>
To the right is the cover for the second edition of "<i>Baraa'ah Ulamaa il-Ummah Min Tazkiyah Ahl il-Bid'ah wal-Mudhammah</i>" (The Innocence of the Scholars of the Ummah from the Commendation of the People of Innovation and Censure). This book was prepared by Isaam bin Abdullaah as-Sinaanee. It contains a refutation of the one who used the intercession of Shaykh Bin Baaz (rahimahullaah) for <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> as a proof for the 'adaalah (integrity) of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and commendation of his (Qutb's) manhaj, when it is not a proof at all.    <P>
The book, after compilation and authorship was sent to <b>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</b> who checked over it and made recommendations, and also suggested an improvement to the title of the book. Then it was read by <b>Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen</b> (rahimahullaah), who made his own written notes on the pre-print copy that was sent to him, and he also advised that the section titled "The Salafi Manhaj", <u>should be placed before</u> "The Qutubi Manhaj" and not after it, unless the author had a specific reason for doing that. And images of these hand-written notes are included at the end of the book. We will be quoting from this book inshaa'Allaah in this series. <b>Both of these scholars endorsed the contents of this book and the purpose for which it was to be published and distributed</b>. <u>And the purpose is clearly outlined in the title of the book itself</u>. Namely, to declare the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah free and innocent (in particular Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-baaz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Baaz</font></a>, and the other scholars in general) of having made tazkiyah (i.e. given adaalah) to those who are from the people of innovation: In this case <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, who aside from writing his commentary on the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> upon an <a href='tags/asharite.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'arite</font></a> creed, added other great calamities, some of which are serious enough that they cannot really be excused by mere ignorance, such as accusing the Scribe of the Prophet (alayhis salaam) the Uncle of the Believers, <a href='tags/muawiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'awiyah</font></a> - whose integrity is attested to by the Prophet himself -  of treachery, deception and hypocrisy.     <P>
<b>And this book essentially <u>sunk their ship</u>, leaving them only <u>the flotsam</u> to hold onto thereafter, which is what they have been doing since then.</b>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> Whilst many of the biased-partisans use the word "<i><a href='tags/madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhali</font></a></i>" as a derogatory phrase to attack one particular Scholar, everyone should realize that <u>this is simply a cover and a veil</u>. Their hatred and resentment goes way beyond just one particular scholar and <u>it is towards the Scholars of the Sunnah in general</u> for the the fact that the majority of them eventually spoke about <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> specifically and the methodologies of al-Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen in general, after the truth became clear to them. The word "<i><a href='tags/madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madkhali</font></a></i>" is used in a derogatory way that simply represents this hatred, resentment and jealousy. These people don't have a group of scholars that <u>represent</u> the manhaj they are upon. <i>They have isolated statements here and there from some Scholars in isolated issues by which they cause confusion</i>, but certainly they cannot point to a group of known major scholars and say, "<i>Their manhaj in da'wah is the same as our manhaj in da'wah</i>". <b>By the way, Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> who erred in defending <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> against those who refuted him has statements that contain refutations of these people. Be sure about that! Go and read <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?eoizx >this article</a> and <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?srjss >this article</a></b>. So they have no Scholars guiding and leading them in their manhaj. And for this reason, they have to attack the truth with false labels in order to cut off the people from recognizing the overall broad methodologies that all of those scholars are united upon and which differ from the methodologies of the secular atheist Jews and Christians that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and Bannaa innovated into the religion.</div> <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh <a href='tags/hammad-al-ansari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hammad al-Ansari</font></a> on the Saying of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> That Islam is a Concoction of <a href='tags/communism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Communism</font></a> and <a href="tags/christianity.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Christianity</font></a></font>    <P>
There occurs on page 60 of the book "al-Baraa'ah" -  [and you can also see Shaykh Ibn Jibreen's comment upon this saying <a href=indexc811.html?bguiq>in this article</a>] - the saying of the Shaykh and Muhaddith, <a href='tags/hammad-al-ansari.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hammad al-Ansari</font></a> (rahimahullaah):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/baraa-ah-ansari-communism-christianity.gif border=0>    <P>
The Shaykh - rahimahullaah - was asked about the statement of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexc811.html?bguiq>see this article</a> for the documentation of this saying from Qutb's book):     <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And it is necessary for Islaam to judge, since it is a unique, constructive and positivist <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> which has been moulded and shaped from <a href='tags/christianity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Christianity</font></a> and <a href='tags/communism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Communism</font></a> together, [with a] blending in the most perfect of ways and which comprises all of their (i.e <a href='tags/christianity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Christianity</font></a> and Communism's) objectives and adds in addition to them harmony, balance and justice.</blockquote>    <P>
The words used by <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> (<span class='arb'>&#1578;&#1589;&#1608;&#1594;</span>) - forming, shaping, moulding something from something, to forge, fabricate something. And (<span class='arb'>&#1605;&#1586;&#1610;&#1580;&#1575;</span>) - compounded, blended, a mixture, medley, blend, combination, compound, alloy - from (<span class='arb'>&#1605;&#1586;&#1580;</span>) - to mix, mingle, incorporate, blend, i.e. a thing with water, or a thing with something else. And he added to that (<span class='arb'>&#1603;&#1575;&#1605;&#1604;&#1575;</span>) - complete, perfect. All this from Lane's Lexicon So we have a complete, perfect, mix and blend of each of <a href='tags/communism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Communism</font></a> and <a href='tags/christianity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Christianity</font></a> into a medley, compound and alloy, to make up Islam.    <P>
Therefore <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> has stated that Islam is a mixture and blend, a mingling of those ideologies of men that are founded upon atheism and <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a> and shares in their ideals and goals, and that it simply adds the elements of harmony, balance and justice to a combination of those man-made religions and secular systems.    <P>
To this, Shaykh Hammaad replied:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>If the one who said these words was alive, <b>then his repentance should be sought</b>, so if he repents (then so) otherwise he is to be killed as an apostate. And if he has died then it is obligatory to explain that these words are falsehood. However we do not perform <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of him since we have not established the proof against him.</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Source:</b> From the book of Shaikh Rabee' "<i>al-Awaasim Mimmaa Fee Kutub Sayyid Qutub Minal-Qawaasim</i>" (p. 24) and who read it out to Shaikh Hammaad himself on the night of 3/1/1415 in order to corroborate it.    <P>
<b>Note</b>: Shaykh Salih <a href='tags/al-fawzan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/fawzan.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Fawzan</font></a></font></a> said (in his checking and notes upon this book "al-Baraa'ah"), as is indicated in the footnote:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The hujjah (proof) is established upon the one whom the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah reach. And the disbelief of the Christians is clear in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, and more clear than that is the disbelief of the Communists, so how can he mix between kufr and eemaan.</blockquote>    <P>
This would indicate that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> essentially left the religion through these words of his, and became a kaafir, and it is not known that he recanted and repented from this statement (see corroboration from <u>Shaykh Ibn Jibreen</u> that the one who utters this statements has disbelieved - <a href=  indexc811.html?bguiq>in this article</a>).    <P>
<img src=assets/images/shipwreck-qutbiyyah.gif border=1 hspace=8 vspace=6 align=right border=0> Now, we personally would not call <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> a kaafir, and still, despite all of his statements (mocking the prophets, accusing the choicest of <a href='tags/the-companions.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>the Companions</font></a> with hypocrisy, speaking with the creation of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, negating their is a deity above the Throne), we are prepared to make excuses (<u>he may have repented in secret and private before his death from mocking the prophet <a href='tags/moses.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Moses</font></a> or saying Islam is a concoction of <a href='tags/communism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Communism</font></a> and Christianity</u>) and give him the excuse of ignorance in some of those issues (the issues in creed, just like we do not make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the <a href='tags/asharis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'aris</font></a> for holding the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to be created, due to their ignorance and faulty ta'weel). <b>Our thing is to reduce this man's burden and to stop his ignorant deluded fanatical followers from oppressing him and making the situation worse for him</b>. The real problem here is for the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>, the question for them is did <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> become a kaafir through these words or not? <b>It is they who MUST answer this question, not us, we've already made our stance clear</b>. The problem for the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> is to show their zeal and fervor regarding <u>the criterion between eemaan and kufr</u> and for them to corroborate, practically, whether kufr is through all of beliefs, statements and actions or not (see   <a href=http://www.aqidah.com/creed/?nbbpo>here</a>, <a href=http://www.aqidah.com/creed/?fuvpo>here</a> and <a href=http://www.aqidah.com/creed/?paauc>here</a>). They need to explain why they continue to aggrandize a man, his books, his doctrines, his methodologies, <u>when <b>according to them</b>, if they are truthful and sincere to what they believe and hold</u>, the man left Islaam and became a kaafir through statement(s) he made, and <u>it is not known (to them)</u> that he recanted or repented from them. And who else is more suitable to corroborate that the statement is one of kufr and its utterer does become a kaafir, other than Shaykh Ibn Jibreen? <b><a href=index74ea.html?rhmeq >Comrade</a>, to where is the refuge?</b> <P>
