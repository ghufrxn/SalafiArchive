<p>You may recall <a href=index3c3b.html?vckiw>in a previous article</a> in our <b><a href='tags/bayaan-talbis-al-qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bayaan Talbis al-<a href="tags/qutbiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutbiyyah</font></a></font></a></b> series, regarding <b>a loaded question</b> put to the Muftee, the Shaykh Abdul-Aziz Aal ash-Shaykh the aim of which was to get some speech out of the Shaykh against <a href='tags/shaykh-rabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Rabee'</font></a> bin Haadee al-Madkhali.     <P>
The question was as follows:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Questioner:</b> "O Shaykh there is a group, who claim Salafiyyah...and they revile the Du'aat and the Mashaayikh ... and they revile Shaykh <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a>, and they revile Shaykh <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, and some of them say that they are astray, leading others astray..." <b>Presenter:</b> [interjecting] "You request some advice..." <b>Questioner:</b> "Yes some advice for them..."  Immediately, <b>the Muftee</b> begins to answer: "O my brothers ...", then the questioner drops in at the very end (after the Shaykh has commenced his speech) "...most of them are the students of Shaykh <a href='tags/rabi-al-madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rabi al-<a href="tags/madkhali.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Madkhali</font></a></font></a>..." </blockquote>    <P>
Note in the recording that as the Muftee was commencing his advice, the questioner dropped in his statement "...most of them are the students of Shaykh <a href='tags/rabi-al-madkhali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rabi al-<a href="tags/madkhali.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Madkhali</font></a></font></a>...". The Muftee advised the questioner at the beginning that these types of things ought not to be brought out openly but can be resolved in other ways without publicizing them to the people in this manner.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Muftee: My brothers, I hope we fear Allaah with respect to ourselves, and that we do not publicize these types of affairs, when we know of their existence, we strive to rectify them, as for making them publicizing them and making them open, then this is not befitting...</blockquote>    <P>
After this, the Shaykh gives a general naseehah (advice) which is not directed at anyone in particular, but is a general naseehah to everyone, and if you actually reflect upon the advice of the Shaykh, it is actually <u>against them</u>, not for them - refer to <a href=index3c3b.html?vckiw> this article</a>  for more details on this piece of advice as a whole.    <P>
However, we want to focus here on the individuals mentioned in the loaded question, <u><a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a></u> and <u><a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a></u>, and present something about the nature of their orientation in da'wah. This orientation is that of <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-<a href="tags/banna.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Banna</font></a></font></a>, founder of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen, the accommodation of all the groups and sects to work for a greater goal, to arrive at the "khilaafah", and Salman al-Awdah's distinction between <i>al-Firqat un-Naajiyah</i> and <i>at-Taa'ifat ul-Mansoorah</i> was from the angle of this Bannaawee principle. This principle destroyed the foundation of al-walaa wal-baraa for the sake of the Islamic <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> in the 20th century, and led to al-walaa wal-baraa based around political goals, motives and ambitions and al-walaa wal-baraa based around groups, parties and organizations. Here we can see the Bannawee principle in action:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Salman al-Aqdah, <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a>, <a href='tags/habib-ali-al-jifree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Habib Ali al-Jifree</font></a> and <a href="tags/amr-khalid.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Amr Khalid</font></a></font>    <P>
This is a 2007 conference on the theme of "<i>Constructing a Desirable Society</i>" taking place between 10th February to 15th February, and amongst the participants are <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a>, and the <a href='tags/sufi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sufi</font></a> saint-worshipper and caller to <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a>, <a href='tags/habib-ali-al-jifree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Habib Ali al-Jifree</font></a>. Here they are in the list of speakers for the event:    <P>

And here is the schedule:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/awdah-qarnee-jifree-conference.gif border=0>    <P>
And then again in 2008 we see another conference with the theme, "<i>Freedom is the Path to Exploration</i>" running from 9th February to 14th February, and within the speakers list are <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a> and <a href='tags/amr-khalid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Amr Khalid</font></a>.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/awdah-qarnee-amrkhalid-conference.gif border=0>    <P>
You have to understand what is going on here. These were <u>the hardcore Qutbiyyah</u>, the callers to "<a href="tags/haakimiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haakimiyyah</font></a>" who were making <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of everything that moves - meaning, of the entire planet   (see   <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?qyrnf>here</a> and <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?aorjc>here</a>), and they were behind an ideological revolution, through which they desired a practical revolution. This is what Safar and Salman were doing in the 1990s. When this Qutbo-Leninism failed for them, and after a stretch in prison, their orientation changed and they've now resorted to Bannaawiyyah as their method of operation in da'wah (the mass-populist, pluralist route). They are two sides of the same coin.    <P>
Their former followers who were nurtured upon this ideology, when they saw this treachery to their former da'wah, some of them made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of Safar and Salman. And one of them wrote a book in refutation of Safar and Salman called (<span class='arb'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1605;&#1604;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1610;&#1577; &#1604;&#1605;&#1602;&#1575;&#1608;&#1605;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1583;&#1608;&#1575;&#1606; &#1586;&#1610;&#1601; &#1608;&#1582;&#1583;&#1575;&#1593; &#1608;&#1588;&#1593;&#1575;&#1585;&#1575;&#1578; &#1603;&#1575;&#1584;&#1576;&#1577;</span>) by Yusuf al-Uyairee, a Takfiri Khariji, in which he affirms the Takfiri, Khariji nurturing these two gave to the youth, and proceeds to outline what he perceives to be their treachery to the da'wah. We will bring excerpts of that book in separate articles.    <P>
