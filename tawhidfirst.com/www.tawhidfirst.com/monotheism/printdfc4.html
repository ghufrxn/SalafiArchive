<img src=assets/images/razi-tafsir-cover.gif border=1 align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0> To the right is a cover page for the book "<b>Tafsir ar-Razi</b>", also known as "<b>Mafaateeh al-Ghayb</b>" belonging to <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> who is a prominent Imaam for the Ash'aris of today and he died in 606H. We will be quoting from it further below to prove that "Tawhid al-Ibadah" is not an invention of Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah), nor Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah). <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ar-Razi</font></a> was present in a time when <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of other than Allaah within the Muslim Ummah had spread and thus, even amongst the As'hari scholars prior to this era, there exist clear indications in their books and writings that they (unlike the later Ash'aris) understood Tawhid al-Ibaadah, and explained it, and spoke against its violation, even if they erred in other aspects of creed.     <P>
Historically, the innovations of the first century were light innovations (Khawarij, Shi'ah, Qadariyyah, Murji'ah), in that they did not directly relate to Allaah Himself. Those that came in the second century hijrah were more severe in that they related directly to the belief in Allaah Himself (His Names, Attributes, His Uluww, His Speech), and then from this period the introduction of philosophy and gnosticism (mystical esoteric knowledge) led to further deviations. However, it took around six centuries for <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> (associationism) to spread amongst the Muslims on a wide scale. The seeds of this <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> were spread initially by the Ismaa'eelee Baatiniyyah known as Ikhwan al-Safaa (Brethren of Purity) in the third and fourth centuries, and they were given support by the Ubaidiyyah (Shii'ite rulers of Egypt) when they took power. Prior to this time (before the fifth century, i.e. 400H), whilst the variuos sects had deviations in issues of aqidah, the understanding of Tawhid al-Ibaadah was still relatively firm.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In light of this, the earliest Ash'aris had the least deviance, they were following the madhhab of Ibn Kullaab (d. 240H). The Ash'aris of the 5th and 6th centuries, hybridized their belief with that of the Mu'tazilah and Jahmiyyah (and thus deviated from the early Kullabi creed), and under the influence of gnostic mysticism, the Ash'aris who came later (7th, 8th century onwards) fell into saint and grave <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a>, which had started to spread in the time of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) - thereby surpassing all previous Ash'aris in deviation. It is for this reason that what is known today as "Ash'ariyyah" is not a uniform consistent belief or practice, rather it is a hotch-potch of views, many of which are inconsistent, and you find great differences between the early (original) Kullaabi Ash'aris, and those who came later.</div>     <P>
This shows that the greater deviations occurred when the people were further away from the era of revelation, and this is simply a cycle of history. This has always occurred after the sending of Prophets and Messengers, and it is indicated in the Prophetic texts for this ummah, such as those texts that mention that this (Muslim) nation will follow the footsteps of those (nations) that came before them (such as the Jews and Christians). For this reason, the greatest deviation, <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> with Allaah, was the last of the affairs to enter into the Ummah - long after the era of Prophethood.    <P>
<!---<div class='sidebar'>Now <a href='//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/ar-razi.cfm" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> is a colorful figure, his books are warned against by later Ash'aris such as as-Sanusi (d. 895H), and this is because often, <a href='//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/ar-razi.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> had no scruples and for the sake of refuting, he would bring together the arguments of the Philosophers, as well as those of the Mutakallimeen (theologians), when attempting to refute, which is what he did in his book "<i>Asaas at-Taqdees</i>", an attempt at refuting Allaah being above His Throne, with His Essence, and which Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah demolished in his "<i>Bayaan Talbees al-Jahmiyyah</i>". This book of <a href='//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/ar-razi.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> became an important reference work for all of the arguments against the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, the Righteous Salaf, that Allaah Himself, with His Essence, is above the Throne, to such a degree that today they are even prepared to utilize the arguments of the Philosophers made against them (the Mutakallimeen, the Ash'arites), as a basis for attacking the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah, which is academic dishonesty. A good example of this was illustrated when a contemporary intellectual fraudster going by the name of Abu Adam Naruiji, was caught and exposed in a scandal with respect to this particular subject, <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?cdaws>you can refer to that episode here</a>. </div> //--->    <P>
Coming to the subject of this series of articles now, we present in this some quotations from the <u>Tafseer of ar-Razi</u> pertaining to the core arguments for the justification of supplicating to those besides Allaah and seeking their <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>, and through this we illustrate that this type of refutation against the grave and saint worshippers precedes Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) by a century and Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah) by six centuries, and it also uncovers the academic and intellectual fraud of today's grave and saint-worshippers against the Scholars of Tawheed.  <P>

Fakhr ud-Din <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) has some commentary upon the saying of Allaah, the Most High, in Surah Yunus, which is a description of the reason used by the pagans to justify their <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of other deities besides Allaah:    <P>

Yunus (10):18 </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
He says the following (Tafsir <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> 17/63):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/razi-tawassul-shafaaah.gif border=0>    <P>
In the above passage <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> is speaking about the part of the verse in which Allaah is quoting from those who <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> others besides Him, which in reality do not benefit them nor harm them, and they say, "<b>These are our intercessors with Allaah...</b>" So <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> explains that these people argued that they should not be occupied with worshipping Allaah, but that they should be occupied with worshipping these idols because they will intercede for them with Allaah. Then <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> says that these people differed from this point onwards as to particularly how they understood these idols to be intercessors for them, and he says that they mentioned many sayings in this regard.     <P>
Then he explains six of such explanations and from them:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><u>The first of them:</u> That they believed that the a specific spirit from the spirits of the world of celestial bodies is in control of a particular region from the regions of the world, and thus they designated a specific idol for that spirit, and they occupied themselves with worshipping that idol. And their intent (behind worshipping the idol) was to woship that spirit. Then they also believed that the spirit was a slave of the greatest deity, and was occupied in worshipping it (the greatest deity).    <P>
<u>The second of them:</u> That they used to <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> the stars, and claimed that the stars are deserving of servitude to Allaah, the Most High. Then when they saw that the stars rise and set, they made specific idols for them and were occupied with worshipping them. And their intent (behind worshipping the idols) was to direct <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> towards the stars.    <P>
<u>And the third of them:</u> That they placed specific talismans upon those idols and statues, and then sought nearnes to them, as is done by the makers of talismans.</blockquote>    <P>
After mentioning these three, he then says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>And the fourth of them:</b> That they made these idols and statues upon the form and shape of their Prophets and senior [righteous] ones (al-akaabir), and they claimed that when they occupied themselves with the <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of these statues, then those senior [righteous] ones (al-akaabir) will be intercessors for them with Allaah. <b>And the equivalent of this in our time is the occupation of many of the creation with the veneration of the graves of the senior [righteous] ones, upon the belief that when they venerate their graves, then they (the deceased) will become intercessors for them with Allaah</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
And he means by "the senior ones (al-akaabir)" the righteous people. After mentioning another two manifestations, he then finishes by saying:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Know that all of these angles are futile by way of the evidence that Allaah the Most High has mentioned, which is His saying, "<b>And they <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> besides Allah things that hurt them not, nor profit them</b>..." and its corroboration is upon what we have mentioned (previously) from three angles.</blockquote>    <P>

They are the same ones present in the time of Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and likewise Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab, and likewise, those of our time who are attached to the graves, calling upon the deceased, venerating them and the likes, all with the reason that they are hoping to win favor with them and win their <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>. <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ar-Razi</font></a> included this amongst the various manifestations he listed, and then stated that all of these are futile and false on account of the  evidence of the verse under discussion.    <P>

All of what Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab has mentioned here is the same as what <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> pointed out about many people in his time who turned to veneration of and attachment to the graves, in order to solicit the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> of those dead people. And what Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab referred to as "<i>I'tiqaad</i>" is the precise thing that <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> was alluding to, and it is also given other names by the contemporaries, such as "<i>Walaayah</i>" and more popularly nowadays as "<i><a href='tags/tawassul.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tawassul</font></a></i>" (a means of nearness) - and they do not mean the legitimate <a href='tags/tawassul.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tawassul</font></a> but rather they mean veneration of the saints and the graves, just as <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> pointed out over 800 years ago.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Closing Note</font>    <P>
The spurious allegation which often comes from the direction of the Sufis and contemporary Jahmiyyah parading under the name of "Ash'ariyyah" against the people of Tawhid and Sunnah, has been exposed here, with <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H), preceding both Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (by a hundred years) and Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab (by six hundred years) in showing rejection against the grave-worshippers who seek <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> from the dead.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>The Mushriks (pagans) simply use things like idols, statues (or in a modern context, pictures) simply as a focal point for performing <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> which is in reality intended for those (angels, prophets, righteous) represented by these things, and these people are not stupid to believe that the pieces of wood, or stone, or other representations are going to intercede for them, certainly not (this is what <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> himself explains in another place). And likewise, the grave-worshippers simply use the graves as a focal point, but all of it is the same, it is the direction of what constitutes <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> to other than Allaah, the greatest of which is "<i><a href='tags/dua.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>du'a</font></a></i>" (<a href='tags/supplication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>supplication</font></a>), and <a href='tags/supplication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>supplication</font></a> is the essence of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a>, because it is never made except with other underlying elements which are themselves <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> in their own right, such as love, hope, aspiration, reliance, and attachment of the heart. And the nature of this <a href='tags/tawassul.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tawassul</font></a> (involving the seeking of shafaa'ah) is such that some of it is innovation that is an avenue to <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> and some of it is clear <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> (worshipping of others alongside Allaah) - and these affairs will be made clear in other articles inshaa'Allaah.</div>    <P>
