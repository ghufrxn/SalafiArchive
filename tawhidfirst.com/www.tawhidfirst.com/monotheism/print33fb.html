Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said in Majmu' al-Fatawa (1/126):    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/ibn-taymiyyah-wasait-dua.gif border=0></div>    <P>
<b>Translation:</b>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And if you affirm <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a> between Allaah and His creation - like the veil which is between the king and his subjects - in that they (the intermediaries) raise to Allaah the needs of His creation, such that Allaah guides His servants, grants them sustenance through their intermediation, hence, the creation ask them and they in turn ask Allaah, just as the <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a> (function) with the kings, they ask the kings for the needs of the people due to their closeness to them (the kings) and the people ask them (the intermediaries), out of respect for them so that they ask the king directly, or because their requesting from the <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a> is more beneficial for them than asking from the king (directly) due to them being closer to the king than the one making the request for needs, so whoever affirmed <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a> upon this angle, then he is a kaafir, mushrik, his repentance should be sought, so either he repents or he is killed (as an apostate).</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Note</b>    <P>
<blockquote>There are numerous concepts at work when a person solicits <a href='tags/dua.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>du'a</font></a> from the dead, and there are also underlying assumptions and beliefs associated with making these requests from the dead for them to supplicate to Allaah on behalf of the one asking them - and all of this falls within what Allaah described as <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> and kufr in the Qur'an which is making <a href='tags/dua.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>du'a</font></a> to other than Allaah (<u>asking the dead to make <a href='tags/dua.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>du'a</font></a> is <a href='tags/dua.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>du'a</font></a> in itself and is asking for their intercession</u>), treating them as <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a>, assuming that Allaah's relationship to the creation is like that of the kings with their subjects through the intermediation of ministers and their likes, soliciting their <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> (which actually means to ask another to make <a href='tags/supplication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>supplication</font></a> - <a href=indexb26f.html?kcqzx >see this article</a>). This matter will be elaborated upon in other articles.</blockquote> <P>
