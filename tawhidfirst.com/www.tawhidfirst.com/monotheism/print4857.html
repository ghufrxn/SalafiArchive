<font class='titleHeadline'>Background and Introduction</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/razi-tafsir-cover.gif border=1 align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0> To the right is a cover page for the book "<b>Tafsir ar-Razi</b>", also known as "<b>Mafaateeh al-Ghayb</b>" belonging to <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> who is a prominent Imaam for the Ash'aris of today and he died in 606H. We will be quoting from it further below to prove that "Tawhid al-Ibadah" is not an invention of Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah), nor Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah). <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ar-Razi</font></a> was present in a time when <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of other than Allaah within the Muslim Ummah had spread and thus, even amongst the As'hari scholars prior to this era, there exist clear indications in their books and writings that they (unlike the later Ash'aris) understood Tawhid al-Ibaadah, and explained it, and spoke against its violation, even if they erred in other aspects of creed.     <P>
Historically, the innovations of the first century were light innovations (Khawarij, Shi'ah, Qadariyyah, Murji'ah), in that they did not directly relate to Allaah Himself. Those that came in the second century hijrah were more severe in that they related directly to the belief in Allaah Himself (His Names, Attributes, His Uluww, His Speech), and then from this period the introduction of philosophy and gnosticism (mystical esoteric knowledge) led to further deviations. However, it took around six centuries for <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> (associationism) to spread amongst the Muslims on a wide scale. The seeds of this <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> were spread initially by the Ismaa'eelee Baatiniyyah known as Ikhwan al-Safaa (Brethren of Purity) in the third and fourth centuries, and they were given support by the Ubaidiyyah (Shii'ite rulers of Egypt) when they took power. Prior to this time (before the fifth century, i.e. 400H), whilst the variuos sects had deviations in issues of aqidah, the understanding of Tawhid al-Ibaadah was still relatively firm.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In light of this, the earliest Ash'aris had the least deviance, they were following the madhhab of Ibn Kullaab (d. 240H). The Ash'aris of the 5th and 6th centuries, hybridized their belief with that of the Mu'tazilah and Jahmiyyah (and thus deviated from the early Kullabi creed), and under the influence of gnostic mysticism, the Ash'aris who came later (7th, 8th century onwards) fell into saint and grave <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a>, which had started to spread in the time of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) - thereby surpassing all previous Ash'aris in deviation. It is for this reason that what is known today as "Ash'ariyyah" is not a uniform consistent belief or practice, rather it is a hotch-potch of views, many of which are inconsistent, and you find great differences between the early (original) Kullaabi Ash'aris, and those who came later.</div>     <P>
This shows that the greater deviations occurred when the people were further away from the era of revelation, and this is simply a cycle of history. This has always occurred after the sending of Prophets and Messengers, and it is indicated in the Prophetic texts for this ummah, such as those texts that mention that this (Muslim) nation will follow the footsteps of those (nations) that came before them (such as the Jews and Christians). For this reason, the greatest deviation, <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> with Allaah, was the last of the affairs to enter into the Ummah - long after the era of Prophethood.    <P>
<!---<div class='sidebar'>Now <a href='//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/ar-razi.cfm" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> is a colorful figure, his books are warned against by later Ash'aris such as as-Sanusi (d. 895H), and this is because often, <a href='//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/ar-razi.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> had no scruples and for the sake of refuting, he would bring together the arguments of the Philosophers, as well as those of the Mutakallimeen (theologians), when attempting to refute, which is what he did in his book "<i>Asaas at-Taqdees</i>", an attempt at refuting Allaah being above His Throne, with His Essence, and which Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah demolished in his "<i>Bayaan Talbees al-Jahmiyyah</i>". This book of <a href='//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/ar-razi.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> became an important reference work for all of the arguments against the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, the Righteous Salaf, that Allaah Himself, with His Essence, is above the Throne, to such a degree that today they are even prepared to utilize the arguments of the Philosophers made against them (the Mutakallimeen, the Ash'arites), as a basis for attacking the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah, which is academic dishonesty. A good example of this was illustrated when a contemporary intellectual fraudster going by the name of Abu Adam Naruiji, was caught and exposed in a scandal with respect to this particular subject, <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?cdaws>you can refer to that episode here</a>. </div> //--->    <P>
Coming to the subject of this series of articles now, we present in this some quotations from the <u>Tafseer of ar-Razi</u> pertaining to the core arguments for the justification of supplicating to those besides Allaah and seeking their <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>, and through this we illustrate that this type of refutation against the grave and saint worshippers precedes Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) by a century and Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah) by six centuries, and it also uncovers the academic and intellectual fraud of today's grave and saint-worshippers against the Scholars of Tawheed.  <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> on Taking Angels, Jinns, Prophets as <a href="tags/intermediaries.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">intermediaries</font></a></font>    <P>
In the (<a href=indexdfc4.html?qhxzs >first part</a>) of this series (<a href=indexdfc4.html?qhxzs >see here</a>), it was established that <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> showed rejection against those who venerate the graves, seeking to win the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> of the righteous dead, and he stated that this is rebutted by the Qur'an. Here is his statement quoted previously, and it is in reference to the saying of Allaah, "<b>And they <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> besides Allah things that hurt them not, nor profit them, and they say: "<i>These are our intercessors with Allah</i></b>"." which is in Surah Yunus (10:18), he wrote:    <P>
<div class='arabic' align='right'>&#1608;&#1606;&#1592;&#1610;&#1585;&#1607; &#1601;&#1610; &#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1586;&#1605;&#1575;&#1606; &#1575;&#1588;&#1578;&#1594;&#1575;&#1604; &#1603;&#1579;&#1610;&#1585; &#1605;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1582;&#1604;&#1602; &#1576;&#1578;&#1593;&#1592;&#1610;&#1605; &#1602;&#1576;&#1608;&#1585; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1603;&#1575;&#1576;&#1585; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1593;&#1578;&#1602;&#1575;&#1583; &#1571;&#1606;&#1607;&#1605; &#1573;&#1584;&#1575; &#1593;&#1592;&#1605;&#1608;&#1575; &#1602;&#1576;&#1608;&#1585;&#1607;&#1605; &#1601;&#1575;&#1606;&#1607;&#1605; &#1610;&#1603;&#1608;&#1606;&#1608;&#1606; &#1588;&#1601;&#1593;&#1575;&#1569; &#1604;&#1607;&#1605; &#1593;&#1606;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;</div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>And the equivalent of this in our time is the occupation of many of the creation with the veneration of the graves of the senior [righteous] ones, upon the belief that when they venerate their graves, then they (the deceased) will become intercessors for them with Allaah</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
Please refer to (<a href=indexdfc4.html?qhxzs >Part 1</a>) for the full context of the above quotation,  because <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> has stated that this action is <u>equivalent</u> to the practice of the idolators. In this article we want to now expand this and look at the statement of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> on another verse that relates to those worshipped besides Allaah, and which are other than idols, such as the Angels, Jinn and the Prophets [and likewise the Righteous]. And as we have already seen <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> speaking about the people seeking <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> from the righteous dead by venerating their graves, then his comments on this verse apply to that situation too.    <P>
He says (Tafseer <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> 15/232-233):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/razi-tawassul-shafaaah-waseelah.gif border=0>    <P>
In this passage, his commentary is on the verse:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Say (O Muhammad): "Call unto those besides Him whom you pretend [to be gods] besides Him. They have neither the power to remove the adversity from you nor even to shift it from you to another person." Those whom they call upon themselves seek a means of access to their Lord (Allah), as to which of them should be the nearest and they hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment. Verily, the Torment of your Lord is something to be afraid of! (Al-Isra 17:56-57) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
So he writes:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Know that the intent behind this verse is to refute the mushriks (pagans), and we have already mentioned that the mushriks used to say, "<i>We are not worthy of being occupied with the [direct] <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of Allaah the Most High, we shall <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> from the servants of Allaah, those who are close and near (to Him)</i>", and they are the Angels. Then they took statues and representations for that angel that they worshipped and they busied themselves with worshipping it upon this understanding.     <P>
And Allaah the Most High, brought proof for invalidating their saying in this verse, so He said, "Say (O Muhammad): "<b>Call unto those besides Him whom you pretend [to be gods] besides Him</b>...". And the intent here is not the idols, because He, the Most High, said in describing them, "<b>Those whom they call upon themselves seek a means of access to their Lord</b>...", and seeking a <a href='tags/waseelah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>waseelah</font></a> (means of nearness) to Allaah the Most High, is not befitting the idols ever.    <P>
When this is established, then we say: Verily a people worshipped the Angels, so this verse was revealed regarding them. And it has been said: It was revealed regarding those who worshipped al-Maseeh (Eesaa) and Uzair (Ezra). And it has been said: A people worshipped a group from the Jinn, the Jinn became Muslims and those people remained in adherence to <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of them, so this verse was revealed. Ibn 'Abbaas said: "Every place in the Book of Allaah the Most High that the word "<i>za'ama</i>" is mentioned (to claim, to pretend) [in relation to those worshipping others besides Him], then it [the claim] is a lie."     <P>
Further, He, the Most High, also brought as proof against the futility of the madhhab of those (people) [with the fact] that the Deity, the worshipped (in truth), He is the one who is able to stop harm and to bring about benefit, and these things that they <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a>, which are the Angels, Jinn, al-Maseeh (Eesaa) and Uzair, are not able to remove the harm or the bring about benefit, and thus, it is obligatory to affirm definitively, that they are not deities (worthy of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> in any sense).</blockquote>    <P>
Here <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> has presented the argument that since no one besides Allaah has control over harm and benefit, including the Angels, the Jinn, the Prophets, then they do not deserve <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> (from the greatest of which is <u>supplication, invocation</u>), and this includes, as per the statement we previously quoted from <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, the righteous dead, to whom people were flocking to and venerating their graves in the time of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a>, which he pointed out, for the sake of seeking their <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh ul-Islam Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhaab on This Topic</font>    <P>
We quote here from "<i><a href='tags/kashf-ush-shubuhaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kashf ush-Shubuhaat</font></a></i>", which is a systematic demolition of the arguments of the pagans who justify the worshipping of the righteous dead, and here the Shaykh brings this verse within the same context:    <P>
