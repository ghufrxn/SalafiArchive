<img src=assets/images/razi-tafsir-cover.gif border=1 align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0> To the right is a cover page for the book "<b>Tafsir ar-Razi</b>", also known as "<b>Mafaateeh al-Ghayb</b>" belonging to <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> who is a prominent Imaam for the Ash'aris of today and he died in 606H. We will be quoting from it further below to prove that "Tawhid al-Ibadah" is not an invention of Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah), nor Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah). <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ar-Razi</font></a> was present in a time when <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of other than Allaah within the Muslim Ummah had spread and thus, even amongst the As'hari scholars prior to this era, there exist clear indications in their books and writings that they (unlike the later Ash'aris) understood Tawhid al-Ibaadah, and explained it, and spoke against its violation, even if they erred in other aspects of creed.     <P>
Historically, the innovations of the first century were light innovations (Khawarij, Shi'ah, Qadariyyah, Murji'ah), in that they did not directly relate to Allaah Himself. Those that came in the second century hijrah were more severe in that they related directly to the belief in Allaah Himself (His Names, Attributes, His Uluww, His Speech), and then from this period the introduction of philosophy and gnosticism (mystical esoteric knowledge) led to further deviations. However, it took around six centuries for <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> (associationism) to spread amongst the Muslims on a wide scale. The seeds of this <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> were spread initially by the Ismaa'eelee Baatiniyyah known as Ikhwan al-Safaa (Brethren of Purity) in the third and fourth centuries, and they were given support by the Ubaidiyyah (Shii'ite rulers of Egypt) when they took power. Prior to this time (before the fifth century, i.e. 400H), whilst the variuos sects had deviations in issues of aqidah, the understanding of Tawhid al-Ibaadah was still relatively firm.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In light of this, the earliest Ash'aris had the least deviance, they were following the madhhab of Ibn Kullaab (d. 240H). The Ash'aris of the 5th and 6th centuries, hybridized their belief with that of the Mu'tazilah and Jahmiyyah (and thus deviated from the early Kullabi creed), and under the influence of gnostic mysticism, the Ash'aris who came later (7th, 8th century onwards) fell into saint and grave <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a>, which had started to spread in the time of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) - thereby surpassing all previous Ash'aris in deviation. It is for this reason that what is known today as "Ash'ariyyah" is not a uniform consistent belief or practice, rather it is a hotch-potch of views, many of which are inconsistent, and you find great differences between the early (original) Kullaabi Ash'aris, and those who came later.</div>     <P>
This shows that the greater deviations occurred when the people were further away from the era of revelation, and this is simply a cycle of history. This has always occurred after the sending of Prophets and Messengers, and it is indicated in the Prophetic texts for this ummah, such as those texts that mention that this (Muslim) nation will follow the footsteps of those (nations) that came before them (such as the Jews and Christians). For this reason, the greatest deviation, <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> with Allaah, was the last of the affairs to enter into the Ummah - long after the era of Prophethood.    <P>
<!---<div class='sidebar'>Now <a href='//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/ar-razi.cfm" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> is a colorful figure, his books are warned against by later Ash'aris such as as-Sanusi (d. 895H), and this is because often, <a href='//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/ar-razi.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> had no scruples and for the sake of refuting, he would bring together the arguments of the Philosophers, as well as those of the Mutakallimeen (theologians), when attempting to refute, which is what he did in his book "<i>Asaas at-Taqdees</i>", an attempt at refuting Allaah being above His Throne, with His Essence, and which Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah demolished in his "<i>Bayaan Talbees al-Jahmiyyah</i>". This book of <a href='//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/ar-razi.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> became an important reference work for all of the arguments against the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, the Righteous Salaf, that Allaah Himself, with His Essence, is above the Throne, to such a degree that today they are even prepared to utilize the arguments of the Philosophers made against them (the Mutakallimeen, the Ash'arites), as a basis for attacking the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah, which is academic dishonesty. A good example of this was illustrated when a contemporary intellectual fraudster going by the name of Abu Adam Naruiji, was caught and exposed in a scandal with respect to this particular subject, <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?cdaws>you can refer to that episode here</a>. </div> //--->    <P>
Coming to the subject of this series of articles now, we present in this some quotations from the <u>Tafseer of ar-Razi</u> pertaining to the core arguments for the justification of supplicating to those besides Allaah and seeking their <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>, and through this we illustrate that this type of refutation against the grave and saint worshippers precedes Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) by a century and Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah) by six centuries, and it also uncovers the academic and intellectual fraud of today's grave and saint-worshippers against the Scholars of Tawheed.  <P>

In the (<a href=indexdfc4.html?qhxzs >first part</a>) of this series (<a href=indexdfc4.html?qhxzs >see here</a>), it was established that <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> showed rejection against those who venerate the graves, seeking to win the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> of the righteous dead, and he stated that this is rebutted by the Qur'an. Here is his statement quoted previously, and it is in reference to the saying of Allaah, "<b>And they <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> besides Allah things that hurt them not, nor profit them, and they say: "<i>These are our intercessors with Allah</i></b>"." which is in Surah Yunus (10:18), he wrote:    <P>

Please refer to (<a href=indexdfc4.html?qhxzs >Part 1</a>) for the full context of the above quotation,  because <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> has stated that this action is <u>equivalent</u> to the practice of the idolators. In this article we want to now take a look at his commentary on another verse in the Qur'an which contains a mention or the argument used by the pagans to justify their <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> (invocation, supplication) to other than Allaah, be they animate, or inanimate. The verse in question is this one:    <P>

Ar-Razi writes (Tafsir <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> 26/241):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/razi-tawassul-shafaaah-26-241.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Know that the pronoun in His saying, <b>"We do not <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> <u>them</u> except that they may bring us near to Allaah</b>" refers back to those things worshipped besides Allaah and they are of two types, intelligent (animate, living) beings and the non-intelligent (inanimate, non-living) things.    <P>
As for the intelligent beings then a people worshipped al-Maseeh (Jesus), al-Uzair (Ezra) and the Angels, and many of the people <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> the sun, the moon and the stars, believing that they are alive, intelligent and [able] to speak. As for those things which are worshipped whilst not being described with life and intelligence, then they are idols.    <P>
When you have come to know this, then we say that the speech which the Kuffaar (disbelievers) have mentioned [in this verse], it is befitting (only) for the intelligent beings (that are worshipped), as for the non-intelligent beings, then (this speech of the Kuffaar) is not befitting (for them). And the explanation of this is from two angles:    <P>
<blockquote><b>The first:</b> That the pronoun in "<i>[we do not] <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> <u>them</u></i>" is a pronoun for intelligent beings [in the Arabic language], and thus it is not befitting (applicable) for idols.    <P>
<b>The second:</b> That it is not far off for those Kuffar to believe that al-Maseeh (Jesus), al-Uzair (Ezra) and the Angels <u>will intercede for them</u> with Allaah. Is it not far removed for an intelligent person to believe that [mere] idols and inanimate things will bring them closer to Allaah[?]</blockquote>    <P>
So upon this consideration [that is seeking intelligent beings for intercession], then their intent is that their <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of them (the idols, or representations) will bring them closer to Allaah. <b>And it is possible for it to be said that the intelligent being does not <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> an idol in the sense that it is mere wood or stone, but they <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> it due to their belief that these [things] are representations of the stars, or representations of the heavenly spirits, or representations of <u>the Prophets and righteous (dead) who have passed away</u>. And their intent behind worshipping them (the statues, idols, representations) is to direct those acts of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> to those things [the stars, heavenly spirits, prophets, righteous] for which they have made these representations as [tangible] forms for them</b>.    <P>
The essence of the speech of the worshippers of the idols is that they said that the greatest deity is more lofty than that man should <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> Him [directly], however it is more befitting for man that he should occupy himself with the <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of the senior ones from the servants of Allaah, such as the stars, and such as the heavenly spirits, and then they in turn will be occupied in <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of the greatest deity. This is what they mean by their saying, "<i>We <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> them only that they may bring us near to Allah</i>".</blockquote>    <P>
Now, if we did not state this was from <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> you might be thinking that this was a passage from Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Abdul-Wahhab's "<a href="tags/kashf-ush-shubuhaat.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kashf ush-Shubuhaat</font></a>" (Removal of the Doubts), or "al-Qawaa'id al-Arba'" (The Four Rules) or some of the other treatises of Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah). But no, its from a prominent Ash'arite figurehead who lived just into the beginnings of the seventh century hijrah, in a time when the Major <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> started to spread within the Ummah, and he spoke of it in a manner exactly like it is found in the works of Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah a hundred years later and in the works of Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Abdul-Wahhab six hundred years later. The only difference is that as it became more widespread, then it was spoken against more formally and books were dedicated to it. Now, remember you have understand these statements of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> in light of what he pointed out regarding what was taking place in his time:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So if he says, "<i>Shirk is worshipping idols, and we do not <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> idols</i>" . Then say to him, What is the meaning of worshipping idols? Do you think that the Pagans (of Makkah) used to believe that those wooden idols and stones had the ability to create, and provide and to regulate the lives of those who called upon them? For this is rejected by the Qurýaan, as occurs in His saying - the Most High, "<b>Say: Who provides for you from the Heavens and the Earth</b>..." (Yunus 10:31), to the end of the verse.    <P>
If he then says, "<i>Well it is when a person who actually intends and seeks (qasada) the wooden idols, or stones or tombs or other things, supplicating to them and sacrificing for them (i.e. a ritual sacrifice of an animal)  and then say, "they bring us closer to Allaah, and bring about his blessing (barakah) upon us, or they actually give us His blessing directly"</i>."    <P>
Then say to him, "You have spoken the truth. And this is your very action that you do near the stone idols  and the tombs that are upon the graves and other than them."    <P>
So this person has actually affirmed that this action of theirs (i.e. the Pagans) is actually <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a>, and this is what is desired from him (i.e. to come with this answer).    <P>
It is then also said, "This saying of yours, "<i>Shirk is the worshipping of idols</i>", is your intent behind this that <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> is limited to this only, and that depending and relying upon the dead righteous people and supplicating to them does not enter into this?" [If this is so], then this actually goes against what Allaah has mentioned in His Book about the disbelief of the one who is attached to <u>the Angels</u>, or <u>Eesaa (alaihis-salaam)</u>, or <u>the Righteous</u>. Hence, it is necessary for him to agree with you and affirm to you that the one who associates anyone from the righteous people in the <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of Allaah, that this is the very <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> that is mentioned in the Qur'aan.     <P>
This is what is desired (from him).</blockquote>    <P>
So with this, the truth is now firmly established and the falsehood has been demolished, and the academic and intellectual fraud of today's gnostics and the grave and saint-worshippers donning the gown of piety, has been exposed. What you have just read is the essence of "<a href="tags/kashf-ush-shubuhaat.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kashf ush-Shubuhaat</font></a>", right there in the writings of a sixth century (hijrah) prominent Ash'arite figurehead.       <P>
