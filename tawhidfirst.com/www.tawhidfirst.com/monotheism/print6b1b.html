The existence of a sole originator and creator of the universe is the most apparent and self-evident truth - which with all the advances in certain sciences such as genetics and astronomy - can no longer be denied with any air of authority. The vast progress made by science over the second half of the last century in general has only shown that as man's realization of the greatness of the universe has increased, his actual knowledge of it has thereby decreased (to the extent of the said realization), and the complexity and intricacy of the universe leaves little room for doubting that there is an unfathomable power behind it - which is Allaah, the Lord of the worlds.    <P>

And the exegete, Ibn Jareer at-Tabari (d. 310H), comments that the origination and creation of the heavens and earth is greater than the creation of man.    <P>
However, the affirmation of an originator and a creator, despite its obviousness, has not been the main point of contention throughout most of history. As for affirming a mere creator and originator:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The World's Most Notorious Atheist Knows It ...</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/flew-existence-god.gif align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0> Over 50 years ago, <a href='tags/antony-flew.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Antony Flew</font></a> re-invigorated the philosophy of atheism in the 20th century (after its waning) through a paper he wrote, "<i>Theology and Falsification</i>" which has probably been the most important work that invigorated and revived the atheism in the decades to follow. Flew was greatly respected and revered in the circles of atheism, being a towering figure in its philosophy.    <P>
However, Flew announced in 2004 that he is no longer an atheist and has accepted the existence of a creator. This, he explains, was a gradual process, through the progression in certain fields of science which slowly made him realize the impossibility of their not being an all-powerful all-knowing creator. Although Flew accepts that there must be a creator, he has not committed to any religion. In his book when one looks at the reasons, considerations or the specific arguments that led him to recant from atheism, you will find that they are not too far off from the implications of the  meanings of these verses in the Qur'an in Surah at-Tur:    <P>
<div class='arabicquran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'> &#1571;&#1614;&#1605;&#1618; &#1582;&#1615;&#1604;&#1616;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1618; &#1594;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1585;&#1616; &#1588;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1569;&#1613; &#1571;&#1614;&#1605;&#1618; &#1607;&#1615;&#1605;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1582;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1616;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614; &#1571;&#1614;&#1605;&#1618; &#1582;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1617;&#1614;&#1605;&#1614;&#1575;&#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1578;&#1616; &#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1571;&#1614;&#1585;&#1618;&#1590;&#1614; &#1576;&#1614;&#1604; &#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1575; &#1610;&#1615;&#1608;&#1602;&#1616;&#1606;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614; <img src='images/qnend.gif'></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Were they created by nothing? Or were they themselves the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth, they do not have any firm conviction. (At-Tur 52:35-36) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Upon returning to the explanation of this verse in the classical commentaries, the following meanings are presented:    <P>
<ul>  <li> Were they created by nothing, meaning without an originator or creator  <li> Were they created from nothing or as inanimate matter. meaning without a father or mother, and not by way of an embryo in its various stages, and not from sperm and ovum, were they created as inanimate beings  <li> Were they created without any purpose or end goal, there being no purpose to their lives  <li> Were they creators of themselves (they would never and cannot claim this)  <li> Were they the creators of the heavens and the earth (they would never and cannot claim this) </ul>    <P>
In the above book, Flew writes (pp. 88-89):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>LAYING THE CARDS ON THE TABLE    <P>
... I now believe that the universe was brought into existence by an infinite Intelligence...     <P>
Why do I believe this, given that I expounded and defended atheism for more than half a century? The short answer is this: this is the world picture as I see it, that has emerged from modern science. Science spotlights three dimensions of nature that point to God. The first is the fact that nature obeys laws. The second is the dimension of life, of intelligently organized and purpose-driven beings, which arose from matter. The third, is the very existence of nature...</blockquote>    <P>
And also on (p. 89):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>My departure from atheism was not occasioned by any new phenomenon or argument. Over the last two decades my whole framework of thought has been in a stage of migration. This was a consequence of my continuing assessment of the evidence of nature ...</blockquote>    <P>
And also on (p. 91)    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Three domains of scientific enquiry have been especially important for me, and I will consider them as we proceed in the light of today's evidence. The first is the question that puzzled and continues to puzzle most reflective scientists:  How did the laws of nature come to be? The second is evident to all. How did life as a phenomenon originate from nonlife? And the third is the problem that the philosophers handed over to the cosmologists: How did the universe, by which we mean all that is physical, come into existence?</blockquote>    <P>
And some of the chapter headings in his book include:    <P>
<ul><li> Who wrote the laws of nature?  <li> Did the universe know we were coming?  <li> How did life go live?  <li> Did something come from nothing? </ul>    <P>
Despite coming to the conviction that there absolutely must be a creator, Flew has not committed to any particular religion. Flew has not reached the truth which naturally follows on from this new conviction which is that the affirmation of the sole originator, creator, maintainer and regulator of the universe who is described with the most beautiful Names and the most lofty Attributes <u>necessitates</u> that only He be worshipped alone, and with that realization true religion would become immediately distinct from false religion.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Belief in a Sole Originator and Creator Necessitates True and Pure Monotheism and All False Religion Departs From That Necessity</font>    <P>
Once a belief in an all-powerful, all-knowing creator is established, it naturally follows that He be given <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> and devotion alone, as that is the natural consequence of such a belief, and this is what characterizes true religion.    <P>
In all nations, societies, civilizations in history there has always been a belief in a supreme creator, and historically, each nation from the time of Noah (alayhis salaam), up until the time of Mohammad (alayhis salaam) has been sent a Messenger with the message to give <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> only to the one truly deserving of it, which is Allaah, and to shun the <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of anything besides Him as that is false <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> and is the essence of ingratitude, infidelity (i.e. kufr). And nations, civilizations and societies have set up deities besides Allaah, amongst them Prophets, the angels, the jinn (devils, demons), the natural phenomena (wind, lighting, rain, mountains, the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, animals), the righteous (dead or living), their ancestors, stones, trees, idols and the likes. This false and unfounded <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a>, itself has four roots (arguments, justifications, claims) underlying it, and they are addressed in this article:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>False <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> and False Religion:</b>  Derives From Four Roots, All Of Which the Qur'an Has Negated - (<a href=indexabd6.html?lykxa>see here</a>)    <P>
</ul>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>There Is No Doubt Concerning Allaah, the Originator and Creator</font>    <P>
Allaah also said, regarding the saying of the Messengers to their peoples:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He, the most high, informs about what occurred between the disbelievers and their [respective] Messengers of argumentation. When their nations faced them [the Messengers] with doubt concerning what they brought to them of (the invitation) to <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> Allaah alone, without there being any partners to him (in worship), the Messengers said: "<i>Is there any doubt concerning Allaah</i>?", and this carries two things:    <P>
<blockquote><b>The first of them:</b> "Is there any doubt about His existence, for the innate (human) disposition testifies to His existence, and it (the innate disposition) is naturally inclined to affirm Him, since acknowledging Him is a necessity in the sound innate disposition".  However, doubt and confusion can sometimes occur to some of (the people) which requires inspection into the evidence that leads to (acknowledgment) of His existence. For this reason their Messengers said to them, in order to direct them to the path of knowing that He is "<i>the Originator of the heavens and the Earth</i>", the one who created them, originated them (from nothing), without (there being) any previous likeness for them. For the evidential witness by way of the newly-arising things, of creation and of (its) subjection [to mankind] is manifest for them both (the heavens and Earth). Hence, it is inevitable for them to have a Maker, who is Allaah, there is none which has the right to be worshipped except He, the Creator of everything thing, its Deity and Master.    <P>
<b>And the second meaning: </b>Regarding their saying, "Is there any doubt concerning Allaah", meaning is  there any doubt in his Ilaahiyyah (right of worship), and in his uniqueness in the obligation of giving <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> to Him (alone), whilst He is the Creator of all existing things and no one is deserving of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> except Him alone, without any partners. For the majority of nations used to affirm a Maker, but they used to <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> others alongside Him, as <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a> which they thought would benefit them or bring them closer to Allaah.</blockquote></blockquote>    <P>
The exegete, Ibn Jareer at-Tabari explains that the meaning of this verse:    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>What the Prophets and Messengers Called To</font>    <P>
They all called to the <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of Allaah alone, without any partners, since giving <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> to others alongside Allaah is the greatest injustice (<a href='tags/dhulm.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>dhulm</font></a>), since it is denying the favour and blessing of Allaah, and giving recognition, praise and <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> to others for the favours and bounties that originate in truth with Allaah. This is what is called "infidelity" (kufr) and also "associationism" (<a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a>), and this is the greatest crime, more so than murder, theft, adultery and the likes.     <P>

So this was the call of the Prophets and Messengers. As for <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> (<a href='tags/ibaadah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ibaadah</font></a>), its meaning, definition, forms and types, then that will be the subject of other articles, and it is a great and vital subject that one ought to grasp well in order to understand the distinction between true religion (Tawhid, Monotheism) and false religion (the deification of others besides Allaah and giving <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> to them). For now, we can  mention some brief words:    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Brief Mention of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> and Its Types</font>    <P>
Worship (<a href='tags/ibaadah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ibaadah</font></a>) refers to those inward and outwards actions that Allaah loves and is pleased with, and they include:    <P>
Supplication (<a href='tags/dua.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>du'a</font></a>), this is from the greatest of types of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a>, and the Prophet (alayhis salaam) said, (<span class='arb'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1593;&#1575;&#1569; &#1607;&#1608; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583;&#1577;</span>), "<i>Invocation is worship</i>", so it has been equated with <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a>, and this is because <a href='tags/invocation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>invocation</font></a> is accompanied inevitably with other forms of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> such as love, fear, hope, reliance and so on. This is why in the Qur'an we find a very strong prohibition of calling upon others besides Allaah. This  should not be confused with calling upon someone for some matter in which he or she has the ability to aid or assist, as this is permissible with respect to those who are a) alive, b) can hear, c) are capable in that matter c) are in such proximity that allows them to fulfill the request.    <P>
Also from the types of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> are love (<i>mahabbah</i>), fear (<i>khawf</i>), hope (<i>rajaa'</i>), seeking aid (<i>isti'aanah</i>), seeking refuge (<i>isti'aadhah</i>), seeking rescue (<i>istighaathah</i>), reliance (<i>tawakkul</i>), awe (<i>khasyhah</i>), aspiration (<i>raghbah</i>), fear (<i>rahbah</i>), humble submission (<i>khusoo'</i>) penitence (<i>inaabah</i>), sacrifice (<i>dhabh</i>), making oath (<i>nadhr</i>) and we will treat each of these in separate articles.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>In Conclusion...</font>    <P>
In conclusion, the mere affirmation of a supreme being, an originator, a creator has never been the major issue of contention, rather it is the issue of singling out <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> for the creator alone which was the issue of contention between the Messengers and their peoples.  And when one studies the great and amazing concern given to this truth - [which is the truth upon which the heavens and the Earth stand  namely that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah alone] - within Islam and within its texts (the Book and the Prophetic Sunnah) one will realize the difference between true <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> and true monotheistic religion and all false <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> and false religion, even if it is claimed to be monotheistic.    <P>
