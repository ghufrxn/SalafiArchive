All false <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> and false religion is based upon certain underlying assumptions and beliefs, on the basis of which, servitude, devotion and enslavement is shown to deities besides the sole originator and creator of the heavens and Earth, which is Allaah. Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) has written on this subject, and he has explained that Allaah has invalidated all the roots of <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> in this passage:    <P>

<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Say: "Call upon those whom you assert (to be associate gods) besides Allaah, they <b><u>do not possess</u></b> even the weight of an atom, either in the heavens or on the earth, nor have they <b><u>any share</u></b> in either, nor is there for Him <b><u>any supporter</u></b> from among them. And <b><u>no <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> profits with Him</u></b> except for him whom He permits. (Saba' 34:22-23) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Ibn al-Qayyim has nicely summed this up in his commentary on the verses as occurs in Madaarij us-Saalikeen (1/351):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Thus, the Mushrik (worshipper of others besides or alongside Allaah), he takes something as his object of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> on account of what he believes that on account of it he will attain some benefit. And benefit cannot be brought about except from one who has any of these four characteristics:    <P>
<ul><li>Either <u>an owner (maalik)</u> of whatever his worshipper seeks from him    <P>
<li>So if he is not an owner, then he is <u>a partner (shareek)</u> to the owner [in what he owns]    <P>
<li>And if he is not a partner to him [in what he owns], then he is <u>a helper (mu'een)</u> and <u>an aider (dhaheer)</u> to him    <P>
<li>And if he is not an aider and nor a helper, then he is <u>one who intercedes</u> with him (i.e. the owner).</ul>    <P>
So, He, the Sublime, negated all of these four levels, in a successive manner, moving from the one that is the highest to the one that is less than it. So he negated dominion, (<i>mulk</i>, i.e. ownership), and partnership (<i>sharikah</i>), and aiding, assisting (<i>mudhaaharah</i>), and <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> (<i><a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a></i>) which the Mushrik thinks to be so [but in reality it is Shirk]. And then He affirmed the [true, affirmed] <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> in which there is no portion for the Mushrik, and this is the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> that occurs with His permission.    <P>
So sufficient is this verse as light, and evidence, and deliverance, and purity in Tawheed, and cutting off the foundations of <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a>, and its underlying roots, for the one who understands it.</blockquote>    <P>
Hence, there is a rejection of the claim of there being the right of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> for any god or gods upon <u>the (false belief) of them owning something, independently, from the creation</u>. This is a refutation of the foundation of the <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> (paganism) of certain cultures, civilizations and nations, historically and present.    <P>
Then there is the negation of the claim of the right of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> for deities upon <u>the (false belief) that they share in the ownership of something in the creation</u> (along with Allaah). This is also a refutation of another level of the paganism of certain cultures, civilizations and nations, historically and present.    <P>
Then there is the negation of the claim of the right of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> for deities upon <u>the (false belief) that they aid and help Allaah in the regulation and management</u> of His creation. This is a refutation of yet another level of the paganism of certain cultures, civilizations and nations, historically and present.    <P>
Finally, there is the negation of the claim of the right of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> for deities upon <u>the (false belief) that they are able to effect <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> independently</u>, in their own right, without the permission of Allaah (for them to intercede) and secondly (what is found in other verses), without their knowledge of Allaah's pleasure with the one for whom they are interceding for. This is a refutation of a further level of the <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> that is found amongst many civilizations, religions and cultures, and is also found amongst those ascribing to Islam.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Exercise:</b> Go and take a look at all nations, civilizations and cultures in history, and you will find that what they worshipped besides the sole originator and creator were deities with respect to which they held at least one of these four claims. </div>    <P>
The Books were revealed and Prophets and Messengers were sent to call the people to the <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of Allaah alone, and that is the upright religion, and the truth for which the heavens and the earth were created.    <P>
You should also note that, if we reverse the order of these four levels, then the first level opens up the door to the greater and more grave levels of <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> (associationism):    <P>
<ul><li> The belief of <u>sure benefit through intercession</u> without Allaah's permission (idhn) for it to take place and without pleasure (ridaah) for the one for whom it is being made.    <P>
<li> The belief of their being <u>aiders or helpers</u> to Allaah with respect to management of His creation.    <P>
<li> The belief in the <u>sharing or partnering</u> with Allaah in ownership of anything in the creation.    <P>
<li> The belief in the <u>sole ownership</u> of anything in the creation.</ul>    <P>
It is for this reason that you find amongst gnostic, esoteric Sufis that they start of with the issue of seeking <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>, and eventually they are led to affirming qualities of <a href='tags/ruboobiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ruboobiyyah</font></a> for those (living or dead) whom they take as deities besides Allaah, such as the belief that they have power over benefit and harm, sharing with Allaah in that, or Allaah having granted them that power, as they claim. So with this verse, Allaah has cut off the roots of all false religion and false <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a>.   <P>
