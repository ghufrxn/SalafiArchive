<font class='titleHeadline'>Background and Introduction</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/razi-tafsir-cover.gif border=1 align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0> To the right is a cover page for the book "<b>Tafsir ar-Razi</b>", also known as "<b>Mafaateeh al-Ghayb</b>" belonging to <a href='tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="tags/ar-razi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> who is a prominent Imaam for the Ash'aris of today and he died in 606H. We will be quoting from it further below to prove that "Tawhid al-Ibadah" is not an invention of Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah), nor Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah). <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ar-Razi</font></a> was present in a time when <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of other than Allaah within the Muslim Ummah had spread and thus, even amongst the As'hari scholars prior to this era, there exist clear indications in their books and writings that they (unlike the later Ash'aris) understood Tawhid al-Ibaadah, and explained it, and spoke against its violation, even if they erred in other aspects of creed.     <P>
Historically, the innovations of the first century were light innovations (Khawarij, Shi'ah, Qadariyyah, Murji'ah), in that they did not directly relate to Allaah Himself. Those that came in the second century hijrah were more severe in that they related directly to the belief in Allaah Himself (His Names, Attributes, His Uluww, His Speech), and then from this period the introduction of philosophy and gnosticism (mystical esoteric knowledge) led to further deviations. However, it took around six centuries for <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> (associationism) to spread amongst the Muslims on a wide scale. The seeds of this <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> were spread initially by the Ismaa'eelee Baatiniyyah known as Ikhwan al-Safaa (Brethren of Purity) in the third and fourth centuries, and they were given support by the Ubaidiyyah (Shii'ite rulers of Egypt) when they took power. Prior to this time (before the fifth century, i.e. 400H), whilst the variuos sects had deviations in issues of aqidah, the understanding of Tawhid al-Ibaadah was still relatively firm.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>In light of this, the earliest Ash'aris had the least deviance, they were following the madhhab of Ibn Kullaab (d. 240H). The Ash'aris of the 5th and 6th centuries, hybridized their belief with that of the Mu'tazilah and Jahmiyyah (and thus deviated from the early Kullabi creed), and under the influence of gnostic mysticism, the Ash'aris who came later (7th, 8th century onwards) fell into saint and grave <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a>, which had started to spread in the time of <a href='tags/ar-razi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> (d. 606H) - thereby surpassing all previous Ash'aris in deviation. It is for this reason that what is known today as "Ash'ariyyah" is not a uniform consistent belief or practice, rather it is a hotch-potch of views, many of which are inconsistent, and you find great differences between the early (original) Kullaabi Ash'aris, and those who came later.</div>     <P>
This shows that the greater deviations occurred when the people were further away from the era of revelation, and this is simply a cycle of history. This has always occurred after the sending of Prophets and Messengers, and it is indicated in the Prophetic texts for this ummah, such as those texts that mention that this (Muslim) nation will follow the footsteps of those (nations) that came before them (such as the Jews and Christians). For this reason, the greatest deviation, <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> with Allaah, was the last of the affairs to enter into the Ummah - long after the era of Prophethood.    <P>
<!---<div class='sidebar'>Now <a href='//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/fakhr-ud-din-ar-razi.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fakhr ud-Din <a href="//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/ar-razi.cfm" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ar-Razi</font></a></font></a> is a colorful figure, his books are warned against by later Ash'aris such as as-Sanusi (d. 895H), and this is because often, <a href='//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/ar-razi.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> had no scruples and for the sake of refuting, he would bring together the arguments of the Philosophers, as well as those of the Mutakallimeen (theologians), when attempting to refute, which is what he did in his book "<i>Asaas at-Taqdees</i>", an attempt at refuting Allaah being above His Throne, with His Essence, and which Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah demolished in his "<i>Bayaan Talbees al-Jahmiyyah</i>". This book of <a href='//www.tawhidfirst.com/monotheism/tags/ar-razi.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ar-Razi</font></a> became an important reference work for all of the arguments against the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, the Righteous Salaf, that Allaah Himself, with His Essence, is above the Throne, to such a degree that today they are even prepared to utilize the arguments of the Philosophers made against them (the Mutakallimeen, the Ash'arites), as a basis for attacking the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah, which is academic dishonesty. A good example of this was illustrated when a contemporary intellectual fraudster going by the name of Abu Adam Naruiji, was caught and exposed in a scandal with respect to this particular subject, <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?cdaws>you can refer to that episode here</a>. </div> //--->    <P>
Coming to the subject of this series of articles now, we present in this some quotations from the <u>Tafseer of ar-Razi</u> pertaining to the core arguments for the justification of supplicating to those besides Allaah and seeking their <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>, and through this we illustrate that this type of refutation against the grave and saint worshippers precedes Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) by a century and Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah) by six centuries, and it also uncovers the academic and intellectual fraud of today's grave and saint-worshippers against the Scholars of Tawheed.  <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Recap Of What Has Preceded</font>    <P>
<blockquote>We have established previously that al-Razi, the Ash'ari scholar of the 6th and early 7th centuries, affirmed: <b>a)</b> That <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> (<a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>) belongs to none but Allaah alone, and <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> can never take place except with Allah's permission - (<a href=index6578.html?pqwqp>see this article</a>),  <b>b)</b> That <a href='tags/dua.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>du'a</font></a> (<a href='tags/supplication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>supplication</font></a>) is the loftiest of the stations of al-ubudiyyah (servitude, worship), is the  most excellent of the types of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a>, and the reality of <a href='tags/dua.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>du'a</font></a> is such that incorporates other forms of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> such as humility (dhull), servitude (uboodiyyah), incapacity (inkisaar), poverty, need (maskanah) - (<a href=index0b41.html?asmag>see this article</a>), <b>c)</b> That none of the pagans ever intended to <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> the statues or idols, rather the acts of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> they performed were directed to those in the graves, and their reason was that they were intending to solicit their <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> - (see <a href=index7248.html?fgnbc>this article</a> and <a href=index6578.html?pqwqp>this article</a>), <b>d)</b> That many were found in the time of al-Razi who flocked to the graves and venerated them with the desire of soliciting the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> of the righteous dead - (<a href=indexdfc4.html?qhxzs>see here</a>), <b>e)</b> That no nation in history ever believed in <a href='tags/ruboobiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ruboobiyyah</font></a> for other than Allaah (with an exception for the Dualists) and that none of those who <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> other than Allaah believe that what they <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> has any independent power or control. And that what actually led people to <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> things were certain philosophical and other reasons and from them were the soliciting of the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> of the pious, righteous dead. And further, that whatever they took as focal points of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> (pictures, idols, statues, graves, tombs) were never intended for <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> at all, rather they were simply focal points to allow the direction of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> to the righteous dead - (<a href=index3141.html?ebzse>see here</a>)</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Seeking <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> From Other Than Allaah Prevents You From Receiving <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> At All</font>    <P>
There is another statement of al-Razi that is of interest to us and it occurs in his tafseer of the verse in Surah al-Saba (34:22-23), and actually have an entire article on that subject with excellent commentary from Ibn al-Qayyim (<a href=indexabd6.html?lykxa>see here</a>). Al-Razi has a sentence or two of interest in his commentary on this verse. It occurs in his Mafaateeh al-Ghayb (25/255-256):    <P>
<img src=assets/images/razi-tawassul-shafaaah-25-255.gif border=0>    <P>
Before we translate the part of interest, al-Razi explains that the madhhabs (ways) that lead to  <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> are four in number. He explains three of them which are centered around doubts pertaining to the Angels, celestial bodies, stars and planets and in which the pagans wrongly believed that they were given ownership or control over parts of the  universe, or the events taking place therein. Then he mentions the fourth, where he says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The fourth of them: The saying of the one who said, "We <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> the idols which are representations of the Angels so that they (the Angels) may intercede with us" so Allaah, the Exalted said, in invalidating their saying, "<b>And nor will <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> benefit anyone in His presence except for the one for whom He permits</b>" (34:23). Hence, there is no benefit in your <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> of other's besides Allaah, for Allaah does not grant permission for the receipt of <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> for the one who worships other than Him. Hence, by requesting <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> (from other than Him) you have relinquished the <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> from yourselves.</blockquote>    <P>
This statement here is something in which al-Razi preceded Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Abdal Wahhaab. You have to remember what has preceded in these articles that al-Razi considers du'aa to be from the greatest form of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a>. And that <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> belongs only to Allaah and is asked only from Him. And that a people began to <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> the righteous dead (Prophets and otherwise) seeking <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> from them. And that this is the false <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> that is forbidden and which constitutes <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a>.     <P>
So here, when he says that by soliciting and requesting <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> from other than Allaah, they actually relinquish the <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> from themselves, and this means that they have fallen into <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a>, since <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> is only for the Ummah of Muhammad,  meaning those who are upon Tawhid and die upon that. And from this Tawhid is to solicit <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> only from Allaah in that you say "O Allaah allow the Prophet to intercede for me with You", this is what the Sunnah has come with and this is supplicating [which is worship] only to Allaah, with the firm belief that all <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> is in His control alone, and asking Allaah, to accept the Prophet as an intercessor for the one supplicating.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This is very different from those who supplicate directly to the Prophets and the righteous dead (this itself is worship) and then ask for something over which they have no control over (<a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a>), and which they will never perform, unless Allaah grants them permission to do so, and with the condition that He is pleased with the one for whom <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> is intended. And when supplicating to other than Allaah and requesting something which only Allaah can grant is <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a>, then Allaah is not pleased with this person, and this person, by his action, has relinquished <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>, meaning he has made it inadmissible for himself. And this is what al-Razi is saying in what has been cited above, and when put aside all of his other statements.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Closing Note</font>    <P>
As we have stated in earlier articles, if you take all of these statements of al-Razi, essentially you have got the first half of the book, <i>Kashf al-Shubuhaat</i> of Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Abd al-Wahhaab. It's actually identical more or less, and al-Razi preceded Ibn Abd al-Wahhab by around six centuries!    <P>
    <P>
