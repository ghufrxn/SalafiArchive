Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, in his treatise, "<i>al-Waasitah bayn al-Haqq wal-Khalq</i>", (<b>Intermediation Between al-Haqq [Allaah] and the Creation</b>) provides an excellent explanation of this subject. Before we quote the passage from this treatise, the following background information should be understood.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Background</font>    <P>
Just like the <b>mulk</b> (dominion) belongs to Allaah alone, and just like <b>izzah</b> (might, honour) belongs to Allaah alone, and just like Allaah alone is the dispenser of <b>rahmah</b> (mercy), and just like Allaah alone is the source of <b>barakah</b> (blessing, increase, growth) and so on, and just like none grants <b>maghfirah</b> (forgiveness) except Allaah alone, then likewise, to Allaah alone belongs all <b><a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a></b> (<a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>) - and these meanings are found in the Qur'an.    <P>
Allaah says in the Qur'an, in relation to <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> (<a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>):    <P>
<div class='arabicquran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'> &#1602;&#1615;&#1604; &#1604;&#1617;&#1616;&#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1607;&#1616; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1617;&#1614;&#1601;&#1614;&#1575;&#1593;&#1614;&#1577;&#1615; &#1580;&#1614;&#1605;&#1616;&#1610;&#1593;&#1611;&#1575; &#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615; &#1605;&#1615;&#1604;&#1618;&#1603;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1617;&#1614;&#1605;&#1614;&#1575;&#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1578;&#1616; &#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1571;&#1614;&#1585;&#1618;&#1590;&#1616; &#1579;&#1615;&#1605;&#1617;&#1614; &#1573;&#1616;&#1604;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1607;&#1616; &#1578;&#1615;&#1585;&#1618;&#1580;&#1614;&#1593;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614; <img src='images/qnend.gif'></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Say: "To Allah belongs all <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>. His is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, then to Him you shall be brought back."  (Az-Zumar 39:44) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Just like the dominion, sovereignty belongs to Allaah alone, likewise, the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> belongs to Allaah alone. What this means is that there is no <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> except with His permission, and there is no <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> except for the one with whom He is pleased. This is the meaning of "<i>to Allaah belongs all intercession</i>". And both these conditions are found in the following verse:    <P>
<div class='arabicquran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'> &#1610;&#1614;&#1608;&#1618;&#1605;&#1614;&#1574;&#1616;&#1584;&#1613; &#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1575; &#1578;&#1614;&#1606;&#1601;&#1614;&#1593;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1617;&#1614;&#1601;&#1614;&#1575;&#1593;&#1614;&#1577;&#1615; &#1573;&#1616;&#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1575; &#1605;&#1614;&#1606;&#1618; &#1571;&#1614;&#1584;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614; &#1604;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1585;&#1617;&#1614;&#1581;&#1618;&#1605;&#1614;&#1606;&#1615; &#1608;&#1614;&#1585;&#1614;&#1590;&#1616;&#1610;&#1614; &#1604;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615; &#1602;&#1614;&#1608;&#1618;&#1604;&#1611;&#1575; <img src='images/qnend.gif'></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> On that day no <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> shall avail, except the one for whom the Most Beneficent (Allah) has given permission and whose word is acceptable to Him.  (Ta-Ha 20:109) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
And these two conditions are mentioned in other verses too (<u>Baqarah 2:255</u>, <u>Anbiyaa 21:28</u>). When this is established, it follows that <u>the asking of intercession</u> is only from Allaah, just like the asking of barakah (blessing) is only from Allaah, and the asking of rahmah (mercy) is only from Allah, and the asking of maghfirah (forgiveness) is only from Allaah, and the asking of izzah (glory, honour) is only from Allaah. Consider the following verse:    <P>

<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Say (O Muhammad): "O Allah!

In this verse, Allaah establishes that He is the "Owner" of the dominion (mulk), then He says that He gives dominion (mulk) to whomever He wills and removes it from whomever He wills. And also consider the following verse:    <P>
<div class='arabicquran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'> &#1605;&#1614;&#1606; &#1603;&#1614;&#1575;&#1606;&#1614; &#1610;&#1615;&#1585;&#1616;&#1610;&#1583;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1593;&#1616;&#1586;&#1617;&#1614;&#1577;&#1614; &#1601;&#1614;&#1604;&#1616;&#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1607;&#1616; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1593;&#1616;&#1586;&#1617;&#1614;&#1577;&#1615; &#1580;&#1614;&#1605;&#1616;&#1610;&#1593;&#1611;&#1575; <img src='images/qnend.gif'></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Whosoever desires izzah (honour, power and glory) then to Allah belong all honour, power and glory  (Fatir 35:10) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
So all izzah (might, honour, glory) belongs to Allaah and (from the previous verse) He gives it to whomever He wills and removes it (i.e. humiliates, lowers) from whomever He wills.    <P>
When you grasp this with respect to <u>mulk</u> (dominion) and <u>izzah</u> (might, honour, glory) and <u>barakah</u> (blessing) - and all of this is found in the Qur'an, then it is exactly the same with the saying of Allaah:    <P>
<div class='arabicquran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'> &#1602;&#1615;&#1604; &#1604;&#1617;&#1616;&#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1607;&#1616; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1617;&#1614;&#1601;&#1614;&#1575;&#1593;&#1614;&#1577;&#1615; &#1580;&#1614;&#1605;&#1616;&#1610;&#1593;&#1611;&#1575; <img src='images/qnend.gif'></div>    <P>

As all <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> belongs only to Him alone, then it is asked and sought from Him alone, and it is not asked of those besides Him, since He is the only granter of <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> (shafee') in truth and in reality, and all <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> returns back to Him, and those besides Him have absolutely no say or power or ability in <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> without His permission and pleasure.     <P>
And we see in the Qur'an <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> being negated and also being affirmed. That which is affirmed is the <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> for which Allaah has granted permission for it to be sought, which is sought from Allaah, and whose recipient He is pleased with. And that which is negated is the requesting of <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> from others besides Allaah.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Fathoming The Topic of Intercession</b>    <P>
<blockquote>Now, when we speak of <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a> (<a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>) and those who seek it and ask of it from others besides Allaah, what does this mean practically? Let us explain. It is known that on the Day of Judgement, the Prophet Muhammad (alayhis salaam) and the Prophets in general, and the Angels and the Righteous, will all intercede for others with Allaah. This is the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> that these people seek, however they request it by way of calling upon those who are dead from amongst the Prophets, and Righteous. They also request immediate <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> (from those who are dead) which is besides the one being sought for the Hereafter. And in all of this they combine a number of things, <u>firstly</u>, supplicating (<a href='tags/dua.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>du'a</font></a>) upon other than Allaah, (where the <a href='tags/supplication.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>supplication</font></a> is directly to other than Allaah)  and <u>secondly</u>, asking them for something in which they have no say, power or ability, which is the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> that belongs to Allaah alone, since there will be absolutely no <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> on the Day of Judgement except with His permission. It will <b>not be allowed to take place by anyone</b>, and <b>nor accepted for anyone</b> except for he whom Allaah is pleased with.     <P>
<u>To fathom this further</u>, you should imagine these people invoking the dead and asking them for forgiveness, or asking them for sustenance, or asking them for izzah (might, honour) when all these things belong only to Allaah and lie within his authority alone. And the same with <a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a>, there is no difference between them at all, as all belong to Allaah alone.     <P>
<u>To fathom this even further</u>, imagine the situation where someone goes to a living person and says, "Intercede for me with Allaah on the Day of Judgement", now you know this is wrong, because firstly how do you know that person is going to be in a position to intercede in the first place, secondly, how can that person intercede on the Day of Judgement in the absence of Allaah's permission, [and even the Prophet (Muhammad) will not intercede until after Allaah grants permission], so how then for those less than him - this is challenging Allaah's authority and treating him like the kings of the earth with whom people intercede without their permission. Now, this is regarding a living person, and it becomes worse when you invoke a dead person with the same request.    <P>
So from this you should understand the great mistake of these people in what they do. When they become attached to others besides Allaah (through the lure of seeking intercession), invoking them, then <a href='tags/invocation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>invocation</font></a> is such that underlying it or accompanying it are other actions (of the heart) which constitute <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> in their own right, such as the type of love, hope, aspiration, reliance and the likes, that is due only to Allaah.  So these people, through the route of seeking <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a>, open themselves up to committing <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a> with Allaah. And indeed, it was in this subtle, step-by-step manner that Iblees misguided many a nation and civilization in the past into worshipping others besides Allaah. Also it is highly recommended that you read this article:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>False <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> and False Religion:</b>  Derives From Four Roots Which Have All Been Negated By the Qur'an - (<a href=indexabd6.html?lykxa>see here</a>)  </ul></blockquote></div>    <P>
Once all this is grasped well, we can move and see how this subject is connected to Tawhid (Monotheism), and how the failure to understand this, and to understand the true nature of the associationism (<a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shirk</font></a>) of those rebuked in the Qur'an, leads people to end up giving their devotion and <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> to others besides Allaah, upon false and rejected assumptions.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn Taymiyyah on the Affirmed and Rejected Types of <a href="tags/intermediaries.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">intermediaries</font></a></font>    <P>
The titles are added for making the passage easy to read and follow:    <P>
<b>THE SCHOLARS ARE THE INHERITORS OF THE PROPHETS AND THEY ARE <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a> OF KNOWLEDGE AND ITS DISSEMINATION</b>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Those who affirm people other than the Prophets - such as the shaikhs [scholars] of Knowledge and of the religion -  as <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a> between the Messenger and his Ummah in the sense that they are people who impart knowledge to them (the Ummah), teach them (such knowledge) and correct their conduct and then follow in their way, they are correct in doing so (i.e. considering them <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a> in this particular manner).    <P>
When these scholars agree upon a matter, their concensus is an absolute proof. They never unite upon misguidance and if they differ upon any issue they always refer it to Allaah and His Messenger. This is because not a single one of them is free from making mistakes in an absolute manner, rather every persons words can either be accepted or rejected except the words of the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam). The Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said: "<i>The scholars are the inheritors of the Prophets and the Prophets do not leave behind dinars or dirhams but they leave behind the knowledge so whoever takes from it then he has acquired a huge fortune</i>." [Abu Daawood]</blockquote>    <P>
<b>THE INTERMEDIATION OF SHIRK</b>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There are those who affirm them as being <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a> between Allaah and His creation in the manner of a barrier which is between a king and his citizens and who raise to Allaah the needs of His creation - such that Allaah guides His servants and gives them sustenance throught their intermediation, the creation asks them and they ask Allaah. This is like the <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a> between the kings and their people who ask for the needs of the people because they are closer to the kings than the people themselves. So the people ask them courteously, that they should take their request to the king, or thinking that their requesting the <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a> is more beneficial for them than requesting from the king directly because the <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a> are closer to the king than the one making the request. Whoever affirms the scholars as <a href='tags/intermediaries.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intermediaries</font></a> in such a manner then he is a Kaafir (disbeliever) and a Mushrik (pagan). It is necessary to seek his repentance and if he does not make repentance he must face death. Such people make resemblances for Allaah, they compare the creation with the Creator and set up rivals and equals with Allaah.</blockquote>    <P>
<b>THE REJECTED TYPES OF INTERMEDIARIES</b>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There is a refutation of these people within the Qurýaan which is too vast to mention in this treatise. Intermediation between the kings [of  this world] and their people occurs in one of three ways:    <P>
<blockquote><b>THE FIRST:</b> Informing the king of the situation of the people which the king by himself does not know. Whoever says that Allaah does not know the condition of His servants until some of the angels or the prophets or anyone else informs Him of that he is a Kaafir. Rather He, the One Free from all Imperfections, knows [all the] secrets and what is most hidden. No one can hide anything from Him in the Heavens and the Earth and He is the Hearer, the Seer. He hears the sounds of all the tongues in all the different languages with all the diversity of their requests. Listening to one does not occupy Him from listening to another. Neither does this cause Him to make mistakes and nor is He exhausted by the persistence of the insistent.    <P>
<b>THE SECOND:</b> When the king is incapable of administering and regulating his people and in repelling his enemies except by helpers who assist Him. He cannot do without these assistants due to his weak position and incapacity. However, Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and limitations is not in need of a  helper nor any allies to help Him.Allaah the Exalted said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Say: "Call upon other (gods) whom you fancy, besides Allaah: They have no power,- not the weight of an atom,- in the heavens or on earth: No (sort of) share have they therein, nor is any of them a helper to Allaah." (Sabaa 34:22) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
And He said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Say: "Praise be to Allaah, who begets no son, and has no partner in (His) dominion: Nor (needs) He any to protect Him from humiliation: and magnify Him for His greatness and glory!" (Israa 17:111) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Allaah is the Creator, the Lord and the Owner of everything which is in existence. He is the One free of all needs from that which is besides Him and all that is besides Him is in need of Him in opposition to the kings who are in need of their helpers. In reality such people are their partners in the ownership of their dominion and kingdom. Allaah the Exalted has no partner in His dominion, rather there is none deserving of <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> except Allaah alone, without any partners, to Him is the dominion, to Him belongs all Praise and He has power over all things.    <P>
<b>THE THIRD:</b> When the king does not desire any benefit for his people and showing benevolence and mercy to them except due to an external movement which urges him to do so. The concern of the king for fulfilling the needs of his flock changes either due to his heart being affected by the words of the one who advises, warns him and directs him or due to the fear or aspiration which occurs (in his heart) on account of the words of the one who is directing him    <P>
However Allaah the Exalted is the Lord and Owner of everything. He is more merciful to His servants than a mother is to her offspring. Everything occurs by His Will, whatever He wills happens and whatever He does not will does not occur. When He sends down benefit for His servants he makes one of them do good towards another by supplicating for him or interceding for him (in a matter of the world) and other such things. Allaah is the Creator of all of that and He is the One who created in the heart of this doer of good, who supplicates and intercedes, the desire to do good, make supplications and intercede.    <P>
It is not possible that there is anyone in the creation who can compel Him against his will or desire or inform Him about something which He did not know or whom He hopes in or fears. For this reason the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said: "<i>Let not one of you say: O Allaah! Forgive me if you will, have mercy upon Me if you will. Let him be firm and resolute in the matter for there is none to compel Allaah (to do something)</i>." [Bukhaaree]    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>The Difference Between the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> That Belongs to Allaah and That Which is Made With the Kings</font>    <P>

<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> And they offer no <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> except for those whom (Allaah) is pleased with (Anbiyaa 21:28) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Allaah has also said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b>  Say: "Call upon other (gods) whom you fancy, besides Allaah: They have no power,- not the weight of an atom,- in the heavens or on earth: No (sort of) share have they therein, nor is any of them a helper to Allaah. No <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> can avail in His Presence, except for those for whom He has granted permission. (Sabaa 34:22) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Allaah has explained that everyone who is called upon besides Him does not have any possession or share in the dominion and neither is he a helper to Allaah. He also explained that their <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> will not benefit anyone except for whom permission has been granted by Allaah. This is not so in the case of the kings of this world because the one who intercedes with them often has some sort of dominion or power and is sometimes a partner to them in their kingdom. Sometimes he is helps or assists them in the management of their kingdom.    <P>
And all of these people intercede with the king without the permission of the king. The king sometimes accepts their <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> due to a need he has from them, or due to fear of them, or to reward them for their good conduct towards him and causing benefit to him. The king may even accept the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> of his wife and son because he is in need of a wife and a son and if they were to turn away from him he would be harmed by that. He also accepts the <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> of his citizens because he fears that if it was not accepted they would not obey him or that they might try to cause him harm. The <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> of people for each other, all of it is of this type. No one accepts <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> except out of fear or hope/aspiration.    <P>
Allaah the Exalted does not hope in anyone, however, nor does He fear anyone. He is Al-Ghaniy (the One Free of all needs). The Exalted said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Behold! verily to Allaah belong all creatures, in the heavens and on earth.  What do they follow who <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> as His "partners" other than Allaah? They follow nothing but fancy, and they do nothing but lie. He it is That has made you the night that you may rest therein, and the day to  make things visible (to you). Verily in this are signs for those who listen (to His  Message). They say: "Allaah has begotten a son!" - Glory be to Him!  He is self-sufficient! His are all things in the heavens and on earth! (Yoonus 66-68) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Allaah the Exalted said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b>  They serve, besides Allaah, things that hurt them not nor profit them, and they  say: "These are our intercessors with Allaah." Say: "Do you indeed inform Allaah of something He knows not, in the heavens or on earth? Glory to Him! and far is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)!" (Yoonus 10:18) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
He also said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Why then was no help forthcoming to them from those whom they  worshipped as gods, besides Allaah, as a means of access (to Allaah)? Nay, they left them  in the lurch: but that was their falsehood and their invention. (Ahqaaf 46:28) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
He also informs about the pagans who said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> We do not <a href='tags/worship.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>worship</font></a> them except that they may bring us closer to Allaah (Zumar 39:3) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
And He said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> And He does not command you to take the angels and the prophets as lords besides Allaah. Would he command you with Kufr while you are Muslims (Aali Imraan 3:80) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>  </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
This topic is a foundational one as it relates to Tawhid, and from the above, it should be clear that <u>intercession (<a href='tags/shafaaah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shafaa'ah</font></a>) belongs to Allaah alone</u>, that He alone grants it, and that it should be asked only from Him alone, and that likening Allaah to the kings of the Earth as it relates to how <a href='tags/intercession.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>intercession</font></a> takes place with them, <u>then that is a revilement upon Allaah</u>, and anyone who believes that this is how Allaah operates with respect to His creation has committed <i>kufr</i>, for Allaah is free from all the deficiencies of created beings, lofty and exalted is He from all of that.     <P>
However, the opponents of the Prophets and Messengers have their doubts and arguments in this regard and these will be addressed in detail in other articles.  <P>
