		<description><![CDATA[Salam u alaykum, I would like to hear your opinion, on the Hadith Mentioned by Bazzar,

 “ “My living is good for you, for you will be told what is good and what is bad for you; and my death is good for you, for your deeds will be shown to me, then whatever I see of good, I will praise Allah for it, and whatever I see of bad, I will pray to Allah to forgive you.””

This has been the topic of discussion recently, with some saying hasan, our salafi shuyookh saying weak. Something brought up that this hadith has 5-6 supporting chains to make it hasan, but you mentioned that the belief that the dead are aware in their graves is not strong on another one of your articles.

I sent a twitter DM for the topic, you will see what I mean. Jazak’Allah khair and I hope for any response.]]></description>
