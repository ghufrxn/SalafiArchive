				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[Shaykh Ahmad Din Ghakrwi was a powerful scholar, orator, writer and debater. He sought ilm from equally great scholars. He was a prolific debater and is on record for defeating the Hanafis, Barelwis, Qadiyanis, Shi’a and Christians in debates when he started at the age of 20 (1920). He was born in 1900 and authored magnificent books in defence of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and refuting Christians and Hindus] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Taqlid leads to the formation of some islamically legislative deficiencies, some of them are the following,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 1<sup>st</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Taqlid is Shirk in risalah</strong> which is synonymous to shirk with Allah. Shah Waliullah Muhaddith Dehlawi said in <em>Aqd ul-Jid</em>,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Then emerged the fanatical followers of the four madhhabs who made taqlid of their respective Imams in a manner as if they were sent as Prophets to them (i.e. the fanatical muqallid followers).”<a style="color: #000080;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This is Shirk in risalah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 2<sup>nd</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The <strong>muqallidin distorted and altered texts of the Quran and Sunnah</strong>, as I mentioned previously. (The Shaykh cited the example of the Deobandi scholar Mawalana Mahmud al-Hasan forging and distorting words in the Quran and the Deobandi Hanafis altering and distorting words in ahadith).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 3<sup>rd</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Taqlid creates jealousy and hatred</strong> in humans just like the Hanafis went to <strong>extreme exaggeration</strong> in the virtues of their Imam. The marginal notes to <em>Sharh Nukhbatul Fikr</em> mentions the fanatical extreme to the extent they said in the virtue of Imam Abu Hanifah,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said he is the light of my Ummah.”</span><a style="color: #000080;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So, <strong>they openly slandered the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</strong> and they dishonoured their Imam. Furthermore, they fabricated and forged reports and incidences in the virtue of their Imam. Some of them are,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said all the Prophets have pride based on me and I have pride based on Abu Hanifah. <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/22)</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jurjani transmits if there was a scholar of the likes of Abu Hanifah in the Ummah of Musa and Isa they would not have been Jews or Christians (i.e. Abu Hanifah would have converted all of them to Islam). <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/22).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Imam Abu Hanifah saw Allah 100 (one hundred) times in his dream. <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/21). However, Fatawa Qadhi Khan in volume 4 in the chapter of Tasbih and Taslim mentions whoever says he saw Allah in a dream then he is the same as the one who worships idols! (cited from Haqiqah tul-Fiqh (1/133-134).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Our madhhab is upon the truth while the others are upon error. <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/818, 4/44).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thabit (the father of Abu Hanifah) took his son, Imam Abu Hanifah to Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu and asked him to supplicate for him. <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/26)  </span> </span> </span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Note:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It should be noted Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu was martyred in 40H and Abu Hanifah was born in 80H, meaning he went to him 40 years before his birth!</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Isa Alayhis Salam will judge and give rulings according to the Hanafi madhhab when he will descend and return.<span style="color: #000080;"> (Durr al-Mukhtar (1/24).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Imam stood on one leg and completed the Quran in one night while at the Ka’ba and a voice was heard saying to him, “You are forgiven, and whoever follows you is forgiven and all those upon your madhhab until the Day of Judgement.” <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/21).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Someone disrespected Imam Abu Hanifah in the presence of Imam Abdullah b. al-Mubarak and he replied in a roaring voice, “I am amazed at you, you are disrespecting the person who prayed the 5 daily prayers for 45 years with one wudhu and who would complete reciting the whole Quran during the night in 2 rak’ahs.”<span style="color: #000080;"> (Cited from Maqam Hazrat Imam Abu Hanifah (p.60) of Molvi Sarfraz Ahmad Deobandi Ghakarwi).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="9">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is more virtuous to seek the knowledge of fiqh than reciting Quran. (Durr al-Mukhtar (1/14).</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, they insulted and belittled Muhammad b. Idris ash-Shafi’i to such an extent that it created overwhelming hatred for the Imam. They wrote,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Allah’s Messenger Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam said, “There will be a man in my Ummah who will be more harmful to my Ummah than iblis and he will be called Muhammad b. Idris ash-Shafi’i.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This is <strong>extreme exaggeration</strong> and it opposes the Prophets Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam’s Sunnah. There is also no authentic chain from the Companions proving this (cited from <em>Hashiyyah Sharh Nukhbah</em>). [The text of <em>Sharh Nukhbah</em> also mentions the muqallidin would also forge ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Allah Allah, <strong>they were shameless in insulting Imam ash-Shafi’i.</strong> In truth, he was from the most trustworthy of people and he was lauded with the title of defender of hadith. I do not know what harsh response the Shafiyyah must have given regarding this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 4<sup>th</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Taqlid of individuals resembles the way of the Rawafidh.</strong> The Rawafidh went to extremes in the virtue of Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu (refer to al-Kafi) to such an extent that they raised his status more than Musa’s and Isa’s (Alayhimus Salam). <strong>This is clear disbelief</strong>. Raising the status of non-Prophet to more than the status of a Prophet is clear disbelief. <strong>The muqallidin are also like this</strong>, they do not see other Imams in a good light except their own as we have shown from the examples in the previous deficiency. The usual diatribe of openly showing respect for all Imams continues but in reality much time is exerted refuting them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 5<sup>th</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The muqallid cannot be metaphorically referred to as Ahlus Sunnah</strong> in terms of actions. Generally speaking, the muqallid will only accept matters which are part of the madhhab of his Imam, for example <strong>the Hanafis do not accept the authentic ahadith in the Sahihayn and the 4 canonical books of hadith</strong> because they oppose and contradict their madhhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Maliki’s, Shafi’is and Hanbali’s largely only recite Fatihah behind the Imam, raise their hands (Raf ul-Yadayn) and say Amin loudly because it is their Imam’s madhhab. If their respective Imams did not practise these matters, they would also not have accepted them like the Hanafis. <strong>These muqallidin do not practise these matters because they are the Sunnah of the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</strong>, but rather, they practise them because it is the view and position of their Imams. Therefore, the muqallidin have no right to call themselves Ahlus Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>We are amazed at Hanafis, who call themselves Ahlus Sunnah</strong> and are proud about it but in essence they have no right to call themselves Ahlus Sunnah, rather, they should call themselves Hanafis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Dear readers, these are just some brief deficiencies of taqlid which I have mentioned in brevity.     </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">(<em>Qudamat Ahlus-Sunnah wa’l Jama’ah Ya’ni Ahlul Hadith</em> (p.603-606) from <em>Majmu’a Rasa’il Mawlana Ahmad Din Ghakarwi</em>.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Sunnah is to look at and focus on the index finger during tashahhud and not to extend the sight beyond the index finger. This view of the Ahlul Hadith is supported by a number of textual evidences.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The First Evidence </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Abdullah b. az-Zubayr narrates from his father, az-Zubayr RadhiAllahu Anhuma narrates the Prophet Sallalalhu Alayhi Wasallam</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong><em>“His sight did not go beyond the pointing (of his index finger) [meaning he focussed on his index finger]”</em></strong> (Abu Dawud (no.990), Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (no.718), Sahih Ibn Hibban (al-Ihsan) (3/201 no.1941), al-Bayhaqi, Sunan al-Kubra (2/190 no.2790), al-Baghawi, Sharh as-Sunnah (no.677) and its chain is Hasan while its origin is in Sahih Muslim (no.579).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Muhammad b. Ajlan in the chain transmits by An’ana however, in <strong>Musnad Ahmad</strong> (4/3 no,16145), <strong>al-Fath ar-Rabbani</strong> (4/115) he clarified he heard the hadith directly. This hadith was <strong>graded authentic</strong> by Imams Abu Awanah, Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban while an-Nawawi and Ibn Mulaqqin <strong>graded the chain authentic</strong>. (Mustakhraj Abi Awanah (no.2018), Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (no.718), Sahih Ibn Hibban (al-Ihsan) (no.1941), Khulasah al-Ahkam (1/427), at-Tawdhih (7/32).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Shaykh Shams ul-Haq al-A’zimabadi said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">“That is that his sight follows the pointing (of his finger) since it is the etiquette of conforming to humility. It means he does not look at the sky with signifying Tawhid which is the practise of some people, rather he should look at his finger and not beyond this.” (A’wn al-Ma’bud (3/197)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Shaykh Abdur Rahman al-Mubarakpuri said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">“Benefit: The Sunnah is that a person should not look beyond the pointing of his finger as the aforementioned hadith of Ibn az-Zubayr mentions. It should be pointed towards the Qiblah with the intent of indicating at-Tawhid and sincerity.” (Tuhfatul Ahwadhi (2/160).  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Someone might argue this is not the meaning of this hadith, that the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam fixated on his index finger, but it means he did not look beyond his index finger yet his focus could have been on anything closer than his index finger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imam Ibn Khuzyamah clarifies this doubt through his chapter title and hence shows this was the view of the early Ahlul Hadith, Imams of Hadith and Sunnah. He adds the chapter, <strong>“To Look at the [index] Finger While Pointing with it in Tashahhud.”</strong> (Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (1/355 no.718). Imam al-Bayhaqi wrote the following chapter heading, <strong>“The Sunnah is not to Look Beyond the Pointing of the Finger.”</strong> (as-Sunan al-Kubra (2/90)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The Second Evidence</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong><em>“On the authority of Abdullah b. Umar, He saw a man moving pebbles with his hand while praying. When he finished, Abdullah said to him: “Do not move the pebbles since you are praying, for that is from Shaytan. Rather do what the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam used to do.” He said: &#8220;What did he used to do?” He said, &#8220;He would put his right hand on his right thigh, and point with the finger next to his thumb [index finger] towards the Qiblah, and he would look at it (the pointing of the finger) or thereabout.” Then he said: &#8220;This is what I saw Allah’s Messenger Salallahu Alayi Wasallam doing.”</em></strong> (an-Nasa’i (no’s.1160, 1265, 1266), its chain is authentic and its origin is in Sahih Muslim (no.580), Abu Dawud (no.987), Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (no.719), Sunan al-Kubra (2/132)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">This hadith was <strong>graded authentic</strong> by Imams Abu Awanah, Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban. (Mustakhraj Abi Awanah (no.2017), Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (no.719), Sahih Ibn Hibban (3/202 no.1944) and Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Sunan an-Nasa’i.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imam an-Nasa’i placed in under the following chapter: <strong>“Where to look During Tashahhud</strong>.” (Sunan an-Nasa’i (no.1160). Imam Abu Awanah Israfayni established the following chapter<strong>, “In Clarifying in Pointing with the Finger to the Qiblah and Fixating on it.”</strong> (Mustakhraj Abu Awanah (1/539 no.2017).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Shaykh Muhammad Ataullah Hanif al-Bhojiyani said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">“Meaning – he would turn his sight to his finger and Naf’i said when Abdullah b. Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma would sit in prayer he would place his hands on his knees and point with his finger and fix his sight on it and he then said, Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <strong><em>“This is more severe on shaytan than an iron rod.”</em></strong> (Ahmad (2/119) as cited in Mishkat.” (at-Ta’liqat as-Salafiyyah A’la Sunan an-Nasa’i (2/178).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imam an-Nawawi said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">“It is from the Sunnah not to look beyond the pointing of the finger.” (Sharh Sahih Muslim (6/81). </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">He further said while expanding on the issue of pointing with the finger,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The fifth: Not to move your sight beyond the pointing of the finger, al-Bayhaqi and others used the hadith of Abdullah b. az-Zubayr as evidence that the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam placed his right hand (on his right knee) and pointed with his finger and his sight did not go beyond it. And Abu Dawud transmitted it with an authentic chain and Allah knows best.” (al-Majmu’ Sharh al-Muhazzab (3/302).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Hafiz Ibn Rajab said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">“Our Companions said it is recommended when a person sits for tashahhud not to look beyond the pointing of the finger.” (Ibn Rajab, Fath ul-Bari (6/369).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Shaykh Abdul Aziz b. Baz said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">“The Sunnah when sitting (in prayer) is to look at the pointing of the finger when sitting for tashahhud or between the two sujud.” (Ibn Baz, Majmu’ Fatawa (29/241).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Shaykh Muhammad b. Salih al-Uthaymin said something similar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">While some madhhabs advocate looking at ones lap or the area between the thighs!!! And according to another opinion, to generally look at the lap and only at the index finger when indicating with it. The Sunnah and hadith of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam takes precedence over all other opinions.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>[This is a slight elaboration on the hypothetical situation whether a muqallid should look for daleel. In this brief reply we produce evidence to show the methodology of the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was to give more information and knowledge to a questioner.]</em></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>باب مَنْ أَجَابَ السَّائِلَ بِأَكْثَرَ مِمَّا سَأَلَه (53)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Chapter: Whosoever Answered a Questioner More Than What was Asked</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Explanation of the chapter</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">This chapter is concerning the etiquette of answering a question. The need for this chapter arose due to a principle which some jurists mention, that a mufti should answer a question according to the questioners enquiry only (i.e. limit information). So, Imam al-Bukhari wanted to clarify it was not the intended meaning used by some jurists and that additional knowledge or information cannot be given to a questioner. Giving additional knowledge or information is from the generousity of knowledge and is a praiseworthy act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">حَدَّثَنَا آدَمُ، قَالَ حَدَّثَنَا ابْنُ أَبِي ذِئْبٍ، عَنْ نَافِعٍ، عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم‏.‏ وَعَنِ الزُّهْرِيِّ، عَنْ سَالِمٍ، عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَنَّ رَجُلاً سَأَلَهُ مَا يَلْبَسُ الْمُحْرِمُ فَقَالَ لاَ يَلْبَسِ الْقَمِيصَ وَلاَ الْعِمَامَةَ وَلاَ السَّرَاوِيلَ وَلاَ الْبُرْنُسَ وَلاَ ثَوْبًا مَسَّهُ الْوَرْسُ أَوِ الزَّعْفَرَانُ، فَإِنْ لَمْ يَجِدِ النَّعْلَيْنِ فَلْيَلْبَسِ الْخُفَّيْنِ وَلْيَقْطَعْهُمَا حَتَّى يَكُونَا تَحْتَ الْكَعْبَيْنِ</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>[with 2 chains] “A man asked the Prophet </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>, &#8220;What kind of clothes should a Muhrim (someone making Umrah or Hajj) wear? He replied, &#8220;He should not wear a shirt, a turban, trousers, a head covering garment or any material coloured with Saffron or Wars (types of colours and fragrance). And if he has no slippers, he can use Khuffs (leather socks) but they should be cut to be below the ankles.&#8221;</strong> (Sahih al-Bukhari no.134).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Narrators in the Chain</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Adam:</strong> He is Adam b. Abi Ayyas al-Asqalani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Ibn Abi Dhi’b:</strong> He is Muhammad b. Abdur Rahman al-Mughirah b. Harith b. Abi Dhi’b and Abu Dhi’b is Hisham b. Shu’bah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Az-Zuhri:</strong> He is Muhammad b. Muslim ibn Shihab az-Zuhri</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Salim:</strong> He is the son of Abdullah b. Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Linguistic Clarification</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Al-Burnus:</strong> Is a type of coat or garment which has a hat sewn onto it. Generally speaking the people of Morocco and Algeria wear such garments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Al-Warsu:</strong> Is a type of plant that has a fragrance which is used to colour garments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Benefits of the Hadith</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">This hadith conveys the manner in which the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam answered questions, in how his answers were complete and sufficient. The questioner asked what should a Muhrim wear but he Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam in his answer mentioned what he should not wear. Indicating, anything besides these things were permissible since this list could be extensive. This is just like a patient asking a Doctor what he could eat and the Doctor replies by saying abstain from such and such thing but you can eat everything else.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The conclusive element of this hadith is the questioner asked about affairs he had a choice over, meaning what he could wear or not wear based on his options or choice. However, the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam further explained other important matters. This was additional knowledge given to the questioner. Once a group of people asked about making Wudu with sea water and the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">“Its water is clean (i.e. pure to make Wudu from) and its dead animals are lawful to consume.”<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Whereas the question was just concerning Wudu but the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam answered with additional knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The wearing of the Khuffayn is for the one who does not have shoes or slippers. This position further refutes and answers the people who say the top of the feet should be open whilst in a state of Ihram, this is because leather socks cover the feet completely, therefore their statement has no basis.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>NOTES</strong>   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Sunan Abi Dawud – Kitab at-Taharah – Bab al-Wudu Bima al-Bahr (no. 83), Jam’i at-Tirmidhi Abwab at-Taharah – Bab Ma Ja’a Fi Ma’a al-Bahr Innahu Tahur (no. 69) Shaykh al-Abani authenticated it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu and Imam al-Bukhari are undoubtedly the <strong>Imams of Ahlul Hadith</strong> who set Sunni standards in hadith preservation and dissemination.&#8221;Use-the- search-function&#8221; orientalists, flopped academics and misguided hadith rejectors reword and rework theories attempting to question the veracity of hadith authority.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Here is a documented incident from the hadith master Imam al-Bukhari himself on the <strong>phenomenal hadith preservation and memory</strong> of Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imam al-Bukhari through his own chain of transmission mentions in his work on <em><strong>al-Kunna</strong> </em>under entry <em><strong>no.287</strong></em></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Abu az-Za&#8217;za&#8217;h &#8211; the secretarial scribe of Marwan (b. Al-Hakam) said, &#8220;Once Marwan summoned Abu Hurayrah while I sat behind a screen. Marwan asked him [to narrate hadith] and I began writing everything to the extent that I wrote a lot of hadith. After a year had passed Marwan summoned Abu Hurayrah again while I sat behind a screen. Marwan asked him [to narrate hadith] again. I looked at what I had written (the previous year) and not a single thing was added or missed (from what he transmitted the previous year) (<em><strong>al-Bukhari, al-Kunna in Tarikh al-Kabir</strong></em> (11/105)</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">This is why the feats and legacy of Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu and Imam al-Bukhari will continue for centuries while others continue to lament.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We generally neglect two postures of the prayer, the standing after ruku and the period between the two sujud or prostrations. We tend to stand after ruku and immediately go into sujud or we make the two sujud without any duration between them. The Sunnah teaches us 4 prayer positions should be of equal duration generally,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">(1) The Ruku</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">(2) The standing after the Ruku</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">(3) The Sajdah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">(4) The period between the two Sujud</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This is evidenced from 6 separate hadith of al-Bara b. A’zib RadhiAllahu Anhu in the 6 canonical books of hadith. Imam al-Bukhari brings the following hadith with 3 separate chains of transmission in his Sahih under 3 different chapter headings, therefore indicating his juristic views related to the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">al-Bara b. Azib RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates, </span><span style="color: #000080;">“The bowing, the prostration the sitting in between the two prostrations and the standing after the bowing of the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam but not qiyam (standing in the prayer) and qu’ud (sitting in the prayer) used to be approximately equal (in duration).” (al-Bukhari no.792)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">In a shorter worded hadith al-Bara RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates, “The bowing, the prostrations, the period of standing after bowing and the interval between the two prostrations of the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam used to be equal in duration”. (al-Bukhari no.801)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">See also (al-Bukhari no.820)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The hadith al-Bara RadhiAllahu Anhu in (Abu Dawud no.852) does not mentioning the standing after ruku.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam an-Nasa’i was another formidable Muhaddith and hadith specialist who exerted great effort in codifying jurisprudence through his chapter headings in his Sunan. He established the following chapter heading, <strong>“The duration of the standing between rising up from bowing to prostrating”</strong>. We can see Imam an-Nasa’i was very meticulous in wanting to explain the specific period of the standing after ruku until one prostrates.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">al-Bara b, Azib narrates, “The bowing of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, and when he raised his head from bowing, and his prostration, and the time between the two prostration, were almost equal in length”. (an-Nasa’i no.1065)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam an-Nasa’i then established the following chapter after almost 100 hadith later, <strong>“How long one should sit between the two prostrations” </strong>and then bought the following hadith,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">al-Bara RadhiAllahu Anhu said, &#8220;In the prayer of Allah’s Messenger Sallalalhu Alayhi Wasallam, his bowing, his prostration, the standing after he raised his head from bowing and (sitting) between the two prostrations, were almost the same.&#8221; (an-Nasa’i no.1148)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The various Azkar we should recite during these postures and positions of Salah are mentioned in books authored on the prayer, for example books authored by, Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il as-Salafi, Shaikh al-Albani, Shaikh Ibn Baz, Shaikh Ibn Uthaymin, Shaikh Muqbil and Shaikh Zubair Ali Za’i, so kindly refer to them.</span></p>
