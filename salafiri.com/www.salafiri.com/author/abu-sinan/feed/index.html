				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">The author replies to these doubts with a general answer, and he gives an example of a doubt with the Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;There will certainly be no fear for the close servants of Allah, nor will they grieve.&#8221;<br />
</strong></em>[Surah Yunus, 10:62]
<p style="text-align: justify">and that the Shafa&#8217;ah (Intercession) is true, and that the Prophets have a high rank with Allah.¹ The author then answers every doubt with a specific answer, or two answers, or more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The First Doubt:</strong> That those that affirm Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah, believing that only Allah creates, provides sustenance, and controls affairs, also assert that Muhammad ﷺ, as well as &#8216;Abdul-Qadir [Al-Jilani] and other than him, do not have the capacity to cause harm nor confer benefit, and they only intend intercession from the righteous due to their esteemed status, so they are not Mushrikin (polytheists).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The Messenger of Allah ﷺ fought those [Mushrikin of Quraysh] that affirmed what was mentioned [i.e., Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah], and they intended what you intend [i.e., seeking intercession through their idols].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Second Doubt:</strong> That the Ayat were revealed regarding those that worship idols and the likes thereof, and we do not worship the idols.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer</strong><strong>:</strong> From amongst the disbelievers are those who worship idols, worship saints, invoke &#8216;Isa bin Maryam and his mother (peace be upon them both), and worship the angels. There is no difference between these objects of worship², all such practise constitutes Shirk (polytheism), and everyone that worships them are Mushrikin. Allah has denounced those that worship idols to be disbelievers, and similarly He denounced those that worship the righteous and angels to be disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Third Doubt:</strong> Seeking intercession from them is not polytheism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> This is the exact statement of the disbelievers, when they said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;&#8230;&#8217;We worship them only so they may bring us closer to Allah&#8217;&#8230;&#8221;</strong></em><br />
[Surah Az-Zumar, 39:3]
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">They did not intend anything except seeking intercession from the Rabb Al-&#8216;Alamin, and verily He denounced them as disbelievers due to that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fourth Doubt:</strong> Their denial of worshipping the righteous whilst simultaneously invoking them and slaughtering for them, despite affirming that these are acts of worship, and these acts align with the practises of the earlier Mushrikin. Whether they refuse to recognise that these are acts of worship, or are unaware of the fact, the Ayat and Ahadith elucidate the truth of the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fifth Doubt:</strong> That whoever rejects [the polytheistic manner of] seeking intercession from the Messenger and the righteous effectively rejects the Intercession of the Messenger and is a disparager of the righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The matter is the opposite, for verily intercession belongs to Allah, and does not occur except after His permission, and Allah does not give permission except to the People of Tawhid. Seeking intercession from other than Allah constitutes Shirk, and this is the underlying reason behind its prohibition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Sixth Doubt: </strong>That the Prophet ﷺ is given intercession, thus it is sought from him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> This intercession was given to him in a restricted manner (Muqayyid), not unrestricted (Mutlaq). Furthermore, his intercession is for the sinners, not for the Mushrikin. Additionally, intercession was granted to other than the Messenger, and it does not indicate that he can give it to whoever asks for it, nor to those who seek it from him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Seventh Doubt: </strong>Seeking refuge with the righteous is not considered polytheism, thus he is not a polytheist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer by Challenge: </strong>He is asked, &#8216;what is Ash-Shirk?&#8217; and, &#8216;what is &#8216;Ibadah of Allah?&#8217;, for verily he does not know what At-Tawhid is, nor what Ash-Shirk is, that which he has fallen into.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Eighth Doubt:</strong> His statement: Ash-Shirk is worshipping idols, and we do not worship idols.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>So it is said to him:</strong> Did they [i.e., the idol-worshippers] believe that the [idols] created and provided sustenance? If he replies: &#8216;The one that directs his worship to wood, stone, structures on graves, or other than these, invoking it and slaughtering for it says: It draws us nearer to Allah in rank, and Allah bestows upon us His blessings.&#8217; Then this explanation of idol-worship is correct, and it is exactly what you do, underlining Ash-Shirk is not specific to idol-worship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Ninth Doubt:</strong> Their statement: Verily they make Takfir of the Muslims, and they equate us to the earlier Mushrikin [of Quraysh], whilst we declare &#8216;La ilaha illAllah&#8217;, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and we affirm the Resurrection, and we pray and fast, and we perform Hajj and &#8216;Umrah, whilst they were the opposite &#8211; how can you make those that have these divisive characteristics like those who do not possess anything from them?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>So he responded to them with nine answers:</strong> He clarified that these characteristics have no effect on the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah, nor Ijma&#8217;, rather these characteristics are what makes their Kufr (disbelief) more severe! Whoever commits an act of Kufr, in affirming something from the Messenger [of Allah] whilst disbelieving in something else, or raising the creation to the level of the Creator, or exaggerating regarding one from the righteous until he claims divinity for him, or opposing the Shari&#8217;ah in some matters, such as Istihlal (declaring the permissibility) of the Nikkah of two sisters, or a branch from the branches of apostasy are found from him, or he mocks Allah or his Ayat, then he is an apostate &#8211; and it is not a condition in his apostasy to combine all types of apostasy, or combine all types of Shirk, or giving all the rights of the Rabb of the &#8216;Alamin to his object of worship. Verily apostasy is two types:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 60px">Unrestricted apostasy: To turn away from everything that the Messenger [of Allah] ﷺ came with.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 60px">Secondly: To disbelieve in some parts of what the Messenger [of Allah] came with.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Tenth Doubt: </strong>That whoever says, &#8216;La ilaha illAllah&#8217;, cannot be declared a Kafir nor killed, whatever he does, and they use some Ahadith as evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> These Ahadith are not evidence for what this person is claiming, in that the sole utterance of &#8216;La ilaha illAllah&#8217; is a preventative for Takfir, rather many people say it whilst they are disbelievers, either due to a lack of knowledge regarding its meaning, or a lack of action of what it necessitates, or the existence of that which nullifies it. An example of that is the Jews who used to say it, and the companions of Musaylimah whom the Sahabah [of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ] fought, likewise those that &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) burnt to death, so the statement of it [i.e., the Shahadah] by the tongue does not suffice in protecting ones blood and wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Eleventh Doubt:</strong> Their statement: That Al-Istigatha (seeking relief) by other than Allah is not Shirk, due to Al-Istigatha by the Prophets on the Day of Resurrection being permissible, and verily the author clarified their ignorance in not differentiating between the two different types of Al-Istigatha.<b>³</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Twelfth Doubt: </strong>Their justification that Al-Istigatha by the dead and absent is not Shirk, due to Jibril offering to help Ibrahim (Peace be upon them both).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> That verily this Al-Istigatha is one type, and that is another type, so whoever equates them has equated two different matters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In clarification that At-Tawhid must exist by the heart, tongue and actions of the limbs, and if one of these are missing, then a man is not a Muslim, and we ask Allah to make these actions sincerely for His Dignified Countenance, verily He is All-Hearing, The Most Near, The One who responds to supplications, and may His Praise be upon Muhammad, his family and his companions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">The one that curses the Sahabah is categorised as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The first category: If he curses all of them or accuses the majority of them of disbelief and apostasy, except for a small group¹, then this indeed constitutes an act of disbelief due to him rejecting the testimony of Allah (Mighty and Majestic) as expressed in His Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>&#8220;Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you ˹O Prophet˺ under the tree.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Fath, 48:18]</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And surely it has been established that those that pledged allegiance under the tree were numbered one thousand and four hundred, with some narrations mentioning them to be one thousand and five hundred.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The second category: As for those that curse some from amongst them, then this issue has details; If he curses some from amongst them due to a belief, i.e., perceiving that they had erred, that they were negligent, and that they were afflicted with whatever had befallen them, from the angle of belief (I&#8217;itiqad) &#8211; similar to the beliefs held by the Khawarij, then verily this is from the major sins, and it does not constitute an act that removes one from the Religion. If one curses some of them out of rage and hatred for them, then verily this is disbelief and apostasy. The People of Knowledge say, &#8216;Allah (Mighty and Majestic) has said in description of the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;&#8230;that He may enrage the disbelievers with them.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Fath, 48:29]</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hence, anyone who harbours rage in his heart for the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is characterised as being among those whom Allah (Mighty and Majestic) has identified as disbelievers.&#8217;²</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Regarding the Mothers of the Believers, then the ruling on cursing them is the [same] ruling on cursing the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them all). As for slandering the Mothers of the Believers, or one from amongst them, such as &#8216;A&#8217;isha (may Allah be pleased with her) or other than her, by claiming she was not chaste, then this constitutes an act of disbelief in Allah. Thus, whoever slanders a wife from the wives of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has disbelieved due to rejecting the statement of Allah (Mighty and Majestic) and what He has decreed for his Prophet ﷺ. However, this differs from the state of those that slandered [&#8216;A&#8217;isha (may Allah be pleased with her)] during the time of the Prophet ﷺ, as the Ayat vindicating her innocence were revealed after the famous incident of Al-Ifk. As for after the Ayat declaring her innocence were revealed, after the revelation of His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;Allah forbids you from ever doing something like this again, if you are ˹true˺ believers.&#8221;<br />
[An-Nur, 24:17]</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Then He made that a condition of Al-Iman, so whoever slanders a wife from the wives of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ after that has surely disbelieved by that, as the People of Knowledge have established.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>[Sharh Lum&#8217;atu&#8217;l-I&#8217;tiqad of Shaykh Salih Aal Ash-Shaykh, may Allah preserve him,<br />
</em><em>p. 145-146]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> The Rafidhi Iranian scholar, &#8216;Ali An-Namazi Ash-Shahrudi, said, &#8220;The sixth benefit: The large number of narrations necessitate the apostasy [of the Sahabah] other than three or four after the Prophet ﷺ, <strong>and it is the &#8216;asl [i.e., default ruling] for every Sahabi that remained after the Prophet ﷺ </strong>and did not die as a martyr during his time ﷺ, due to giving precedence to [Abu Bakr] in the matter of leadership over [&#8216;Ali].&#8221; <a href="https://ar.lib.eshia.ir/12156/1/67">[Mustadrakat &#8216;Ilm Ar-Rijal Al-Hadith, p. 67]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:]</strong> Al-Baghawi in Tafsir of this Ayah narrated, <strong>&#8220;Malik bin Anas said, &#8216;Whoever wakes up with hatred in his heart towards the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, then this Ayah surely applies to him.&#8221; </strong>[Tafsir Al-Baghawi, under 48:29]

<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a name="_Toc124860486"></a><span style="color: #000080">[The Contradictions of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani]</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">After a series of Mutawatir (mass-transmitted) authentic evidences, it is vital to mention that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani laid down the following important principle as written in his own words, <strong>“And Al-Qasam [(an oath, i.e., ‘by Allah!’)] indicates that the narration is taken upon its apparent meaning without interpretation, without exception – and if this was not the case, then what benefit was there in mentioning the oath? So, ponder upon this as those that inspect and research do.”</strong> <em>(Hamamatul Bushra p. 51, Ruhani Khaza’in 7/196)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<p style="text-align: justify">It is now known from this Mirza’i principle that if an oath is present in a prophecy, then it is taken upon the apparent (i.e., literal) meaning, and [figuratively] interpreting the narration or making an exception is incorrect – keeping this in mind, two Ahadith are presented:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The first: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! Surely the Son of Maryam (‘Isa) is about to descend amongst you as a just ruler, then he will break the Cross, kill the pigs, and abolish the Jizyah &#8211; and money will overflow until there is no one to accept it [as charity] …” </strong><em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #2222, Sahih Muslim #155, Sunan At-Tirmidhi #2233 and he [Abu ‘Isa At-Tirmidhi] said: ‘This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith’, Tahqiqi Maqalat 1/100-101)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The second: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“By Allah! [‘Isa] bin Maryam will descend as a just ruler! …” </strong><em>(Sahih Muslim #155, Tahqiqi Maqalat 1/105-106)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is not explicitly clear in even a single Sahih or Hasan li-Dhatihi Hadith that ‘Isa bin Maryam (Peace be upon them) will not descend from the Heavens, let alone that he will be born in the Ummah! If any Qadiyani has any such Hadith, then let them present it or let them clearly and honestly repent from disbelief and apostasy and adopt the authentic creed of the Muslims.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center">وَمَا عَلَيْنَآ اِلَّا الْبَلٰغُ الْمُبِيْنُ</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“And our duty is only to convey [the Message] clearly.”<br />
</strong><em>(Surah Ya-Sin, 36:17)</em></p>
<p>21<sup>st</sup> of April 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>(Translated from Mas&#8217;ala Khatam An-Nabuwwat, p.60-61)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><a style="color: #000080" name="_Toc124860484"></a>[The Descent of ‘Isa bin Maryam (Peace be upon him)]¹</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">After the Mutawatir Ahadith and the consensus of the Ummah on the Finality of Prophethood, it is said that Sayyiduna ‘Isa (Peace be upon him) will descend from the Heavens to the Earth and will kill the Dajjal before the Day of Resurrection, as is proven by the Sahih Ahadith.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that Abu’l Qasim (the Messenger of Allah ﷺ) said [as part of a lengthier narration], <strong>“Then ‘Isa bin Maryam </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong> will descend from the Heavens…” </strong><em>(Al-Bahr Az-Zakhar 17/96 #9642 and his wording after has </em><em>فيؤم الناس</em><em>, Kashf Al-Astar ‘An Zawa’id Al-Bazzar 4/142-143 and his wording after has </em><em>فيقوم الناس</em><em>, Majma’ Az-Zawa’id 7/349, the chain of narration is authentic – refer to my book ‘Tahqiqi Maqalat 1/111,112)</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">The wording of the Hadith فيقوم الناس means that the people will stand up for prayer, the meaning of فيؤم الناس is that after the day that Sayyiduna ‘Isa (Peace be upon him) descends, he will lead all the remaining prayers – due to this, there is no contradiction between these Ahadith.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>Sayyiduna Nawas bin Sam’an (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said [as part of a lengthier narration], <strong>“Then, Allah (Exalted is He) will send Al-Masih bin Maryam, and he will descend at a white minaret in the East of Damascus wrapped in two garments, both hands placed on the wings of two angels…” </strong><em>(Sahih Muslim #2937, Tahqiqi Maqalat 1/117)</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">This Hadith is explicitly clear in that Sayyiduna ‘Isa (Peace be upon him) will be brought down by two angels while he has both hands on their wings.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>On the Night of Mi’raj, the Prophet ﷺ met Sayyiduna ‘Isa (Peace be upon him), who said to him [as part of a lengthier narration], <strong>“I have been enjoined [with some tasks] before The Hour. So as for The Hour, then nobody has knowledge of it except for Allah.” </strong>Then he mentioned the coming of the Dajjal and said, <strong>“So I shall descend and then kill him…” </strong><em>(Sunan Ibn Majah #4081 and its chain is Sahih, Tahqiqi Maqalat 1/121-122)</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">This Hadith is explicitly clear that the [same] Prophet that was sent to Bani Isra’il, Sayyiduna ‘Isa bin Maryam (Peace be upon him), will descend from the Heavens and kill the Dajjal.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>Allah (Exalted is He) says in the Noble Qur’an:</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: center">وَإِنْ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ إِلَّا لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“And verily there is none from the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) except that they will surely believe in him (‘Isa bin Maryam) before his death.”</strong><br />
<em>(Surah An-Nisa’, 4:159)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said in explanation of this Ayah, <strong>“[Meaning] the death of ‘Isa.” </strong><em>(Tarikh Dimashq of Ibn ‘Asakir 47/513 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The famous Faqih and Mujtahid, Amir Al-Mu’minin in Ahadith, the Sahabi of great status, Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) also used this Ayah as evidence for the descent of ‘Isa bin Maryam (may Allah be pleased with him). <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3668, Sahih Muslim #155, Darussalam Edn. #390)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The famous trustworthy Tabi’i, Imam Hasan Al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him), said in explanation of this Ayah, <strong>“[Meaning] before the death of ‘Isa, and by Allah! Verily he is alive right now with Allah (in the Heavens), but when he descends, all of [Ahlul-Kitab] will believe in him.” </strong><em>(Tafsir Ibn Jarir At-Tabari 4/254 #10822 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center">وَإِنَّهُۥ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“And verily he (‘Isa) will be a known sign for The Hour…”</strong><br />
<em>(Surah Az-Zukhruf, 43:61)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said in explanation of this Ayah, <strong>“[Meaning] the coming of ‘Isa before the Day of Resurrection.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Ibn Hibban Al-Ihsan #6778 and its chain is Sahih, see Tahqiqi Maqalat 1/86)</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center">إِنِّى مُتَوَفِّيكَ</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“…Verily I will take you…”<br />
</strong><em>(Surah Ali ‘Imran, 3:55)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Hasan Al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said in explanation of this Ayah, <strong>“[Meaning:] I will take you from the Earth.”</strong> <em>(Tafsir At-Tabari 3/244 #7128 and its chain is Sahih, Tafsir ‘Abdur-Razzaq 1/129 #407)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The truthful Tabi’ Tabi’i, Matar bin Tahman Al-Warraq, who is considered truthful according to the majority [of scholars of Hadith] and is Hasan Al-Ahadith said, <strong>“[Meaning]: I will raise you from the world without death.” </strong><em>(Tafsir At-Tabari 3/243-244 #7128 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a name="_Toc124860485"></a><span style="color: #000080">[Consensus on The Descent of ‘Isa bin Maryam (Peace be upon him)]</span>³</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">There is not a single person known to oppose [this belief] from the best of generations (the Companions, their successors, and their successors), thus there is Ijma’ (consensus) on the fact that Sayyiduna ‘Isa bin Maryam An-Nasiri (Peace be upon him) is alive in the heavens and will descend before the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The famous Mufassir (exegete) Abu Hayyan Muhammad bin Yusuf Al-Andalusi (d. 745H, may Allah have mercy on him) said, <strong>“And the Ummah have agreed upon what is included in the Mutawatir Al-Hadith that ‘Isa is in the Heavens and that verily he shall descend in the final duration [before the Day of Resurrection].”</strong> <em>(Tafsir Al-Bahr Al-Muhit 2/497)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Abu’l Hasan Al-Ash’ari (d. 329H), the one who turned to the truth towards the end of his life, said, <strong>“And the Ummah have agreed upon that Allah, Mighty and Majestic, surely raised ‘Isa to the Heavens.” </strong><em>(His famous book ‘Al-Ibanah ‘An Usul Ad-Diyanah’, p. 34)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">One should remember that it is established from the Mustadarak of Al-Hakim (1/116)<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> and other than it from the Sahih Ahadith that the Ijma’ (Consensus) of the Ummah is a Shari’ proof and evidence – rather, Imam Ash-Shafi’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said, <strong>“The Asl (foundation) is the Qur’an and Sunnah, and if [there is no explicit text from either] then Qiyas (analogy) is done based on the two. When the Hadith is continuous (i.e., the chain of narration is connected) from the Messenger of Allah </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong> and its chain of narration is authentic then it is a Sunnah, and Ijma (consensus) is greater than a singular narration, and the Hadith is [taken] upon the apparent [meaning], and if it carries two meanings then the one closer to the apparent meaning is given precedence, and if two Hadiths counterbalance each other, then the one with the more authentic chain of narration is given precedence.”</strong> <em>(Adab Ash-Shafi’i wa Manaqibih of Ibn Abi Hatim p. 177-178 and its chain of narration is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Regarding his statement about Consensus, Imam Shafi’i meant that a singular narration may be prone to a faulty interpretation. However, Consensus [of the Ummah] cannot have a faulty interpretation, thus Consensus is clearer than a singular narration.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><em>(Mas&#8217;ala Khatam An-Nabuwwat, p.56-60)</em></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> [TN:] The following chapter headings are not found in the original work of the Shaykh, I (Abu Sinan) added them for clarity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> [TN:] The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! Surely the Son of Maryam (‘Isa) is about to descend amongst you as a just ruler, then he will break the Cross, kill the pigs, and abolish the Jizyah &#8211; and money will overflow until there is no one to accept it [as charity], and at that point a single prostration [for Allah] will be greater than the world and whatever is in it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said after narrating this Hadith, <strong>“And recite, if you wish: ‘And verily there is none of the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) except that they will surely believe in him (‘Isa bin Maryam) before his death.’” </strong><em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3448)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> [TN:] Many of the Imams of the Religion mentioned this belief in their books of I’tiqad (creed), for example:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>Imam ‘Ali bin Al-Madini (d. 231H) narrated regarding that which is obligatory to believe in, <strong>“Belief in that The False Messiah, Ad-Dajjal, has ‘Kafir’ written between his two eyes, and in the Ahadith that have come regarding that, [and] belief that that will occur, and that ‘Isa bin Maryam will descend and kill him at the Gate of Lud.” </strong><em>(As transmitted by Imam Al-Lalaka’i in his chapter: ‘I’tiqad of Ali bin Al-Madini and that which he transmitted regarding it from a Jama’ah of the Salaf’, 1/260-262 #290/10, Dar Al-Lu’lua Edn.)</em></li>
<li>Imam Ahmad said, <strong>“The foundations of the Sunnah with us are holding onto what the Companions of the Messenger of Allah were upon…” </strong>until his saying: <strong>“…and belief that Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will come out, and written between his two eyes is ‘Kafir (Disbeliever’, and [belief in] the Ahadith that have come regarding that, and belief that that will all occur, and that ‘Isa bin Maryam (Peace be upon him) will descend then kill him.” </strong><em>(As transmitted by Imam Al-Lalaka’I in his chapter: ‘I’tiqad of Al-Imam Abi ‘Abdillah Ahmad bin Hanbal’, 1/252-259 #289/18, Dar Al-Lu’lua Edn.)</em></li>
<li>Imam Ibn Battah Al-‘Ukbari said in explanation of the Sunnah, <strong>“Belief in that ‘Isa bin Maryam (Peace be upon him) will descend from the Heavens to the Earth, then he will break the cross and kill the swine…” </strong><em>(Ash-Sharh w’al-Ibanah 2/57)</em></li>
<li>Imam Ibn Abi Zayd Al-Qayrawani said, <strong>“Section: In clarification of what the Ummah has gathered upon…”</strong> until his saying: <strong>“and belief in what has been narrated regarding the Night Journey of the Prophet </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong> to the Heavens […] and in what is established from the coming out of the Dajjal and the descent of ‘Isa bin Maryam (Peace be upon him)…” </strong><em>(As transmitted by Ibn Al-Qayyim in Ijtima’ Al-Juyush p. 215-220, Dar Ibn Hazm Edn.)</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> [TN:] The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“Allah shall never gather my Nation together upon misguidance, and the Hand of Allah is above the Jama’at.”</strong> <em>(Al-Mustadarak of Al-Hakim 1/116 #399, and Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i authenticated it in his article on Ijma’ – see Monthly Al-Hadith Hazro #91, p. 9-49)</em></p>
