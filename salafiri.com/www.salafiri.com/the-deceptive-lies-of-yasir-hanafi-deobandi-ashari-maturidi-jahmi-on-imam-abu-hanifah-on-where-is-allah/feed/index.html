		<description><![CDATA[Correction: Allah is not in space so, the point that the SALAFS NOT &#039;salads&#039; put Allah in a location or at a point is logically invalid*

One more things, the term everywhere cannot be infinite because an actual infinite cannot exist as Imaam al Ghassali argues in his book, The incohenrence of the philosophers. Hence, by saying Allah is everywhere, deobandies are putting Allah at a place not outside of space. This is a logical refutation which cannot be refuted by anyone. In sha Allah.]]></description>
