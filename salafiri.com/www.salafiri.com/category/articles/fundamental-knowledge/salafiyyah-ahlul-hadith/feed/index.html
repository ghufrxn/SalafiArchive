				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[Shaykh Ahmad Din Ghakrwi was a powerful scholar, orator, writer and debater. He sought ilm from equally great scholars. He was a prolific debater and is on record for defeating the Hanafis, Barelwis, Qadiyanis, Shi’a and Christians in debates when he started at the age of 20 (1920). He was born in 1900 and authored magnificent books in defence of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and refuting Christians and Hindus] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Taqlid leads to the formation of some islamically legislative deficiencies, some of them are the following,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 1<sup>st</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Taqlid is Shirk in risalah</strong> which is synonymous to shirk with Allah. Shah Waliullah Muhaddith Dehlawi said in <em>Aqd ul-Jid</em>,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Then emerged the fanatical followers of the four madhhabs who made taqlid of their respective Imams in a manner as if they were sent as Prophets to them (i.e. the fanatical muqallid followers).”<a style="color: #000080;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This is Shirk in risalah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 2<sup>nd</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The <strong>muqallidin distorted and altered texts of the Quran and Sunnah</strong>, as I mentioned previously. (The Shaykh cited the example of the Deobandi scholar Mawalana Mahmud al-Hasan forging and distorting words in the Quran and the Deobandi Hanafis altering and distorting words in ahadith).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 3<sup>rd</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Taqlid creates jealousy and hatred</strong> in humans just like the Hanafis went to <strong>extreme exaggeration</strong> in the virtues of their Imam. The marginal notes to <em>Sharh Nukhbatul Fikr</em> mentions the fanatical extreme to the extent they said in the virtue of Imam Abu Hanifah,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said he is the light of my Ummah.”</span><a style="color: #000080;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So, <strong>they openly slandered the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</strong> and they dishonoured their Imam. Furthermore, they fabricated and forged reports and incidences in the virtue of their Imam. Some of them are,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said all the Prophets have pride based on me and I have pride based on Abu Hanifah. <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/22)</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jurjani transmits if there was a scholar of the likes of Abu Hanifah in the Ummah of Musa and Isa they would not have been Jews or Christians (i.e. Abu Hanifah would have converted all of them to Islam). <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/22).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Imam Abu Hanifah saw Allah 100 (one hundred) times in his dream. <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/21). However, Fatawa Qadhi Khan in volume 4 in the chapter of Tasbih and Taslim mentions whoever says he saw Allah in a dream then he is the same as the one who worships idols! (cited from Haqiqah tul-Fiqh (1/133-134).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Our madhhab is upon the truth while the others are upon error. <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/818, 4/44).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thabit (the father of Abu Hanifah) took his son, Imam Abu Hanifah to Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu and asked him to supplicate for him. <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/26)  </span> </span> </span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Note:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It should be noted Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu was martyred in 40H and Abu Hanifah was born in 80H, meaning he went to him 40 years before his birth!</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Isa Alayhis Salam will judge and give rulings according to the Hanafi madhhab when he will descend and return.<span style="color: #000080;"> (Durr al-Mukhtar (1/24).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Imam stood on one leg and completed the Quran in one night while at the Ka’ba and a voice was heard saying to him, “You are forgiven, and whoever follows you is forgiven and all those upon your madhhab until the Day of Judgement.” <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/21).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Someone disrespected Imam Abu Hanifah in the presence of Imam Abdullah b. al-Mubarak and he replied in a roaring voice, “I am amazed at you, you are disrespecting the person who prayed the 5 daily prayers for 45 years with one wudhu and who would complete reciting the whole Quran during the night in 2 rak’ahs.”<span style="color: #000080;"> (Cited from Maqam Hazrat Imam Abu Hanifah (p.60) of Molvi Sarfraz Ahmad Deobandi Ghakarwi).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="9">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is more virtuous to seek the knowledge of fiqh than reciting Quran. (Durr al-Mukhtar (1/14).</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, they insulted and belittled Muhammad b. Idris ash-Shafi’i to such an extent that it created overwhelming hatred for the Imam. They wrote,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Allah’s Messenger Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam said, “There will be a man in my Ummah who will be more harmful to my Ummah than iblis and he will be called Muhammad b. Idris ash-Shafi’i.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This is <strong>extreme exaggeration</strong> and it opposes the Prophets Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam’s Sunnah. There is also no authentic chain from the Companions proving this (cited from <em>Hashiyyah Sharh Nukhbah</em>). [The text of <em>Sharh Nukhbah</em> also mentions the muqallidin would also forge ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Allah Allah, <strong>they were shameless in insulting Imam ash-Shafi’i.</strong> In truth, he was from the most trustworthy of people and he was lauded with the title of defender of hadith. I do not know what harsh response the Shafiyyah must have given regarding this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 4<sup>th</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Taqlid of individuals resembles the way of the Rawafidh.</strong> The Rawafidh went to extremes in the virtue of Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu (refer to al-Kafi) to such an extent that they raised his status more than Musa’s and Isa’s (Alayhimus Salam). <strong>This is clear disbelief</strong>. Raising the status of non-Prophet to more than the status of a Prophet is clear disbelief. <strong>The muqallidin are also like this</strong>, they do not see other Imams in a good light except their own as we have shown from the examples in the previous deficiency. The usual diatribe of openly showing respect for all Imams continues but in reality much time is exerted refuting them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 5<sup>th</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The muqallid cannot be metaphorically referred to as Ahlus Sunnah</strong> in terms of actions. Generally speaking, the muqallid will only accept matters which are part of the madhhab of his Imam, for example <strong>the Hanafis do not accept the authentic ahadith in the Sahihayn and the 4 canonical books of hadith</strong> because they oppose and contradict their madhhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Maliki’s, Shafi’is and Hanbali’s largely only recite Fatihah behind the Imam, raise their hands (Raf ul-Yadayn) and say Amin loudly because it is their Imam’s madhhab. If their respective Imams did not practise these matters, they would also not have accepted them like the Hanafis. <strong>These muqallidin do not practise these matters because they are the Sunnah of the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</strong>, but rather, they practise them because it is the view and position of their Imams. Therefore, the muqallidin have no right to call themselves Ahlus Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>We are amazed at Hanafis, who call themselves Ahlus Sunnah</strong> and are proud about it but in essence they have no right to call themselves Ahlus Sunnah, rather, they should call themselves Hanafis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Dear readers, these are just some brief deficiencies of taqlid which I have mentioned in brevity.     </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">(<em>Qudamat Ahlus-Sunnah wa’l Jama’ah Ya’ni Ahlul Hadith</em> (p.603-606) from <em>Majmu’a Rasa’il Mawlana Ahmad Din Ghakarwi</em>.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>by </strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Shamil in an article attempted to prove Shaykh Irshad al-Haq distorted the words of as-Samarqandi in his article <strong><em>Did as-Samarqandi say rafay yadain nullifies salah? (Irshad ul Haq Athari’s tahreef)</em></strong> on Hanafiyya wordpress and Darul Tahqiq copying them, published it on their site. I did not expect this level of presentation for this unwarranted allegation of tahrif, and even they know it’s not tahrif.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Shamil’s scathing allegation is that Shaykh Irshad distorted as-Samarqandi’s words and put words into his mouth while he in turn was quoting Imam Abu Hanifah! So, merely on account of this, Ahmad Shamil echoes this charge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9828 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-cov.jpeg?resize=386%2C636" alt="Nawazil cov" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-cov.jpeg?resize=182%2C300 182w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-cov.jpeg?w=698 698w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9830 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?resize=398%2C600" alt="Nawazil 49" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?resize=199%2C300 199w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?resize=768%2C1158 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?resize=679%2C1024 679w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?w=832 832w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You can clearly read Shaykh Irshad saying, “<em>Faqih Abu Layth as-Samarqandi has clearly written…” </em> because as-Samarqandi did write this in his book. Shaykh Irshad chose the words <em>“has clearly written”</em> opposed to <em>“he clearly said”.</em> So, Shaykh Irshad was very precise in what he was implying. However, the brother missed this point because he was too busy juggling the word <em>“Tahreef”</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9823 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/irshadul-haq-athari-1.jpg?resize=484%2C313" alt="irshadul-haq-athari 1" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/irshadul-haq-athari-1.jpg?resize=300%2C194 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/irshadul-haq-athari-1.jpg?resize=768%2C497 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/irshadul-haq-athari-1.jpg?w=900 900w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secondly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says, <em>“Also one must note that as-Samarqani quoted it saying </em>روى عن <em>which is </em><em>“</em><em>sighah al-tamreedh</em><em>”</em><em> and a way to point towards weakness of the narration.”</em> So, if as-Samarqandi alluded to its weakness it means he was in doubt of its attribution to Imam Abu Hanifah. However as-Samarqandi is the one who transmitted it to the world and the readers. So, If Shaykh Irshad al-Haq was also aware of this sighah, it would be natural for him to say “<em>Faqih Abu Layth as-Samarqandi has clearly written.” </em>So, is this your appreciation of Shaykh Irshad al-Haq for not attributing this statement to Imam Abu Hanifah and giving him the benefit of doubt?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9824 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fatawa-al-nawazil-asal.jpg?resize=536%2C220" alt="fatawa-al-nawazil asal" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fatawa-al-nawazil-asal.jpg?resize=300%2C123 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fatawa-al-nawazil-asal.jpg?resize=768%2C314 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fatawa-al-nawazil-asal.jpg?w=799 799w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says, <em>“In his work Irshad al Haqq Athari in asserting that scholars of the four established schools of Islamic fiqh have gone to extremes in issues of furoo’..” </em>Shaykh Irshad summarised as-Samarqandi’s speech and you clearly see this from the Urdu summary of the Arabic. Ahmad Shamil clearly knew this, this is clear like the day, yet he wanted to pass this off as a tahrif of the Shaykh. This is common when quoting lengthy passages as the point is to usually convey the intended meaning or comprehension. Surely as Muslims we should know better.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fourthly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is clearly a view which as-Samarqandi believed in. He first says, “Qalu” as in they say, meaning the elders and authorities of the Hanafi madhhab and that this is their view and by default also his. He mentions these scenarios and reasons in which the Hanafis can pray behind the Shafi’s. He then proceeds to mention raising the hands also nullifies the prayer, the only difference this time is that he mentions it through Makhul from Imam Abu Hanifah. So the question is, did as-Samarqandi hold this view? Yes, of course he did. What is the problem then when Shaykh Irshad said, “<em>Faqih Abu Layth as-Samarqandi has clearly written.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fifthly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says, <em>“What he has done here is to put into the mouth of a seasoned Hanafi jurist what he merely stated as a report from Imam Abu Hanifa through Makhul an-Nasafi.” </em>This is a very poor line or argument to begin with. It would make more sense to have said this was Imam Abu Hanifah’s view because he is “the most seasoned Hanafi jurist” and it would further support and strengthen Shaykhs Irshad’s view and the point he was trying to make. Why would he settle for a lesser point. Obviously this does not make sense.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sixthly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are not concerned with what other Hanafi scholars have had to say about his issue, as this is an internal matter for the Ahnaf to deal with. He said, <em>“Shaykh al-Lucknawi has mentioned the names of multiple renowned jurists who have not accepted that word.” </em>This is besides the point and what al-Lucknowi or others said. This is a matter for your house to resolve. In fact, al-Lucknowi offered a detailed discussion in <em>as-Si’ayah fi Kashf ma-fi Sharh al-Wiqayah</em> (2/150-151), (Deoband: Maktabah Shaykh ul-Hindh, Faisal Publications, 1427H).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He does refute this incident in his <em>al-Fawa’id al-Bahiyyah fee Tarajim al-Hanafiyyah</em> (1/401 under no. 244) (Riyadh/ Cairo: Dar Ibn al-Qayyim/Dar Ibn Affan, 1441/2020) and alludes to it elsewhere under Makhul’s entry in detail. (<em>al-Fawa’id al-Bahiyyah </em>(2/197 no.479).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And did the brother not read in <em>al-Fawa’id al-Bahiyyah fee Tarajim al-Hanafiyyah</em> how Amir Katib al-Itqani attributed this view to Imam Abu Hanifah from Makhul (1/194 no.90). So, it was your own scholars who continued to use this report for centuries even until Amir Katib’s time. So, a sharp exit through al-Lucknowi is not as honourable as you might want to think.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The contention was a Hanafi jurist and mufti held this view, the view of raising hands nullifies the salah and thus the salah of the Hanafi behind the Shafi&#8217; is null and void, this was the point. It would be pointless to even share books which Hanafi scholars wrote advocating raising hands in prayer. This is not the discussion brother.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To then conclude, Shaykh Athari summarised as-Samarqandi’s words and mentioned the issue of the prayer being invalid if the hands were raised. As-Samarqandi held this view himself as he mentions it with the discussion when a Hanafi can pray behind a Shafi&#8217; and that before him al-Makhul attributed this view to Imam Abu Hanifah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us take a moment here and ask, was it not as-Samarqandi’s work which mentioned the following while transmitting from Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There will light be after the Prophet and his kunyah will be Abu Hanifah and he will revive the religion of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam<em>.</em> Anas RadhiAllahu Anhu said Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, there will be a man at the end of times with the kunyah Abu Hanifah who will revive the religion of Allah and my sunnah… (<em>an-Nawazil </em>(p.378) (Hyderabad: Matba’a Shams al-Islamiyyah, 1355H/1936).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9831 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-p378.jpeg?resize=407%2C626" alt="Nawazil p378" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-p378.jpeg?resize=195%2C300 195w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-p378.jpeg?resize=665%2C1024 665w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-p378.jpeg?w=762 762w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whether this addition is not from the author or if someone else added it, it has remained in his book, read and seen since its publication, and this edition was published around 1936, i.e for almost 90 years. Is this not a distortion of the religion?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Honest and sincere advice would be to rectify your own house before accusing others of distortion!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Summarised and Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibban and Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>A general point: What is taqlid?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Ibn Abdul Barr and Imam Ibn al-Qayyim quote Abu Abdullah b. Khawaz Mandad saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8216;Taqlid in the shariah is to turn to the saying of someone without proof and this is impermissible in the shariah and Ittiba is to take the saying with proof. <em>(I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> Imam Ibn Qayyim (2/178) and <em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm</em> of Ibn Abdul Barr (2/118).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Hanafi madhhab jurists have explained taqlid to mean,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">To act upon the saying of someone without any evidence or proof. (<em>Fawatih ar- Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/400).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it can be seen that those who perform taqlid will not be able to differentiate between the saying which is upon the truth and that which is upon falsehood. It can generally be seen from the definition of taqlid that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">✓ Taqlid is not knowledge but it is ignorance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Ghazzali writes, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“taqlid is to accept the saying of someone without any proof or evidence and this is not the way to attain knowledge of that which is from the usul (fundamental principles of the religion or the furu (those matters which are secondary). (<em>al-Mustasfa</em> (2/385).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">And it is written in <em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/402) that, taqlid is not the way for attaining certain knowledge. So know that that thing (taqlid) which does not lead to attaining knowledge cannot be called wajib (obligatory). Taqlid stops an individual from looking at the Quran and hadith as a proof and evidence. Never mind this being obligatory this cannot even be tolerated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Despite this some of the Hanafi scholars wrote,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The dalil (proof) for a muqallid is the saying of the mujtahid scholar, not his own thought or his scholars&#8217;. (<em>Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (p.5).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Therefore for the one performing taqlid the Quran and sunnah are no longer the proof and evidence and he is forever free from them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Some misconceptions cleared</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">To accept the witness of someone is not taqlid. The highly accepted book of the Hanafi fiqh titled <em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/400) states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“For the general lay person to turn to the mufti (scholar who gives a verdict) and for the judge to turn to the acceptable witness is <strong>not taqlid</strong>.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it is clearly proven to accept a verdict of the scholar of hadith is <strong>not taqlid</strong>.<strong> It is not taqlid</strong> to accept narrations from <em>Sahih Bukhari</em>. Why? Because there is <em>ijma</em> (unanimous agreement) of the ummah that it is the most authentic book after the book of Allah. And it is known that to turn to ijma is not taqlid. &#8216;So to turn to ijma is to turn to proof (not taqlid). (<em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-</em>Thabut 2/400)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is <strong>not taqlid</strong> to take a saying which is based upon revelation is <strong>not taqlid</strong>. (<em>Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (1/290).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">According to the Hanafi&#8217;s it is <strong>not</strong> permissible to perform taqlid of a <strong>Tabi’i</strong> (those of the second generations and many were students of the Companions). And the famous Hanafi jurisprudence book <em>Talwih</em> reports,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8216;So as for these narrations (the tabi&#8217;in) then taqlid will not be made of them. For they were men and we are men. (<em>Talwih</em> (2/17).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Some evidences on the prohibition of taqlid from the Quran.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> &#8216;Say (O Muhammad) to your folk follow what has been revealed down unto you from your Rabb (the Quran and Sunnah), and follow not any Auliya (protectors and helpers) besides him&#8217;. (Al-A&#8217;raf: 3).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">All classical mufassirin (explainers of the holy Quran) explain <strong>“That which has been</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>revealed by your Rabb”</strong> in the above ayah to refer to the Quran and hadith. For example, <em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> (2/200), <em>al-Qurtubi</em> (7/161), <em>al-Khazin </em>(2/182), <em>an-Nasafi</em> (2/44), <em>Shawkani</em> (2/179), <em>al-Qasmi</em> (7/2610), <em>al-Maragi </em>(8/100). This shows that we are ordered to follow the Quran and hadith as they are revealed by Allah and to abandon following any other way or saying as there is no evidence for following this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “Say, &#8216;Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful”. (an-Naml: 64).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This shows that without evidence shall not be accepted. Know that a saying which has no evidence to support it from the Quran and hadith shall not be accepted no matter who the saying is from. This is sufficient to refute the performing of taqlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Know that if a saying or action could be accepted without proof from the Quran and hadith then Allah would not have ordered for the proof to be brought forth in this verse. Verily it was sufficient for Allah to have called the disbelievers as &#8216;liars&#8217; but in ordering for the showing of proof in this verse, Allah has indicated that no saying shall be accepted without evidence. The utterance of this verse from the prophet Muhammad is to show that the way of the Muslim is not to perform taqlid and blindly follow. Some may comment that this verse was revealed in relation to the disbelievers and does not apply to Muslims. Then note that even though the disbelievers had no proof of what they used to do despite this they were still asked to produce there proof. Then the Muslim who has proof for what he does should be more readily asked for proof and this is necessary. Furthermore, to provide evidences is the way of the Muslim and to follow without proof or performing taqlid is and was the custom of the disbeliever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “When those who were followed disown (declare themselves innocent of) those who followed them, and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them. And those who followed will say, &#8216;If only we had one more chance to return (to the worldly life), we would disown (declare ourselves innocent from them) as they have disowned (declared themselves innocent from us). Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regrets for them&#8217;. (al-Baqarah: 166-167).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The ittiba (to follow) which has been mentioned in this verse is not ittiba which has been ordered with the proof as has been mentioned in verse one above. Therefore the ittiba referred to here will be to follow without proof and this is taqlid. If someone says that the itiba referred to here is the worship which is done for other than Allah and not making taqlid of any Imam or scholar. Then this in itself is a great proof in the prohibition of taqlid as it will have to be conceded that to make ittiba or to follow other than Allah is to worship that person and this will be shirk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> &#8216;When it is said to them: &#8216;Follow do ittiba) what Allah has sent down&#8217;. They say, &#8216;Nay! We shall follow (do ittiba) what we found our fathers following&#8217;. (would they do that) even though their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided?&#8217;. (al-Baqarah: 170).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This verse invites people to follow with evidences whereas those who are astray perform ittiba or follow that for which there is no evidence or proof. This is why they follow there forefathers and elders even though they had no evidences and proofs for what they used to say. So how is it that those who were astray continued to follow there elders not knowing whether they were upon the truth or falsehood? The only way they could distinguish between the truth and falsehood and actually be certain they were following the truth was if they had followed with proof and evidence,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">If someone says that &#8216;this verse is admonition of those disbelievers who would blindly follow there disbelieving elders and forefathers and does not refer to blindly following pious people and Imams. Then the answer to this is that this is a proof against you. For if it is as you say then know that this verse shows that to follow without evidences was the way of the disbelievers whereas the way of the Muslims is to follow the prophet Muhammad with clear evidences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad), &#8220;This is my way: I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me”. (Yusuf:108).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It would have been sufficient to call the disbelievers liars in the beliefs they held. However to explain in more detail the reason for the deviancy of the disbelievers it is not being said &#8216;that you are astray because you followed your disbelieving forefathers&#8217; but what is rather being said is that the disbelievers followed those for whose guidance or being upon the truth they had no evidences and proofs. And this what taqlid is to follow without evidences and proofs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Some sayings of the Salaf as-Salihin about taqlid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">The Companion Abdullah Ibn Mas’ud said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Let no person perform taqlid of any other person.” (<em>Majma az-Zawa’id</em> and <em>Mizan al-Kubra</em> of Shirani (1/48).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">The Companion Mu’adh Ibn Jabal said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“So when a scholar is upon guidance do not perform taqlid of him in your religion.” (<em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> (2/174), of Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, Egyptian print).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">A similar narration has been narrated as above from the companion Salmaan. (<em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> (2/174), of Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, Egyptian print).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Amir al-Mu’minin Ali said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Be aware in taking from the ways of people.” (<em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm wa Fadlihi</em> (2/114) of Imam Ibn Abdul Barr).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is known that those who were being addressed with this advise were the companions and Tabi’in. This clearly shows that taqlid in the era of the companions was forbidden.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Amir bin Sharajil Sha’bi said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“What these people inform you of from the messenger of Allah (hadith) take it. And what they say from there opinions then throw it in the rubbish.” (<em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em> (1/37) and <em>al-Hujjatullah al-Balighah</em> of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (1/148).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Dear readers know that Imam Sha’bi was from the Kibar Tabi’n&#8217; (those from the second generation after the prophet). He met 500 companions of the messenger of Allah (<em>Tazkirrah al-Huffaz</em> of Imam Dhahabi (1/74). So if the saying of a man of this stature and position is not proof in itself then how can the saying or opinion of any other Tabi’in or those who followed them be blindly accepted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Abdullah bin al-Mu&#8217;tamir said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“There is no difference between that animal which is pulled (after being tied up) and that human which performs taqlid”. (<em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm wa Fadlihi </em>(2/113,) <em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in </em>(2/170).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Know that the animal which is tied and dragged behind it&#8217;s owner knows not if it is being taken to be fed grass, or to sell or to slaughter. Likewise the muqallid (blind follower) has no knowledge that the one who he is blindly following whether he is taking him towards the truth or falsehood! This is because he has no proof for what he is following and nor is the one who he is following infallible (but our prophet is infallible).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Abu Hanifah said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“It is not halal (permissible) for anyone to take my saying who does not know from where I have bought the evidences”. (<em>Muqaddimah Hidayah</em> (p.93).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The author who recorded this saying continues by commenting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“And our Imam has prohibited the performing of taqlid and has stressed the importance of knowing the dalil (proofs and evidences).” (<em>Muqaddimah Hidayah </em>(p.93).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is clear from the above saying of the Imam that at first he prohibits the performing of taqlid and then he stresses the importance of following with proof. So it can therefore be seen that to accept with evidences and proof is not taqlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Malik said:</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Verily I am a man and I err and at times am correct. So look at what I say and whatever is in accordance with the book (Quran) and sunnah take it and whatever opposes this then abandon it.” (<em>Jalb al-Manfa&#8217;a</em> p.68).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Imam has completely finished here the performing of taqlid. This is because he has ordered the asking for proof from the book and sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Shafi’ has clearly warned against taqlid. Therefore his student Imam Muzani said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Imam Shafi’ forbids the performing of taqlid of himself and others (scholars and Imams). And he gave the order that all should look for themselves (at the proofs) in the religion and should be careful.” (<em>Mukhtasar al-Muzani</em> (1/2) on the marginal notes of <em>Kitab al-Umm</em>).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It can be clearly seen Imam Sarakhsi that performing taqlid is not permissible and this was not the way of the Salaf.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“If there is a father of misguidance it is performing taqlid.” (<em>Ruh al-Ma&#8217;ni</em>).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>So did the Companions or those who came before them with their various shariah&#8217;s perform taqlid in any aspects of the religion? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. Shah Waliullah Dehlwee quotes in his book <em>Hujjatullah al-Balighah</em> (p.154) from Imam Ibn Hazm in his book <em>al- Ihkam</em> (1/760) that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“So to perform taqlid was haram (forbidden) in all of the shariah&#8217;s from the first of them to the last. Whether it was (performing taqlid) in Tawhid (aqidah), Prophethood, belief in pre-destination or all of the other aspects of worship and ahkam (rules and laws).”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Explanation of an ayah which is often quoted for performing taqlid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “Ask the people of knowledge if you do not Know.” (surah an-Nahl)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is claimed by some that when a layperson asks a scholar or seeks a verdict from him about something this is taqlid of the scholar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This is not the case because the layperson is within his rights to ask the scholar what the Quran and hadith say about a particular matter and not to ask him about his opinion. So after being told what the hadith states about a certain matter he will try to act upon it to his capability. This is not taqlid but it is the following of proof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">If just by &#8216;asking&#8217; someone one falls into taqlid then what does one say about the following verse wherein the prophet Muhammad was ordered to &#8216;ask&#8217; from the jews and Christians. Allah forbid! Will you now say that even Muhammad was performing taqlid or blindly following the Jews and Christians?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">What does to &#8216;ask&#8217; mean in this ayah? Does it mean ask the person of knowledge for his own opinion or what the Quran and hadith state? If it meant ask the scholar of his opinion then know that opinions vary. So the only reason a questioner asks is so that he can be led to certainty rather than more uncertainty and confusion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, the “people of knowledge” in this verse are those who are people of the Quran and hadith, not people of opinion. So this in itself refutes taqlid. Therefore, the muqallid and blind follower will ask about his Imam&#8217;s or scholars opinion. Whereas if he were to ask</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">for proof from the Quran and sunnah then he would no longer remain a muqallid. Also this verse orders to ask the person of knowledge if a person does not know and the following verse restricts the questioner not to follow other than that which is revealed, that is, the Quran and sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it is proven from this that one should not follow the scholar himself but should ask the scholar for proof and then follow that. We ask about the mentioning of the people of &#8216;knowledge&#8217; in this verse. Is &#8216;knowledge&#8217; anything other than the Quran and hadith?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is it obligatory to perform taqlid?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. The Hanafi scholar Adul Hayy Lucknowi writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Only that is obligatory which Allah has made so. And only he has authority to do this. Allah did not make it obligatory on anyone that he choose for himself a madhab (school of thought today such as Hanafi, Shafi’, Maliki, Hanbali and others) of an Imam. To think it obligatory to do this is to make a new religion which Allah has not legislated for.” (<em>Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em>).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Dhahabi states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Ahl us Sunnah do not make it obligatory upon anyone to follow for themselves only one specific Imam.” (<em>al-Muntaqa</em> (p.166).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is there any other person from whose tongue nothing will come except the truth, other than Muhammad?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. When the companion Abdullah bin Umar Ibn al-Aas RadhiAllahu Anhu was stopped by the Quraysh in writing the hadith (narrations) of the messenger of Allah because he (the messenger) was only a man also and at times he would be happy and at times in anger so not everything should be written down of his. Therefore, the companion Abdullah stopped writing all that was said from the tongue of the messenger. When the Prophet heard about this he pointed to his tongue and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Write! So I swear by Allah in whose hand is my soul that nothing comes from this (my tongue) except that it is the haqq (truth).” (<em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em> (1/68).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is it permissible to ascribe to a particular madhab, being known as Hanafi, Shafi’, Maliki or Hanbali?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. If it were permissible for a person to ascribe himself to a particular madhhab or person then the companions would have been the foremost to make there separate and distinct madhhabs with other companions as the leaders of the particular madhhab or group. But we see that despite the existence of great companions such as the four caliphs, Ibn Umar, Ibn Masud, Ibn Abbaas RadhiAllahu Anhum and others no particular madhhabs were formed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">In fact the companions refrained from ascribing themselves to any other companion or madhab. Therefore, the companion Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“I am not Alawi (a person who makes a particular madhab ascribing himself to the fourth caliph Ali as leader) nor am I Uthmani (a person who makes a particular madhab ascribing himself to the third caliph Uthmaan as leader), but <strong>I AM UPON THE &#8216;MILLAH&#8217; (NATION AND FOLLOWERS) OF MUHAMMAD<em>.”</em></strong> (<em>al-Ihkam</em> of Ibn Hazm (6/118).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it can be seen that the companions did not like to ascribe themselves to any other person except Muhammad. Also the four Imams Abu Hanifah, Shafi’, Maalik and Ahmad did not have their own separate &#8216;millah&#8217;s&#8217; therefore to ascribe oneself to them cannot be permissible also. If one was to say now that there are four separate &#8216;millah&#8217;s&#8217; (nations) then this would be a different matter altogether!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">O Allah guide us all upon truly following Muhammad. Amin.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated by</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You alleged the Ahlul Hadith and Salafis insult Imam Abu Hanifah. This is totally incorrect, our Madhab (the Madhab of Ahlul Hadith) does not permit using derogatory words for Imam Abu Hanifah. However, everyone has the right to critique Abu Hanifah&#8217;s ijtihad and raise objection against his Madhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Imam Malik said) Everyone’s statement can be accepted or rejected except the statement of Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. (Iqd ul-Jid (p.122), al-Insaf Fi Bayan Sabab al-Ikhtilaf (p.13), Muqaddimah Sifatus Salah (p.49)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8230;..</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Insults and abuse actually emanate for your house (ie the Hanafi Madhab) for example in your Madhab it is permissible to write the Quran with blood from a nosebleed, to write the Quran with urine, giving fiqh a greater status than the Quran, in fact giving women body parts an even greater status than both etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Durr al-Mukhtar Sharif mentions, the prayer behind an individual who swears at the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam is makruh tanzihi (prohibitively disliked) (Durr al-Mukhtar Ala Hamish ash-Shami (1/561)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To the extent that according to your fiqh such a person does not become a Kafir. (Durr al-Mukhtar (1/561)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You also believe if a person puts his feet on the Quran with the intention of desecrating it in a blasphemous manner, only then is he a Kafir otherwise he is not. (Fatawa Alamghiri (5/322)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is not placing his feet in the Quran blasphemous and desecrating it by default?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They further say, the one who accuses all the mothers of the believers of fornication except A&#8217;ishah RadhiAllahu Anha is not a Kafir and much more.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="center"><strong>Compiled &amp; Translated </strong></h5>
<h5 align="center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, no long introductions straight to the point. 6 scholars &#8211; 3 fathers and 3 sons who spent decades upon calling to Tawhid and Sunnah, teaching hadith, reprimanding Madhhabism and the associated bigoted taqlid. If anything take the benefit of nurturing your children on the pure pristine Salafi Manhaj and keep away from blind fanaticism of madhhabs and take evidence when it comes to you. Same people who fall prey to technical fiqhi buzz words and think they have a defence!</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[1] Shaikh al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Muhammad Sa&#8217;id Muhaddith Banarasi</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was born in a sikh household in 1274H and died in 1322H/1904CE. He was born as Mawl Singh in Gujrat and his father’s name was Karak Singh. He was a sikh and converted to Islam. He first sought knowledge in Deoband but later became Ahlul Hadith and eventually studied with major Salafi Ahlul Mashaykh like Shaykh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi who he studied hadith and tafsir with as well as Shaykh Abdullah Ghazipuri and Shaykh Muhammad Ibrahim Arawi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then went to the Banaras (Varanasi) the holiest city of the idol worshippers and set up Madrasah Sa&#8217;idiyyah in 1297H and taught for a few decades until he died. He also set up a printing press called Matba&#8217;a Sa&#8217;idiyyah and printed thousands of pages of amazing books that promoted the Madhhab of Ahlul Hadith and Salafis and refuted the bigoted Madhhabists</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From Sikhism to establishing a Salafi Madrasah built upon Tawhid and Sunnah in the holiest place of the idol worshiping Hindus and a phenomenal printing press.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaykh Abdur Rahman al-Faryawa&#8217;i said about him, <em>&#8220;He had numerous works and treatises most of which were fierce and vehement refutations of the muta’ssub Madhhabists and the bigoted staunch Muqallidin he also had a book on Fatawa in 2 parts.&#8221;</em> (al-Harakatus Salafiyyyah wa Dawriha Fi Ihya as-Sunnah (p.44)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He died in 1322H/1904CE. He had a son, who he nurtured on the Quran and Sunnah with care, affection and diligence and he was,</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[2] Shaikh al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Abul Qasim Muhammad Sayf Banarasi </strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was born in 1307H Banaras. He completed his Hifz of the Quran by the age of 7 and by the age of 16 he started teaching after having taken all the knowledge from his father, Shaykh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, Shaykh Abdul Mannan al-Wazirabadi, Shaykh Shams ul-Haq Azimabadi, Shaykh Hussain b. Muhsin Ansari.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He began teaching in his father&#8217;s Madrasah Sa&#8217;idiyyah where he taught Bukhari and Muslim 30 times (each) during his life. He spend his life defending and spreading hadith. When a Hanafi bigoted muqallid wrote a book called <em>&#8220;Jarh Alal Bukhari&#8221;</em> and 6-7 other books criticising and disparaging Sahih al-Bukhari and hadith in general. Shaykh Abul Qasim Sayf Banarasi answered and refuted all of them in overwhelming detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He defended and spread the Madhhab of Ahlul Hadith and Salafis through his numerous works. He was a prolific author and wrote books in Arabic and Urdu which number more than 65. Some of them include,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jam&#8217;a al-Quran wal-Hadith, Qadhiyatul Hadith Fi Hujjatul Hadith, Husul al-Maram, Kitab ar-Radd Ala Abi Hanifah &#8211; an rendering of the work of the Ahlul Hadith Muhaddith Imam Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Shaybah, Arba&#8217;in Muhammadi, Hidayatus Sa&#8217;il Ila Ahadith Wa&#8217;il, Naf&#8217;i al-Ahnaf, Hal Mushkilat Bukhari in 3 volumes also known as Kawthar al-Jari Fi Jawab al-Jarh Alal Bukhari, al-Amr al-Mubram Li-Ibtal Al-Kalam al-Muhkam, al-Siyar al-Hathith Fi Barah Ahlul Hadith, Ijtilab al-Manfa&#8217;a Liman Yatal&#8217;ih Ahwal Ai&#8217;matul Arb&#8217;a, 5 more books refuting the Hanafi muqallid who attacked Sahih al-Bukhari and many more. He died in 1369H/1949CE.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[3] Shaikh al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Abu Muhammad Abdul Haq al-Hashimi</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the formidable scholars of Ahlul Hadith who spent 70 years teaching over 2 continents calling to the Quran and Sunnah, refuting the bigotry of the La-Mutabbi Madhhabists and holding them at bay and their distorted call to taqlid. He was born in 1884/1302H and sought knowledge from many scholars, most of whom were upon the way of knowledge without Madhab fanaticism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He had over 60 teachers, some of them included, Shaykh Abdul Tawaab Qadirabadi, <strong>Shaykh Abu Abdullah Uthman al-Hussain Azimabadi</strong>, Shaykh Abul Hasan Muhammad bin Hussain Dehlawi, Shaykh Abul Wafa Thanullah Amritsari, Shaykh Abu Sa’id bin Abdur Rahim Batalwi, Shaykh Hussain bin Haydar Hashimi, Shaykh Abu Idris Abdul Tawwab bin Abdul Wahhab Secundarabadi, Shaykh Khalil bin Muhammad bin Hussain bin Muhsin al-Ansari, Shaykhana Sayyid Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He taught for almost 25 years in Saudi Arabia and 45 years in the subcontinent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shaykh said, <em>“My Aqidah is the Aqidah of the Salaf us-Saleh, the same Aqidah of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jam’ah, the Fuqaha and the Muhadithin. My Aqidah is to act on the Quran and Sunnah and to take the apparent ie Zahir meaning without ta’wil or tahrif and <strong>my madhhab is the madhhab of Ashabul Hadith in belief and actions</strong>.”</em> (Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.5)</p>
