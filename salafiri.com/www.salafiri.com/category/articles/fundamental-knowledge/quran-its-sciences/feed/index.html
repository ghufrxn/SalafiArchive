				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<h3><span style="color: #000080">Hadith No. 7443</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Yusuf bin Musa narrated to me: Abu Usamah narrated to me from Al-A&#8217;mash, from Khaythamah, from &#8216;Adiy bin Hatim who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;There is none amongst you except that his Rabb will speak to him, there will be no interpreter between them nor a veil to veil Him.&#8221; </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left">
<h3 style="text-align: left"><span style="color: #000080">Explanation of Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him)</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">And in this Hadith is a refutation of those that speak with &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217;¹, and its meaning is that Allah will introduce speech (yuhdithu al-qawl) in that Hour, He speaks to the one who is alone with him in that Hour, and those that speak with &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217; (i.e., the Asha&#8217;irah) say: &#8220;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi is eternal, however, Allah creates sounds when He wishes for someone to hear, and it is an expression from Al-Kalam An-Nafsi.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And on account of this, some of the intelligent said: The Madhab of the Asha&#8217;irah regarding the Speech [of Allah] is the Madhab of the Jahmiyyah, rather it is even worse! For verily they say that which is heard [in recitation] and that which is written in the Masahif is created, and it is [nothing more than] an expression from the [true] Speech of Allah, and as for the Speech of Allah then it is that which is in His Self, it is not heard and He does not speak when He wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the Jahmiyyah, then they said, &#8220;That which is heard is the Speech of Allah in reality, however it is created.&#8221; So who is closer to that which is correct? The Jahmiyyah, and this is the reason they said, &#8216;The speech of the Asha&#8217;irah regarding the Speech [of Allah] is worse than the speech of the Jahmiyyah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the reality of the matter, then there is no difference between them and the Jahmiyyah, for verily they are in agreement that what was heard by Muhammad ﷺ, and what was heard by Musa (Peace be upon him), and what will be heard in the future is all created. But the Asha&#8217;irah say that is an &#8216;Ibarah (Expression)² from Al-Kalam An-Nafsi, and these people say: &#8220;No! Rather it (the Speech of Allah) is a creation that He created, He created sounds which are heard, and He attributed them to His Self as a way of honouring and venerating.&#8221; &#8211; So this Hadith clearly refutes those that claim that the Speech of Allah is [just] the Meaning established eternally within His Self, and they have narrated that the Speech [of Allah] is like [His] Knowledge or [His] Will.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>(Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin, Sharh Kitab At-Tawhid min Sahih Al-Bukhari p. 437, 438,<br />
Dar Al-Kalim At-Tayyib, 1st Edn.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Translators Notes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>&#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi:&#8217; </strong>The Asha&#8217;irah reject that Allah has volitional actions (actions tied to His will), and this led to their belief in &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217;, the corrupt belief that Allah does not speak, rather the &#8216;Speech (Kalam)&#8217; is merely a single indivisible meaning which is established in His Essence &#8211; as for the Qur&#8217;an that we have with us which is written in the Mushaf and memorised by all Muslims, then it is <strong>created</strong> and merely an &#8216;Expression (&#8216;Ibarah)&#8217; of the Meaning which subsists within the Essence of Allah. Some went as far as claiming the Qur&#8217;an we have with us is the speech of Jibreel (Peace be upon him), rather than the Speech of Allah! Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;The Ash&#8217;ariyyah say: What is in the Mushaf is not the Speech of Allah, rather it is an &#8216;Ibarah (Expression) from Him [&#8230;] and these letters which are in the Qur&#8217;an, and the sounds which the Messenger heard, or Jibreel heard, verily it is created.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sharh Fath Al-Bariyyah bi-Talkhis Al-Hamawiyyah p. 314)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Madhab of Ahlus-Sunnah regarding the Speech of Allah: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu &#8216;Uthman As-Sabuni said, &#8220;And the Ahlul-Hadith testify and believe that the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah and His Book, and His Revelation, and that which He revealed is uncreated, and whoever speaks with its creation (i.e., that the Qur&#8217;an is created) and believes in it is a Kafir according to them.&#8221; <em>(Aqidatu&#8217;s Salaf wa Ashabu&#8217;l Hadith p. 165, Dar Al-&#8216;Asimah)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Muhammad bin Isma&#8217;il Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;I met more than 1000 men from the People of Knowledge: [From] the People of Hijaz, and Makkah, and Madinah, and Kufa, and Basrah, and Wasit, and Baghdad, and Sham (Levantine Region), and Misr (Egypt) [&#8230;] and I did not see one of them differ on these matters: [&#8230;] and that the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah, uncreated&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad of Imam Al-Lalaka&#8217;i 1/273-274, Dar Al-Lu&#8217;lua)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Abu Zur&#8217;ah and Abu Hatim Ar-Raziyayn said, &#8220;We reached the scholars of all the cities, in Hijaz, &#8216;Iraq, Sham, Yemen, and from their Madhab was: Al-&#8216;Iman is speech and action, it increases and it decreases, and the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah, uncreated from all aspects [&#8230;] and whoever claims that the Qur&#8217;an is created then he is a disbeliever in Allah Al-&#8216;Adhim, with a disbelief that removes him from the Religion, and whoever doubts his disbelief &#8211; from those that understand [this issue] &#8211; then he is [also] a disbeliever&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad of Imam Al-Lalaka&#8217;i 1/278-282, Dar Al-Lu&#8217;lua)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Ibn Battah narrated from Imam Ahmad who said, &#8220;And whoever says that verily Allah will not be seen in the Hereafter, then he is a Jahmi who has surely disbelieved&#8221; and &#8220;They will look at their Rabb, and He will look at them, and they will speak to Him, and He will speak to them, However He wills, Whenever He wills.&#8221; <em>(Al-Ibanah &#8216;an Shari&#8217;atu&#8217;l Firqatu&#8217;n Najiyah #47-48, Dar Al-Rayah)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Harb Al-Kirmani, companion of Imam Ahmad and Ishaq bin Rahuyah, transmitted consensus on this issue saying, &#8220;And the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah by which He speaks, uncreated, so whoever claims that the Qur&#8217;an is created then he is a Jahmi Kafir.&#8221; <em>(Ijma As-Salaf fi&#8217;l-I&#8217;tiqad p. 64, Dar Al-Imam Ahmad)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;Ahlus-Sunnah w&#8217;al-Jama&#8217;ah have agreed upon that Allah speaks, and His Speech is an Attribute in truth, established for Him in a manner which is befitting for Him. And He, Exalted is He, speaks with letters and sounds, however He wills, whenever He wills, and His Speech is an attribute of His Essence (Sifat Dhatiyyah) in terms of genus, and it is an attribute of action (Sifat Fi&#8217;liyyah) in terms of occurrences.&#8221;</strong> He commented on his own speech, explaining, &#8220;This is because it is connected to His Will, and every attribute connected to His Will is an attribute of action, and Speech in its essence is an attribute of the Essence, for verily Allah has not ceased and does not cease to be One that Speaks.&#8221; <em>(Sharh Fath Al-Bariyyah bi-Talkhis Al-Hamawiyyah p. 303, 304) </em></li>
</ol>
<p>² Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilani said, &#8220;So whoever claims that it (the Qur&#8217;an) is created, or an &#8216;Ibarah, or that the recitation is other than what is recited, or he says: &#8216;My articulation of the Qur&#8217;an is created&#8217;, then he is a disbeliever in Allah Almighty, he is not to be mingled with, or fed, or married, or neighboured&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Al-Ghunya li-Talibi 1/128, Dar Al-Kutub Al-&#8216;Ilmiyyah)</em></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from Fatawa &#8216;Ilmiyyah (1/493-497)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Question:</strong> The Tahqiq (research) regarding the following narration is desired: &#8220;The person that recites Surah Ya-Sin every morning will have all the needs of his day fulfilled.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Answer:</strong> This narration is present in the Sunan of Ad-Darimi <em>(2/457 #3421)</em> with the following chain of narration: <strong>&#8220;&#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah (Tabi&#8217;i) said: It has reached me that the Messenger of Allah </strong>ﷺ <strong>said&#8230;&#8221;<em> &#8211; </em></strong>and the author of Mishkat [Al-Masabih] <em>(#2177)</em> narrated it from Ad-Darimi. This narration is weak on account of it being Mursal¹, and the person that informed [&#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah] is unknown. The following Marfu&#8217;² narrations pertaining to the virtues of Surah Ya-Sin are also weak and rejected:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify">
<li style="text-align: left"><strong>&#8220;Verily everything has a heart, and the heart of the Qur&#8217;an is Ya-Sin, and whomsoever recites Ya-Sin, Allah will write for him [the reward of] the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an ten times.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Jami&#8217; At-Tirmidhi #2887 from the Hadith of Qatadah from Anas [may Allah be pleased with him], Tablighi Nisab p.292, Fadha&#8217;il Al-Qur&#8217;an p.58)</em></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam At-Tirmidhi said regarding one of the narrators [of this Hadith], <strong>&#8220;Harun Abu Muhammad is an unknown Shaykh.&#8221; </strong>Due to Harun being unknown, this narration is weak &#8211; Shaykh Al-Albani declared it to be Mawdu&#8217; (Fabricated). <em>(Silsilah Ahadith Ad-Da&#8217;ifa 1/202 #169)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu Hatim Ar-Razi claimed that the narrator of this Hadith [in reality] is Muqatil bin Sulayman, who is a liar <em>(&#8216;Ilal Al-Hadith 2/56 #1652).</em> Whereas in the Sunan of At-Tirmidhi, Sunan of Ad-Darimi (2/456 #3419), and Tarikh Baghdad (4/267), the narrator is Muqatil bin Hayyan, who is truthful &#8211; and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">2. In this same chapter, regarding the [same Hadith] narrated on the authority of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him), Imam At-Tirmidhi wrote, <strong>&#8220;And it is no more authentic than the previous chain of narration, and its chain of narration is weak.&#8221; </strong><em>(Jami&#8217; At-Tirmidhi #2887)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">3. <strong>&#8220;Verily everything has a heart, and the heart of the Qur&#8217;an is Ya-Sin.&#8221; </strong><em>(Kashf Al-Astar &#8216;an Zawa&#8217;id Al-Bazzar 3/87 #2304 from the Hadith of &#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Al-Albani wrote regarding this Hadith, <strong>&#8220;&#8230;and this Humayd (narrator) is unknown, just as Al-Hafidh said in Al-Taqrib, and I do not know &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Fadhl, the Shaykh of Al-Bazzar.&#8221;</strong><em> </em><em>(Silsilah Ahadith Ad-Da&#8217;ifa 1/204)</em> &#8211; Meaning this narrator Humayd Al-Makki, Mawla of Aal &#8216;Alqamah <em>(Tafsir Ibn Kathir 3/570) </em>is unknown just as Hafidh Ibn Hajr said in Taqrib Al-Tadhib, and that he does not know the teacher of Al-Bazzar: &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Fadhl. It is now understood that this narration is weak on account of two narrators being unknown.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">4. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night will be forgiven in the morning.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Musnad Abi Ya&#8217;la 11/93,94 #4324, and other than him from the path of Hisham bin Ziyad from Al-Hasan [Al-Basri] who said: I heard Abu Hurayrah&#8230;)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration is severely weak, Hisham bin Ziyad is an abandoned narrator. <em>(Al-Taqrib p.364 #7292)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">5. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night, seeking the Face of Allah, he will be forgiven in that night.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan Ad-Darimi #3420, and other than him)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration is weak on account of a disconnection, it is not established that Al-Hasan Al-Basri ever met Abu Hurayrah. Additionally, [Al-Hasan] was a Mudallis, and he is narrating with &#8216;An.³</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">6.  <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night, seeking the Face of Allah, will be forgiven.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Ibn Hibban, Marawid Adh-Dhaman #665, and other than him from Al-Hasan Al-Basri from Jundub)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration if weak on account of a disconnection, Abu Hatim Ar-Razi said, <strong>&#8220;It is not correct that Al-Hasan heard from Jundub.&#8221; </strong><em>(Al-Marasil p. 42)</em>, Also see the previous Hadith.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">7. <strong> &#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night, seeking the Face of Allah (Most High), will be forgiven for what has preceded from his sins, so recite it over your dead.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Bayhaqi in Shu&#8217;b Al-Iman #2458, from the Hadith of Ma&#8217;qil bin Yasar)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration is weak on account of an unknown narrator: Abu &#8216;Uthman and his father, who is also unknown. This Hadith is present in a shortened form in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad <em>(5/26,27)</em>, Mustadarak of Al-Hakim <em>(1/565)</em>, Sahih Ibn Hibban <em>(Al-Ihsan 7/269 #2991</em><em>)</em>, Sunan Abi Dawud <em>(#3121)</em> and Sunan Ibn Majah <em>(#1448)</em>, and Imam Ad-Daraqutni declared this Hadith to be weak. It has one weak supporting Hadith in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad <em>(4/105)</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">8.  &#8220;<strong>Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night will be forgiven in the morning.&#8221; </strong><em>(Hilyat Al-Awliya 4/130 form the Hadith of &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud, may Allah be pleased with him.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is considered fabricated due to the narrator &#8216;Abu Maryam &#8216;Abdul-Ghaffar bin Al-Qasim Al-Kufi&#8217;, who is a liar and a fabricator. <em>(Lisan Al-Mizan 4/50,51)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">9. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin will have the equivalent of twenty Hajj&#8217;s, and whosoever writes it then drinks it will have one thousand certainties and one thousand mercies enter his heart, and will have rancour and disease removed from it.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Hilyat Al-Awliya 7/136 from the Hadith of Al-Harith Al-A&#8217;war from &#8216;Ali)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is severely weak due to Al-Harith Al-A&#8217;war and the Tadlis of Abu Ishaq.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">10. <strong>&#8220;I wish that it were in the heart of every person from my Ummah (meaning Ya-Sin).&#8221;</strong> <em>(Kashf Al-Astar 3/87 #2305 from the Hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbas)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The narrator of this Hadith, Ibrahim bin Al-Hakim bin Aban, is weak. <em>(At-Taqrib #166)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">11. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Surah Ya-Sin whilst he is experiencing the agonies of death, or he is close to it, the Treasurer of Paradise will come to him with a drink from the drinks of Paradise, and he will give it to him to drink whilst he is on his bed, so he will drink it then die, and he will not be in need of a Basin (Hawdh) from the Basins of the Prophets.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Wasit of Al-Wahidi 3/509)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is fabricated &#8211; Yusuf bin &#8216;Atiyyah is an abandoned narrator <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #7872) </em>and Harun bin Kathir is unknown <em>(Lisan Al-Mizan 6/218)</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">12. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin, then it is as if he recited the [entire] Qur&#8217;an ten times.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is Mursal due to Hayyan b. &#8216;Atiyyah.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">13. <strong>&#8220;Surah Ya-Sin is called Al-Muni&#8217;mah in the Torah [&#8230;].&#8221;<em> </em></strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">(</span>Shu&#8217;b Al-Iman of Al-Bayhaqi #2465, Ad-Du&#8217;afa of Al-&#8216;Uqayli 1/347, Tablighi Nisab p.292,293, Fadha&#8217;il Al-Qur&#8217;an p.58, 59)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is Mawdu&#8217; (Fabricated), [the narrator] &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr Al-Jad is abandoned in Hadith, and another narrator is unknown. Imam Bayhaqi said regarding this Hadith, <strong>&#8220;It is rejected.&#8221;<em> </em></strong>Imam Al-&#8216;Uqayli also rejected this narration. This Hadith also comes through a second chain of narration in Tarikh Baghdad and in Al-Mawdu&#8217;at of Ibn Al-Jawzi, the narrator [in this chain], Muhammad bin Abd bin &#8216;Amir As-Samarqandi, is a liar and abandoned.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">14. <strong>&#8220;Verily I have made the recitation of Ya-Sin every night obligatory upon my Ummah, so whomsoever persists upon its recitation every night, then dies, will die the death of a Martyr.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Imam Ash-Shajri 1/118)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is fabricated, not a single one of its narrators is known, for example &#8216;Umar bin Sa&#8217;d Al-Waqas, Abu Hafs bin &#8216;Umar bin Hafs and Abu &#8216;Amir bin Abdur-Rahim. To summarise &#8211; every Marfu&#8217; narration on the virtues of Surah Ya-Sin is weak and rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Ad-Darimi, may Allah have mercy upon him, narrated: <strong>&#8220;&#8216;Amr bin Zurarah narrated to me: &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab narrated to me: Rashid Abu Muhammad Al-Hamani narrated to me from Shahr bin Hawshab who said: &#8216;Ibn Abbas said, &#8216;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the morning will be given an easy day until the evening, and whomsoever recites it in the middle of the night will be given an easy night until the morning.'&#8221; </strong><em>(Sunan Ad-Darimi 1/257 #3422, and its chain is Hasan</em><em>)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">A summarised biography of these narrators is as follows:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>&#8216;Umar bin Zurarah: Trustworthy. <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #5032)</em></li>
<li>&#8216;Abdul-Wahhab Ath-Thaqafi: Trustworthy, used to change (i.e., mix up Hadith) before his death for 3 years, however, this does not harm his Hadiths as he did not narrate Hadith in this period of time. <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #4261)</em></li>
<li>Rashid bin Nujayh Al-Hamani: Truthful and perhaps he made mistakes. <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #1857) &#8211; </em>He was a Hasan Al-Hadith narrator.</li>
<li>Shahr bin Hawshab: The [Scholars of Hadith] differed on him as a narrator, the majority of the Muhaddithin declared him trustworthy. <em>(As I have researched in my book: Takhrij An-Nihayah fi&#8217;l-Fitan w&#8217;al-Malahim p.119,120) &#8211; </em>Hafidh Ibn Kathir declared one of his narrations to be &#8216;Hasan&#8217;. <em>(Musnad Al-Faruq 1/228) </em>In my research, this narrator is Hasan Al-Hadith.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">The summary of this research is that this chain of narration is Hasan, and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> A Mursal narration is that which is narrated by a Tabi&#8217;i (student of a Sahabi) from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ without mentioning who he had taken it from, Shaykh Zubayr &#8216;Aliza&#8217;i said, <strong>&#8220;The position of the majority of the Scholars of Hadith is that the Mursal narration of a Tabi&#8217;i is rejected.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Fatawa &#8216;Ilmiyyah 2/290)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:] </strong>Hafidh Ibn Kathir wrote regarding Marfu&#8217;, <strong>&#8220;That which is attributed to the Prophet ﷺ, whether it is speech or action&#8230;&#8221; </strong><em>(Ikhtisar &#8216;Ulum Al-Hadith with the annotations of Shaykh Zubayr &#8216;Aliza&#8217;i p.33)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">³ <strong>[TN:]</strong>  <span class="fontstyle0">Tadlis: </span><span class="fontstyle2">Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i wrote, </span><strong><span class="fontstyle0">“If a narrator transmits a narration from his Shaykh (with whom it is established that he met and heard from) using terms such as ‘An </span></strong><span class="fontstyle0">([ </span><span class="fontstyle3">عن </span><span class="fontstyle0">from], this is an ambiguous form of narrating in Arabic which can imply that one </span><span class="fontstyle0">heard it directly or indirectly from someone else)</span><strong><span class="fontstyle0"> while he heard that narration from someone else (other than his Shaykh) – and those whom he narrates this to think that is likely that he heard it from his Shaykh, then this is known as ‘Tadlis’.” </span></strong><span class="fontstyle2">– see the Maqalat of Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i, Volume 1, Page 252. In summary, Tadlis is a hidden weakness in a chain of narration caused by a narrator concealing whom he had actually heard the narration from by using ambiguous terms such as ‘An (عن).</span><span class="fontstyle4"> </span><span class="fontstyle2">Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i explains, </span><strong><span class="fontstyle0">“It is a famous and well-known issue in the Principles of Hadith (i.e., Hadith Sciences) that the narrations of the Mudallis (a narrator that practises Tadlis) that narrates by ‘An ( )</span><span class="fontstyle3">عن</span></strong><span class="fontstyle0"><strong>is rejected and not a proof, meaning it is weak.”</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle2">He further quoted from Imam Ash-Shafi’i who wrote, </span><strong><span class="fontstyle0">“So we say: We do not accept a Hadith from a Mudallis until he says ‘Hadathani (So-and-so narrated to me)’ or ‘Sami’tu (I heard directly, i.e., an explicit term used for transmitting directly)’.” </span></strong><span class="fontstyle2">[Ar-Risalah with the Tahqiq of Ahmad Shakir #1035] – see the Maqalat of Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i, Volume 4, Page 151.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 class="citation_title" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Early Manuscripts of Quran (Through Data of Hijazi Calligraphy and Archaeological Evidence)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Prof. Dr. Adnan bin Mohammed Shareef</strong> (Umm Al Qura University)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Prof. Dr. Yasser Ismail Abdul Salam</strong> (Cairo and Taif Universities)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>:|:|:- <em>This paper tackles the ambiguous doubts aired by Yasir Qadhi.  Some people are yet to grasp the fundamentals of Ahl al-Sunnah. This paper will leave you in awe, the detail in the research is phenomenal and Yasir Qadhi is left standing. Please, do leave your views in the comments</em> -:|:|:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This research tackled the manuscripts of the early Quran (through the data of Hijazi calligraphy and archaeological evidence), reviewing the spelling phenomena that characterized Quran writing in close relation to the reality of Arabic writing. It also attempted to enlist the characteristics of calligraphy in early Quran copies as influenced by Nabataean script or what might be called early Arabic calligraphy (Hijazi calligraphy), comparing it with early Arabic inscriptions. Moreover, the study identified the relationship between the spelling system used in writing early Quran copies and the one used in early Arabic inscriptions, and attempted to conceive ways of identifying and dating the early Quran manuscripts preserved in regional and international libraries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The study is mainly based on five copies of the Quran manuscripts preserved in international libraries and book houses; namely:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Quran manuscript preserved in Berlin National Library (Berlin Quran), the Quran preserved in Birmingham University Library (Birmingham Quran), Tübingen University Library Quran (Tübingen Quran), the Quran preserved in the National Library in Paris (Paris Quran), and the Quran preserved in the British Library in London (London Quran).</span><span style="color: #000000;">This is in addition to a collection of stone inscriptions and early dated papyrus received.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The identification of the origin of Arabic calligraphy is significant for researchers of ancient Arabic inscriptions and of the Quran, whether in terms of the manuscripts or the drawings and other related sciences. Such identifications also enables identifying the characteristics of this calligraphy, especially the early ones with which the first Quran was written to explain those sciences and others, and to resolve the debate on the origin of the calligraphy with which the Quran in the era of the Prophet peace be upon him was written and copied in the era of the Caliphs, may Allah be pleased with them all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are many trends and theories in determining the origin of the Hijazi Arabic calligraphy with which the Quran was written. A researcher of early dated Arabic inscriptions can easily identify a well-established writing system that writers followed, no matter how well that system resulted in conformity between what is written and what is pronounced.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The study concluded with a set of findings and recommendations, the most important of which are:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8211; The study proved that the early Quran copies received (samples of study) were copied and written in soft Hijazi calligraphy.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">&#8211; The study and the models of Quran manuscripts used proved the authenticity of the Holy Quran, despite the claims of Orientalists and skeptics.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">&#8211; The study revealed that most of the tithing marks were later on added in the early Quran manuscripts after their copying.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">&#8211; The study proved that among the main criteria that assist in dating the Quran manuscripts, especially the early ones, are their technical standards, as well as the linguistic standards in comparison with the cultural heritage, and then the radioactive carbon (C14) examination.</span></p>
