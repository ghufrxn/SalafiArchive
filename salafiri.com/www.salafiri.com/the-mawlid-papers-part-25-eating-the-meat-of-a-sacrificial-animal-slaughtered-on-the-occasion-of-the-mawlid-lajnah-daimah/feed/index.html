		<description><![CDATA[i think you may need to read up on this issue. just by mentioning Allah names does not make it correct. a person can mentions Allahs name and say he is offering the sacrifice for guru nanak. which is shirk as it is being slaughtered for other than Allah]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked the following question in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (9/74): 

What is the ruling on meat that is slaughtered for the Mawlid? 

He (may Allaah have mercy on him) replied: 

If it is slaughtered (as a sacrifice) to the one whose birthday is being celebrated, then it is major shirk, but it is slaughtered just to be eaten, there is nothing wrong with that. But it should not be eaten, and the Muslim should not attend (the feast), so as to denounce them in word and in deed, unless he attends in order to denounce them without joining them in eating or anything else. End quote.]]></description>
