		<description><![CDATA[Assalamu alaikum,

Akhi, are you aware that the owner of Darul Tahqiq has written a very thick book as a refutation to your Al qual as saheeh fee masatul taraweeh. 

I have read almost all the pages and I thoroughly examined it. This is what I found :

1. He couldn&#039;t prove that 20 rakaah is Sunnah. 
2. He couldn&#039;t prove that 8 rakaah is not Sunnah. 
3. But what he did prove that there are authentic narrations which say that sahaba offered 20 rakaah.

The thing which i understood is that because 8 is sunnah, sahaba started offering 8 rakaah but later they found that people couldn&#039;t stand in prayer for a very long rakaah, so they increased the no. Of rakaah from 8 to 20, 26, 36, 16, etc to decrease the duration of time in rakaahs. In order to make it easy for them.

They did this because 20 is not compulsory 

But today we hardly spend 1.5 hours in taraweeh, so we shouldn&#039;t increase the no. Of rakaah and stick to Sunday which is 8 because we don&#039;t have good reasons for it.

Do you agree with me?

May Allah Reward you for your efforts. Ameen.]]></description>
