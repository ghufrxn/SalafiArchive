		<description><![CDATA[Assallamu Alaikum wa Rahmtullah hi wa Barakat hu!

Dear Brother,

Is their any hadeeth on how the Prophet may peace be upon Him, or The Shabaas radiallahu anhu maintain their prayer timings at the time of cloudy or rainy seasons? Where the shadows reference were not visible.

In Islamic History how was the maintenance of time changed from shadows to watches?

Awaiting for reply desperately. May Allah reward you to the best!

Jazaka`Allah wa Khair.

Faiazur Rahman.
