		<description><![CDATA[Very good job highlighting the double standards of the Hanafis. They are bold enough to say that the sayings of the Companions are not hujjah but if you tell them the simple fact that their Imaam was weak in hadith they begin to have seizures.  

You tell them their trinity of Imaams made mistakes and they go red and blue in the face. 

May Allaah reward you for showing the double standards of this bizarre school of thought.]]></description>
