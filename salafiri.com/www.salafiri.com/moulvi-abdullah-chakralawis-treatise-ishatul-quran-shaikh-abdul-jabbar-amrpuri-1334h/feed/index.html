		<description><![CDATA[walaikum asalam, if you follow the Quran only then inch allah i think it will be good if you try to understand the meanings and refer back to its explanation and you may find that the hadith and sunnah plays a vital and important role. also since your at it and you only follow the Quran would you kindly tell us why you eat fish for and where in the Quran it says it is halal. lastly we are pretty sure of the importance of the hadith and Quran and thus are not in need to discuss it with anyone. May Allah guide us to the truth. Amin]]></description>
