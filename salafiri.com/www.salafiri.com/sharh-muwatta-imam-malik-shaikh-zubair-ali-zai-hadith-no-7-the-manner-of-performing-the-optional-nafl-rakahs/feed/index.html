		<description><![CDATA[It is possible the recitation may have been loud or slightly audible however there are possible reasons, i.e. the occasional higher tone whilst reciting some ayat which allowed Hafsah RadhiAllahu Anha to make this deduction, or she may have asked the Messenger of Allah Salalalhu Alayhi Wasallam, or the he may have informed her. So there are a few possibilities. Nonetheless there is no restriction in reciting loudly in the nawafil prayer as well as doing this in congregation. The evidence for this is the companions would pray with the Messenger of Allah and then return to their respective communities and lead them in the obligatory as well as optional prayers and they would recite loudly. Allah knows best]]></description>
