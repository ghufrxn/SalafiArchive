		<description><![CDATA[As-salaamu &#039;alaykum,

At the end of the hadeeth it is stated that Uwaymir (radiyallaahu &#039;anh) pronounced divorce three times upon his wife. If I am not mistaken then he did this in a single sitting and in the presence of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#039;alayhi wa sallam). Does that then validate this practice (of thrice divorcing in one go) since I assume the divorce was finalized as a result and the Prophet (sallallaahu &#039;alayhi wa sallam) witnessed it without objecting to it (or is it restricted to this particular situation i.e adultery)? 

Baarakallaahu feekum]]></description>
