		<description><![CDATA[As-salaamu-alaykum. I was wondering if you have anything regarding innovated practices like khatams and what is the corect solution/way. Also, there are other different onnovated practices of the sub continent like kissing of the thums and eyes etc and congregational dua after every obligatory prayer.

I was brought up the deobandi hanafi way however Alhamdulillah i have been trying to learn the correct aqidah which is to follow quraan and sunnah with the teachings and understanding of the companions and the 1st three generations of islam.

May Allah swt bless you and the team for all that you have done.]]></description>
