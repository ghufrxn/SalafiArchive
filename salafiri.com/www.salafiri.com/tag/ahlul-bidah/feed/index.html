<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What the Scholars said about him when he died</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Badʿi al-Dīn Shāh al-Rāshidī al-Sindhī wrote:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I was very shocked after hearing the news of the tragic death of Faḍīlat ul-Shaykh Mawlāna Maḥmūd Aḥmad Mirpūrī. May Allāh accept his efforts and service with regards to propagating and spreading Islām in the foreign lands, May Allāh forgive his mistakes, raise his status and grant the whole Jamāʿah strength to cope with this tragedy. Amīn, as the whole Jamāʿah is equally grieving and may Allāh allow us to die upon Islām.”</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAbdul ʿAzīz ibn ʿAbd Allāh Bāz said:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The news of the tragic death of Maḥmūd Aḥmad Mirpūrī reached me. May Allāh forgive the Shaikhs shortcomings and grant him mercy and may he grant you wholesome patience. May Allāh give the Shaikhs children guidance and success to tread upon his path and grant us an equal replacement, Amīn. We all belong to Allāh to him we shall return.” </em>(<em>ʿ</em>Abdul ʿAzīz bin ʿAbd Allāh bin Bāz &#8211; Dār al-Iftā, Riyāḍh)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAbdul Qādir Ḥabībullāh al-Sindhī wrote:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“Me, my father and my household are all grieving with you. Kindly convey my condolences to the Jamāʿah, the Shaikhs family and children, as I am also a member of this Jamāʿah</em><em>.  I praise the efforts of Jamāʿah Ahl al-Ḥadīth United Kingdom. </em><em>I was impressed with the Shaikh’s praiseworthy and noble efforts and I ask Allāh to accept this from him and to replace him with someone beneficial for the Jamāʿah Ahl al-Ḥadīth. May Allāh also grant success in further propapagting the Dīn and its teachings and may he give you and all of us patience. Amīn.” </em>(Shaikh ʿAbdul Qādir Ḥabībullāh al-Sindhī<em> &#8211; </em>Professor Islamic University Madīnah) abībullah</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ṣafī al-Rahman al-Mubārakpūrī wrote:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Shaikh had raised the knowledge of Islām in the land of kufr and upheld the burden of rectification in this land of anarchy. Due to his effort, struggle, understanding, contemplations, wisdom and intelligence he raised the rank of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth of Britain from being virtually unknown and non-existant to the epitomy and vast stature of society. Without doubt everyone played a role in this formation and InshaʾAllāh everyone will be rewarded accordingly for their efforts. Thus the pivotal role the Shaikh played is not in need of any clarification. We have hope in our Rabb the most generous and oft giving and we supplicate to him that he grants the Shaikh the loftiest of stations and that he is blessed, favoured, forgiven and compassion. My heart pains after contantly thinking that a very capable and an adept visionary leader passed away. Death is undoubtedly a stark reality and its time and place is also definitive and so when a tragic event like this occurs the heart is affected and old thoughts become active. I pray to Allāh that he grants the Shaikh his special blessings and that he grants his close relatives virtuous patience and that he replaces the Shaikh with someone beneficial for all of us.”</em> (Shaikh Ṣafī al-Rahman al-Mubārakpūrī &#8211; Markaz Khidmah al-Sunnah Waʾl Sīrah al-Nabawīyyah &#8211; Islamic University Madīnah)</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Definition of <em>Bidʿ</em></strong><strong><em>ah</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of the statements of the Messenger of Allāh (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) we can generally define innovations ie <em>bidʿ</em><em>ah</em> as, <strong>“Inventing or introducing something new into the Dīn.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> </strong>In some further detail we can say<strong>, “Introducing something new into the Dīn which has no evidence from the Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>(Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> or the companions, with the intent of receiving reward and thinking it is his means of salvation by acting on it. (ie the <em>bidʿ</em></strong><strong><em>ah</em></strong><strong>)</strong><strong>”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islām Imām Ibn Taymiyyah has further elucidated and said, it means to introduce an action, which was not practised during the time of the Messenger of Allāh (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam), and there was no obstacle that prevented them from doing it. Furthermore, there was no legal reason for them to even formulate an innovation, so despite this if a new action is performed with the understanding that it is part of the Dīn, then this is an innovation.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> ʿAlī Maḥfūẓ said regarding the technical or Sharīʿah meaning of <em>bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah</em>, <em>“A new way introduced in the Dīn which resembles (aspects) of the Sharī</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah which is only practiced in order to exceed in worshipping Allāh.”</em> [ʿAlī Maḥfūẓ, <em>al-Ibdā</em><em>ʿ</em><em> Fī Maḍhār al-Ibtidā</em><em>ʿ</em> [p.15]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>[A]</strong> The linguistic definition of <em>bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah</em> is: <em>“Something invented without having any prior example.”</em> This is based upon its usage in the Qur&#8217;ān in the saying of Allāh, <strong>“Say: “I am not a new thing <em>(bid</em></strong><strong><em>ʿ</em></strong><strong><em>an)</em></strong> <strong>amongst the Messengers” (Sūrah al-Aḥqāf:9)</strong>, meaning Muḥammad is not a new thing amongst the Messengers, as he has precedents and prior examples before him (Isā, Mūsā, Ibrāhīm and so on). [Shāṭibī, <em>al-Ei</em><em>ʿ</em><em>tisām</em> [1:43]. Some linguists have defined <em>bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah</em> as, <em>“Innovating something new in the Dīn after its completion or any statement or action based on whims, desires or personal opinion innovated after the Messenger of Allāh </em>(Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam)<em>.”</em> Some added “<em>A statement or action without and prior precedence.”</em> [<em>al-Qāmūs al-Muḥiṭ</em> [p.906], Ibn Manzūr, <em>Lisān al-</em><em>ʿ</em><em>Arab</em> [6:8], Ibn al-Fāris, <em>Mu</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ajam al-Maqā</em><em>ʿ</em><em>is Fil Lugha</em> [p.119] and Ibn Taymiyyah,<em> Fatāwa</em> [35:414]. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[B]</strong> The word <em>bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah</em> in the Dīn has many meanings attached to it. One such meaning is given by al-Shāṭibī who said, <em>“Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah</em><em> is an expression of a path taken in the religion, which is invented and resembles the Sharī</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah and by whose practice exaggeration in worshipping Allāh is intended”</em> [Shāṭibī, <em>al-Ei</em><em>ʿ</em><em>tisām</em> [1:53]. Ibn Rajab said. <em>“Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah refers to newly invented actions which have no basis in the Sharī</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah. Actions that do have a basis in the Sharī</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah are not classed as innovations and are understood in the linguistic sense.”</em> [Ibn Rajab, <em>Jām</em><em>ʿ</em><em>e Ulūm al-Ḥikam</em> [2:127-128]. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[C] </strong>The Scholars of Ahlus Sunnah have explained that innovation is of two types. That which is<em> <strong>Ḥaqīqīyyah</strong> (or ḥaqīqī)</em>, meaning proper innovation, in every sense of the word. It has absolutely no association to, or basis in the Sharīʿah. [Shāṭibī, <em>al-Ei</em><em>ʿ</em><em>tisām</em> [1:367]. It is when a person seeks nearness to Allāh through something the Messenger of Allāh (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) never sought nearness to Allāh with at all, in its very foundation. From the examples of this type of innovation is seeking nearness to Allāh through celebrating birthdays, through dancing and music, or through acting. Some scholars have mentioned different examples like monasticism and secluding oneself from the worldly life and benefits etc. Such people impose fabrictated types of worship on themselves. [Shāṭibī, <em>al-Ei</em><em>ʿ</em><em>tisām</em> [1:370], Ibn Kathīr, <em>Tafsīr al-Qurʾān al-</em><em>A</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ẓīm</em> [4:316], Saʿdī, <em>Taysīr al-Karīm ar-Rahmān Fī Tafsīr Kalām al-Manān</em> [1:782]. Shāṭibī mentions numerous other examples in his book. [Shāṭibī, <em>al-Ei</em><em>ʿ</em><em>tisām</em> [1:370-445].  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[D]</strong> As for that which is <strong><em>Iḍāfīyyah</em></strong> (that which has a basis in the religion), this is when a person seeks nearness to Allāh on account of something by which nearness is in fact sought with Allāh in its foundation (asl). However, to which he adds something which takes it away from the form that it came with in the Sharīʿah and this is done in respect to six matters: <strong>(i)</strong> al-Kam (number), <strong>(ii)</strong> al-Kayf (form), <strong>(iii)</strong> al-Jins (type), <strong>(iv) </strong>al-Ṣabab (cause, reason), <strong>(v)</strong> al-Makān (place), <strong>(vi)</strong> al-Zamān (time). Hence, <strong><em>Bid</em></strong><strong><em>ʿ</em></strong><strong><em>ah</em></strong><strong><em> Iḍāfīyah</em></strong> [despite having a basis in the Sharīʿah] is rejected just as <strong><em>Bid</em></strong><strong><em>ʿ</em></strong><strong><em>ah</em></strong><strong><em> Ḥaqīqīyah</em></strong> is. This is because the six matters above are never established in the Qurʾān and Sunnah when the asal or foundation will be in the Qurʾān and Sunnah. [Ṣāleḥ bin Saʿd al-Suḥaimī, <em>Tanbīyyah Ulil al-Abṣār Ila Kamāl al-Dīn Wa Ma Fī al-Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah Min Akhṭār </em>[p.96], ʿAdawī, <em>Uṣūl Fī’l Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah Waʾl Sunan</em> [p.30] (also known as <em>Ṭarīq al-Wuṣūl Ilā Ibṭāl al-Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>a</em><em>h bi ʿIlm al-Uṣūl</em>). An example of <strong><em>Bid</em></strong><strong><em>ʿ</em></strong><strong><em>ah</em></strong><strong><em> Iḍāfīyah</em></strong> would be to offer special prayers in mid Shaʿbān despite prayer being established in the Dīn the mode and form of such a prayer is not established by the Messenger of Allāh (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) at the particular time, hence it is an innovation. Examples of this are making Zikr in unison after the five daily prayers etc. [Shāṭibī, <em>al-Ei</em><em>ʿ</em><em>tisām</em> [1:452], Ṣāleḥ bin Saʿd al-Suḥaimī, <em>Tanbīyyah Ulil al-Abṣār Ila Kamāl al-Dīn Wa Ma Fī al-Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah Min Akhṭār</em> [p.96]. <strong>[E]</strong> In fact, the ḥadīth of Āʿishah, <em>“Whoever introduces something into this affair of ours which does not belong to it, shall have it rejected.”</em> leads to the irrefutable conclusion that, nothing is considered a <em>bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah</em> in the <em>Sharī</em><em>ʿ</em><em>a</em><em>h</em> sense except when these conditions are met. These three conditions are: <em>‘</em><strong><em>al-Ihdāth</em></strong><em>’</em> &#8211; Introducing something new, <em>‘</em><strong><em>al-Iḍhāfah</em></strong><em>’</em> &#8211; Ascribing it to the religion, <em>‘</em><strong><em>A’dm al-Dalīl ash-Shar</em></strong><strong><em>ʿ</em></strong><strong><em>ī</em></strong><em>’</em> &#8211; Absence of Sharīʿah evidence [for this newly-introduced matter] in either a general way or a specific way from the prophet of Allāh. [See also ʿAlī Nāṣir al-Faqīhi, <em>al-Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah Ḍawābiṭha Wa </em><em>A</em><em>tharuhā al-Sayy</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ia Fi</em><em>ʿ</em><em>l Ummah </em>[p.12-13]. The Albanian Ḥadīth Master, Muḥammad Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī was of the opinion that most innovations are based on general principles which are still impermissible and al-Shatibi classed such innovations as <strong>Iḍāfī</strong>. [al-Albāni, <em>Ṣaḥīḥ Targīb Waʾl</em><em> Tarhīb</em> [1:54-55], <em>al-Radd al-Taʿqīb al-Hathīth</em> [p.48] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Ibn Taymiyyah said <em>“An innovation in the Dīn of Islām is every action not legislated by Allāh The Most High nor his Messenger </em><em>(Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam</em><em>)</em><em> ie something not legislated which is neither mandatory nor recommended.” </em>[Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>Majmū</em><em>ʿ</em><em>a Fatāwa</em> [4:107-108]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> There are numerous statements of Ibn Taymiyyah regarding <em>bidʿah</em> and its principles. For further clarification of Ibn Taymiyyahs words refer to <em>Majmū</em><em>ʿ</em><em>a al-Fatāwa</em> [4:194, 22:306, 18:346, 35:414]</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Publishers Foreword</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Alhamdullilahi Rabbil A’lamīn, Waṣalatu Wasalam Ala Rasūlillahil Karīm,  Wa, Ba’d</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is before you is part one of a great book of Allāmah al-Albānī ‘Qāmūs al-Bidʿah’ ie <em>‘An Encyclopedia concerning Biʿdah.’</em> The Shaikh started the book but was taken away by Allāh before he could complete it. One of the students of the Shaikh, Shaikh Mashūr Ḥasan Aāl-Salmān and Shaikh Aḥmad Ismāʿīl Shakwakānī took the responsibility on completing the book from the works and lectures of the Shaikh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh has used over hundreds of books, recordings and column pieces written by the Shaikh to try to do justice in order to complete the book. May Allāh bless the Shaikhs who strove to give the reader an amazing text which we hope insha’Allāh can be seen as a legacy of Shaikh al-Albānī in time to come.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The parts will be released gradually and summarised whilst taking from the most relevant and important points. Shaikh Muḥammad Nāṣir ud Dīn al-Albānī discussion on bidʿah at times are very detailed and takes the course of an Usūlī discussion and at times they very succinct and precise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wherever possible the translators have attempted to keep to the method and style of the Shaikh in order to give the readers a better comprehension of the thought of his Imām of Ahlus Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Last but not least, this work alone is a testament of Imām al-Albānīs deep comprehension, interpolation and deductions which is no ordinary feat and at the same instance it silences the ardent and staunch detractors of the Imām.    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allāh accept it from everyone involved, Amīn. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>S</strong><strong>alafi</strong> <strong>R</strong><strong>esearch</strong> <strong>I</strong><strong>nstitute</strong> <strong>2015</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was fervent in his efforts to highlight bidʿah and its manifestations. To have knowledge of bidʿah and that which leads to it is from the chapter of knowledge which is obligatory to learn and understand so one can be saved from Bidʿah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh states in his tremendous book <em>‘al-Ajwibātun Nāfʿe’</em>,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is an obligation for one to know about Bidʿah and it&#8217;s evils as it is through this that a person will be saved and gain closeness to his Lord. Salvation from bidʿah will only be achieved after one is aware of the principles of bidʿah otherwise a person can very easily and unknowingly fall into the evils of bidʿah. It is a well known maxim amongst jurists &#8220;that which leads to fulfilling an obligation is in itself an obligation. the same can be said about the likes of shirk, for it is obligatory to know what will lead to shirk for staying away from it is an obligation.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the companion Huḍaifah ibn al-Yamān (RaḍiAllahu ʿAnhu) narrates that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The people used to enquire from the prophet about good but I used to ask about the evil, so that I could avoid it.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, in this book we shall explore the meaning of bidʿah and its various manifestations. We will also look at types of bidʿah that have crept into the Muslim creed and worship, knowledge of which is a must so that bidʿah can be avoided. May Allah help us all upon his path. Amīn.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>WHAT IS BIDʿAH?</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>LINGUISTIC DEFINITION</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allāmah Albānī records from Imām Ṣiddīq Ḥasan Khān that bidʿah is,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“That for which there is no previous established example [proof]”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE SHARĪʿAH DEFINITION</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh mention in his books <em>‘Salāt at-Tarāwīh’</em> and <em>‘al-Ibdā’</em> that bidʿah in the religion means,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Something introduced into the religion which has a resemblance to the Sharia in some form. One acts upon it in order to worship Allah and get a nearness to him.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE PRINCIPLES OF IBĀDAH [WORSHIP] AND BIDʿAH [INNOVATION] IN ISLĀM. </strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh in his book <em>‘Ḥujjatun-Nabī’ </em>states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“For worship to be accepted before Allāh it must fulfill two basic conditions: a] That it be purely for the sake of Allāh and b] It be in accordance with the book of Allāh and the Sunnah of his Prophet.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>TYPES OF SUNNAH</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>1] Sunnah is of two types:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sunnah Tarkīyyah [that which was left by him] and Fʿilīyyah [that which was said or performed by him].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh explains in <em>‘Ḥujjatun Nabī’</em> that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Should someone perform an action or saying as part of worship, yet those actions or sayings were not performed by the prophet in order to get close to Allah as part of his worship is a something which is in opposition to the Sunnah. This is because Sunnah is of two types being Tarkīyyah and Fʿilīyyah. Therefore, to leave off performing that which the prophet left off is Sunnah. One should consider how there is no adhān call to prayer for the Eīd and Funeral prayer yet to give such a call is to praise Allah.  The prophet left doing this and therefore to also leave this off is considered a Sunnah and that which makes one close to Allah. The blessed companions of the prophet understood how important it was to stay away from and warn from bidʿah. Huḍaifah Ibn al-Yamān (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) narrates that, “All that was left off by the companions of the prophet must be left off” and Abdullāh Ibn <u>Masʿūd</u> (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) said that, “Follow the Sunnah and do not innovate. The Sunnah is sufficient for you so follow it.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2] The saying of the prophet “every bidʿah is misguidance” is to be left upon its general and complete meaning. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh in <em>‘al-Ajwibatun Nāfʿe’</em> states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is narrated by Jābir Ibn ʿAbdullāh (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) that the prophet whilst giving his sermons used to say, &#8216; The best speech is the book of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, and the worst of affairs is that which is innovated, and every innovation is a misguidance”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh states in ‘<em>Masājilah ʿIlmīyyah’</em> that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This shows all bidʿahs in the dīn without restriction are based on and lead to misguidance. Indeed the messenger said “every innovation is misguidance and every misguidance leads to the hellfire.””</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh in his book <em>‘Salāt at-Tarāwīh’</em> whilst recording a statement from <em>‘Majālis ul-Abrār’</em> of Mullā Aḥmad Rūmī Ḥanafī that he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The jurists have said concerning actions such as Ṣalāt ul-Ragā’ib and its pray in congregation, Reciting the Qurān in the bowing and to make remembrance aloud ahead of the funeral procession that these are all from the rejected actions and bidʿah. So the one who says that they are ‘ḥasanah’ [good] it will be said to him in reply, “Those actions which have a proof from the religion as being ‘ḥasanah’ will be ḥasanah due to them not being from bidʿah, in which case the ḥadīth &#8216;every innovation is misguidance&#8217; shall remain upon its unrestricted meaning. So the one who who specifies and makes exceptions to these words of the prophet let him bring an evidence from the book and Sunnah or consensus of the scholars to establish the exception to the general words of the prophet. One cannot rely upon opinions and customs to make exceptions to the ḥadīth of the prophet.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>3] It is necessary to oppose those who reject the truth, regardless of whether the opposers are many or few in number.</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh said at the end of his treatise <em>&#8216;Risālah Eīdain’ </em>that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Regarding the two groups there are those upon the truth and those who oppose. As for the ones upon the truth then they are the ‘jamaʿāh’ [Ahlus Sunnah community]. This is so as they are upon the Sunnah of the prophet and it is about them that the prophet described as “The Jamaʿāh”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a> and in another place he said “They [The Jamaʿʿh] are upon what I and my companions are upon.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><strong>[11]</strong></a> Indeed those who oppose them cannot harm them even if they are greater in number as the prophet said “There never cease to be a group [Jamaʿāh] in my Ummah who shall be manifest upon the truth. Its opposers cannot harm it up until the order of Allah shall come and they shall remain upon it”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><strong>[12]</strong></a> Thus, the believer is not afraid by being shunned by the sheer number of those who oppose the truth. Imām Shaṭibī states in his ‘al-ʿEitiṣām that, “It has been the way of our lord that the  ones upon the truth have been fewer in number than those upon falsehood.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><strong>[13]</strong></a> Allah says. <strong>“</strong></em><strong><em>And most of the people, although you strive [for it], are not believers.</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><em><strong>[14]</strong></em></a> <em>and <strong>“</strong></em><strong><em>And few of My servants are grateful.</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><em><strong>[15]</strong></em></a><em>So it can be said that the one who has intellect and understanding whilst reflecting upon the history of Islām and the prophets before Muḥammad will know that those upon truth have always been the strangers and fewer in number.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><strong>[16]</strong></a> </em></span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“Laa Tashirbil Maa Minal Bi’er Wa Fiyhee Galaazatun”</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“DO NOT DRINK (O SALAFEE) FROM THE WELL IN WHICH THEIR IS IMPURITY (BIDAH AND AHLUL BIDAH)”</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is not hidden from the salafees of the West that for some time now there has been a very relaxed approach in the affairs of dawah, especially, in calling to the pure, unadulterated and unblemished dawah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Of course, when one considers in depth the reason for the weakening and disunity of the salafees generally and in the west specifically, then there are many reasons as to why we have fallen from the peak all the way down! No doubt, becoming weak in taqwa, aqeedah and manhaj amongst many other matters come to mind as the foundational reasons for where we find ourselves today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, the purpose of this risaalah is not to list and discuss all the various factors that have made us fall to new depths but to consider carefully one factor which some may say is the single most considerable matter that has led to the salafee and his dawah suffering, that is leaving the door open for ahl ul bidah to enter our masaajid and thus our hearts!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence the title of this risaalah is a metaphorical one, in that, we must never allow ourselves to be influenced by ahl ul bidah and all that they call to from wretchedness and deviation. Allahs aid is sought.</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us consider some principles that ought to be the cornerstone of the salafee yet we have shamelessly deemed fit to move away from light toward darkness in our manhaj.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>{1} The importance and benefit in refuting not only the innovation but also the innovator.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah commented: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Some of the people said to Imaam Ahmad that ‘I find it difficult to critisize (narrators in the chain of narrations) that they have some problems and are like so and so? Imaam Ahmad replied, ‘if you and I remain silent, then how will the ignorant one know the authentic from the unauthentic narration?” (Majmoo al-Fataawa 28/231)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise is to Allah! Pay attention to how these few words of the salaf sum up the necessity to clarify the aqeedah and manhaj of those that have erred concerning it. For the one who ponders upon the words of Imam Ibn Tyamiyyah carefully will come to realise that this was said concerning a narrator who may have a weak memory or some other minor defect in narrating hadeeth, then what about the one who openly corrupts the Aqeedah and Manhaj, lying on Allaah (like the various callers to shirk and bidah from the various sects today) and our noble prophet? The one whom Allah has blessed will see that it is far more urgent and necessary to clarify the condition of this one!</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, the intellectual one is required to take one step further and he will realise that Imaam Ibn Tyamiyyah through the words of Imam Ahmad “how will the ignorant one know” is informing us that the basis of having the correct deen is to take it from those who are ahl us sunnah {the trustworthy ones} and not Ahlul Bidah {those that have sold their deen being the disparaged ones} for they will only spread knowledge which is corrupt and vain, thus leaving the ignorant as an ignorant one.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So noble reader know that it was due to the foresight bestowed upon Ibn Taymiyyah by Allah that he concluded this discussion by saying: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Had Allah not made the upright repel the evil ones {Ahlul Bidah} harm, the religion would be corrupted and this corruption is far greater than that being caused when during war the people are conquered. Verily, when they take over a country they do not corrupt and take over the heart and that which is in it related to the deen, but they do it over a long period. On the other hand, the people of Bidah they corrupt the hearts from the outset.” (Majmoo al Fataawa 28/232)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So it is clear to see that the Ahlul Bidah are like the serpent whose venom is deadly and at the same time instant in that they will affect and perverse the heart of the salafee. How much of a calamity is it that the person of innovation be allowed to take a place in our hearts and masaajid yet we know full well the venom of him and his innovation! Allah is the protector and his aid is sought!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, it is not difficult to deduce from the words of Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah that “Had Allah not made the upright repel the evil ones {Ahlul Bidah} harm, the religion would be corrupted” that this no doubt shows the superiority and status of the scholar, but most particularly the one who clarifies the affairs of the aqeedah and manhaj .</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 6">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is from the great blessing of Allah that in every time he sends scholars who ‘remove the hair from the flour’ and clarify the affairs. In current times where would we be had we not had the likes of Shaikh Ibn Baaz, Shaikh Albaanee, Shaikh Uthaymeen and currently Shaykh Rabee May Allah bless them all and have mercy on them. Ameen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet the calamity has struck those who belittle the dawah of these scholars past and present being affected and infected by the false principles around them and Ahlul Ahwaa. The irony of it, they “refute” those from amongst these scholars who they say they do nothing but to “refute”! May allah guide us all!</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>{2} The salafee will not have as his companion an innovator, rather, he will be judged by the one whom he befriends.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So once the salafee has safeguarded himself by adhereing to the above principle in, refuting the innovator and innovation, it is upon him then that he further distinguish and safeguard himself from the innovator and a means of doing this is that he does not have the ahl ul bidah as his companion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This principle and the one above are connected and understand it well may Allah have mercy on you, that, “every time a salafee has a companion from the people of innovation it is usually at this tage that he will open his heart to the innovator, not being able to rebuke him or his innovation”. So for this reason we find the tremendous saying of Abu Dardaa who said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“It is from the fiqh (understanding of a person) that he [chooses] those whom he walks with, whom he enters upon (visits) and whom he sits with.” (al-Ibaanah 2/477)</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 7">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Yahyaa bin Katheer said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Sulaimaan bin Daawood alaihis salaam said: Do no pass a judgement over anyone with anything until you see whom he befriends.” (al-Ibaanah 2/464)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Moosaa bin Uqbah, the Syrian, approached Baghdaad and this was mentioned to Imaam Ahmad. So it was said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Look at whose residence he goes to and with whom he resides and finds shelter.” (al-Ibaanah 2/480)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Imaam Al-Awzaaee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Whoever hides his innovation from us will not be able to hide his companionship from us.” (al-Ibaanah 2/476)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah have mercy on you, look at those who were far noble, upright and god fearing than you and I, yet they had a strong stance to those who corrupted the deen and not having any links with them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask, which one today is more knowledgeable in aqeedah and manhaj concerning how to deal with the ahl ul bidah and the principles of al jarh wa tadeel than Al Awzaaee? Yet ponder on the noble saying of al-Awzaaee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bring forth your men if you are truthful! So do not be Oh Salafee like the one who deludes himself thinking that the Ahlul Bidah will not affect him as his companion but know that the effect of this companionship will be so severe upon you that you will not be able to hide it! Allahs protection is sought.</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 8">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>{3} The obligation to clarify the dawah and the one who does so is not the cause of disunity.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Saaleh al-Fawzaan was asked, “Many of the people say that the refuters of Ahlul Bidah are separators, causing separation?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh replied: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Yes, they cause separation between truth and falsehood. This is correct. We make a distinction between the truth and falsehood, between the people of truth and those of falsehood. We are going to refute ahl ul bidah and so did the scholars refute ahl ul bidah. This is not the cause of division, but its to gather the people upon the truth, because with people remaining upon misguidance and the speech which is falsehood then it is this that causes division amongst the muslims. As for clarifying the truth for the people, so they can gather upon it, then this is the dawah towards unity and not the dawah towards separation. The dawah towards separation is when it is said ‘the people of falsehood are not to be refuted’. This is dawah of disunity if only they ponder! And allah knows best”{Q&amp;A session, Riyaadh, 2011}</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a short but tremendous advise and reply by Shaikh Fawzaan, may allah preserve him. One can see with great clarity from the shaikhs words tha he allies truth and falsehood as matters which cannot be mixed and similarly equates this by saying that the possessors, that is, people of truth and falsehood cannot therefore mix. A fundamental principle summarised by the sheikh in a few words, glory be to Allah.</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 9">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Noble reader, despite such clarifications you will still here some that say that their is no point in refuting ahl ul bidah or even speaking about them. Some go further and say that ‘ to discuss and backbite Ahlul Bidah is a waste of time and of no benefit’. So what then? Read on.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>{4} One of the distinguishing signs of Ahlul Bidah is that they ask for less refutation, whilst the Salafee is balanced and he will refute when it is required.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Unfortunately, a severe illness has crept in amongst salafees today and the people are told that to refute is not the correct way and that this hardens the heart and causes harshness and so on. So consider the following saying, and consider it over and over again for it encapsulates the manhaj of the salaf, who were the most balanced and kindest of people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">It is reported from al-Abbââs bin al-Waleed that ‘Uqbah said: “I was once with Arta’ah bin al-Mundhir when one of the people in the gathering said, “What do you say about a man who sits with the followers of the Sunnah and mixes with them, but when the followers of Bid’ah are mentioned he says, ‘Spare us from mentioning them, do not talk about them?’” Arta’ah said, “He is one of them, do not let him confuse you about his condition.” I felt this was strange, so I went to al-Awzaa’ee – and he used to clarify these matters when they came to him. He said, “Arta’ah is right, the matter is as he said; this person forbids talking about [Ahlal-Bid’ah], so how can [people] be on guard against them if they are not exposed?” (Ibn ‘Asââkir, Tâârîkh Dimishq 8/15)</span></em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 10">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So have you pondered enough! Clarifying the affairs is a cornerstone of dawah salafiyyah and to oppose this is to oppose the essence of the dawah for which there is no burhaan.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>{5} Laa Tashribul maa minal bi’er waa fiyhee ghalaazatun.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here, we end this short risaalah with the inspiring words of Imaaam Awzaee. I could not find a more suited reference than this which purely corresponds with the title of this risaalah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is reported that Imaam al-Awzaa’ee (d157H) wrote:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“O Muslims, fear Allâh and obey Him, and accept the advice of the sincere advisers and the exhortation of the exhorters, and know that this knowledge is religion, so be careful about what you do [in it] and from whom you take [it] and who you follow and who you trust your religion to. For verily, the followers of Bid’ah are all falsifiers and liars, neither are they careful nor do they fear and protect [against wrongdoing], and nor are they to be trusted to not distort what you hear. They say what they know not when criticizing and decrying or when affirming their lies. But Allâh encompasses what they do. So be on guard against them, suspect them, reject them and distance yourselves from them, for this was what your earlier scholars and the righteous latter ones did and instructed others to do. Beware of rising against Allâh and becoming instruments in the destruction of His religion and undoing its handholds by respecting the innovators, for you know what has come down to us about respecting them.And what stronger respect and veneration can there be than taking your religion from them, following them, believing them, being close to them and helping them in alluring those they allure and attracting those they attract of the weak Muslims towards their ideas and the religion they practice? This is enough to be considered a partnership and contribution to what they do.” (Ibn ‘Asââkir, Târîkh Dimishq 6/361-362).</span></em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 11">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">we find no need to add anything further then what has been said by Imaam Awzaaee. It is enough, sufficient, enough!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ones in need of pardon of their lord, Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And hold firmly to the rope of Allāh all together and do not become divided.” {Āli’Imrān (3): 103}</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We were sent an email by a very noble brother who highlighted some very important issues and concerns relating to the dawah Salafiyyah in Birmingham. Thereafter, on numerous occasions many brothers have been discussing the email and about how the dawah is to be progressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We thought it prudent to write a very short treatise on some of the important matters that have been discussed generally amongst the salafee brothers relating to dawah and specifically have highlighted some areas that are potential pitfalls, that we as Salafees must endeavour to navigate away from, thus preserving the dawah and ourselves before our Lord, the Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We have called this treatise “Do not Differ” as we have advocated in the past and shall continue to do so with the aid of Allah that the salafees ought to be united and must learn to differ, as and when subsidiary issues arise. However, this does not by any means translate into abandoning or watering down any of the blessed dawah’s principles or its identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, in current times it is ever more crucial and mandatory to preserve that which we have been blessed with of As Salafiyyah so that we are not held otherwise to account before Allah for distorting his deen.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(1) The Issue Concerning Watering Down the Dawah and an Important Distinction. That is, The Tremendous Principle of the Difference Between ‘Mudarah’ (being amicable) and ‘Mudahanah’ (to compromise).</strong></span></h4>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">

<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">’Ā’ishah (radi Allāhu ’anha) reported </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“that a man sought permission to enter upon the Prophet (sallallāhu alayhi wassallam) and when he saw the man the Prophet (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam) said: “Let him in, what a bad brother of his tribe he is and what a bad son of his tribe he is.” (Bukharee &#8211; Kitaab ul Fitan)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Nawawee (rahimahullāh) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“This Hadīth shows the permissibility of mudārah”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Hajr (rahimahullāh) said about this Hadīth: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Ibn Battāl said: Mudārah is from the good character of the believers, to be responsive to people, even with a word, without being coarse with them in speech, this is one of the strongest causes of harmony. Some people think that mudārah is mudahānah and this is an error, as mudārah is regrettable and mudāhanah is prohibited. The difference is: mudāhanah is taken from the word ad-Dahhān (the painter) who glosses over something and covers what is actually there. the scholars have explained it as lying with a sinner and openly displaying happiness with what he is doing without forbidding him at all. Mudārah is being kind with the ignorant in order to teach him, being kind with the sinner in order to forbid him from what he is doing, without being harsh with him so that he does not expose what he does, and forbidding him with gentle speech and action, especially if his comradeship is needed and the likes of that.” (Fath ul-Bārī [Dār ur-Rayyān], vol.10, pg.545)</span></em></p>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 6">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Qurtubī (rahimahullāh) stated: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“the difference between mudārah and mudāhanah is that mudārah is to surrender the dunya for the benefit of the religion and it is permissible and even recommended. Mudāhanah is leaving the religion for the dunya.” (ibid, vol.10, p.469)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (rahimahullāh): </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Thus mudārah is praiseworthy and mudāhanah is censured, so there is a differenece between the two. The one who is mudāree uses kindness with a person in order for the truth to manifest from the person or make him retract from falsehood. The mudāhin (compromiser) uses kindness in order for the person to remain established upon falsehood and leaves him upon his desires. Mudārah is for the people of Imān while mudāhanah is for the hypocrites.” (Ar-Rūh pg. 231)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to refer to the magnificent books by the great late, Allamah Bakr Abu Zayd (rahimahullāh) ‘Hukm ul Intimaa’ and ‘Hajr ul Mubtadi’ for a discussion on this topic further and I pray Allah will allow us to translate and publish the book soon, Inshaallaah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So you will come to realise that it is not necessary to be harsh and rough all the time when giving dawah or responding to the one calling you, although this has its time and place. At the same token we should not ‘gloss over’ the current problems in the dawah and pretend that they are not there, such pertinent example are from the likes of al-Maghrib, al-Kauthar, these academies, institutes and cooperating with their speakers and promoter’s thus creating a confusion and void in the minds of the Salafee youth, not knowing whether to turn to the right or left.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 7">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ultimately, the caller and the called become confused together and the sinner is left unspoken and not warned about, and this is displaying a support and aid for the sinner. It should not be difficult for the Salafee, as a minimum, to free himself from the one who places the Soofee, Mutazilee, Jahmee, Qadaree, Murjee and so on under the banner of Ahlus Sunnah, and by doing so he preserves the trust that Allah has placed with him through this blessed dawah. A lot, can be said but this will be detailed in a later book Inshaallaah. Allah’s aid is sought.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(2) The Basis of the Salafee Call and Its Restriction</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam adh-Dhahabee (rahimahullāh) said in the introduction to his book al-’Uluww li’l-’Aliyy al-Ghaffār’: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“O ’Abdullāh, If you love justice then stop at the texts of the Qur’ān and Sunan and then look at what the Companions and the Tābi’ūn stated along with the commentaries of the Imāms of tafsīr with regards to the verses and with whatever has been related from the madhab of the Salaf. So either you speak with knowledge or you remain silent with gentleness.” (Refer to Wasitiyyyah Ahlus Sunnah Baynal Firaq pgs. 102-103.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Pay attention, it is obligatory, no doubt, that the caller call to and stop at the Quran, Sunnah and salaf. Look carefully and you will see in the words of Dhahabee the restriction and not going beyond this and it is therefore necessary that we explain this dawah to the masses in the kindest way. Contra, It is a major sin if we attempt to water down, hide or appease this dawah with that which is falsehood.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Look carefully again at the words of Dhahabee and you will see that a condition he placed is that the caller must have knowledge of that which he calls to and by this it is as clear as the sun that he is placing the importance upon the obligation of consulting, taking advise of and referring to the scholars.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 8">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A dawah which does not refer to scholars for its knowledge is like the one who expects a response from a donkey when it asks it how its affairs are! Impossible! That is, it is a dawah that cannot possibly succeed and instead the dawah becomes open to the interpretations of the juhaal (ignorant) and ruwaybidah (those unfit to give knowledge). So what will be the effect? See below,</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(3) False Interpretations</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn ul-Qayyim (rahimahullāh) states: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“To sum up: The splitting of the People of the Book and of this Ummah into 73 sects is only understood via their interpretations.” (Ilaamul Muwaqi’een 4/317)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abi’l-’Izz al-Hanafī (rahimahullāh) states: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Did the Khawārij revolt, or the Mu’tazilah depart or the Rawāfid reject and the Ummah split into 73 sects due to anything except corrupt and false interpretations? (Sharh Aqeedah Tahawiyyah pg. 89)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once the dawah has been clouded and clarity diminishes then the floodgates open for all the watering down, false interpretations, accommodations of all the opinions ever held by the people. It is at this time that the dawah becomes something which is strange only adhered to by those who seen as strangers! So one of the most important ways to remove such blemishes and confusions concerning the dawah is to be clear upon the prophetic Aqeedah, Manhaj and stopping where the salaf stopped. This one is the true salafee and sunni.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 9">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Pay heed, as salafees we must not allow any false interpretations of anyone, no matter how many degrees they may have, how brilliant their courses are, how filled their seminar rooms become and so on to alter the dawah ‘through the back door’, the saying of the arabs is to be noted “the shade of the stick will never straighten up until the stick itself is crooked”.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(4)Why We Must Never Taint Dawah Salafiyyah</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ubayy ibn Ka’b (radi Allāhu ’anhu) stated: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“You must follow the path of Allāh and the Sunnah. There is no slave who is on the path of Allāh and the Sunnah, remembering Allāh, his eyes overflowing out of fear of his Lord, but that Allāh will never punish him. A minimal course in the path of Allāh and the Sunnah is better than striving hard in a path contrary to the path of Allāh and the Sunnah and consenting to innovation.” (Usool ul Eemaan Fee Dau Kitaab was Sunnah pg. 296)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Praise be to Allah, we call to a middle path, not being too harsh and nor being overly lenient and apologetic.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Consider the words of the illustrious companion Ubayy, the first part is emphatic in stating that the Sunni, Salafee who is merely an aami {layperson} but he is established firmly upon the book and Sunnah, that is as Salafiyyah, then “Allah will never punish him”. Praise be to Allah, let us call the general masses to this Salafiyyah and let us not be shy. We may well be held accountable for not allowing the general masses to be introduced to the clear and untainted salafiyyah. This is the job of the caller.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 10">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The second part of his saying clarifies further that as callers if we cannot give the people true and pure Dawah Salafiyyah then we should NEVER allow an untainted, twisted and confused version promoted by those who bring the grave worshipper and other than that under Ahlus Sunnah to emanate from our platforms or masaajid! It is better for us that we sit at home and better ourselves and our families then to preach or stay silent, thus accepting, the mistakes of others in the deen. Allahs aid is sought.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(5) Do not pretend to be on Dawah Salafiyyah but besincere in being a Salafee.</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullāh) stated in Majmū’ al-Fataāwā, vol.3, pg.156: </span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 10">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;As for pretending to be upon the Madhhab of the Salaf then this is bātil, as this is not possible except that ignorance will increase and knowledge will decrease.”</em></span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We don’t wish to overly comment upon the Imaams above quote but suffice it to say that it seems the watering down and wolves clothed in Salafiyyah garments is not a modern problem but one which has been dealt with by our salaf. Instead, we record below the words of a current day scholar.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdus Salām bin Sālim Rajā’ as-Suhaymī (Associate Professor in the Department of Fiqh, College of Sharī’ah, Islamic University of Madeenah) Commented on the above quote with,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“I say: “During our time there have been those who have claimed to be upon the madhab of the Salaf when the reality is that they are not. Indeed, there are those who are part of modern partisan groups, some who have the ideology of the Khawārij in the name of Salafiyyah and the likes. All of this is the result of the increase of ignorance and the decrease of knowledge just as Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah stated, or there has been a watering down of the Salafee Manhaj in order to include deviated groups in the guise of Ahlus-Sunnah wa’l-Jamā’ah”. (Please refer to the tremendous book of the sheikh ‘Kun Salafiyyan ’alā’l-Jādah’ pg.72)</span></em></p>

<h4><strong><span style="color: #000080;">(6) Considering the Tremendous Principle;‘Preventing Harm Takes Precedence Over Achieving Benefit’</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The evidence of this principle is: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A} The saying of Allāh:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And do not insult those they invoke other than Allāh, lest they insult Allāh in enmity without knowledge.” (Soorah al-Anām 6: 108)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allāh has prohibited insulting the gods of the Mushrikīn due to insults being levelled at Allāh and on the pretext that humiliating their deities leads to insulting Allāh. So the benefit of averting the insulting of Allāh is better than the benefit of us insulting their deities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">B} It is mentioned in the Hadīth of Ā’ishah (radi Allāhu ’anhā) that the Prophet (sallallāhu alayhi wassallam) said: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Yā Ā’ishah! If yourpeople had not been recent converts to Islām, I would have spent the treasure of the Ka’bah in the way of Allāh and would have constructed its door just on the level of the ground and would have encompassed in it the space of Hijr.” (Agreed Upon)</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 12">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the hadīth is a clear evidence for this principle as the Prophet (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam) left of the benefit of the Ancient House on the premise that Ibrāhīm (‘alayhis-salām) in order to avert the evils and fearing falling into them destroyed it and built on it and out of the people apostating due to this action. So the Prophet (sallallāhu alayhi wassallam) gave precedence to preventing this evil than achieving the benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">C} The Prophet (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam) sufficed from fighting the hypocrites due to the benefit in that for safeguarding the people from their harm, such as it being said that Muhammad (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam) kills his companions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">D} The Prophet (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam) forbade killing the leaders (of the Muslims) and revolting against their Imāms (i.e. leaders) even if they oppress, as long as they establish the prayer, in order to prevent the means to fitna and the wisdom in this was to prevent further corruption and harm; this is because what results in killing and revolting against leaders is double the evil than what the leader was doing in the first instance, and the Ummah is still reaping the effects of this to this day. The Prophet (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam) said: “If two Caliphs are pledged allegiance to then kill the last of them (who called for allegiance to be pledged to him)”, in order to prevent the means to fitna (tribulation).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullāh), after mentioning the different branches under the principle of preventing harm takes precedence over achieving benefits, mentioned that if the benefits and harms conflict then the most correct one in the situation will take precedence, he said (rahimahullāh):</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“From the Usool of Ahlus Sunnah is to stick to the Jamā’ah, leave off fighting against the leader, meaning: the oppressive leader, and abandoning fighting during times of fitna and all of these are included with the general principle that if the benefits and harms, and the evil and good conflict, then the most correct option has to be selected. This is because enjoining and forbidding though they entail the attainment of some benefit, and the prevention of some harm, its opposite must also be considered. If, in carrying out this enjoining or forbidding, there is benefit lost greater than the benefit gained, or harm is brought about greater than the harm which was avoided, then this is not part of that which Allah has ordered us to do, rather it is harām, because of the fact that its net harm is greater than its net benefit. the only criterion for measuring the above- mentioned harm and benefit is with the scales of the Sharī’ah. Whenever one is capable of following a text directly, it is not permitted for him to turn elsewhere. If he cannot find a text for the exact problem confronting him, he can exert his reason to understand the ruling by way of analogy. the legal texts are seldom without someone capable of knowing their implications, and how they point the way to the rulings of the Sharī’ah” (Majmu al-Fataawa vol. 28 page 128.)</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 13">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So we have heard amongst brothers saying that, ‘if we make the dawah clear then the people will leave’, ‘our numbers will decrease’, ‘the masjid will become empty’, ‘donations will fall’ and so on. These are excuses and not the legislated principles which allow one to leave of enjoining the good. Further, these points are mere conjectures and just darkness upon darkness.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(7) The Openness of Dawah Salafiyyah</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">’Umar bin ’Abdul ’Azīz (rahimahullāh) stated:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “If you see a people having secret meetings about their religion without involving the general people then know that they are based on misguidance.” (See Kun Salafiyyan pg.85 of Shaikh Suhaimee.)</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 14">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Note, the dawah is not about shutting out individuals from a close network just as those such as the al-maysooniyyah (The Free Masons) do with their closed meetings and agendas. The dawah is open for all and the doors are open for any individual to participate with sincerity and good actions before Allah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Further, the involvement of general people is also important in its right place. The salafee ought to be the most humble one distancing himself from arrogance and checking himself at all stages, Allah’s aid is sought.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(8) Preserve Your Salafiyyah At All Costs Oh Salafee!</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">’Abdullāh ibn Imām Ahmad (rahimahullāh) reported from Abī Qilābah (rahimahullāh) that he said:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “Neither sit with them nor mix with them! It is not safe as they will plunge you into their misguidance and confuse you with many things.” (Masaa’il Imam Ahmad pg. 86)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">How many a people have we seen that began to sit and have relations with one distant from the sunnah only for him to become like that person. In Birmingham, we have seen people say that the Deobandee caller to his baatil beliefs and manhaj, such as Zaheer Mahmood, was a shaikh and nothing was wrong with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">See all the points above and then you will come to the conclusion on how this one fell into the trap of sitting with an open innovator, the callers cannot free themselves of having a portion of the blame in this poor ones demise and distance from salafiyyah.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 15">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So what is the starting point for the salafee when it comes to innovators? Read on.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(9) The Balance of the Salafees in Dealing With Innovators</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullāh) said: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“So for example, the Imāms of innovation from the people who have statements which oppose the Book and the Sunnah or actions of worship which oppose the Book and the Sunnah, then their condition has to be clarified and it is obligatory to warn the Ummah against them by agreement of the Muslims. to the extent that it was said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: “If a man fasts, prays and secludes himself in the worship of Allāh, is this more beloved to you or talking about the people of innovation?” Imām Ahmad replied: “When a person prays, fasts and secludes himself in worship then this is only for himself, yet if he speaks about the people of innovation this is for the Muslims and thus is more virtuous.” He made clear that the benefit for this is for the general Muslims in their religion and is a type of jihād in the path of Allāh wherein the path of Allāh is purified along with His religion, His Methods and His Divine Legislation (from the heresies of the innovators) and it prevents their transgression and enmity. For this reason, it is obligatory according to the consensus of the Muslims and if this was not established for Allāh to prevent the harms of those innovators then the religion would become corrupted and this harm would be much worse than the enemy during warfare gaining power. this is because when these enemies take control they do not corrupt the hearts or the religion that is within the hearts. But as for those (innovators) then they corrupt the hearts from the outset.” (Majmu al-Fataawa vol. 28 page 231-232.)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He also said (rahimahullāh) in another instance:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If an innovator is calling to his corrupted beliefs which oppose the Book and the Sunnah, and it is feared that he will misguide the people then his situation has to be explained to the people so that they are conscious of his misguidance and know about him. All of this is obligatory as a form of advice and seeking the Countenance of Allāh and not for personal desire with the people.” (Majmu al-Fataawa vol 28 page 221)</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 16">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Consider!, the IJMAA (consensus) of the salafee, past and present, in warning against the innovator and his innovation. So what about the salafee who sees no harm in the innovator and instead looks for ways of cooperating with the innovator rather than creating the distance of the east and west between him and the innovator. We do not need to go into specific occurrences concerning the dawah in the UK to exemplify this point and those who have some understanding will see what is being said here!</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(10)A Note of Clarity Concerning al-Maghrib, al-Kauthar, Current Day Institutes, Academies, Zaheer Mahmood: as-Suffa and others Who Are Unclear, Who Say “but they have some good points aswell.”</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Al-’Allāmah Shaykh Sālih al-Fawzān (hafidhahullāh) was asked, after being asked about groups {that oppose the salaf}:”O Shaykh! Shall we warn against them without mentioning their good points for example? or do we mention both their good and bad points?”</span></p>

As for mentioning their good points then the people will then say “this is what we want to take.” (Extracted from Muqaddimah an-Nasr il-’Azeez, pg.8 transmitted from the cassette of the third lesson of Kitāb ut-Tawhīd which was given by the noble Shaykh in Summer 1413 AH/1992 CE in Tā’if.)</span></em></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The above saying needs no commentary from us and is as clear as the sun for the one who wishes to see.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(11) A Great Reminder by Allaamah Bakr Abu Zayd(rahimahullāh)</strong></span></h4>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He said in his book ‘Hajr ul-Mubtadi’ (pg.48:) </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“&#8230;just as the one who speaks with falsehood is a Shaytān speaking, the one who is quiet about the truth is likewise a silent Shaytān, as Abū ’Ali ad-Diqāq (d.406 AH, rahimahullāh) stated! From the verified Sunnah is the statement of the Prophet (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam): “A person is with who he loves” and Anas (radi Allāhu ’anhu) stated: “The Muslims were not pleased with anything after Islām except this Hadīth.” The Imāms were stern on whoever contradicted the basis of belief and abandoned the innovators. Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah refuted the Ittihādiyyah saying: “All who is attached to them must be punished along with those who praise them and their books and along with those who help and assist them, or those who hate speaking about them, or those who make excuses for them by saying “This speech is unknown” and “it is not known who made these disparaging statements” and the likes of such excuses which are not uttered except by a jāhil or hypocrite! So rather, all who know their condition (of the innovators of the Ittihādiyyah) and do not help to oppose them have to be punished. This is because opposing them is from the greatest obligations because they (the Ittihādiyyah) corrupt the minds and religion of many scholars, kings, rulers and they thus strive throughout the earth causing corruption and they block people from the path to Allāh”.</span></em></p>

<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Bakr Abu Zaid (rahimahullāh) then said:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “May Allāh have mercy on Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah and bless him to drink from the Salsabīl of Paradise, Āmīn. These words are of the utmost precision and importance&#8230; so all who manifestly praise an innovator, or praise his books and distributes them among the Muslims and spread their innovation and misguidance and does not expose the deviations in belief that they have – then whoever does this is negligent and has to be abandoned so that he does not affect the Muslims. We have been tested in this era with people who praise the innovators and distribute their statements and writings and neither warn against them nor from their misguidance&#8230;.we seek refuge in Allāh from misery and its people.”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So Oh Salafee, do not be silent at all times on the innovation, confusion, corruption and evil being uttered by those around you and certainly do not open the door and let in yourself the one who will harm your dawah and its people. Have trust in Allah and be not worried on your numbers dwindling!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Remember the prophet said about people like you and us (inshallaah) that the victorious group will be “Dhaahriyeen alal haqq”, that is OPEN AND APPPARENT upon the truth (Nasa’ee no.2229), so do not be shy, afraid or even embarrassed of saying that you are Salafee and that you oppose al that which opposes salafiyyah!.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah Guide Us All. Ameen</span></p>
