				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In this article, we shall be discussing with evidences which all celebrations that are reoccurring (whether yearly, monthly or weekly) are allowed for us Muslims to engage in and celebrate thereby.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||Meaning of &#8216;Eid||</strong><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Al-Azhari (D. 370) said in Tahdhīb al-Lughah (3/84):<br />
<strong> “And ‘eid for the ‘Arabs means: the time wherein happiness and sadness is (frequently) returned”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">al-Nawawī (D. 676) said in Al-Majmū’ (5/2):<br />
<strong> “’Eid is from ‘Awd which means to return as it repeats”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ibn Manẓūr (D. 711) said in Lisān al-’Arab (3/319):<br />
<strong> “Any day where there is a (repetitive) gathering”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ibn Taymiyyah (D. 728) said in Iqtiḍā al-Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqīm (1/496):<br />
<strong> “’Eid is a name for what repeats with a general gathering and repetition”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">al-Fīrūzabādī (D. 817) said in Al-Muḥīṭ (p. 302):<br />
<strong> “what repeats from distress, sickness or sadness etc. Or a day where people gather”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">And other scholars whose mentioning would prolong the article</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||Number of ‘Eid in Islam||</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ibn Ḥazm (D. 456) said in al-Muḥallā (3/293):<br />
<strong> “They are ‘Eid al-Fiṭr of Ramadan which is the first day of Shawwāl and the day of (‘Eid) al-Aḍḥā which is the tenth day of Dhul Ḥijjah. There is no ‘Eid for the Muslims apart from them except Friday and the three days (tashrīq) after the day of al-Aḍḥā as Allah Ta’ala has not made for them an ‘Eid other than what we mentioned, nor His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and there is no dispute between the people of Islam over that”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">We know that Ijmā’ (consensus) is one of the proofs of our religion, perhaps I may write an article on that too if Allah allows</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>(1) ‘Eid al-Fiṭr and ‘Eid al-</strong><strong>Aḍḥā </strong><br />
<strong> Narrated &#8216;Āishah رضي الله عنها that once Abu Bakr entered upon her on the day of &#8216;Eid al-Fiṭr or &#8216;Eid al-Aḍḥā while the Prophet (يصلى الله عليه وسلم) was present and there were two girl singers with her, singing songs of the Ansar about the day of Bu&#8217;āth. So Abu Bakr said twice: &#8220;Musical instrument of Satan!&#8221; But the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, &#8220;Leave them Abu Bakr, For every nation has an &#8216;Eid and this day is our &#8216;Eid.&#8221; </strong>[al-Bukhāri 3931 &amp; Muslim 892]
<p style="text-align: left">Anas رضي الله عنه reported:<br />
<strong> Allah&#8217;s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم arrived in Medina during two days in which they were celebrating. The Prophet said, “What are these two days?” They said, “We would celebrate these two days in the time of Jāhiliyyah (before Islam)” The Prophet said, “Verily, Allah has replaced these two days with two better days: Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr.”</strong> [Abu Dawud 1134 &amp; Nasai 1556 both with Sahih isnad]
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin al-&#8216;Āaṣ رضي الله عنهما said that Allah&#8217;s messenger said to a man:</strong><br />
<strong> “I have been instructed to take the day of al-Aḍḥā as an &#8216;Eid which Allah, &#8216;Azza wa Jall, has ordained for this Ummah.”</strong> [al-Nasai 4365 &amp; Abu Dawud 2789 with Hasan Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>(2) Friday</strong><br />
Ibn Khuzaymah (D. 311) named a chapter in his Sahih:<br />
<strong> “The evidence that Friday is an ‘Eid”</strong> (before hadith 2161)</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Ibn Abbas رضي الله عنهما recited: “&#8217;This day, I perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and chose for you Islam as your religion&#8217; [5:3] and a Jew was with him who said: ‘If this Ayah was revealed to us then we would have taken that day as a day of celebration.’ So Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: “Indeed it was revealed on two &#8216;Eids: On Friday, and on the Day of &#8216;Arafah.” </strong>[al-Tirmidhi 3044 with Sahih Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>(3) Days of Tashrīq (the three days after ‘Eid al-Aḍḥā)</strong><br />
<strong> Narrated Uqbah bin &#8216;Amir رضي الله عنه that Allah&#8217;s messenger said:</strong><br />
<strong> &#8220;The day of &#8216;Arafat and the day of sacrifice and the day of At-Tashriq are our ‘Eid, the people of Islam, and they are days of eating and drinking.&#8221;</strong> [al-Nasai 3007, al-Tirmidhi 773, Abu Dawud 2419 all with Hasan Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left">Note: Just because they are named as &#8216;Eid does not mean all the rulings of the two &#8216;Eid also apply</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||It is not allowed to engage in any other festival||</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Allah said: <strong>&#8220;<span id="verse_2662_language_6_content">For every religion We have appointed rites which they perform.</span>&#8220;</strong> [al-Hajj 22:67]
<p style="text-align: left">Thābit bin  al-Ḍaḥḥāk رضي الله عنه reported:<br />
<strong> A man in the time of the Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه وسلم made a vow to sacrifice a camel at a placed called Buwanah. He came to the Prophet and he said, “I have made a vow to sacrifice a camel at Buwanah.” The Prophet said, “Were there any idols worshipped there in the time of ignorance?” They said no. The Prophet said, “Were any of their idolatrous festivals celebrated there?” They said no. The Prophet said, “Fulfill your vow, for a vow in disobedience to Allah must not be fulfilled, nor a vow over which the son of Adam has not control.”</strong> [Abu Dawud 3313 with Sahih Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left">We know the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم does not ask a question without any reason, this shows that sacrificing at a place where festivals of the disbelievers are held is a preventive factor, even if the intentions are pure, for we do not engage in what the non-Muslims do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ibnul Qayyim (D. 751) said in Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah (2/246):<br />
<strong> “And indeed Allah Subhanah has named their festivals (the mushrikeen) as falsehood and falsehood is not allowed to be attended. Allah said: ‘And those who do not witness falsehood, and when they pass by ill speech, they pass by with dignity’”</strong> [25:72]
<p style="text-align: left">And he said in the next page:<br />
<strong> “It is impermissible for the Muslims to attend the festivals of the mushrikeen or help them upon it, according to the consensus of the scholars whose words carry weight. The fuqaha’ who follow the four schools of thought have stated this clearly in their books”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Al-Khallal (D. 311) named a chapter in Ahkam ahl al-milal (before no. 126):<br />
<strong>“impermissibility of Muslims to go out on the festivals of mushrikeen”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">al-Bayhaqi (D. 458) named a chapter in his sunan al-Kubra (9/234):<br />
<strong>“impermissibility of Muslims entering on ahl al-Dhimmah in their churches and imitating them on their Nawruz and Mihrajaan”</strong> (these are two festivals of the Persians)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||Any other festival is either imitating them or an innovation||</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Allah said: “And for every nation We have appointed religious ceremonies”</strong> [al-Hajj 22:34]
<p style="text-align: left">Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said:<strong><br />
“Whoever imitates a people is one of them.”</strong> [Abu Dawud 4031; Hasan]
<p style="text-align: left">‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas رضي الله عنهما reported:<br />
<strong> “Whoever lives in the land of non-Arabs and engages in their Nawruz (persian new year) and Mahrajan (persian festival) and imitates them until he dies upon that, he will be resurrected with them on the day of judgement”</strong> [al-Sunan al-Kubra li al-Bayhaqi 18896 with Hasan Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left">The history of the festivals other than the ones permitted in Islam either go back to the disbelievers or due to an innovation which the Muslims performed without the Salaf preceding them. We shall present some examples.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Birthdays:</strong><br />
<strong>&#8220;The highest of all holidays in the Satanic religion is the date of one&#8217;s own birth&#8221;</strong> [Satanic Bible, ch. Religious holidays, p.53]
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Independence day:<br />
</strong><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10008" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/independance.png?resize=300%2C164" alt="independance" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/independance.png?resize=300%2C164 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/independance.png?w=613 613w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
<strong>&#8220;I am apt to believe that it (decleration of independance) will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.&#8221;</strong> [Letter from John Adams to Abigail Adams, 3 July 1776, p. 3]
<p style="text-align: left">The Prophet’s birthday يصلى الله عليه وسلم:<br />
<strong> It was started by the Fatimites, A sect from the Shi’ah</strong> [see al-Mawa’idh wal I’tibar (2/436) by Taqi al-Din al-Maqrizi (D. 845)]
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||Conclusion||</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">As a Muslim, we should be steadfast according to what our creator has commanded with, as He said:<br />
<strong> “So remain steadfast as you are commanded”</strong> [11:112].</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Do not look at what the people do as Allah said:<br />
<strong> “And if you obey majority of those on earth, they will mislead you from the way of Allah”</strong> [6:116]
<p style="text-align: left">and do not be surprised by their numbers for you have a great reward. Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said:<strong>“Islam initiated as something strange, and it would revert to being strange. so good tidings for the stranger.”</strong> [Muslim 145]
<p style="text-align: left">and he said:<br />
<strong> “The nations were shown to me and one or two Prophets would pass by me with a group (of followers), and a Prophet who had no one with him…”</strong> [al-Bukhari 5705, Muslim 220]
<p style="text-align: left">Remember that Islam is a complete guideline of one&#8217;s life, we must implement Islam even when it comes to celebrating. Allah said: <strong>“Enter into Islam completely”</strong> [2:208]
<p style="text-align: left">Therefore my beloved brother/sister, leave these celebrations for Allah’s sake, He will reward you with something better. Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said:<br />
<strong> “Verily, you will never leave anything for the sake of Allah Almighty but that Allah will replace it with something better for you.”</strong> [Musnad Ahmad 23074 with Sahih Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left">Do not worry about others being displeased with you if Allah is pleased with you. Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“Whoever pleases Allah with the displeasure of the people, Allah will suffice him. And whoever displeases Allah with the pleasure, Allah leaves him to the people”</strong> [al-Ihsan fi taqrib Sahih Ibn Hibban 277 with Sahih Isnad]

<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><em><strong>Muhadith Zubair Ali Zai</strong></em></span></h4>

<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">For The Qurbani 10 People Can Have A Share In The Sacrifice Of A Camel And 7 People Can Have A Share In The Sacrifice Of A Cow</span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center"></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[106] From Malik from Abu az-Zubair from Jabir Ibn Abdullah as-Sulami (Radi Allahu Anhu) that he said,&#8221;In the year of Hudaibiya (6 AH), we, along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam), sacrificed a camel for seven persons and a cow for seven persons (as a Qurbani).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [MUSLIM]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/486 hadith no.1068, book 23, chapter 5, hadith no.9), at-Tamhid (12/147), and he said,&#8221;This hadith is <em>[Sahih]</em> authentic according to the people of knowledge.&#8221; and al-Istidhkar (no.1002) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Muslim (350/1318) from the hadith of Malik and Abu az-Zubair clarified hearing this hadith from Jabir Ibn Abdullah as-Sulami (Radi Allahu Anhu) in Ahmad (3/378 hadith no.15043) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Seven people can share the sacrifice of a cow or camel. According to another hadith ten people can share in the sacrifice of a camel. (See Sunan at-Tirmidhi no.1501, and its chain is <em>[Hasan]</em> good, Sunan an-Nasa&#8217;i no.4397, Sunan Ibn Maja no.3131)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) The year of Hudaibiya is the 6th year of Hijri. See at-Tamhid (12/147)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) The scholars have a difference of opinion in regards to when a dhimmi (non-muslim who lives in a Muslim country and pays the jizyah) has one part of the sacrifice. Some say it is allowed and some say it is not allowed. The most correct view is to not include the dhimmi to have a share in the sacrifice.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) If there is a person of bid&#8217;ah who is included in the sacrifice and their bid&#8217;ah does not reach the level of kufr then that sacrifice is allowed. However it is better to only include those who have the correct aqidah in the sacrifice and not to include any person of bidah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) All the sacrifice can also be done from one person.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) If there are only six people who share a part each in the sacrifice of a cow or camel then one of them individuals should take two parts (T.N. as opposed to one so that it becomes a seven part sacrifice). The seventh part should not be distributed among all the six participants because there is no evidence to do this.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) If a person can not go to the scared sanctuary (T.N. Makkah) due to a Sharia compliant excuse then it is allowed to sacrifice on behalf of him which is external to the sacred sanctuary. However it is better for him to carry out the sacrifice in the boundary of the sacred sanctuary. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) Sacrificing one goat on behalf of one household is enough. See Sunan at-Tirmidhi (no.1505, and its chain is <em>[Hasan]</em> good and he said, &#8220;<em>[Hasan Sahih]</em>&#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Abu Ayub al-Ansari (Radi Allahu Anhu) said that we used to sacrifice one goat on behalf of the whole household. (al-Muwatta 2/486 hadith no.1069, and its chain is <em>[Sahih]</em> authentic, and Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi 9/268)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">By performing qiyas on the above, having one share in the sacrifice of a cow from the whole household is enough. Allah knows best. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">9) Performing sacrifice anytime other than during Hajj is a Sunnah and it is not obligatory. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">See al-Muwatta (2/487, Malik said,&#8221;The sacrifice is Sunnah, and it is not obligatory. I prefer that anyone who has the price of the animal should not abandon it.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">10) There is an Ijma that the ruling of a Buffalo is the same as a cow because the Buffalo is a type of cow. See the book of Ijma of Ibn al-Mundhir (no.91). However from other evidences and as a precautionary measure it is better to not have it as a sacrificial animal. And Allah knows best.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[98] From Malik from Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Haban from al-&#8216;Araj from Abu Hurairah (Radi Allahu Anhu) that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) forbade fasting on two days, the day of Eid al-Fitr and the day of Eid al-Adha.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [MUSLIM]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/300 hadith no.674, book 18, chapter 12, hadith no.36, 1/376, hadith no.756, book 20, chapter 44 hadith no.136), at-Tamhid (13/26), al-Istidhkar: (no.624)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Muslim (no.1138) from the hadith of Malik</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) It is haram to fast on the day of Eid al-Fitr or Eid al-Adha on purpose (whilst knowing with certainty that the moon of Shawal has been sighted).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) If someone makes a vow to fast on the day of Eid then this vow is false.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) Some scholars derive and understand from this hadith that it is allowed to fast all the time on the condition that you don&#8217;t fast on the prohibited days. See al-Muwatta (Yahya&#8217;s narration 1/300)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) It is better to avoid fasting all the time and the most one should fast is the way Dawud (Alayhisalam) fasted. i.e. one day fast and one day not fast, this is the most virtuous method. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) Those narrations which mention that it is prohibited to fast all the time is understood to mean disliked (which doesn&#8217;t reach to the level of haram i.e. it is makru tanzihi and not makru tahrimi), excluding the days of Eid which are prohibited.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) Also see hadith no.73</span></p>
