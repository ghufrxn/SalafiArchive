				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Fawakah al-Adhab Fi Radd A’la Man Lam Yahkam al-Sunnah wa’l Kitab</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ahmad bin Nasir bin Uthman al-Mu’amari al-Najdi [1225H]</span></strong></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(From the students and disciples of Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab [1206H])</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mushrikin would worship the righteous people and ask them for their needs, believing they were intermediateries and intercessors. Allah the Mighty also warned and reprimanded them from this type of calling and informed them those they call upon cannot help them alleviate their sorrow nor change anything. Therefore every individual who calls upon the Prophets, the righteous, the dead, the angels or the Jinn does so in order to seek help and they ask such entities that are unable to help. They are unable to remove or change their difficulties and calamities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The norm of the mushriks today is that when a calamity or hardship befalls them, they call upon their Shaikhs and saints (Pirs). They continuously cry and call their names and humble themselves whilst submitting themselves in a dire state of need. They feel ease and tranquillity by calling on the names of the Shaikhs and saints and they do this at times of hardship but also generally on a daily basis and they feel ease and peace in this just as a child feels ease and peace when they hear their mothers name or voice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Strangely when they say Oh Ibn Abbas or mention the name of any other righteous person they will never say anything in vain or lie without fearing Allah and when they mention the name of their righteous individuals and saints they will never lie because they think it will harm them or put them into difficulty and hardship and therefore they fear the creation more than the creator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[he goes onto say]&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Obeying and following the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam is mandatory in every affair and by the grace and blessings of Allah, we follow and obey the commands of the Messenger of Allah Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam the most. Whatever he informed us; we follow and affirm more than our hearts and lives and thus obey his commands and rulings. We also follow and obey the rules and regulations he was sent with and we adopt the principles he came with.</span></p>
