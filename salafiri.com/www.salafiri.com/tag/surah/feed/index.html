				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from Fatawa &#8216;Ilmiyyah (1/493-497)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Question:</strong> The Tahqiq (research) regarding the following narration is desired: &#8220;The person that recites Surah Ya-Sin every morning will have all the needs of his day fulfilled.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Answer:</strong> This narration is present in the Sunan of Ad-Darimi <em>(2/457 #3421)</em> with the following chain of narration: <strong>&#8220;&#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah (Tabi&#8217;i) said: It has reached me that the Messenger of Allah </strong>ﷺ <strong>said&#8230;&#8221;<em> &#8211; </em></strong>and the author of Mishkat [Al-Masabih] <em>(#2177)</em> narrated it from Ad-Darimi. This narration is weak on account of it being Mursal¹, and the person that informed [&#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah] is unknown. The following Marfu&#8217;² narrations pertaining to the virtues of Surah Ya-Sin are also weak and rejected:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify">
<li style="text-align: left"><strong>&#8220;Verily everything has a heart, and the heart of the Qur&#8217;an is Ya-Sin, and whomsoever recites Ya-Sin, Allah will write for him [the reward of] the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an ten times.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Jami&#8217; At-Tirmidhi #2887 from the Hadith of Qatadah from Anas [may Allah be pleased with him], Tablighi Nisab p.292, Fadha&#8217;il Al-Qur&#8217;an p.58)</em></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam At-Tirmidhi said regarding one of the narrators [of this Hadith], <strong>&#8220;Harun Abu Muhammad is an unknown Shaykh.&#8221; </strong>Due to Harun being unknown, this narration is weak &#8211; Shaykh Al-Albani declared it to be Mawdu&#8217; (Fabricated). <em>(Silsilah Ahadith Ad-Da&#8217;ifa 1/202 #169)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu Hatim Ar-Razi claimed that the narrator of this Hadith [in reality] is Muqatil bin Sulayman, who is a liar <em>(&#8216;Ilal Al-Hadith 2/56 #1652).</em> Whereas in the Sunan of At-Tirmidhi, Sunan of Ad-Darimi (2/456 #3419), and Tarikh Baghdad (4/267), the narrator is Muqatil bin Hayyan, who is truthful &#8211; and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">2. In this same chapter, regarding the [same Hadith] narrated on the authority of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him), Imam At-Tirmidhi wrote, <strong>&#8220;And it is no more authentic than the previous chain of narration, and its chain of narration is weak.&#8221; </strong><em>(Jami&#8217; At-Tirmidhi #2887)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">3. <strong>&#8220;Verily everything has a heart, and the heart of the Qur&#8217;an is Ya-Sin.&#8221; </strong><em>(Kashf Al-Astar &#8216;an Zawa&#8217;id Al-Bazzar 3/87 #2304 from the Hadith of &#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Al-Albani wrote regarding this Hadith, <strong>&#8220;&#8230;and this Humayd (narrator) is unknown, just as Al-Hafidh said in Al-Taqrib, and I do not know &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Fadhl, the Shaykh of Al-Bazzar.&#8221;</strong><em> </em><em>(Silsilah Ahadith Ad-Da&#8217;ifa 1/204)</em> &#8211; Meaning this narrator Humayd Al-Makki, Mawla of Aal &#8216;Alqamah <em>(Tafsir Ibn Kathir 3/570) </em>is unknown just as Hafidh Ibn Hajr said in Taqrib Al-Tadhib, and that he does not know the teacher of Al-Bazzar: &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Fadhl. It is now understood that this narration is weak on account of two narrators being unknown.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">4. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night will be forgiven in the morning.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Musnad Abi Ya&#8217;la 11/93,94 #4324, and other than him from the path of Hisham bin Ziyad from Al-Hasan [Al-Basri] who said: I heard Abu Hurayrah&#8230;)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration is severely weak, Hisham bin Ziyad is an abandoned narrator. <em>(Al-Taqrib p.364 #7292)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">5. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night, seeking the Face of Allah, he will be forgiven in that night.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan Ad-Darimi #3420, and other than him)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration is weak on account of a disconnection, it is not established that Al-Hasan Al-Basri ever met Abu Hurayrah. Additionally, [Al-Hasan] was a Mudallis, and he is narrating with &#8216;An.³</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">6.  <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night, seeking the Face of Allah, will be forgiven.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Ibn Hibban, Marawid Adh-Dhaman #665, and other than him from Al-Hasan Al-Basri from Jundub)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration if weak on account of a disconnection, Abu Hatim Ar-Razi said, <strong>&#8220;It is not correct that Al-Hasan heard from Jundub.&#8221; </strong><em>(Al-Marasil p. 42)</em>, Also see the previous Hadith.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">7. <strong> &#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night, seeking the Face of Allah (Most High), will be forgiven for what has preceded from his sins, so recite it over your dead.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Bayhaqi in Shu&#8217;b Al-Iman #2458, from the Hadith of Ma&#8217;qil bin Yasar)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration is weak on account of an unknown narrator: Abu &#8216;Uthman and his father, who is also unknown. This Hadith is present in a shortened form in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad <em>(5/26,27)</em>, Mustadarak of Al-Hakim <em>(1/565)</em>, Sahih Ibn Hibban <em>(Al-Ihsan 7/269 #2991</em><em>)</em>, Sunan Abi Dawud <em>(#3121)</em> and Sunan Ibn Majah <em>(#1448)</em>, and Imam Ad-Daraqutni declared this Hadith to be weak. It has one weak supporting Hadith in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad <em>(4/105)</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">8.  &#8220;<strong>Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night will be forgiven in the morning.&#8221; </strong><em>(Hilyat Al-Awliya 4/130 form the Hadith of &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud, may Allah be pleased with him.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is considered fabricated due to the narrator &#8216;Abu Maryam &#8216;Abdul-Ghaffar bin Al-Qasim Al-Kufi&#8217;, who is a liar and a fabricator. <em>(Lisan Al-Mizan 4/50,51)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">9. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin will have the equivalent of twenty Hajj&#8217;s, and whosoever writes it then drinks it will have one thousand certainties and one thousand mercies enter his heart, and will have rancour and disease removed from it.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Hilyat Al-Awliya 7/136 from the Hadith of Al-Harith Al-A&#8217;war from &#8216;Ali)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is severely weak due to Al-Harith Al-A&#8217;war and the Tadlis of Abu Ishaq.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">10. <strong>&#8220;I wish that it were in the heart of every person from my Ummah (meaning Ya-Sin).&#8221;</strong> <em>(Kashf Al-Astar 3/87 #2305 from the Hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbas)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The narrator of this Hadith, Ibrahim bin Al-Hakim bin Aban, is weak. <em>(At-Taqrib #166)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">11. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Surah Ya-Sin whilst he is experiencing the agonies of death, or he is close to it, the Treasurer of Paradise will come to him with a drink from the drinks of Paradise, and he will give it to him to drink whilst he is on his bed, so he will drink it then die, and he will not be in need of a Basin (Hawdh) from the Basins of the Prophets.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Wasit of Al-Wahidi 3/509)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is fabricated &#8211; Yusuf bin &#8216;Atiyyah is an abandoned narrator <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #7872) </em>and Harun bin Kathir is unknown <em>(Lisan Al-Mizan 6/218)</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">12. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin, then it is as if he recited the [entire] Qur&#8217;an ten times.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is Mursal due to Hayyan b. &#8216;Atiyyah.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">13. <strong>&#8220;Surah Ya-Sin is called Al-Muni&#8217;mah in the Torah [&#8230;].&#8221;<em> </em></strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">(</span>Shu&#8217;b Al-Iman of Al-Bayhaqi #2465, Ad-Du&#8217;afa of Al-&#8216;Uqayli 1/347, Tablighi Nisab p.292,293, Fadha&#8217;il Al-Qur&#8217;an p.58, 59)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is Mawdu&#8217; (Fabricated), [the narrator] &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr Al-Jad is abandoned in Hadith, and another narrator is unknown. Imam Bayhaqi said regarding this Hadith, <strong>&#8220;It is rejected.&#8221;<em> </em></strong>Imam Al-&#8216;Uqayli also rejected this narration. This Hadith also comes through a second chain of narration in Tarikh Baghdad and in Al-Mawdu&#8217;at of Ibn Al-Jawzi, the narrator [in this chain], Muhammad bin Abd bin &#8216;Amir As-Samarqandi, is a liar and abandoned.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">14. <strong>&#8220;Verily I have made the recitation of Ya-Sin every night obligatory upon my Ummah, so whomsoever persists upon its recitation every night, then dies, will die the death of a Martyr.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Imam Ash-Shajri 1/118)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is fabricated, not a single one of its narrators is known, for example &#8216;Umar bin Sa&#8217;d Al-Waqas, Abu Hafs bin &#8216;Umar bin Hafs and Abu &#8216;Amir bin Abdur-Rahim. To summarise &#8211; every Marfu&#8217; narration on the virtues of Surah Ya-Sin is weak and rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Ad-Darimi, may Allah have mercy upon him, narrated: <strong>&#8220;&#8216;Amr bin Zurarah narrated to me: &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab narrated to me: Rashid Abu Muhammad Al-Hamani narrated to me from Shahr bin Hawshab who said: &#8216;Ibn Abbas said, &#8216;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the morning will be given an easy day until the evening, and whomsoever recites it in the middle of the night will be given an easy night until the morning.'&#8221; </strong><em>(Sunan Ad-Darimi 1/257 #3422, and its chain is Hasan</em><em>)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">A summarised biography of these narrators is as follows:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>&#8216;Umar bin Zurarah: Trustworthy. <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #5032)</em></li>
<li>&#8216;Abdul-Wahhab Ath-Thaqafi: Trustworthy, used to change (i.e., mix up Hadith) before his death for 3 years, however, this does not harm his Hadiths as he did not narrate Hadith in this period of time. <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #4261)</em></li>
<li>Rashid bin Nujayh Al-Hamani: Truthful and perhaps he made mistakes. <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #1857) &#8211; </em>He was a Hasan Al-Hadith narrator.</li>
<li>Shahr bin Hawshab: The [Scholars of Hadith] differed on him as a narrator, the majority of the Muhaddithin declared him trustworthy. <em>(As I have researched in my book: Takhrij An-Nihayah fi&#8217;l-Fitan w&#8217;al-Malahim p.119,120) &#8211; </em>Hafidh Ibn Kathir declared one of his narrations to be &#8216;Hasan&#8217;. <em>(Musnad Al-Faruq 1/228) </em>In my research, this narrator is Hasan Al-Hadith.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">The summary of this research is that this chain of narration is Hasan, and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> A Mursal narration is that which is narrated by a Tabi&#8217;i (student of a Sahabi) from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ without mentioning who he had taken it from, Shaykh Zubayr &#8216;Aliza&#8217;i said, <strong>&#8220;The position of the majority of the Scholars of Hadith is that the Mursal narration of a Tabi&#8217;i is rejected.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Fatawa &#8216;Ilmiyyah 2/290)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:] </strong>Hafidh Ibn Kathir wrote regarding Marfu&#8217;, <strong>&#8220;That which is attributed to the Prophet ﷺ, whether it is speech or action&#8230;&#8221; </strong><em>(Ikhtisar &#8216;Ulum Al-Hadith with the annotations of Shaykh Zubayr &#8216;Aliza&#8217;i p.33)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">³ <strong>[TN:]</strong>  <span class="fontstyle0">Tadlis: </span><span class="fontstyle2">Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i wrote, </span><strong><span class="fontstyle0">“If a narrator transmits a narration from his Shaykh (with whom it is established that he met and heard from) using terms such as ‘An </span></strong><span class="fontstyle0">([ </span><span class="fontstyle3">عن </span><span class="fontstyle0">from], this is an ambiguous form of narrating in Arabic which can imply that one </span><span class="fontstyle0">heard it directly or indirectly from someone else)</span><strong><span class="fontstyle0"> while he heard that narration from someone else (other than his Shaykh) – and those whom he narrates this to think that is likely that he heard it from his Shaykh, then this is known as ‘Tadlis’.” </span></strong><span class="fontstyle2">– see the Maqalat of Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i, Volume 1, Page 252. In summary, Tadlis is a hidden weakness in a chain of narration caused by a narrator concealing whom he had actually heard the narration from by using ambiguous terms such as ‘An (عن).</span><span class="fontstyle4"> </span><span class="fontstyle2">Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i explains, </span><strong><span class="fontstyle0">“It is a famous and well-known issue in the Principles of Hadith (i.e., Hadith Sciences) that the narrations of the Mudallis (a narrator that practises Tadlis) that narrates by ‘An ( )</span><span class="fontstyle3">عن</span></strong><span class="fontstyle0"><strong>is rejected and not a proof, meaning it is weak.”</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle2">He further quoted from Imam Ash-Shafi’i who wrote, </span><strong><span class="fontstyle0">“So we say: We do not accept a Hadith from a Mudallis until he says ‘Hadathani (So-and-so narrated to me)’ or ‘Sami’tu (I heard directly, i.e., an explicit term used for transmitting directly)’.” </span></strong><span class="fontstyle2">[Ar-Risalah with the Tahqiq of Ahmad Shakir #1035] – see the Maqalat of Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i, Volume 4, Page 151.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) It is established (that the Prophet Sallalaahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) recited Surah at Tur and Surah Mursalat in the Magrib prayer. See hadith no.49</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) It is narrated from Abu Abdullah as-Suna Nakhi that, “I came to Madinah during the time of Abu Bakr’s Caliphate and I prayed the Magrib behind him. He recited Surah Fatihah and the short mufasil (detailed) Surahs in the first two rak’ats then in the third rak’at he recited Surah Fatihha and one ayah, “Our Rabb, let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us and grant us from Yourself mercy. Indeed, You are the Bestower.” (al-Muwatta 1/79 hadith no.170, and its chain is authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From this truthful’s athar there are two issues that are known: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">First: Surah Fatihah should be prayed in every rak’ah therefore those who say “if nothing is recited in the last two rak’ahs then the salah is valid” then this saying is false.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Two: Apart from reciting Surah Fatihah it is allowed to recite from the Quran in the third (or fourth) rak’ah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) A summary of Ibn Umar’s athar is that (in the prayers that have four rak’ah) in the four rak’ahs he prayed Surah Fatihah and one Surah and sometimes he prayed two or three Surahs in one rak’a. (see al-Muwatta 1/79 hadith no.171, and its chain is authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) In some chains of this narration when Jubayr Ibn Mut’im heard the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) recite Surah Tur in Maghrib prayer then at that time he wasn’t a muslim. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From this the scholars have been able to extract the issue that if a non muslim becomes a muslim then he can say narrations whilst he is a muslim and they will be accepted on the condition that this narrator is trustworthy during his time in Islam. (whilst he is a muslim).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) This is also a refutation of those who say that the time for Maghrib Salah is very small and only small Surahs can be recited. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>

<h4 class="entry-title" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated by Abu Rumaysah</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</header>
<div class="entry-content">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Surah al-Fatihah</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">1) With the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">2) All the praises and thanks are for Allah the Lord of the Universe. </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">3) The Most Beneficent, The Most Merciful. </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">4) Master of the Day of Recompense. </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">5) You Alone we worship, and You Alone we ask for help. </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">6) Guide us to the Straight Path. </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">7) The Path of those on whom You have bestowed your grace, not the Path of those who earned your Anger, nor of those that went astray.</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span class="quran">“ALL THE PRAISES AND THANKS ARE FOR ALLAH”</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no mention here as to when this praise is said or from where this praise comes from, but in <em>Surah Rum</em> there is mention that from amongst the ‘where’s’ are the heavens and the earth – in His saying, <span class="quran">” … and His is all the praises and thanks in the heavens and the earth.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 30:18] And in <em>Surah Qasas</em> there is mention that from amongst the ‘when’s’ are in this world and in the Hereafter – in His sayings:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“And He is Allah, none has the right to be worshipped besides Him. To Him belongs all praise in the beginning (i.e. this world) and in the end (i.e.the Hereafter).”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 28:70]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And He said in the beginning of <em>Surah Sab’a</em>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“His is all the praise in the Hereafter, and He is the All-Wise, All-Aware.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 34:1]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The <em>Alif</em> and <em>Lam</em> (i.e. the definite article ‘the’) in <em>al-hamd</em> is so as to include all the different manners of praise, and it is an extolling with which Allah has praised Himself and ordered His servants to praise Him with.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span class="quran">“THE LORD OF THE UNIVERSE (<em>ALAMIN</em>)”</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no explanation here as to what <em>al-alamin</em> is but this is explained in another place with His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“Pharaoh said: and what is the Lord of the <em>Alamin</em>? He (Moses) said: the Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 26:23-24]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the scholars stated that <em>al-alam</em> (world, pl. <em>alamin</em>) is derived from <em>Al-Allamah</em> (sign) because the existence of the world is a sign, without doubt, of the existence of it’s Creator who is described with perfect and magnificent Attributes. The Exalted said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">“Indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the change of the night and day are signs (<em>ayat</em>) for the people of understanding.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in the language <em>ayah</em> means <em>allamah</em>.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span class="quran">“THE MOST BENEFICENT (<em>AR-RAHMAN</em>), THE MOST MERCIFUL (<em>AR-RAHIM</em>)”</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These are two descriptions of Allah, <em>the Exalted</em>, and two of the Names from amongst His Beautiful Names, derived from <em>ar-rahma</em>(mercy) in a way to express intense and exaggerated meanings. And <em>Ar-Rahman</em> is more intense than <em>Ar-Rahim</em> because <em>Ar-Rahman</em> is the one endowed with Mercy which extends to all of the creations in this world and to the believers in the Hereafter, and <em>Ar-Rahim</em> is the One endowed with Mercy which extends to only the believers on the Day of Judgement – this being the understanding of the majority of the scholars. And from the discussion of Ibn Jarir (at-Tabari) one can understand that there is an agreement on this, and the <em>tafsir</em> of some of the <em>salaf</em> lends weight to this understanding as was stated by Ibn Kathir, and the narration reported from Isa, as mentioned by Ibn Kathir and others, also indicates this – that he (<em>upon him and our Prophet be peace and blessings</em>) said, <span class="hadith">“Ar-Rahman: the One Who shows Mercy in this world and the Hereafter. Ar-Rahim: the One Who shows Mercy in the Hereafter.”</span> <span id="qtip0" class="toggle">1</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah, <em>the Exalted</em>, also points to what we have mentioned when He said, <strong><span class="quran">“Then He rose over the Throne, <em>Ar-Rahman</em>“</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em>25:59] and when He said, <span class="quran">“<em>Ar-Rahman</em> rose over the Throne”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em>20:5]</strong>. So he mentioned the <em>Istawa</em> (rising over the Throne) with His Name <em>Ar-Rahman</em> so as to embrace the whole of His creation with his Mercy as was stated by Ibn Kathir.<span id="qtip1" class="toggle">2</span> And likewise is His saying, <strong><span class="quran">“Do they not see the birds above them, spreading out their wings and folding them in? None upholds them except ar-Rahman”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 67:19]</strong> meaning: from his Mercy to His creation is his kindness to the birds and His holding them in the sky while they are spreading out their wings and folding them in. And from the clearest evidences pertaining to this is His saying, <strong><span class="quran">“<em>Ar-Rahman</em>. He taught the <em>Qur’an</em> … So which of the favours of your Lord will you two deny?”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 55:1-13]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And He said, <strong><span class="quran">” … and He is Ever Most Merciful (<em>Rahim</em>) to the believers”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 33:43]</strong> and hence particularised His name <em>Ar-Rahim</em> to them. So if it said: “How is it possible to reconcile what you have thus far established with his (<em>peace be upon him</em>) saying in the<em>du’a</em>, <span class="hadith">‘The Rahman of the world and the Hereafter and the Rahim of them’</span>?”<span id="qtip2" class="toggle">3</span> The obvious reply – <em>and Allah knows best</em> – is that <em>Ar-Rahim</em> is specific to the believers as we have mentioned, but it is not specified to them in the Hereafter alone, rather His Mercy to them is included in this world as well. So the meaning of <span class="hadith">“the Rahim of them”</span> would be ‘His Mercy to the believers in them’. And the evidence that He is <em>Rahim</em> to the believers in this world as well (as the Hereafter) is that this is the literal meaning of His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“He is the One who sends His Blessings (<em>salah</em>) upon you, and His Angels so as to lead you out of the darkness to the light, and He is Ever Most Merciful (<em>Rahim</em>) to the believers.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 33:43]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Because His <em>salah</em> upon them, the <em>salah</em> of His Angels and His leading them out of the darkness to the light is Mercy to them in this world, even though it be the reason for Mercy in the Hereafter as well. And similar to this in meaning is His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the <em>Muhajirun</em> and the <em>Ansar</em> who followed him in the time of distress after the hearts of a group of them had nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance. Certainly He is full of kindness to them, Most Merciful (<em>Rahim</em>).”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 9:117]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For the Mercy is linked to the event that befell the Prophet, the <em>Muhajirun</em> and the <em>Ansar</em>, and also His forgiving them was Mercy in this world even though it be the reason for Mercy in the Hereafter as well. And the Knowledge (of what is correct) lies with Allah.</span></p>
<h4 class="quran" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“MASTER OF THE DAY OF RECOMPENSE (<em>DIN</em>)”</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no explanation here (as to what the Day of <em>Din</em> is), but this is explained in His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“And what will make you comprehend what the Day of <em>Din</em> is? Again what will make you comprehend what the Day of <em>Din</em>is? It is the Day when no person shall have power (to do) anything for another.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 83:17-19]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the meaning of <em>Din</em> in the verse is recompense, as can be seen in His saying, <strong><span class="quran">“on that Day Allah will pay them their <em>din</em> in truth”</span>[<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 24:25]</strong> meaning: the recompense of their actions with complete justice.</span></p>
<h4 class="quran" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“YOU ALONE WE WORSHIP”</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Indicating in this noble verse to the realisation of the meaning of <em>la ilaha illallah</em> (there is none worthy of worship except for Allah) for it’s meaning is comprised of two matters: negation and affirmation. So the negation aspect means to remove every single object of worship apart from Allah in all the actions of worship, and the affirmation aspect means to single out the Lord of the heavens and the earth Alone for all matters of worship in the way that has been legislated by the <em>Shari’ah</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This negation in the <em>la ilaha illallah</em> was indicated by placing the object of worship first in the verse hence, <span class="quran">‘You Alone’</span>, and it is established in ‘<em>Al-Usul</em>‘ under the discussion on ‘<em>Dalil al-Khitab Alladhi Huwa Mafhum al-Mukhalafa</em>‘, and in ‘<em>Al-Ma’ani</em>‘ under the discussion of ‘<em>Al-Qasr</em>‘: that placing the object first (in a sentence) is one if the ways of confining (the meaning of the verb to the object alone).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the affirmation part of the <em>kalima</em> was indicated in His saying, <span class="quran">‘we worship’</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And He, <em>the Exalted</em>, explained this meaning which is indicated here in detail elsewhere. For example His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“O Mankind! Worship your Lord who created you.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 2:21]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Clarifying the affirmation aspect with his words, <span class="quran">‘worship your Lord’</span> and the negation aspect at the end of this noble verse with His words, <strong><span class="quran">‘so do not set up rivals with Allah while you know’</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 2:22]</strong>. And for example His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“We have indeed sent a Messenger to every people saying: worship Allah and leave all that is worshipped besides Allah.”</span>[<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 16:36]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Clarifying the affirmation with His words, <span class="quran">‘worship Allah’</span> and the negation with His words, <span class="quran">‘and leave all that is worshipped besides Allah’</span>. And for example His saying, <strong><span class="quran">“And whosoever rejects all that is worshipped besides Allah and believes in Allah has held onto the most trustworthy handhold.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em>2:256]</strong> Clarifying the negation with his words, <span class="quran">‘whosoever rejects all that is worshipped besides Allah’</span>and the affirmation with His words, <span class="quran">‘and believes in Allah’</span>. And for example His sayings:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“And when Abraham said to his father and his people: Indeed I am free of what you worship except He who created me.”</span>[<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 43:26-27]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“And We did not send a Messenger before you except that We revealed to him: that there is none worthy of worship but Me, so worship Me.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 21:25]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span class="quran">“Ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides Allah.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 43:45]</strong> And other verses.</span></p>
<h4 class="quran" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“YOU ALONE WE ASK FOR HELP”</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning that we do not seek aid from anyone but You because the command / affair in it’s totality is under Your control Alone, no one else has even an atoms weight of control over it. And in this statement’s following His saying, <span class="quran">“You Alone we worship”</span> lies an indication that it is not permissible to put our trust in anyone except the One that deserves worship because no one else has control over the command / affair. This meaning which is indicated here is clearly explained in other verses, like His sayings:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“So worship Him and put your trust in Him.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 12:123]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“But if they turn away, say: Allah is sufficient for me, none has the right to be worshipped but Him, in Him I put my trust.”</span>[<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 9:129]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“The Lord of the East and the West, none deserves to be worshipped but Him, so take Him as the Disposer of your affairs.”</span>[<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 73:9]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“Say: He is the Most Beneficent, we have believed in Him and put our trust in Him.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 67:29]</span></strong></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span class="quran">“THE PATH OF THOSE WHOM YOU HAVE FAVOURED”</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no explanation here as to who are the ones that have been favoured, but this is explained in another place with His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“And whosoever obeys Allah and the Messenger then they will be in the company of those that Allah has favoured: of the Prophets, the Truthful Ones (<em>Siddiq</em>), the Martyrs and the Righteous – what an excellent company!”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 4:69]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Addendum 1: the correctness of the Caliphate of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq can be derived from this noble verse because he is included amongst those that Allah has commanded us, in the Great <em>Qur’an</em> and the Seven Oft-Repeated Verses – I mean <em>Al-Fatihah</em>, to ask Him that He guide us to their path thus indicating that their path is the Straight Path.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This lies in His saying, <span class="quran">‘guide us to the Straight Path, the Path of those whom You have favoured’</span> and He explained who these favoured people were and included amongst them the <em>Siddiqin</em>. And he (<em>peace be upon him</em>) explained that Abu Bakr (<em>may Allah be pleased with him</em>) was from amongst the <em>Siddiqin</em>, so it becomes clear that he is included amongst those that Allah has favoured – those that Allah has commanded us to ask Him to guide us to their path. So there remains no doubt that Abu Bakr as-Siddiq was upon the Straight Path and that his Caliphate was correct.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Addendum 2: you have come to know that the <em>Siddiqin</em> are from those that Allah has favoured. And Allah has made clear that Maryam the daughter of Imran was a <em>Siddiqah</em> in His saying, <span class="quran">‘and His mother was a <em>Siddiqah</em>‘</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 5:75]. So is Maryam included in His saying, <span class="quran">‘those whom you have favoured’</span>or not? The answer: whether or not she is included amongst them is dependent upon a foundational principle which has a well known dispute over it. This is – does the sound masculine plural and it’s likes which occurs in the<em>Qur’an</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em> include the feminine gender in all cases or only in those cases for which there is a specific evidence?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A group of scholars took to the opinion that it does – so according to them Maryam is included in the above verse. And these scholars depended upon two proofs:</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The consensus of the people of the Arabic Language that the masculine gender takes prevalence over the feminine.<span id="qtip3" class="toggle">4</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">There a number of verses which prove that the females are included in the sound masculine plural, like His saying concerning Maryam herself, <strong><span class="quran">“she testified to the truth of the Words of her Lord and His Books, and she was of those obedient to Allah (<em>Qanitin</em> – a sound masculine plural)”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 66:12]</strong>, and His saying concerning the wife of Al-Aziz, <strong><span class="quran">“O Yusuf! Turn away from this! (O Woman!) Ask forgiveness for your sin, indeed your were of the sinful (<em>Khati’in</em> – a sound masculine plural)”</span>[<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 12:29], and His saying concerning Bilqis, <span class="quran">“And that which she used to worship besides Allah has prevented her (from Islam), for she was of a disbelieving people (<em>Qawm Kafirin</em>)”</span></strong> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 27:43], and His saying, <strong><span class="quran">“We said: get down (<em>ihbitu</em>) all of you from this”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 2:38]</strong> and this includes <em>Hawa</em> by consensus. And the majority of scholars took to the opinion that the females are not included in the sound masculine plural unless there is a specific evidence, and they depended upon a number of verses like His saying, <span class="quran">“indeed the male Muslims and the female Muslims, the male believers and the female believers. Allah has prepared for them a forgiveness and a great reward”</span>, and His saying, <strong><span class="quran">“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and protect their private parts. That is purer for them”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 24:30]</strong> following this with, <strong><span class="quran">“and tell the believing women to lower their gaze and protect their private parts”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 24:31]</strong>. So their following the mention of the men indicates that they are not included amongst them. And they replied to the proponents of the first opinion by saying that the fact that the masculine gender takes prevalence over the feminine is not a matter of dispute. What is disputed is whether the masculine plural includes the females in every case. And they replied to the verses (the first group) used by saying that it is known by the context of these verses and the meaning of the wordings that the females are included in the male plural – and that their inclusion in the male plural in the case of their being an evidence that they are included is not contended.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So according to this opinion Maryam is not included in the verse.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this difference of opinion was pointed out in ‘<em>Maraqi as-Sa’ud</em>‘ with his saying, <span class="salaf">“There is nothing untoward in including the feminine (amongst the masculine gender) For this is a matter in which the Muslims have differed.”</span></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span class="quran">“NOT THE PATH OF THOSE WHO HAVE EARNED YOUR ANGER, NOR OF THOSE THAT WENT ASTRAY”</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The majority of the scholars of <em>tafsir</em> said that <span class="quran">‘those who have earned Your Anger’</span> are the Jews, and<span class="quran">‘those that went astray’</span> are the Christians, and their is the <em>hadith</em> of the Messenger of Allah (<em>peace be upon him</em>) reported from Adi ibn Hatim (<em>may Allah be pleased with him</em>) concerning this<span id="qtip4" class="toggle">5</span>. And the Jews and the Christians even though both of them are misguided and both of them have Allah’s Anger on them – the Anger is specified to the Jews, even though the Christians share this with them, because the Jews knew the truth and rejected it and deliberately came with falsehood, so the Anger (of Allah being upon them) was the description most befitting them. And the Christians were ignorant, not knowing the truth, so misguidance was the description most befitting them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So with this the saying of Allah,<strong> <span class="quran">‘so they have drawn on themselves anger upon anger’</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 2:90]</strong> clarifies that the Jews are those that <span class="quran">‘have earned your Anger’</span>. And likewise His sayings:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“Say: shall I inform you of something worse than that, regarding the recompense from Allah: those (Jews) who incurred the Curse of Allah and His Anger.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 5:60]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“Indeed those who took the calf (for worship), anger from their Lord and humiliation will come upon them.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em>7:152]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the saying of Allah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“And do not follow the vain desires of people (i.e. the Christians) who went astray in times gone by, and misled many, and have themselves strayed from the Straight Path.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 5:77]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Clarifies that it is the Christians who are astray.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="font-weight: 300; text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Many narrations are well known in the virtue of Soorah Yaseen one such is that Soorah Yaseen is the heart of the Qur’aan and recite it when a person is near death (ie dying) and so on. However in terms of the authenticity of their chains none of them reach the level of authentic and some are either fabrications or weak. The narration of (Soorah Yaseen) being the heart of the Qur’aan was declared a fabrication by Shaikh al-Albaanee. (ad-Da’eefah Hadeeth no.169)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">It is well known the recitation of Soorah Yaseen near a person about to die has his soul taken with ease, but this hadeeth is not established in its chain. The details are as follows.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Narrated Muhammad ibn E’laa bin Makkee al-Marwazee who said informed me Ibn al-Mubaarak from Suleimaan at-Taymee from Abee Uthmaan not Nahdee from him his father from Ma’qil bin Yasaar who said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee-Was-Sallam) said, <i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">“Recite Soorah Yaseen<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">  </span>upon the one’s near death, these are the words of E’laa.”</em></i> (Mussanaf Ibn Abee Shaybah (4/84), as-Sunan Ibn Maajah (3/19), al-Mustadrak, Abu Abdullah al-Haakim (1/565), as-Sunan al-Kubraa (3/383) of Baihaqee, al-Musnad (5/26) of Imaam Ahmad, Amal al-Yaum Wal Laylah<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">  </span>(p.58) of Imaam Nasaa’ee, al-Adhkaar (pp.131-132) of Imaam Nawawee.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">The chain of this hadeeth rests on Suleimaan at-Taymee from Abee Uthmaan from his father from Ma’qil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Alee ibn al-Madeenee said Suleimaan at-Taymee is the only person who narrates from Abee Uthmaan and he is unknown ie Majhool al-Haal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Ibn Hibbaan, Haakim and Abu Dawood have narrated it from Abee Uthmaan, not Nahdee from his father however Imaam Nasaa’ee and Ibn Maajah have mentioned it as being narrated by Abee Uthmaan from Ma’qil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Hajr said this hadeeth is ‘Ghareeb’ (strange or odd). Ibn Qattaan said there is Idthiraab (mixing/confusing the chain). So in total there are three defects in the chain of this hadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">(1) Abee Uthmaan is majhool (unknown)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">(2) Abu Uthmaan’s father is also Majhool.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">(3) There is also Idhtiraab in the chain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Details of the Idhtiraab are as follows</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">(1) Is the hadeeth Mawqoof (stopped) or Marfoo (raised)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">(2) This narration has been narrated from Abee Uthmaan from Ma’qil and also from Abu Uthmaan from his father from Ma’qil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Allaamah Shawkaanee said in Nayl al-Awthaar, <i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">“Ibn Qattaan said this hadeeth is defective for the following reasons, there is Idhtiraab in it, it being mawqoof, Abee Uthmaan from his father is majhool (unknown ie both son and father are unknown).”</em></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Daarqutnee said, <i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">“The chain of this hadeeth is weak and the text is unknown and there is no such hadeeth in this subject.” </em></i>(Irwaa al-Ghaleel (3/151) of Allaamah Muhammad Naasir ud deen al-Albaanee, Nayl al-Awthaar (2/22) of Qadhee Shawkaanee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Allaamah Nawawee said in al-Adhkaar, <i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">“Its chain is weak and two narrators in it are unknown but Abu Dawood did not declare it weak. It is narrated from Ibn Abee Dawood from Mujaalid narrates from Sha’bee who said the Ansaar (The Companions who helped the Messenger of Allaah (</em></i>Sallalahu Alayhee-Was-Sallam<i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">) in Madeenah) would recite Soorah al-Baqarah when one was close to dying. However Mujaalid is weak.” </em></i>(al-Adhkaar (pp.131-132)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Also Ameer San’aanee in Subl as-Salaam (2/186), Minawee in Faidh al-Qadeer (2/67), Shaikh ul-Hdeeth Allaamah Ubaidullaah Mubaarakpooree in Mira’ah al-Mafaateeh Sharh Mishkaat al-Masabeeh (5/314-315) have all mentioned the criticism above, however Minawee has put a ‘H’ sign next to it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Allaamah Mubaarakpooree has discussed the virtue of reciting Soorah Yaseen in Mira’ah and mentions the criticism on the hadeeth but he has not written clearly whether it is authentic or weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Allaamah al-Albaanee has declared it weak in all of his books and according to my information the most detailed discussion of it is in al-Irwaa. (see Irwaa al-Ghaleel (3/15), Da’eef Ibn Maajah (p.159), Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh (1/1501) Checking al-Albaanee, Da’eef Jaami as-Sagheer Wa-Ziyaadah (1/330) and Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (p.11).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">There is another hadeeth with a similar meaning, which is narrated in Akhbaar Asfahaan by Abu Nu’aym. (Akhbaar Asfahaan (1/188) of al-Albaanee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">There is a narrator in the chain whose name is Marwaan, about whom Imaam Ahmad said, “He is not Thiqah (trustworthy). Saajee and Abu A’roobah Haraanee said, “A fabricator of hadeeth”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Daylamee has also narrated this hadeeth with the same chain but after the successor he mentions it from Abu Dardaa Abee Dharr. (Irwaa al-Ghaleel (3/152) of al-Albaanee, Talkhees al-Habeer (2/110) of Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Here we also find the narration is Musnad al-Firdaus like the hadeeth of Taareekh Asfahaan is also inauthentic as it is also narrated whilst including Marwaan and he is not reliable as has preceded. The<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>number of people that have criticised Abu Uthmaan from his father, are many however Haafidh Ibn Hajr has graded him from amongst the fourth level of acceptable narrators. (Taqreeb ut-Tahdheeb (2/449).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">The summary is this hadeeth is not established by any chain<b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">.</strong></b></span></p>
