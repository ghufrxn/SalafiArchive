				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of Abu Hurairah RadiAllahu Anhu the Messenger of Allah Sallalalhu alayhi Wasallam said, <em>&#8220;Whenever one of you performs wudu for Salah, he should not do tashbik with his fingers (after he has completed the wudu)</em> (al-Sahihah no.1294, transmitted Tabarani in al-Awsth (1:4-5).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tashbik is interlocking the fingers of both hands, ie putting the fingers on one hand into the fingers of the other hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith as narrated by Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri RadiAllahu Anhu said, <em>&#8220;When one of you is in the masjid, do not do tashbik for verily tashbik is from the Shaytan.&#8221;</em> (Musnad Ahmad (3:43).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Isma’ll b. Umayyah said, <em>“I asked about a man who intertwines his fingers while he is engaged in prayer. He said that Ibn ‘Umar had said: This is the prayer of those who earn the anger of Allah.”</em> (Abu Dawud no.993) Shaikh al-Albani graded its chain to be authentic (Irwa 2:103)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Thumamah al-Hannat said that Ka&#8217;b ibn Ujrah met him while he was going to the mosque; one of the two (companions) met his companion (on his way to the mosque) And he met crossing the fingers of my both hands. He prohibited me to do so, and said: The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said: If any of you performs ablution, and performs his ablution perfectly, and then goes out intending for the mosque, he should not cross the fingers of his hand because he is already in prayer. (Abu Dawud (no.562), Sahih Abi Dawud (1:168 no.562), Ibn Majah (no.967)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari established the following chapter heading in his Sahih, <strong>“Chapter on interlocking the fingers in the Masjid and elsewhere” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then brings a hadith from either Abdullah ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) or Abdullah ibn Amr bin Aas (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) interlocked his fingers. (Bukhari no’s 478-479)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the following hadith the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said to Abdullah Ibn Amr al-Aas (RadhiAllahu Anhu), <em>&#8220;O Abdullah bin Amr! What will be your condition when you will be left with the of (worst) people?&#8221; (and he indicated by interlocking the fingers of his two hands). </em>(Bukhari no.480)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of Abu Musa al-Ash’ari (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who narrates the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “<em>A faithful believer to a faithful believer is like the bricks of a wall, enforcing each other.&#8221; While (saying that) the Prophet (</em><em>ﷺ</em><em>) clasped his hands, by interlocking his fingers.” </em>(Bukhari no.481)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith in this regard is the long hadith of Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu about the story of Dhul Yadayn, it mentions the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, <em>“went and stood by a piece of wood that was set up in the masjid, and leaned against it as if he was angry, and he placed his right hand on his left and interlocked his fingers…”</em> (Bukhari no.482, Muslim no.573)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari brings this ahadith to show the permissibility of clasping the hands and interlocking the the fingers. The prohibition is because this is ie interlocking of the fingers a futile and useless act. However, there is no harm if there is a specific reason for a person to do this as in the hadith above the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) used the interlocking of his fingers to illustrate or explain a particular point.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr has explained despite one of the narration being in note form, Ibrahim Harbi has cited a continuous chain for it in his Gharib al-Hadith. Imam Bukhari’s intent in establishing this chapter heading is to elucidate and show the permissibility of clasping the hands and interlocking the fingers. As for the ahadith which mention prohibition of interlocking the fingers they are specific and in relation to the prayer or whilst preparing for the prayer and or most of them are not even authentic. (Fath al-Bari (1:565)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr further said whilst reconciling between these ahadith, the ones cited above and the ones that mention the prohibition, that <em>“al-Isma’ili reconciled between them by noting that the prohibition is limited to when one is in prayer or is intending to pray, because the one who is waiting for the prayer comes under the same ruling as one who is praying… Then al-Haafiz said: The report which says that this is forbidden so long as one is in the mosque is da’eef (weak) as we have stated above.” </em>(Fath al-Bari (1:565)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people whilst in a state of prayer may interlock their fingers in an attempt to crack them. This is unnecessary movement and a distraction from concentrating on the prayer. It was narrated by Shu’bah that he said, <em>“I prayed beside Ibn Abbas and cracked my fingers. When the prayer finished, he said, “May your mother lose you! You crack your fingers when you are in prayer?” </em>(Ibn Abi Shaybah (2:344). Shaikh al-Albani said in Irwa al-Ghalil (2:99), its chain is Hasan.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is another report in which is very weak according to Shaikh al-Albani in Ibn Majah (no.965) that Ali (RadhiAllahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, <em>“</em><em>Do not crack your fingers during the prayer.”</em> (Irwa ul-Ghalil (2:99 no.367) al-Bawsiri declared a narrator in the chain to weak. (al-Zawa’id (1:63). Shaikh al-Albani follows this with another narration from Mu’adh bin Anas (Ahmad (3:438), Daraqutni (no.64), Baihaqi (2:289) who said one of the narrators was not strong.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams ul-Haq Azimabadi also offers similar explanations and alludes to the fact that there are no contradictions in the aforementioned narrations. He cites further ahadith from Ibn Hibban in the prohibition of interlocking the fingers whilst on the way to the masjid to prayer. He also cites a narration from Hakim from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) when one of you performs wudu in his house and then he comes to the masjid, he is in a state of prayer up until he returns and he should not interlock his fingers. Hakim said the hadith is authentic on the conditions of the two Shaikhs. He goes onto cite another narration from Ibn Abi Shaybah’s Musannaf, that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said when one of you prays, he should not interlock his fingers for verily interlocking the fingers is from Shaytan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams ul-Haq goes onto say The Hadith of Ka’b has been authenticated by Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibban and that some scholars have differed over the authenticity of its chains and have thus rendered it to be weak. They (the scholars of hadith) have said there is no contradiction between these ahadith. They are understood to mean that a person is not to interlock their fingers after wudu and whilst on their way to the masjid to pray or whilst praying. The hadith of Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) in Sahih al-Bukhari refers to after the prayer and not during the prayer or from the time leading to the prayer. He then goes onto to cite the view of Ibn al-Munir, al-Ayni and al-Khattabi. (Au’n al-Ma’bud Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud (2:188-190 no.558) </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Everyone Should Say Amin Loudly</strong></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Allamah Muhammad Shams ul-Haq Azimabadi (1329H-1911)</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></p>
<p>In recent times a fatwa of his eminence, Allamah Imam Abdul Aziz Ibn Baz was rendered into English, highlighting the permissibility of saying Amin quietly in order to preserve muslim unity and to bring the people closer to the Sunnah etc etc. We do not want debate the fatwa of the great Allamah, however there must be more scope and discussion of the fatwa. For example the Shaikh refers to the caller ie the Da’ee and it is possible the Allamah may have been referring to such instances when a Da’ee is in such gathering etc.</p>
<p>The fatwa was rendered into English and but we find in the west that we have a number of Masaajid that clearly and comfortably allow us to say Amin loudly and raise our hands, therefore are we to abandon these practices in the smaller masajids. Allah knows best the motives of the translator, however translating such Fatawa without contemplating the greater benefit for the readers is something that should always be borne in mind especially by the newcomers. How are we supposed to teach the smaller masajid the Sunnah. Yes if there is greater harm and fitan then it is probably better to pray in a masjid that allows you to practice and propagate the Sunnah.</p>
<p>It is not the case that by applying such principles we will abandon the Sunnah and those we want to bring closer are adamant in their denial and rejection. Dear reader please note this is not a critique of the fatwa or questioning the legitimacy of it, in fact far from it and the contrary, that such a fatwa must come with some stipulations and no doubt this fatwa should be understood in conjunction with other Fatawa of Allamah Ibn Baz. It would have been better for the translator to have been fair to Allamah Abdul Aziz ibn Baz and have also translated other Fatawa so that the readers become versant and well acquainted with the love and firmness Allamah Ibn Baz had with the Sunnah. Much can be said, we leave you with a fatwa of The great Hadith master from the sub continent…..</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Is it authentically established from the non abrogated marfu hadith (ie from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) for the Imam, the congregation and the one who prays on his own to say Amin loudly in the loudly recited payers.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Saying Amin loudly has been established from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) as transmitted by Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said, “When the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) would finish his recitation of the Quran he would raise his voice and say Amin.” Transmitted by ad-Daraqutni who graded it Hasan and Hakim who graded it Sahih as cited in Bulugh al-Maram.</p>
<p>On the authority of Wa’il ibn Hujr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said, “I heard the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) recite Ghairil Magdhubi Alayhim Waladh-Dhaleen, he would say Amin by raising his voice.” Transmitted by at-Tirmidhi.</p>
<p>So both ahadith prove the validity for the Imam to say Amin loudly, however this ruling pertains to the person praying on his own and the Imam is always a single person (ie he is responsible for the congregation) which is established from the authentic marfu Hadith. Therefore when it is established and proven for the Imam (to say Amin loudly) then the same rule applies to the individual praying on his own.</p>
<p>As it relates to the members of the congregation ie those praying behind the imam, then we say it is also established from the marfu Hadith for them to say Amin loudly. This is narrated by Ibn Abbas (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) that the Messenger of Allah Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “The Jews do not envy you for anything more than they envy you for the Salam and (saying) amin, so say amin abundantly.” Transmitted by Ibn Majah.</p>
<p>It is thus evident that unless Amin is not said loudly and the sound does not reach the ears of the Jews they will not be jealous or envious.</p>
<p>And Imam Bukhari has transmitted in the <b>“Chapter: The Congregation To Say Amin Loudly”</b>  (in his Sahih) from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said that when the Imam says “Waladdaalleen” then you say Amin, for if your Amin coincides with the Amin of the angels, his previous sins will be forgiven.” Transmitted by Bukhari.</p>
<p>Thus the words “you say Amin” means to say Amin loudly and this is supported by the practice and action of Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) which Shaikh Badr ud deen Ayni has transmitted in his book Umdatul Qari Sharh Sahih Bukhari from Baihaqi that, “Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) used to announce the call to prayer for Marwan ibn al-Hakam, stipulating that the latter would not get to “Wa Ladalin” unless he knew that Abu Hurairah had entered the row. So when Marwan said “Wa Ladalin”, Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) would say Amin, prolonging it. He also said, “When the Amin of those on the earth coincides with the Amin of those in the heaven, they are forgiven.” Transmitted by Baihaqi as cited by al-Ayni.</p>
<p>And Imam Tirmidhi said after citing the Hadith of Wa’il Ibn Hujr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), “Abu Esa said the Hadith if Wa’il Ibn Hujr is a Hasan Hadith and a number of people of knowledge from amongst the companions of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam), the successors and those after them have said the same that a person should raise his voice and say Amin (ie loudly) and not quietly, this is also the saying of ash-Shafi, Ahmad and Ishaq.”</p>
<p><strong><em>(Fataawa Shaikh Shams ul-Haq Azimabadi, pg.153 rendered by Shaikh Muhammad Uzair 1989ce, also refer to Fataawa Naziriyyah 1/145-146)</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a rare first time reproduction of this fatwaa of the Great Scholar Allamah Azimabadi in the English language.<span id="more-1381"></span> His fataawa have never been printed in the Urdu language except at the time they were issued in his various works, journals and letters. Therefore this is special honour for the English readers to read a fatwaa of this great Hadeeth Master that was published over 100 years ago, such a fatwaa that has never been reproduced in the Urdu language except now only in English and a rare presentation by the administrators of this blog.    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Standing in a Gathering in Commemoration and Celebrating The Prophets Birthday.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By the Great Allaamah, Imaam, ash-Shaikh, Muhaddith Shams ul-Haqq Azimabadi al-Hindi (1273/1857ce-1329/1911ce) (author of <em>‘A’un al-Ma’bood’</em> and <em>‘Ghayatul-Maqsood’</em>)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Question 11</strong> </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people stand in gatherings that have been organised in relation to the Prophets Birthday and they stand with the belief that the Soul of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is present or the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is omnipresent and therefore he is present in such gatherings (of Mawlid, Milaad) then what is the ruling concerning this in light of the Sharee’ah and what is the ruling concerning those who do not believe in this?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Standing in such gatherings of remembrance that commemorate or celebrate the Prophets Birthday is an innovation and as we have mentioned before the characteristic of being omnipresent is not applicable to anyone except Allaah in terms of his knowledge. One must contemplate that if there 100 gatherings specifically organised for Mawlid, then how is it possible that his souls (ie Muhammads (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is specifically present in every gathering?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadhee Shihaab ud deen Daulatabaadee said in his book, <em>‘Tuhfatul-Qadhaa,’ </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“As for what the Juhaal (ignorant ones) do in the beginning of the month of Rabee ul-Awaal every year, then this is something that has no value. These people stand (in veneration) in gatherings celebrating the Mawlid and they believe the soul of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) comes and is present. Then this belief is baatil (false) rather this belief is Shirk (polytheism) and the four Imaams have warned us from such things (ie the soul of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) being (omni)present in such Mawlid gatherings)”</em>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadhee Naseer ud deen said in <em>‘Tareeqtus-Salaf,’ </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Some of the Jaahil (ignorant) Shaikhs have invented many new things which have no basis in the Quraan or the Sunnah, from these affairs is the standing in the celebrations of the Prophets Birthday.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is mentioned in Seerah ash-Shaamee, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It has become a major habit amongst (the false claimants) of lovers of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) that whenever they organise a gathering in his (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) remembrance they stand up whereas this standing is an innovation which has no basis.” (because the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is not omnipresent.”</em>(Subl al-Hudaa War-Rishaad (1/344) of Muhammad bin Yoosuf ash-Shaamee)</span></p>
