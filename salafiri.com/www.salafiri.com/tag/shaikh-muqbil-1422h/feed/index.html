				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shaikh Muqbil, may Allaah have mercy on him, said about the following when most of them were alive, “As for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0000ff">Shaikh Badee’ud-Deen ar-Raashidi</span></strong><span style="color: #0000ff"> </span>[d. 1996] then he is from our Shaikhs and I attended a <i>dars</i> or two or three of his, may Allaah the Most High protect him—<strong>and he is regarded as an Imaam of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah</i></strong>, may Allaah reward him with good, and he hates blind-following and blind-followers and repels them.</p>
<p>And also likewise is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0000ff"><strong>Shaikh Naasirud-Deen al-Albaani</strong></span>, may Allaah the Most High protect him, <strong>he is regarded as an Imaam of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah</i></strong>, and we advise all of our brothers to obtain his books and benefit from them.</p>
<p>And likewise also is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0000ff"><strong>Shaikh ’Abdul-’Aziz ibn Baaz</strong></span>, may Allaah the Most High protect him, <strong>he is regarded as one of the Imaams of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah </i></strong>and a champion of the <i>Sunnah</i> of Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وسلم …</p>
<p>… as for <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;text-decoration: underline">’Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Yahyaa al-Mu’allimi</span></strong></span> [d. 1966] then the likes of him are few in this time, and his books, if you read his book, ‘<i>At-Tankeel bimaa fee Ta’neeb al-Kawthari minal-Abaateel,’</i> you will see a wonder of wonders as regards his patience and tolerance in his refutation of al-Kawthari, and some people have called him <strong>the Dhahabi of his time</strong>, so <i>alhamdulillaah</i> his books are beneficial and his style is easy.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0000ff;text-decoration: underline">Ehsan Elahi Zaheer</span></span></strong> [d. 1987] also, Allaah unleashed him on the <i>Raafidah</i> and on the <i>Shee’ah </i>and so he exposed them—<strong>and he is regarded as a champion of the <i>Sunnah</i> of Allaah’s Messenger</strong> صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وسلم … and … it is proper that these people should be asked about me and not me of them—because they are the Imaams of this time, may Allaah reward them with good.</p>
<p>And when we say so and so and so and so from these people [mentioned above], I do not mean that you blindly follow [<i>taqleed</i>] them—<strong>so do not blindly follow Badee’ud-Deen nor al-Albaani and nor Ibn Baaz and nor so and so and nor so and so, these people are our Imaams, but if we were going to blind follow them, then we would have blindly followed Abu Bakr and ’Umar and ’Uthmaan and whoever traversed upon their way …</strong>”</p>
<p><i>Ijaabatus-Saa‘il ’alaa Ahammil-Masaa‘il</i>, p. 494.</p>
