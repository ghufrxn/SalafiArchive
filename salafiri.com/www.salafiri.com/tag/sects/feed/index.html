				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated by</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Hanafi Fiqh is the Origin of all Deviated Sects</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say with conviction and insight all the present day religious deviated movements, for example Christian missionaries, the communist movement, Chakralwi and other hadith rejectors like them, Qadiyani (Mirzai’s), and the shi’a sect, their origins can be found in the (books) of Hanafi fiqh, and this is further endorsed through the Hanafi fiqh issues and origins. Although they all appear to be separate and independent, their true origins lie within Hanafi fiqh. If anyone wants to substantiate this, they can take any deviated sect and they will find their issues rooted in Hanafi fiqh.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(at-Tafsil al-Jalil (p.60) Shaikh Badi ud-Din Shah ar-Rashidi as-Sindhi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Foundation of the Issues of Deviated Sects and Hanafi Fiqh</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Oh detractor, you proved deceptive in your point against us, you claimed we said, “all deviated sects are from the Ahnaf.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We did not write it in this manner nor what he intended to portray. The Ahlul Hadith and Hanafis in their own place, many Muslims apostate. A few people became Muslims and apostated during the lifetime of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, does this now mean we malign Islam? We seek refuge in Allah from such a thing. We did not say this at all that Chakralwis, Shi’a, Qadiyanis and others are from the Ahnaf. What we intended is that the origins of several issues related to deviated sects, or their support can be found in the book of the Hanafis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Mabsut al-Maghbut (p.159) of Shaikh Badi ud-Din Shah ar-Rashidi as-Sindhi</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">From Al-Ajwibah al-Mufidah of Jamal bin Farihan al-Harithi </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated by Abu Iyaad as-Salafi</strong><span id="more-1300"></span></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Question. Is one who calls himself a “Salafi” to be considered a partisan (hizbi)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer</strong>. There is not harm [1] in labelling oneself with Salafiyyah when it is in truth. However, if it is merely a claim then it is not permissible to label oneself with Salafiyyah, whilst one is upon a manhaj other than that of the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ash’aris for example, say “We are Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah” and this is not correct. This is because what they are upon is not the manhaj of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. It is likewise for the Mu’tazilah who call themselves “Muwahhideen” (Monotheists).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">All of them claim to have love for Laylaa</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Yet Laylaa does not affirm this for any of them</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence, the one who claims that he is upon the madhhab of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah [actually] follows the path of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah and abandons the Opposers. However if he [is one who] wants to unite the lizard and the fisth – as they say – meaning, to unite a creature from the land with a creature from the sea, then this is not possible. Or to unite water and fire in a vessel. In light of this, Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah do not reconcile with the path (madhhab) of those who oppose them such as the Khawarij, the Mu’tazilah, the Hizbiyyeen amongst those who call themselves, the Contemporary Muslims. Such is one who wants to unite between the errors and misguidance of the contemporaries with the manhaj of the Salaf. So “the latter part of this Ummah will not be corrected except by that which corrected its earliest part.” The essence of the matter is that it is necessary to weigh matters and to separate them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[1] Shaikh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah said: “There is no criticism for the one who proclaims the way (madhdhab) of the Salaf, who attaches himself to it and refers to it. Rather, it is obligatory to accept that from him by unanimous agreement (Ittifaaq) because the way (madhdhab) of the Salaf is nothing but the Truth (Haqq)” [Majmoo al-Fataawaa 4:149]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: Reflect  dear reader  upon the words of Shaikh ul-Islaam which [were uttered] before approximately eight centuries, and it is as if he is refuting one of the contemporaries of today who ascribes himself to knowledge and says, Whoever makes it obligatory upon the people that he should be an Ikhwani or a Salafi or a Tablighi or a Sururi, then his repentance should be sought. Either he repents or he is to be killed.!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said this in a cassette which circulated heavily amongst the youth and which was called “Flee from Hizbiyyah Like you would from a Lion” [*]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[*] After completing this book some papers reached me which contained some of Aa</strong><strong></strong><strong>id al-Qarni</strong><strong></strong><strong>s recantations from some of his errors. I found that amongst them was his recantation of this grave error. It is from justice that we mention this particular one: “Fourteen: I had said in a cassette, </strong><strong></strong><strong>Whoever makes it obligatory upon the people that he should be an Ikhwani or a Salafi or a Tablighi or a Sururi, then his repentance should be sought. Either he repents or he is to be killed.</strong><strong></strong><strong> This is an error that emanated from me and I seek Allaah</strong><strong></strong><strong>s forgiveness from it. What I meant was that whoever did that, then he has legislated (into the religion). However, it is an error regardless and I pardon myself from it. I believe that the madhhab of the Salaf is the correct madhhab and it is the one that is obligatory for the people to follow, to be guided by it and to traverse its path.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So I say: Subhanallaah! How has he granted himself the right to place the True Salafi Manhaj amongst these other methodologies (manahij) and astray, innovative deviant sects?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And our question to this person who actually lives in the land of Tawhid  and who holds a Masters degree in Hadith  is if a person is not a Salafi then what is he?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the Allaamah, Abdul-Aziz Ibn Baz  the [former] mufti of Saudi Arabia was asked: What do you say about the one who calls himself Salafi or Athari? Is this is a tazkiyah (purification) of his own self?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So he replied  may Allaah have mercy upon him  “When he is being truthful [in his claim] that he is Salafi or Athari then there is not harm in that, [this is] similar to what the Salaf used to say, So and so is a Salafi, So and so is Athari as a tazkiyah (commendation) which was necessary, a tazkiyah that is obligatory.” [Cassette: Haqq ul-Muslim 16/1/1413 Taif]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Shaikh Bakr Abu Zaid said, “And when it is said, Salaf or the Salafis or Salafiyyah then this is an ascription to the Salaf us-Salih, all of the Sahabah  may Allaah be pleased with them. So whoever followed them in goodness, and not those who were led astray with desires And those who were firm upon the methodology (minhaj) of Prophethood were associated (by others) to the Salaf us-Salih. Hence it was said to them, [that they are], the Salaf, the Salafis and an ascription to them [being the word] Salafi. So upon this, the word Salaf means, the Salaf us-Salih (the Righteous Predecessors). And this word when it is applied generally means everyone who guides himself by the Sahabah  may Allaah be pleased with them  even if he was in this modern time of ours. It is like this, and this is what the sayings of the People of Knowledge are agreed upon. Therefore, this is an ascription which does not have any aspect which departs from the requirements of the Book and the Sunnah. Rather it is an ascription which does not depart, even for one moment, from the very first generation [of Muslims]. It is from them and returns to them. As for the one who opposes them with a particular name or custom, then no, even if he lived amongst them and in their time.” [Hukm ul-Intimaa p.36].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: This ascription occurs in the books of biographies (of narrators).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam adh-Dhahabi says in the biography of Muhammad bin Muhammad al-Bahrani, “And he was devout, good, a Salafi”. [Mujam ash-Shuyukh(2/280)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And he said in the biography of Ahmad bin Ahmad bin Nimah al-Maqdisi, “And he was upon the aqidah of the Salaf” [Mujam ash-Shuyukh (1/34)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, ascribing oneself to the Salaf is an ascription which is necessary and required so that a differentiation can be made between the true Salafi and the one who hides behind them. Also so that the affair does not become confusing to those who want to guide themselves by them {the Salaf). So when the heretical groups and astray partisanships that lead astray have increased, then the People of Truth announce and declare their ascription to the Salaf with a view to free themselves from those who oppose them. And Allaah the Most High says to his Prophet and the Believers,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>And who is better in speech than he who [says: “My Lord is Allâh (believes in His Oneness),” and then stands straight (acts upon His Order), and] invites (men) to Allâh’s (Islâmic Monotheism), and does righteous deeds, and says: “I am one of the Muslims.” [Fussilat 41:33]</strong></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Taj Hargey said and we quote<span id="more-1914"></span></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But the misogynistic clergy defies the Koran text and distorts the reputed sayings (hadith) of the Prophet Muhammad (recorded over 250 years after his death) to elevate an archaic pre-Islamic convention into a contemporary religious imperative.</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Dear Readers we apologise profusely for the emotive language used in the article but taj hargey is well overdue such a response)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This statement of mr taj was uttered in disgrace and in his vilification and jihad against the veil in the daily mail dated 12 April 2011. In due course inshaAllaah we will present our response to his jihad and attack on Islam. What we found extremely ignorant and his grave manifestation of his sheer depravity of knowledge was the part in brackets ie the Hadeeth were recorded 250 years after the prophet Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We don’t know wether to cry or to mourn at this statement especially in light of mr tajs statement, which was yet again another abomination of the truth that he was an imam and a scholar (refer to his appearance on al-Jazeera with David Frost where he makes these fairy claims).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This dear readers should not be surprising, as taj hargey the anti veil jihadist, anti islamic and anti muslim, lacks the most basic knowledge of Islaam and yet he portrays total ignorance of the precise and concise sciences of Islaam, which the non muslims especially those amongst the orientalists have acknowledged.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At this point there is dismay and sorrow at the British media who in their ignorance and in this era of commercialism use mr taj as a puppet and their mouth peice with the sole intention of increasing their numbers. In addition taj hargey uses his vile tongue to attack the salafis and Ahlus Sunnah, so we say directly to taj if you want to say something about Islam and the salafis and they say it to us and we shall see what your all about and be sure to receive an adequate response.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say openly to mr taj hargey, you claim that your an imam and a scholar, we dare you to refute the following information, and if you can not then remain silent, shut up, stop presenting yourself as being totally ignorant in the media and stop waisting the precious oxygen we have left.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Taj hargey is and continues to spread discord, disunity and harm to the muslims and at the same time spreads terror amongst the muslims via his jihad against the veil. taj hargey should be ignored and passed as a trouble maker.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ALL BEFORE 250H<br />
SAHEEFAH AS-SAHEEHAH</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;">The Sunnah and Hadeeth were categorically compiled during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). The illustrious and noble companion Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrated Hadeeth to his students namely Hummaan Ibn Munabbeh bin Kaamil as-Sana’anee, who was a reliable successor and who died in the year 132H. These students wrote down these ahadeeth and as such this compendium became known as as-Saheefah as-Saheehah which commonly became known as Saheehfah Hummaam Ibn Munnabeh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By default this compendium was at the very least compiled in the very first century of Islaam, let alone the far fetched vacant claim of 250H and we will continue to inshaAllaah show the absurdity of this claim by this ‘imam and scholar.’ This compendium has approximately 139 ahadeeth. The later scholars and compilers of Hadeeth then utilised this first compilation and included some Hadeeth from it in their respective collections.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ahmad included all of Hummams Saheefah in his Musnad (FACT)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Abdur Razzaaq as-Sana’anee included 61 of his narrations in his Musannaf (FACT)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Bukhaari included 52 of his narrations (FACT)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Muslim used 83 of his narrations (FACT)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">And Imaam Baghawee used 97 of his narrations. (FACT)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Hummaams Saheefah was included by the compilers in their respective books of hadeeth but the the actual book of Hummaam was unavaible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was until Dr Hameedullaah found Hummaams book in manuscript form in a library in Berlin, Germany in 1933. He also found another manuscript in Damascus, Syria and whilst comparing both edition of the Saheefah he published his book from India in 1955 and the most interesting aspect was that there was not a single difference between the 2 manuscripts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What further adds to this amazement is that both of these manuscripts were corroborated with the ahadeeth which Imaam Ahmad included in his Musnad, as Imaam Ahmad included Hummaams whole book in his Musnad and astonishingly there was just a slight difference in wording.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) died in 56H and Imaam Ahmad died in 240H so in a period of approximately 190 years there was no difference in any of these narrations. This point further refutes the unintelligent self proclaimed scholars who say the ahadeeth could have changed or have been altered whereas this is a prime example of the fallacy and the spurious nature of their weak and futile arguments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are further points to this argument and inshaAllaah we will present this at a different time as our unscathing refutation of taj hargey and his blind followers at this moment in time is their retarded notion of the hadeeth being compiled after 250H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The interesting thing is Hummaam Ibn Munabbeh heard all the ahadeeth from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who died in 58H and so this conclusively establishes that the first compendium of hadeeth must have been compiled around or before 58H as Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) would tell Hummaam ibn Munabbeh to write the hadeeth from him.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE BOOK OF ALEE BIN ABEE TAALIB (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;">Further more Alee ibn Abee Taalib [40H] also has a small compilation Of hadeeth with him, which although were pertaining to certain aspects of Islaam, they were compiled well before 250H. (Refer to Saheeh al-Bukhaari no.111, Sunan Tirmidhee no.1412). Just in case some of the cohorts of taj hargey were confused this implies such a compilation must been authored before or at the very least at 40H</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE SAHEEFAH AS-SAADIQAH</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Abdullaah ibn Amr [65H] (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) also authored a small comilation of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) which was known as as-Saheefah as-Saadiqah and all of this can also be found in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad. The well known scholar of hadeeth and Muslim historian, Ibn Atheer said this compilation of the Prophetic Hadeeth contained at least 1000 ahadeeth. (Refer to Ibn Atheers Asad al-Ghaabah FeeTarjamah as-Sahaabah (3/233).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The illustrious companion Abdullaah Ibn Amr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said himself, “The as-Saheefah as-Saadiqah is a book which i wrote concerning whatever i heard from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and there was no one between me and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) (when i heard them from him) (Taqayyad al-Ilm (pg.82), Asad al-Ghaabah (3/234)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet again this compendium also follows a similar position to that of the compendium of Hummaam ibn Munabbeh and it must have been compiled at 65H or at least before. Where is that the ignorant claim of 250H and where is 65H. If only they were honest to themselves and freed themselves from arrogance to see the truth.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE BOOK OF AMR IBN HAZM (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;">He was the governor of Yemen and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) sent him a small booklet of the rulings and guidance which Amr bin Hazm used for the people of Yemen. Later Amr bin Hazm added approximately 21 more prophetic commands. This small booklet was perserved and cited by Ibn Toolaan in his ‘A’laam as-Saa’eeleen Aan Kutub Sayyud al-Mursaleen’.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE COMPILATION OF ANAS IBN MAALIK (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;">Anas ibn Maalik (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) used to also have a compendium that he compiled and when his students would ask him he would present his compilation. He would say. “These are the ahadeeth which are heard from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and then i showed them to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).” (al-Mustadrak (3/573-574)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">so and so forth with regards to the various different compendiums and compilations of hadeeth that were collated by the various companions and succesors all before 250H</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">like the Book of Jaabir ibn Abdullaah [71H] (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) which had approximately 1000 ahadeeth. Refer to Tadhkirratul-Huffaadh (1/43)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">like the book of Samurah bin Jundub [60H] (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) refer to Tadheeb ut-Tahdheeb (4/236).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and the list can continue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">we advise the readers to refer to the ebook section on this blog to read the late sub continent hadeeth master, Abdul Ghaffar Hassans book titled The compilation of Hadeeth for further reading.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">lastly we would like our dear readers to email MECO (Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford) at info@meco.org.uk and let them know we will not stand for poor backward thinking, philosophy, feeble intelects and deviated misguided teachings to enter Islam as we have a history of 1400 years of pure pristine Islamic teachings. Further if you at MECO have difficulty controlling your anti women jihad and takfeer or from degrading our Muslim Women (May Allaah raise their rank Ameen), then at least some respect for your own women folk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">FEAR ALLAAH.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>QUESTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A narration mentions that Adam (Alayhis Salam) supplicated through the Wasilah of Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). (al-Mustadrak al-Hakim 2/615 no.4228, Dalail an-Nabuwwah 5/489 of Baihaqi).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After citing this narration Dr Tahir ul-Qadiri (Barailwi) wrote,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>“Imam Hakim graded this Hadeeth to have an authentic (Saheeh) chain. Imam Baihaqi also graded it Sahih” </em>(al-Arba’een Fee Fadhail an-Nabi al-Amin pg.55, 4th Edn 2002)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So did Imam Baihaqi really authenticate and grade this narration to be Sahih and is this narration actually Sahih. Abu Saqib Muhammad Safdar of Hazro.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">We say Imam Baihaqi did not grade this narration to be authentic (Sahih) at all, rather Imam Baihaqi, May Allaah have mercy on him said, <i>“This is a lone report from Abdur Rahman bin Zaid bin Aslam and he is weak.” </i>(Dalail an-Nabuwwah 5/489).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Mr Tahir ul-Qadiri also cites this report in another book and thereafter reports Imam Baihaqi and others as grading it to be Sahih. (Refer to his book Aqidah Tawhid Aur Haqiqat Shirk pg. 266, 5th Edn, June 2005)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Mr Tahir ul-Qadiri saying that Imam Baihaqi graded it to be authentic (Sahih) is a clear and manifest lie.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>NOTE</b></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Imam Hakim was corrected by Hafidh Dhahabi in Talkhis al-Mustadrak and said, <i>“Rather infact it is fabricated (Mawdoo).”</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The chain of this narration is Mawdoo ie fabricated due to Abdur Rahman bin Zaid bin Aslam and Abdullah bin Muslim al-Fahri. For further details refer to Silsilah al-Hadith ad-Da’ifah Wal-Mawdoo’ah (1/38,47 no.25) of Shaikh al-Albani, May Allah have mercy on him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Fatawa Ilmiyyah ie Tawdhih al-Ahkam (1/84-85 Monthly al-Hadith Magazine, Issue 22, both of Shaikh Zubair Ali Zai</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center">
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">Published: 23rd December 2001 </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the time of the Fitnah (trial and tribulations) of Qadr <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://members.fortunecity.com/theclearpath/articles/aqeedah/#1">[1]</a>, Rafd, Ei’tizaal (Mutazilites), Irjaa (whether Eemaan does not increase or decrease) and Khalq al-Qur’aan (the Creation of the Qur’aan), Imaam Abul-Hasan Musadad ibn Masahid ibn Masarbil Asadee Basree (d. 228H) wrote to Ahmad ibn Hanbal to write concerning the issues from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) and to send it to him. When this letter reached the Imaam he said whilst weeping :</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To Allaah we belong and to him is our return, This Basree has spent enough wealth acquiring knowledge, yet the condition of his knowledge is that he could not acquire the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) regarding these issues.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then he wrote this Answer :</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise is for Allaah who preserved the People of Knowledge <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://members.fortunecity.com/theclearpath/articles/aqeedah/#2">[2]</a> of every time who gave Da’wah of guidance to the misguided and stopped the destruction. They made the dead, living by the Book of Allaah and saved them via the Sunnah of Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam). How many of them have they given life to, who the Shayaateen had killed, how many misguided have they guided. The result of their striving was a good favour on the Muslims. These people removed the Tahreef (distortion) of the Ghaalayn (Exaggerators) and the Ihtiaal of the Mubtalyn who were indulged in innovations and made Fitnah’s open and general and they made divisions after divisions upon the Book of Allaah. They placed Buhtaan’s (Great lies) on Allaah and raised numerous doubts concerning him. They talked about the Book of Allaah without knowledge. We seek refuge in Allaah from these misguided sects. May Allaah send salutations and Mercy upon his Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To Proceed :</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allaah give us all the ability to achieve his pleasure and protect us from his punishment and that he takes us on the path of those who fear him and who have knowledge about him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I advise you and myself of Taqwaa, the Sunnah of Rasoolullah <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://members.fortunecity.com/theclearpath/articles/aqeedah/#3">[3]</a> and the obligation of the Jamaa’atul-Muslimeem <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://members.fortunecity.com/theclearpath/articles/aqeedah/#4">[4]</a>(Believers). We know a bad destination of those who oppose it and a good destination of those who act accordingly. This saying of Muhammad (Sallaalhu Alayhee Wasalam) has reached us, <em>“Allaah enters his slave into Paradise for acting on one Sunnah strictly.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I command you people, do not give anything precedence over the Qur’aan. The Qur’aan is the Kalaam (Speech) of Allaah and the means by which Allaah made his Speech is not created and whatever is the Lauh al-Mahfooz (Preserved Tablet) is also uncreated. Whoever says it is created is a disbeliever and whoever does not declare them disbeliever’s, is also a disbeliever (After the proof is established).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallaalhu Alayhee Wasalam), Prophetic Ahadeeth and the saying of the companions and Taab’ieen have the next status. Salvation is in the following <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://members.fortunecity.com/theclearpath/articles/aqeedah/#5">[5]</a> (Ittibaa) and affirmation of the statements of the Anbiyaa and Rusul. These points have been continuously mentioned by the higher stature of the people of knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Beware of the ideas of Jahm Ibn Safwaan <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://members.fortunecity.com/theclearpath/articles/aqeedah/#6">[6]</a>. The sect of the Jahmiyyah according to our Scholars they are divided into three groups :-</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1.      One group says the Qur’aan is the speech of Allaah and it is created.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2.      The second group says the Qur’aan is the speech of Allaah, and then remains silent whether it is created or uncreated. They are the <em>Waaqafiyyah</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3.      The Third group says their words of recitation of the Qur’aan are created.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then all of them are the Jahmiyyah and the Scholars are agreed that whoever says this and if does not repent from these sayings, then the slaughtered of his hand will not be Halaal and his decisions are not worthy of acceptance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Eemaan is compromised of speech and action and there is increase and decrease in it. <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://members.fortunecity.com/theclearpath/articles/aqeedah/#7">[7]</a> If you do righteous actions there will be an increase in Eemaan and if you do bad actions there will be decrease. Is it possible that a man has no Eemaan yet he still remains within Islaam, if he repents he will enter into Eemaan and nothing takes one out of Islaam except Shirk or he rejects one of the obligations of Allaah, then he is a disbeliever. If he abandons an action due to laziness then this condition of his is with Allaah whether he punishes him or whether he forgives him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Regarding the Mu’tazilah, our Scholars are agreed that they are in favour of performing Takfeer (declaring Muslims to be disbelievers) on the account of sins. Hence whosoever from amongst the Mu’tazilah is upon this, believes that Aadam (alayhis-salaam) by committing a sin also committed Kufr and when the brothers of Yusuf (alayhis-salaam) lied to their father, they also committed Kufr. The Mu’tazilah are agreed on this Aqeedah that if one was to steal then he is from the people of Hellfire, his wife will have to leave him. If he has performed Hajj previously he needs to repeat it. The one who says such things has indulged in Kufr. The ruling concerning them is that they are not given Salaam or spoken to, nor is their food to be eaten that they slaughter up until they repent from their Aqeedah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning the Rawaafid, our Scholars are agreed, it is their Aqeedah that Alee (radiAllaahu ‘anhu) is more virtuous than Abu Bakr and Umar (radiAllaahu ‘anhum) and the Islaam of Alee (radiAllaahu ‘anhu) was before the Islaam of Abu Bakr (radiAllaahu ‘anhu). The individual who is in favour of this has openly refuted the Book and the Sunnah. Allaah says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Muhammadur Rasoolullaah and those who believe are with him…”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this Ayah Allaah has preferred Abu Bakr (radiAllaahu ‘anhu) after Muhammad (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa salaam), not Alee (radiAllaahu ‘anhu). The Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said, <em>“If I was to take a friend, I would take Abu Bakr but Allaah has made me his friend.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whoever understands that the Islaam of Alee (radiAllaahu ‘anhu) was before the Islaam of Abu Bakr (radiAllaahu ‘anhu), he is upon error and mistake because he (Abu Bakr) accepted Islaam when he was 35 and at that age Alee was a child of 7 years. The Islamic rulings, Sharee’ah punishments and religious obligations were not effective on him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is necessary for the Muslim to have Eemaan in the Good and Bad of Qadaa and Qadar and hold the belief that every acceptable and non-acceptable points of Qadaa and Qadar are from Allaah. Allaah created the Heavens before he created the creation and he did Tahleeq of those who are worthy of it. Its blessings are continuous. Whosoever thought that parts of Paradise are wasted is a disbeliever similarly Allaah created Hell and its inheritors. Its punishment is continuous. People will come out of Hell due to the intercession of Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam). The belief should be held of the Seeing of Allaah, the speaking of Allaah to Moosaa and that He (Allaah) made Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) his friend.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Meezaan (Scale) is true, the Siraat (Bridge) is true, the Prophets are true, Eesaa (alayhis-salaam) is the slave and Messenger of Allaah. One should have Eemaan in the Hawd (Pool), Shifaa’ah (Intercession), Arsh (Throne), Kursee (Footstool) and Eemaan in that Maalik al-Maut removes the soul and it is returned to the bodies and they are questioned about Eemaan, Tawheed and the Messenger. To have Eemaan in the Soor (Trumpet) which Israafeel will blow. Also to have Eemaan that the grave, in Madeenah, is the grave of Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) and Abu Bakr and Umar (radiAllaahu ‘anhum). To have Eemaan in the fact that the heart of the believer is between the two fingers of Allaah. Dajjaal will descend in the Ummah of Muhammad and Eesaa (alayhis-salaam) will come at Ludd and kill him. The Scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah, whichever point they reject, they are the rejecters. Beware of Innovations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no one more virtuous than Abu Bakr (radiAllaahu ‘anhu) after Muhammad (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) in this Ummah, after him there is no one more virtuous than Umar (radiAllaahu ‘anhu) and after Umar there is no one more virtuous than Uthmaan (radiAllaahu ‘anhu). This is our saying about the Three Khulafaa and we are silent about Alee (radiAllaahu ‘anhu). The narrations of Abdullah Ibn Umar concerning their excellence and preference are authentic. All Four Khulafaa are Rashideen Mahdiyeen. We testify about the 10, that they are from the people of Paradise, their names are :-</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1.    Abu Bakr</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2.    Umar</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3.    Uthmaan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4.    Alee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5.    Talhah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6.    Zubair</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7.    Sa’ad</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8.    Sa’eed</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9.    Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Auf</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10. Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarraah (radiAllaahu ‘anhum ajma’een)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people the Messenger of Allaah gave tidings of Paradise to, then we also affirm them being from the People of Paradise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to us performing Raf ul-Yadain (raising the hands) and saying Ameen loudly is a means to increasing in the good. Supplications of righteousness, firmness and rectification should be made for the rulers. The sword should not be raised against them and war is not fought against them in issues of differing, nor should anyone be forced to say so and so is from the people of paradise. However this can be said about the Asharah Mubasharah, (the ten promised paradise) about whom the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) gave the glad tidings of paradise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Only mention the attributes of Allaah that he mentioned for himself and negate everything he negated for himself. Beware from debating with the people of desires. Withhold from mentioning the errors of the companions of the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) and mention their virtues and remain silent about their mutual differences. Do not seek advice from the people of innovation concerning the religious affairs, nor travel with them. And for the permissible ni’kah (wedlock) there has to be a Walee (guardian), listeners of the khutbah and two trustworthy witnesses. Mu’tah (temporary marriage) is haraam (unlawful) up until the Day of Judgement. Pray behind every righteous person – even the sinful individual. Pray the funeral prayer of every individual who is from the people of the Qiblah because his affair is with Allaah. Obey every Imaam and Ameer. Participate in Jihaad and Hajj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The takbeers of the funeral prayer are four, and if the Imaam says five then you also say five takbeers, like Alee (radiAllaahu ‘anhu). It is the saying of Abdullah Ibn Mas’ood to say the same amount of takbeers as the Imaam, but Shaafi’ee has differed with me in this. He says that if the Imaam says more than four takbeers then he should supplement the prayer and he has presented to me a hadeeth with its chain, of the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) in which he said four takbeers in the funeral prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The wiping over the khuffains is three days and nights and one day and night for the resident. The supererogatory prayer is two units. There is no prayer before the Eed Prayer. Pray two units before sitting down in whatever mosque you enter. The witr is one unit. Saying the Iqaamah is necessary.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I consider the people of Ahlus-Sunnah much better then Ahlul-Ahwaa (the people of desires) whatever their defects. May Allaah give you and us death upon Islaam and the Sunnah and may he give us its knowledge.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">When Shaykh ul-Islaam Harawee was exiled he left all his books but he took this treatise with him. It is the saying of Ibn Mandah – rahimahullaah – said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Whoever read this advice and acted upon it is worthy of the verse upon him, <strong>Inna Abdee Laisa Laka Alayhim Sultaan</strong>.”</span></p>
