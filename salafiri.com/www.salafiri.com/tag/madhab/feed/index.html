				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">By</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Aqeel al-Hindi</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the charges against the people of hadith is that their role within Islamic scholastics is one of compilation and transcription of the Sunnah for its benefit as a legislative source for those with the tools who fully understand it and can use it. Those who follow this line of thought argue that the one-dimensional role of the scholars of Hadith can be juxtaposed with the more complex, intricate and cognitive role of the Fuqaha. While it is true that it <em>can</em> be the case that a memoriser of Ahadith may not have complete understanding of what they convey<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, to tar the people of hadith in their entirety with such a brush is an injustice at best and libellous at worst. As will be demonstrated in this article, the well-known scholars of Hadith were individuals whose faculties for memorisation <em>and</em> understanding of the narrations they conveyed were gifts from Allah, as their works attest to.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another result of this fallacy is the assertion that the books of Ahadith are purportedly too complex for anyone other than a scholar of fiqh to benefit from and the layperson is to be warned against reading them, for fear of misunderstanding and going astray. This categorisation of the books of the Sunnah as such lowers their status to one of repositories of information, to be accessed by the elite few who have understanding. While it is true that the people of knowledge will appreciate and gain more from the books of hadith than the layperson, the success that Allah has granted the scholars of hadith in their works, in terms of their practical abilities to compile their works, as well as the thought that went in to their works, means that their books are far more than stores of Ahadith and that the layperson can pick up one of these books and learn about the religion of Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As demonstrated in the article in issue no.4, &gt;&gt;&gt; <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/imam-al-bukhari-was-a-muwahhid-salafi-athari-not-a-muqallid-partisan-or-blind-follower-of-any-madhhab-he-was-upon-the-madhhab-of-ahlul-hadith/">Imam al-Bukhari was a Muwahhid and Salafi in his Aqidah and Manhaj</a></strong></span>. One of the sources of his Aqidah is his book, the Sahih. The oft-cited principle when reading the Sahih of Imam Bukhari is that his fiqh is understood through his chapter headings. So chapter headings and the titles of books within the Sahih give an understanding as relates to his Aqidah, which he based upon the Athar. Al-Mustamla narrated in his report of the Sahih adds to the chapter heading of the book of Tawhid, <em>‘The Book of Tawhid; a Rebuttal of the Jahmiyyah and other than them’.</em> Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar comments, under the chapter heading of Tawhid:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The intent behind the narration of al-Mustamla: and other than them” is the Qadariyyah. As for the Khawarij, that which relates to them proceeded in the Book of Fitan and the Rafidah in the Book of Ahkam. And these four groups are the heads of innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Hafiz’s words show that the Sahih of Imam al-Bukhari is rich in terms of its Aqidah-based content that rebuts the fundamentals of the major groups of deviation. This richness is not, however, restricted to Aqidah. Matters relating to the relaying of Ahadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, fiqh<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, the virtues of righteous actions<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> and other than this can be derived from the Sahih. Some of the scholars have taken this a step further by compiling works that that have been derived from the two Sahihs, al-Bukhari and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The books of Sunan, particularly Abu Dawud’s and at Tirmidhi’s, also demonstrate the understanding and the compiler’s had of the implications Ahadith carried, their relevance to the sciences of fiqh and the relative stances of the people of knowledge relating to them. Abu Dawud, for example, states in his <em>Sunan</em> after reporting the Hadith of Uthman relating the wudhu of the Prophet ﷺ,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The authentic Ahadith of Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, all indicate that wiping over the head is done once, for they (the narrators) mentioned the actions of wudhu thrice and mentioned the wiping of the head without mentioning the number of times, as they did for the other actions.</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also clarifies some meanings contained in Ahadith; <em>‘…give her food when you eat, clothe her when clothe yourself, do not strike her on the face, do not revile her or leave her except in the house’</em> Abu Dawud stated:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The meaning of ‘Do not revile her’ is to say [to her] ‘May Allah revile you.’</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to fiqh-based intricacies and clarifying meanings, he also explains the meanings of terminology that is not often used in Arabic (Ghara’ib) in numerous Ahadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholastic weight of Imam at Tirmidhi is equally evident in his Jam’i, as attested to by Ibn al-Athir, where he mentions its distinguishing features among the books of Ahadith, namely: its ordering and lack of repetition; mentioning the views of the fiqhi Madhahib and how they respectively deduce rulings; explanation of the Ahadith, in terms of their grade of authentic, sound, weak, gharib and mu’alal; explaining the names of the narrators, their monikers and kunyas, and additional points of benefit that pertain to the sciences of rijal and the book of Ellal at the end of the Jami<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Having established the richness of the books of Hadith, we can now focus on how to benefit from them. This has been outlined by countless scholars when discussing the Manhaj of the student of knowledge in acquiring knowledge. A fitting example here would be the Muhaddith of Yemen, Shaykh Muqbil b. Hadi al-Wadi’, a scholar whose call to the Quran and the Sunnah, and particular emphasis on Ahadith, caused changes on a societal level in his native lands. He states:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fact that some beginner seekers of knowledge in the field of Ahadith err [in their endeavours] is taken up by their antagonists, who use the errors to justify driving them away from their Manhaj [that of the people of hadith]. However, I advise my brothers to acquire what they can from the books of Ahadith and dedicate themselves to reading them – and as for the one who says that whoever’s Shaykh is a book will err more than they are correct, this is only if they do not choose the most fitting book and do not refer to the statements of the scholars relating to the hadith – and acting upon knowledge that has been found [al-Wijadah] is permissible. They should refer to the explanations that the people of the Sunnah have given and if they see in the books of Hadith something that contradicts what the people around them are upon, they should look to see what the people of knowledge have said about the Ahadith in terms of its authenticity and in terms of its meanings. If the Hadith is authentic and the meaning has been understood correctly, it has not been abrogated and you have checked in the explanations that it is not a general hadith that has been made specific elsewhere, or an unrestricted hadith that has been restricted elsewhere, do so if you can. If they are in an environment in which the community have an acceptance of the Sunnah and have trust in them, they should teach them with statements and actions. If they are in an environment in which the community do not have acceptance of the Sunnah, nor do they have trust in them, they should strive to encourage them to act in accordance to the Sunnah and request evidences [for practices].<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>[3]</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Imam Muhammad Fakhir Za’ir Ilabadi</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>1120H-1164H</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(1708c-1751c)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari </strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His full name is Muhammad Fakhir and known as Za’ir, the son of Shaikh Muhammad Yahya. His title is as ash-Shaikh al-Alim al-Kabir al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir bin Muhammad Yahya bin Muhammad Amin al-Abbasi Ilabadi. (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence is Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir bin Shaikh Muhammad Yahya Ilabadi. (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.334)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had two brothers, one was Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Ilabadi who was a reputable scholar of the Din. His maternal grandfather was Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi, whose lineage could be traced back to Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhu).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find that Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was from a family of learning who valued and gave Islamic education great importance. The family were known amongst the people for their knowledge and attachment to the sacred Islamic sciences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From an early age Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir started learning from his father, grandfather and older brother and benefited greatly from them. It led him to acquire knowledge quickly and thereby becoming highly proficient and competent in the sacred Islamic sciences. (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>A Brief Overview of his Family</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(1) His father; Shaikh Muhammad Yahya Ilabadi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a major scholar of his day and the author of <em>Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram</em> praised him by saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was an ocean of knowledge in the sciences, once that sent waves of this knowledge resounding with the people and he authored a number of books and treatises.” (</em>Ma&#8217;athir Al-Kiram (2:218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had three sons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(i) Shaikh Muhammad Tahir</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(ii) Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(iii) Shaikh Shah Muhammad Hasir Afsali</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All three sons and father were keen poets and enjoyed poetry.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(2) His grandfather; Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No detailed information could be obtained regarding his biography.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(3) His brother; Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Ilabadi (b.1110H &#8211; d.1143H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the older brother of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir, he was a person of knowledge and virtue, Shaikh Muhammad Ra&#8217;is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was upon the Salafi Madhab and an Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith just like his brother as we find from his writings.&#8221;</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.193)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hasani said he was well aware and acquainted with the Madhabs of the Salaf and Khalaf and that his brothers sought knowledge from him. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:332-333 no.615)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Seeking the Knowledge of Hadith from Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi [1163H]</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir studied with Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi in the year 1149H when he travelled to the 2 sanctuaries and visited Madinah. At the time Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami was also studying with Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi and hence both were of similar stature in terms of their sittings. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339-340), Taqsar Junud al-Ahrar Min Tazkar Junud al-Abrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Fakhir studied and read <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em> on Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi to the extent that he gained great credibility and heights which conjured up immense love for Hadith in his heart, such was the case that he became rigid and firm on the Quran and Hadith his whole life. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.141)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi also gave him Ijazah for the two Sahihs as well as other books. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349), Sarwar Azad (p.213), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.141)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Under the Tutelage of Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir studied with Shaikh Azad Bilgirami, as another beneficial point it is sufficient to note that Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlavi also studied under Shaikh Azad Bilgirami, meaning that Shaikh Azad Bilgirami was a teacher of both of them however their period of study was different. (Sarwar Azad (p.213+), Itihaf an-Nabula (p.406-407), Ma&#8217;arif (22:339)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Stay in The Two Blessed Sanctuaries</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir had special love for the 2 blessed lands and hence for the purpose and intent of seeking and consolidating his knowledge he remained there for a few years. During this period, he performed 2 Hajjs. After returning to India, he intended to perform his third Hajj in the year 1154H and whilst he set out, some goons captured him near Surat and stole all of his belongings except his books and eventually gave him a ride to the city of Surat. (Sarwar Azad (p.214), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He attempted to perform Hajj again in the year 1156H and whilst travelling by ship, the journey was short lived due to ship wreck. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir ended up residing in Bandar Faha for a few days and then eventually reached his destination of Hijaz safely in the same year and then finally returned back to India in 1159H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In one of his journeys to Hajj he returned with an edition of <em>Sahih Muslim</em>, which was copied by Mawlana Ruh al-Amin Khan, which is preserved in Habin Ganj library. (Ma&#8217;arif (23:91-92), Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349), Sarwar Azad (p.214), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335, 340).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After seeking the traditional knowledge and sciences he began to teach his students with great vigour and fervour. He was known to have reached the status of being a Muhaddith at a very young age and thus a large number of people benefited from his knowledge and understanding.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This can easily be deduced and understood from the fact that when Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan sent Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati to study with Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlavi, he later sent him to Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir to seek knowledge of Hadith and its sciences. This clearly shows Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was a great scholar of Hadith of his era and was highly proficient as a Hadith master.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From his students were his two sons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Shaikh Qutb ud-Din (1187H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(2) Shaikh Muhammad Ajmal (1236H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and also</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Shaikh Qadhi Thanullah Pani Pati (1225H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Shaikh Murtaza Bilgirami (al-Zabidi) (1205H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Shaikh Ghulam Haidar Khan Kakawri (1252H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(6) Shaikh Ghulam Safdar Khan (1283H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(7) Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi (1234H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(8) Shaikh Muhammad Nasih</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(see Mashahir Kakawri (p.300), Tazkirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140), Siratul Bukhari (p.37-38).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Shaikh Qutb Al-Din bin Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir (b.1138H &#8211; 1187H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the Shaikhs eldest son, and was often responsible for teaching the people as well delivering regular lessons, he essentially took over his father’s role in teaching, more so when his father would travel to perform Hajj. He has been mentioned with great virtue with regards to his command of the various sciences and disciplines, especially the knowledge of <em>Fiqh</em> and its principles ie <em>Fiqh</em> and <em>Usul al-Fiqh</em> and other areas of learning. He died while he travelled to Makkah to perform Hajj and was thus buried there. He also authored some books. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:235-236 no.437).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra&#8217;is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was upon the way of his father and uncle, on the Madhab of Ahl al-Hadith.&#8221;</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.192)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The affect of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir on his students was so profound that it was manifest in their writings. This was more so in adhering and abiding by the ahadith and rejecting any form of blameworthy and rigid staunch Taqlid which is prevalent with the muqallidin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An example of this is what Shaikh Qadhi Thanullah Pani Pati said in his will, in that Surah Fatihah is to be recited after the first takbir and opening supplication even though he is famously attributed to the hanafi madhab. (<em>Wasiyat Nama</em> printed with <em>Majmu&#8217;a Wasaya</em> Number 4 (p.146).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi (1234H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi authored a book on raising the hands in the prayer titled, <em>&#8216;Nur Al-Aynayn Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain.&#8217;</em> This maybe an addendum to his Shaikh work or his own personal work and Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is said about him that he was exemplary and unmatched in speaking the truth and being vocal in this and he spent a large part of his life strictly following the Quran and Hadith and adhering to the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says in one place in his book, <em>&#8216;Nur Al-Aynayn Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain&#8217;,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When I have obeyed and followed the Messenger of Allah </em><em>ﷺ</em> <em>I am totally unconcerned with the statements of Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Sufyan ath-Thawri and Imam at-Zuhri.&#8221;</em> (Tarajim Ulama Hadith (p.383), Tazkirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (pg.142), Siratul Bukhari (p.37-38)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Will</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was firm and strong in adhering to the Quran and Sunnah and thus vehemently abhorred grave worship and so he willed that he was to be buried next to Shaikh Abdul Latif in Burhanpur. This was due to the fact it was only his grave that was not venerated and worshipped. Hence, according to his wish he was buried next to Shaikh Abdul Latif.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Status and Position</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was a mujtahid, a Salafi and not a muqallid. We find by looking at his books that he was undoubtedly an Ahl al-Hadith and refrained from doing Taqlid of anyone. He was a mujtahid in his own right and this supported by the statement of Shaikh Abdul Hay al-Hasani which is to proceed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah blessed Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir with a great station and status.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He studied with numerous teachers and began teaching at the tender age of 20. He achieved the title of Shaikh. He then went to Haramayn Sharifayn in 1149H to perform Hajj and Umrah. He visited The Prophets Masjid and eventually sought knowledge of hadith and other disciplines from the Shaikh of the Shaikhs, Muhammad Hayat Sindhi and eventually returned back to his native land. He would visit Haramayn Sharifayn numerous times.”</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh (p.195)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Author of Risalah Najatiyyah of Shaikh al-Fazil Al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir with the title of Za&#8217;ir Ilabadi.&#8221;</em> (Ittihaf an-Nabula (p.84) Also refer to Intiqad at-Rajih (p.84), Taqsar Junud al-Ahrar Min Tazkar Junud al-Abrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At another instance Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He detested venerating the holy men ie the pirs and he would write in refutation of them. He would encourage adhering to the Quran and Sunnah. It is sufficient testimony for Shaikh Muhammad Fakhirs trustworthiness and uprightness that Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan and Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami bore witness to his great virtue, immense noble character and extensive knowledge.&#8221;</em> (Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said at another place,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was the Imam of the Imams of the followers of the Sunnah in India and he was from amongst the Shaikh of the Shuyukhs from the major and well known scholars.&#8221;</em> (Taqsar al-Junud al-Ahrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ismail Salafi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is apparent from the authors poems that he was a fearless caller to Tawhid and the Sunnah, and at the same instance he would rebuke the customary staunch bigoted Taqlid. This would inevitably lead to some harshness but nonetheless he was very intelligent and the scholars would respect him highly.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Azad Bilgrami said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan said, &#8220;I have seen many notable people but after 11 hundred years I saw the likes of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir and I found him to conform and agree with the Quran and Sunnah.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram Fi Tazkirrah Ulama Bilgiram (2:218), (Sarwar Azad (p.218), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.337)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He (ie Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan) would would visit me with respect but with Shaikh Fakhir he was even more respectful and humble.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan would go to visit Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir Ilabadi himself which was not the norm for him.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati praised Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir with the following words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ash-Shaikh al-Ustadh Muhammad Fakhir al-Muhaddith Rahimahullah said that it was unlawful to make a masjid next to a grave whilst deducing from the Hadith of Abi Lahaij in Sahih Muslim.&#8221;</em> (Tafsir Mazhari (6:23)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati undoubtedly, was a non staunch open minded Hanafi Scholar searching for the truth such that the current day Hanafis would not bat an eyelid except to shun and ostracise him and label him as a pseudo Hanafi as the word pseudo is often used and accustomed on the tongues of the bewildered retractors. So despite this Shaikh Thanullah Pani Pati would would still have great respect for him despite him being an Ahl al-Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whereas in our times it is the total opposite and the present day Hanafis have left the teachings and mindset of their forefathers and abuse the Ahl al-Hadith. (Refer to Nur us-Sunnah (p.5-6)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Abdul Hayy al-Hasani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ash-Shaikh Al-Alim Al-Kabir Al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir bin Muhammad Yahya bin Muhammad Amin Al-Abbasi al-Salafi Ilabadi, one the well known and famous scholars.&#8221;</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349 no.641)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;All the people were agreed in praise of him and his noble characteristics, he was someone who was referred to in such affairs. He did not restrict himself to only one specific madhab nor did he do taqlid of anyone in the affairs of the Din rather he followed the texts of the Quran and Sunnah and did Ijtihad which he was well qualified and capable to do.&#8221;</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:350)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Atthar Mubarakpuri said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was a major Muhaddith of his era.”</em> (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is Nadwi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“…We can see just from the titles of his books that it is apparent he was Ahl al-Hadith and upon the Salafi Madhab, he would openly say he was an Ahl al-Hadith and would spread the Manhaj of Ahl al-Hadith…..In summary, this Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith of the twelfth century, who was accepted and praised by whose who were not from the Ahl al-Hadith. The Imam was an outspoken, formidable and fervent propagator of the Madhab of Ahl al-Hadith, coupled with the fact that he was accepted by both the Ahl al-Hadith non Ahl al-Hadith, thus it is not impossible a large group of the muqallidin did not adopt and change to the Madhab of the Ahl al-Hadith due to the arduous efforts of this Imam of Ahl al-Hadith.”</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.196)     </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Allamah Azad Bilgrami&#8217;s (1294H) Praise for Imam Muhammad Fakhir.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Azad Bilgrami wrote a poem in Farsi on the death of Imam Muhammad Fakhir&#8217;s in respect of him and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was known as Za&#8217;ir (in the poets circles) and his name was Muhammad Fakhir, the son of Shaikh Muhammad and the grandson of Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi, and we empowered the three, he assumed the role of the Musnad of his elders. In doing so he was very noble, virtuous and reached a high rank as well as having lofty characteristics.&#8221;</em> (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>An Expert Master in the Sciences</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was an excelled master in the Islamic principles and far ahead in the sciences of texts and their comprehension from his counterparts, this was also applicable to some of the scholars prior to his era.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir excelled and was a specialist in Hadith and its various sciences as well has having the rank of a mujtahid in issues of <em>fiqh</em> ie jurisprudence.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Writings and Works</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir authored a number of treatises. The Hanafite biographer, Shaikh Abdul Hayy said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He authored a number of books in spreading the Sunnah.”</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:350)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">some of them are</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(1) Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqa&#8217;id Al-Hadithiyyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the scholars referred to this book as <em>Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqa&#8217;id Al-Athariyyah</em>. There is probable cause for this as Imam Muhammad Fakhir authored this book on the methodology Ahl al-Hadith and hence the Athari creed. It has only been printed twice and Walillahil Hamd we have published it for a third time.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Risalah Najatiyyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we have already mentioned some scholars referred to this book with two equally interchangeable names. This classical 12th century text on Salafi creed was authored by Imam Muhammad Fakhir when he had to reside in Chittagong in Bangladesh for between 3-4 months in the year 1161H ie 3 years before his death. The original book is preserved in Mawlana Abdul Ghani al-Baqi’s library in Dinajpur in Bengal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treatise as also mentioned before is based purely on the Salafi Creed and Manhaj and hence the Quran and Sunnah and it is from Imam Muhammad Fakhir last works. One can gauge the importance and significance of this book from the fact that Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan translated the book from Farsi into Urdu as Farsi was the original language it was written in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-8048 alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=306%2C343" alt="najatiyyah old" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=268%2C300 268w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=768%2C861 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=913%2C1024 913w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?w=1040 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan produced a summarised transation and included it in his book <em>&#8216;Al-Mu&#8217;taqad Al-Muntaqad&#8217;</em> which was printed in the year 1305H from Matba&#8217;a Al-Ansari in Delhi. Furthermore, he included the whole book in Farsi in the beginning of another book, <em>&#8216;an-Nahj Al-Qubul Min Shara&#8217;i ar-Rusul.’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the importance of the status of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir, if a great scholar of the likes of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan summarized his book and reproduced them in his books of Aqidah, it for sure shows his status and calibre.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was an accomplished poet in Arabic and Farisi. Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan summarised Shaikh Muhammad Fakhirs poems in his two books, <em>&#8216;Nafah at-Tayyib&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;ar-Rawdh al-Khasib&#8217;</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Qurratul Aynayn Dar Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is authored in poem form in Farsi. Imam Muhammad Fakhir addressed the issue of Raf ul-Yadain in a scholarly manner and proved the raising of the hands in the prayer and refuted the weak evidences for not raising the hands.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-8049 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/qurratul-ayn.png?resize=298%2C505" alt="qurratul ayn" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/qurratul-ayn.png?resize=177%2C300 177w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/qurratul-ayn.png?resize=768%2C1305 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/qurratul-ayn.png?resize=603%2C1024 603w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/qurratul-ayn.png?w=964 964w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is Nadwi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Most of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhirs books were in poetry form. He died and was buried in Burhanpur in Maharashtra. We can see just from the titles of his books that it is apparent he was Ahl al-Hadith and upon the Salafi Madhab, he would openly say he was an Ahl al-Hadith and would spread the Manhaj of Ahl al-Hadith.”</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.196)     </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>The Scholars of During Imam Muhammad Fakhirs Era</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir was calling to the the Quran and Sunnah without Taqlid and adhering to the Salafi Manhaj at a time when the people and the scholars of the era were engrossed in Taqlid or the madhahibs. It also shows the status of Imam Muhammad Fakhir as well as his call based on the notable and praiseworthy scholars that were around during his era, it includes the likes of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab (1114H-1206H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(2) Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlavi (1114H &#8211; 1176H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi (d.1163H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati (1145H &#8211; 1225H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Shaikh Abul Hasan Sindhi (d.1138H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(6) Shaikh Abdullah Salim al-Basri (d.1134H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(7) Shaikh Ibrahim al-Kurdi (d.1145H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(8) Shaikh Murtaza al-Zabidi Bilgrami (1145H &#8211; 1205H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(9) Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il bin Amir San’ani (d.1182H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(10) Shaikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Saffarini (d.1188H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also very plausible that he may have met Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab during his visits to Makkah and Madinah.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>When Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir Met Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is also a well known incident when Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir met Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi. The incident mentions that once when Imam Muhammad Fakhir visited Delhi, while praying he said Amin loudly in the prayer in the Jamia Masjid. This was a disturbing event in Delhi. The general people because angry and began to oppress Imam Muhammad Fakhir to the extent they were on the verge of beating him. Imam Fakhir explained to them that this was established from the Sunnah and if you were to go to any of your major scholars of Hadith they will affirm this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the end they took Imam Muhammad Fakhir to the gathering of Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi and mentioned the incident to him.  So Shaikh Shah Waliullah told the people that this was also established from the Sunnah and the people were silenced. Thereafter Imam Muhamamd Fakhir said to Shaikh Shah Waliullah what don&#8217;t you tell these people openly what the Sunnah is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To which Shaikh Shah Waliullah replied that if I was to tell these people openly about such issues how would I have saved you today. Meaning that the people were so engrossed and staunch in the Hanafi madhab and fixed in their ways that they failed to accept anything else. (Taqsar al-Junud al-Ahrar (p.115), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339), Mawj Kawthar (p.63) of Shaikh Muhammad Akram)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Death</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1164H Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir prepared for Hajj again but became very ill, he had just reached the town or Burhanpur when he breathed his last and returned to our creator on the 11th Dhul Hijjah 1164H. Shaikh Azad Bilgirami expressed his sorrow and sadness at the demise of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir. (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218), Sarwar Azad (p.218), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.336)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This formidable Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith, spent his very short life in spreading Tawhid and the Sunnah, reprimanding grave veneration, grave worship and blind taqlid. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir spent almost quarter of a decade in calling to adhering to the Quran and Sunnah in an era which was filled with ardent bigoted hanafi muqallids, who were ferociously vicious and violent. The legacy of this Imam of Ahl al-Hadith who was upon the Madhab of the Salaf still remains as radiant and bright as ever around the globe even after 250 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The existence of this impressive Scholar of Ahl al-Hadith, his efforts and struggles are a testimony and a tremendous rebuttal of the modern madhabists who claim the Ahl al-Hadith are a new sect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah have mercy upon Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir and forgive his sins, Amin   </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>READ <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-reality-of-the-madhab-of-ahl-al-hadith-part-1/">PART 1</a></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-reality-of-the-madhab-of-ahl-al-hadith-part-2/">PART 2</a></span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, it is clear just from the example of the likes of Tirmidhee that the Ahlul Hadeeth not only existed in the first three centuries but were seen as yardsticks in issues of creed, as those refuting the various sects of misguidance, imams of the science of jarh wa tadeel and fuqahaa and jurists in their own right whose jurisprudence was based on the book and sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For the detractors who say the scholars of hadeeth did not know Fiqh we can cite over at least 50 examples just from Tirmidhees Sunan which show the Fiqh and Jurisprudence of Ahlul Hadeeth and Tirmidhee would refer to them as ‘our Companions’ as opposed to the people of rhetoric and kalaam, whom he referred to as ‘ahl ul kufah’.  Allahs aid sought. For example, under the chapter of Hajj tamattu he says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“And Ahlul Hadeeth preferred the Tamatu’ of ‘Umrah in Hajj and this is the saying of Ash-Shafi’ee, Ahmad and Ishaq.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we say to the detractors, it is you who did not exist as a madhab to be blindly followed in the first three centuries whereas there was ijmaa, consensus upon the Ahlul Hadeeth’s way, books, Aqeedah and juristic acceptance. How would there be agreement on the Hanafis madhab which only began in the fourth century seeing that there usool, Aqeedah and Fiqh opposed the correct way, that is of the Ahlul Hadeeth. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fifthly, there is not a single scholar of Ahl us Sunnah who has detracted from the acceptance of the sihaa sitta and those who authored them, that is the scholars of hadeeth in the first three centuries. Yet, all the Ahlul Hadeeth and some madhabists refute, contradict and challenge the narrative of the books of usool and Fiqh in the Hanafee madhab. The reasons are self evident on why this would be the case when the Hanafee books of Usool and Fiqh state:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abul Hasan Karkhee Hanafee writes:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Every ayah/hadeeth which contradicts our scholars madhab will be abandoned and explained as either being abrogated or left due to precedence of some other text” </em>(Usool karkhee p.13</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“May the curse of Allah be upon the one who refutes the saying of Abu Haneefah as much as the grains of sand”</em> (Durr al-Mukhtaar (1:63)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The prophet Isa upon his return will gave verdicts based upon the rulings of Abu Haneefah”</em> (Durr al-Mukhtaar (1:55) and Tahtaawee (1:40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The study of hadeeth will lead one to destruction”</em> (Hidayah (1:68)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When discussing the cure for a continuous nose bleed the author of Qadee Khaan reports:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It was asked and even to write the Quran with urine? It was said if there is a cure in it then to do so is no problem”</em> (Fataawa Qadee Khan (1:367), Alamgheree (1:39), Durr al-Mukhtaar (1:210)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>Seeing as alcohol will be permissible in jannah then to have some type of alcohol as halaal in the world in preparation of the hereafter is permissible”</em> (Shaamee (2:256)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abu Hurayrah and Anas ibn Maalik were not grounded in Fiqh and if a hadeeth reported from them opposes analogical reasoning there hadeeth will be abandoned for the analogical reasoning”</em> (Usool Shaashee (p.38)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The companions Salmaan Faarsee being as a companion was greater than Abu Haneefah due to this but was not as great as him in the field of dawah and spreading the deen”</em> (Shamee (1:40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“To swear at the shaykhayn [Abu Bakr and Umar] is not kufr.”</em>  (Sharh Fiqh ul Akbar Ali al Qaaree (pp.76-77)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“To swear at Umar, Uthman and Alee is not Kufr”</em> (Fataawa Alamgheree (2:775)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We can produce at least 500 issues of usool, Fiqh and belief of the Hanafee madhab which contradict the Quran, sunnah and way of Ahlul Hadeeth. Indeed the ummah has not accepted the Hanafee madhab whereas the salaf were in conformity to the Ahlul Hadeeth way. Considering the above it should be of no surprise as to why the Hanafees are an innovated group and the Ahlul Hadeeth not so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note, we have purposefully left out certain beliefs and matters of Hanafee Fiqh as it is not prudent to mention them in this work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sixthly, Ibn Sireen and the salaf are in agreement that “the chain of narration is from the religion” [Muslim]. If you consider the books of Ahlul Hadeeth and compare them to the madhabs you will surely see that the Ahlul Hadeeth provide chains of transmissions back to the prophet and sahaba yet the hanafee books of Aqeedah and Fiqh are absent from chains of transmissions and are mere assertions and opinions of men. Yet we are told by the detractors of the ‘obligation’ to follow the verdicts/madhabs and sayings of men without any evidence of sound chain of transmission!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, pick up and read the hanafee books of usool and Fiqh and see how many chains they transmit back to Abu Haneefah whom they see as the leader of their amdhab or the sahaaba? it would be good if such evidence could be provided!!  This point in itself is sufficient to prove the invalidity and innovation of the existence of the Hanafee madhab and the truthfulness and existence of the Ahlul Hadeeth at the time of the salaf for one who wants to see!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Much can be said about the efforts of Ahlul Hadeeth in transmitting hadeeth and it is an unequivocal fact that the sahaaba would learn and teach other hadeeth and fiqhul hadeeth but not Hanafee madhab. There was no existence of the Hanafee madhab to be blindly followed in the era of the salaf. For example,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Umar had befriended an Ansaari Companion from the Bani Umayyah Bin Zaid tribe and that he would take it in turns with him to hear the sayings of the prophet and they would share them with each other. (Bukharee (1:68)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The companion Wail Bin Hujr travelled a long distance in cold weather just to learn the hadeeth of salah from the prophet (Sunan Abu Dawood (2:68)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> A companion sent his wife to the mother of the believers Umm Salamah to ask about the hadeeth of what the prophet said about a person kissing his wife whilst fasting (Bukharee no.1969)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> These examples establish that the Ahlul Hadeeth way of learning the book and hadeeth was an established way during the time of the prophet whilst there was no teaching of Hanafee Fiqh whatsoever. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, the prophet order Abu Hurairah to write as anything uttered by him would only be the truth (Sunan Daarimee no.490). The Prophet ordered that hadeeth pertaining to inheritance be written down for the companion Abu Shah (Bukharee 2:59) and the prophet himself wrote hadeeth for Ali which became known as the ‘Saheefa as Saadiqah’ (Bukharee (5:27). There is no doubt at all that the way of Ahlul Hadeeth of writing, spreading and learning hadeeth was fully established by the prophet himself. Contra, we ask show us any evidence that the prophet wrote and verdict of any Imaam? or the companions spread any madhab?  Surely, the prophet or his companions would never ever be pleased with the usool and Fiqh that we have listed above from the Hanafee madhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, we want to conclude by reporting how the blessed sahaaba were eager to preserve the hadeeth and in then spreading it as this is evident from the chains of transmissions handed down to us from them. Had the companions not done this we would not have the deen as it is with us today and would have been left with sayings and opinions of men with every man saying what he willed and how he wanted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No one was more eager to ask about hadeeth and its meanings than the companions and this is because the ‘Fiqh’ and understanding of the hadeeth is also found in the quran and sunnah itself and not in innovated madhabs invented in the fourth century onwards.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once Abu Huryrah asked the prophet who it will be easiest for to receive his intercession in the hereafter? The prophet explained this hadeeth of his further by saying to Abu Hurayrah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“I have seen your fervour to find out about the hadeeth” </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and then he continued:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The people most deserving to receive my intercession will be those who say none have the right to be worshipped but Allah”</em> (Bukharee no.99)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Pay attention to how the student is studying Hadeeth, the prophet is calling what the student is seeking an explanation about as ‘hadeeth’, how the student seeks further explanation once again from hadeeth and the students fervour to know about hadeeth so he can spread it and act upon it!! After such evidence to dispute the validity of the way of seeking and following hadeeth right from the era of the companions does not seem to be academic honesty by the detractors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask Allah give us the strength to be upon the way of the Ahlul Hadeeth, the companions and those of the salaf who were upon their way and to give us the fervour like Abu Hurayrah to seek nearness to Allah through the teachings of hadeeth. We conclude by saying that the Ahlul Hadeeth are not a new innovated group without academic heritage, Aqeedah and Fiqh. Instead, it is the Hanafee detractors who follow opinions of men over and above teh hadeeth and a madhab which had no existence in the time of the prophet, companions or first three centuries. Allah knows best.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">READ</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-reality-of-the-madhab-of-ahl-al-hadith-part-1/">PART 1</a></span></strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, when Allah has not commanded something how is it even conceivable that the companions or their students could be upon that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, pay attention to the following Ahadeeth and the Salafs commentary upon them demonstrating that the Ahlul Hadeeth are not an innovated group but the opposite stands true.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>In an authentic report the prophet said: “There will cease to be a <strong>Group</strong> from my Ummah<strong> “victorious upon the truth,“</strong> not being harmed by those who oppose them until the command of Allaah comes about, and they are like that.”</em> (Related by Muslim (6:52-53) and Abu Dawud [2:202]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">It was reported from ‘Awf ibn Maalik who said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Jews were divided into seventy-one sects, one of which is in Paradise and seventy are in the Fire. The Christians were divided into seventy-two sects, seventy-one of which are in the Fire and one is in Paradise. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, my Ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects, one of</span> which will be in Paradise and seventy-two will be in the Fire.” It was said, O Messenger of Allaah, who are they?

It was classed as Saheeh by Ibn Taymiyah in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (3:345), al-Shaatibi in al-I’tisaam (1:430), and al-‘Iraaqi in Takhreej al-Ihya’ (9:133)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described the saved group as the<strong>jamaa’ah,</strong> i.e.,<strong> “Al-Taifah Al-Mansoorah OR Firqatun Naajiyah” (Victorious Group OR Saved Group</strong> )..…</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The salaf have commented upon these narrations connecting them to the Ahlul Hadeeth which shows their existence amongst the salaf and their legitimacy.</span></p>

<span style="color: #000000;"> he said,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>6) Imam Shaf’ee (204 H)</strong> Said:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and Also Imaam Ash-Shaafi’ee (d.204AH) said:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>7) Ali bin Abdullah Al Madeeni (d.234H</strong>), who was the Teacher of Imam Bukhari, said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“They are the “Ahul Hadeeth”</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>8) Shaykh Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee (d.561H)</strong> said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“</span><em><span style="color: #000000;">As for al-Firqatun- Naajiyah (the Saved-Sect) it is</span><strong style="color: #000000;"> Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah,</strong><span style="color: #000000;"> and there is no name for Ahlus- Sunnah except one – and that is</span><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> Ashaabul-Hadeeth (the People of Hadeeth).</span> </strong></em><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Ghuniyatut-Taalibeen (pg.212)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>9) Khateeb Baghdadi (d.463H)</strong> has written a Book on the Virtues of the Ahlul Hadeeth, titled: Sharf Ashaab al-Hadeeth, and also refer Tareekh ul-Baghdad (1:224)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>10) Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (d.728H) </strong>said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>Hence it is clear that the people who most deserve to be called the<strong> victorious group are “Ahl al- Hadeeth wa’l-Sunnah”,</strong> who have no leader to follow blindly apart from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). They are the most knowledgeable of people concerning his words and deeds, the most able to distinguish between what is sound and what is not [of hadeeth]. Their imams have deep knowledge of that, they are the ones who understand its meanings and are the most sincere in following it. They accept it and believe in it, and act upon it. They show love to those who adopt it and they show enmity to those who oppose it. They are the ones who measure any idea against that which is proven in the Qur’an and Sunnah, so they never adopt any idea and make it one of the basic principles of their religion unless it is proven in that which the Messenger brought. Rather they make that which the Messenger brought, the Qur’an and Sunnah, the foundation and basis of their beliefs. With regard to the issues concerning which people dispute, such as the attributes of Allah, the divine decree, the threat of Hell, the names of  Allah and the principle of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, etc., they refer that to Allah and His Messenger. They examine the general ideas concerning which the different groups dispute, and whatever of these ideas is in accordance with the <strong>Qur’an and Sunnah</strong>, they approve of it, and whatever goes against the Qur’an and Sunnah, they reject it. They do not follow conjecture or whims and desires. For following conjecture is ignorance and following whims and desires without any guidance from Allah is wrong doing.” </em>(Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (3:347-348)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The explanation of Ibn Taymiyyah Rahimahullah proves that Ahlul hadeeth means 2 types of people: The Muhadditheen and those who are upon the book and sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"> يَوۡ<strong>مَ</strong> <strong>نَدۡعُوۡا</strong> <strong>كُلَّ</strong> <strong>اُنَاسٍۢ</strong> <strong>بِاِمَامِهِمۡ</strong><strong>‌</strong><strong>ۚ</strong> <strong>فَمَنۡ</strong> <strong>اُوۡتِىَ</strong> <strong>كِتٰبَهٗ</strong> <strong>بِيَمِيۡنِهٖ</strong> <strong>فَاُولٰۤٮِٕكَ</strong> <strong>يَقۡرَءُوۡنَ</strong> <strong>كِتٰبَهُمۡ</strong> <strong>وَلَا</strong> <strong>يُظۡلَمُوۡنَ</strong> <strong>فَتِيۡلًا</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“(And remember) the Day when We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) Imam [their Prophets, or their records of good and bad deeds, or their Holy Books like the Quran, the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), etc.]. So whosoever is given his record in his right hand, such will read their records, and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least.”</strong> <strong>[Surah Al-Isra 17:71]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ibn Katheer (d.774H)</strong> said in the Tafseer of this Verse in his Most Famous Tafseer ibn Katheer:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“And Some Salafs said: This (verse) is the Greatest honour for the <strong>Ashaabul Hadeeth</strong> because their Imaam is the Prophet MUHAMMAD ”</em> (Tafseer Ibn Katheer Surah al-Isral ayah 71).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Jalal Ud Deen Suyuti (d.911H)</strong> recorded a Similar Tafseer of this ayah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is not a Greater honour than that (verse) for the <strong>Ashaabul Hadeeth</strong> because they Do Not Have an Imaam other than Him.”</em> (Tadreeb al-Raawi (2:126)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a plethora of texts and evidences alongside those stated above which establish the existence of Ahlul Hadeeth right from the companions and to discuss all evidences would be a very lengthy task.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fourthly, the books of the Ahlul Hadeeth are many and we have already listed some books of aqaaid above but the entire ummah relies on the sihah al-sittah, six books of authentic hadeeth as an authority. These books by themselves establish the existence of Ahlul Hadeeth in the first three centuries as all these books were authored by the first three centuries. There is not a single authentic report from any of these authors to establish that they were blind followers of any madhab or that even any of the four schools existed as madhabs in their time. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is not hidden to the detractors that the likes of Imam Bukharee, Tirmidhee and others held the way of salvation to be the way of Ahlul Hadeeth as has been explained above. This stance is also reflected in the books of hadeeth they referenced. Taking Sunan Tirmidhee as an illustration Imaam Tirmidhee throughout the sunan mentions the Ashaabul Hadeeth, Ahlul Hadeeth as a distinct separate juristic way upon the truth. The illustrations are too many to note here.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, Tirmidhee throughout the sunan establishes that the Ahlul Hadeeth were the Imaams of the science of Jarh wa tadeel, an example is when he said “Ibn La’ihah is weak according to Ahlul Hadeeth. Yahya ibn Qattan and others weakened him because of his memory.”  He also mentions the way of Ahlul Hadeeth as the way to follow in matters of creed when he narrated in the chapter: “What is narrated about the Khulud (staying forever) of people of Paradise and Hell” a Hadeeth mentioning the vision of Allah and Allah putting His foot in the hell, and then Imam Tirmidhi wrote:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Hadeeth is Hasan Saheeh, and it has been reported from the Prophet a lot of narrations similar to this mentioning the topic of the vision of Allah, that people will see Allah, and the mention of the Foot and matters similar, and the Madhab of people of knowledge from Imams like Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Malik ibn Anas, ibn Al-Mubarak, ibn ‘Uyaynah, Waki’ and others is that they mention these matters and they say: “These Ahaadeeth are narrated, and we believe in them and it is not said “How?” and this is what is chosen by <strong><u>Ahlul Hadeeth</u></strong>, that these matters should be narrated as they came, and there should be belief in them, and there should not be any Tafsir (other than literal meaning) and one should not cast any doubt, and it should not be asked: “How?”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tirmidhee also mentions Ahlul Hadeeth as a reference point for truth whilst refuting various sects who had incorrect beliefs in the first three centuries as follows when he refuted the Jahmiyyah sect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> It should be noted that Tirmidhee uses the terms Ahl us Sunnah to mean the same thing as Ahlul Hadeeth as follows below. Hence, for Tirmidhee it was the Ahlul Hadeeth Ahl us sunnah which were upon the correct way in affairs of Aqeedah. He said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“More than one person of knowledge said on this Hadeeth and similar narrations about the Attributes, the ascending of the Lord every night towards the heaven of this world, they said: These narrations are established, and we should believe in them and not have any doubt, and not say: “How” and this is narrated from Malik, Sufiyan ibn ‘Uyaynah and ‘Abdullah ibnul Mubarak, and they said concerning these AHadeeth: “Quote them without (asking and mentioning) “How” and this is the saying of the people of knowledge among the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah. As for the <strong>Jahmiyah,</strong> they rejected these narrations and said that it is Tashbih (establishing a similarity between Allah and His creation). Allah (‘Azza wa Jalla) has indeed mentioned in many places of His Book the hand (Al-Yad), the hearing (As-Sam’), the sight (al-Basar) and the Jahmiyah interpolated these verses and explained them (did its Tafsir) contrary to what the people of knowledge have explained (did Tafsir), and they (Jahmiyah) said: “Allah did not create Adam with His hand” et they said: “The meaning of hand is the power”. And Ishaq ibn Ibraheem said: “Tashbeeh is only when we say that the hand is like my hand or similar to it, or hearing is like my hearing or similar to it, so if someone says: He hears like I hear or similarly to my hearing, this is Tashbeeh (establishing a similarity between Allah and the creation), and if we say as Allah (Ta’ala) said: a hand, hearing and seeing, and we do not say “How” and we do not say: “Like my hearing or similar to it” this is not Tashbeeh.” </em>(Tirmidhee (2:38)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Certain brothers, mostly those ascribed to the Hanafee madhab, have recently began a campaign maligning the Ahlul Hadeeth, their heritage and methodology. In essence, these brothers have detracted from Ahlul Hadeeth, Ahl us Sunnah by having enmity in their positions towards the Ahlul Hadeeth. The detractors, it seems, when attacking the Ahlul Hadeeth seek to do so due the taqleed and tahazzub they have for their own madhab loosing the moral essence that any researcher and academic should have, that is, seeking the truth for the face of Allah azzawajal. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We seek Allah’s aid and assistance from such fanaticism for the sake of a madhab or Imaam at the expense of ikhlaas towards Allah. What follows is a very brief and summarised critique around the submissions and themes which often surface during supposed ‘academic’ discussions by the detractors and Allah’s help is sought.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If it is opined that the Ahlul Hadeeth are a new innovated madhab that had no existence during the first three centuries Hijri, then this is broadly responded to from many angles. Firstly, it must be understood that Ahlul Hadeeth is not a sect like the four madhabs, but, instead it is a methodology which advocates adhering to the book and sunnah with prophet Muhammad as its Imaam and the companions as his students. The way and essence of Ahlul Hadeeth as stated is not based on mere words or slogans but the salaf and Islamic texts have established this fact for us all. Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘We do not mean by Ahl al-Hadeeth only those who study it, write it down or narrate it, rather we mean anyone who takes care to memorize it, understand it and follow it, both inwardly and outwardly. The same may be said of “Ahl al-Qur’aan” (the people of the Qur’aan). The basic quality of these people is their love of the Qur’aan and hadeeth, referring to them and their meanings, and acting upon what they learn.&#8221;</em> (</span><span style="color: #000000;">Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 4:95)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ahmad also is reported to have said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“According to us<strong>, Ahlul hadeeth</strong> is a person that Acts upon a hadeeth”</em> [Manaaqib Al-Imam Ahmed Li Ibn Al Jawzi p.208 with an authentic Chain]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is not a single scholar in the first three centuries of Islaam that mentioned taqleed of the hanafee madhab or Abu Haneefah yet it can clearly be seen that the Ahlul Hadeeth were present and the Imaams and people were upon their way as it was only the Quran and sunnah that were followed and not the madhabs as we have them today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Secondly, one can also refer to all the books of Aqeedah authored in the first three or so centuries Hijri, they all refer to the methodology of the Sunni being so as to follow the book and sunnah, that is the way of Ahlul Hadeeth without a mention of taqleed of any madhab. Some books which we list below all promote and explain the way of Ahlul Hadeeth in the first three centuries, whilst some authors expressly mention Ahlul Hadeeth, Ahlul Athar, Firqatun Naajiyah, Ashaab ul Hadeeth and so on therein as being the people of truth, saved sect and the way to follow. Nowhere, in these texts will you find the mention of madhabs and blindly following them yet the detractors claim the Ahlul Hadeeth are a new phenomenon and that it is they whom existed at the time of the salaf, this is nothing but a bare faced lie the detractors’ concoct. Such texts are:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thirdly, Islamic texts and the scholars of Islaam indicate other than what the detractors claim and in fact what one very quickly realises is that it is the madhabist detractors who had no existence during the quruwn ul mufaadhala, whereas, the Ahlul Hadeeth did so.  For example, the prophet said          </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When Allah intends goodness for someone he gives them the understanding of the religion”</em> (Bukharee no:71)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No one from the first three centuries ever understood this to mean understanding of a particular madhab but there is consensus on the fact here that it means the understanding of the Quran and sunnah being mentioned as no other sources existed at that time. This is self explanatory as there was no Hanafee madhab or any of the four madhabs for that matter during the era of the companions. Instead, there was only the Book and the Sunnah, that is, the way of that Ahlul Hadeeth.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, we find Imams in the first three centuries who expressly mentioned and defended the Ahlul Hadeeth thus showing that Ahlul Hadeeth were not only in existence but it was only the Ahl ul Bidah who opposed and fought them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Abu Yusuf referred to the companions and their students as Ahlul Hadeeth. (Sharf Ashaabul Hadeeth p.25)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is one of the main Imaams and about whom the Hanafees say their madhab was handed down to them from so it would be wise to pay attention to his words. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam al-Haakim said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal did well when he commented on this report by saying that the victorious group who will prevail until the Hour begins is “ashaab al-hadeeth” (the people of hadeeth). Who is more deserving of this description than people who follow the way of the righteous and follow in the footsteps of the salaf who came before us, and exposed the falsehood of the people of bid’ah (innovation) by basing their arguments on the Sunnahs of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)?’ </em> (<em>Ma’rifat ‘Uloom al-Hadeeth</em>, by al-Haakim al-Nisaboori, pg. 2-3) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask if the Ahlul Hadeeth are an innovated madhab why did Ahamd Ibn Hanbal say these words? In fact, we ask where are the texts of the salaf from the first three centuries defending or promoting madhabs?  never mind stating that the Hanafi madhab is the saved sect. In actual fact even the Imaam which our Hanfee brothers have invented a madhab around, Numan Bin Thaabit, Abu Haneefah reportedly said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘When a hadeeth is found to be authentic then it is my madhab’</em> (Shaami p.18)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, even he acknowledged the way of Ahlul Hadeeth as being the truth. So who would it be other than the Ahlul Hadeeth who would verify the veracity and authenticity of a hadeeth? This clearly shows not only did the Ahlul Hadeeth exist in the first three centuries but the Imaams like Abu Haneefahh were in need of them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, we ask all the Hanafee brothers please produce a single evidence where Imaam Abu Haneefah said to make a madhab on his name?, to blindly follow him and promote it as one ought to promote only the Quran and Sunnah? There is no such statement as the Hanafees and madhabs did not exist during the first three centuries. This is something which Hanafees even a thousand years after the invention of there madhab have had to acknowledge. Mulla Ali Qari said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allah has not commanded anyone to become Hanafee, Maalikee, Shaafee or Hanbalee”</em> (Sharh Ayn ul-Ilm p.44)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact even the ardent Hanafee Deobandee Idrees Khan Dehlawee had to admit:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In the era of the companions the four madhabs, Hanafee, Malikee, Shaafee, Hanbalee did not exist”</em> (Ijtihaad and Taqleed p.11)</span></p>
