				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the Sufi burps from halwa and Ghiyarwain indigestion, yes you know what we are talking about, that trademark sufi burp after the sour taste left in the mouth from the previous part, Part 1 <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/part-1-the-anti-wahhabi-salafi-ahmad-raza-khan/">(READ HERE)</a> </span></strong>and that 360 wobbling formation experienced by Mohammad Naveed Ashrafi and the Barelwi chapter, we thought it would be pertinent to open the doors to Barelwi factionalism, real inroads and groundbreaking work in, inciting, hatred, violent and issuing fatawa of disbelief, Kufr and heretic beliefs by the british Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s leaders and their light in shining armour, namely the abhorrent, foul mouth underlings, as you will see. This is real inciting hatred and violence and I hope Bibi Therea May takes note of this Sufi Barelwi violent terror outbursts. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I mean really, where do we start, Barelwi teachings, infested with shirk and bidah are a matrix of confusion. Okay, so lets start with this, Dr. Tahir ul-Qadiri, who is revered amongst the Sufi Barelwi circles, has been</span><span style="color: #000000;"> heavily criticised, reprimanded, refuted, shunned and everything else under the Sun. Why the criticism and flowery words we hear you ask? Well because Dr. &#8216;Sahib&#8217; Tahir ul-Qadiri apart from a catalogue of delusional errors and a crime spree in the Barelwi Mazhab, claimed that it was permissible for Barelwis to pray behind Wahabis (i.e. Sunni&#8217;s). Naturally, there was an outrageous uproar, and so there should be, because years earlier the Barelwi church fathers and holy men issued an legal edict, that whoever prays behind a wahabi will break his nikah, and then divorces and the cursed halalah would ensue due to hanafi teachings, oh dear me what a very messy affair! (pun intended)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So there was an internal backlash and strife (besides other issues which showed Tahir ul-Qadiris leanings towards Shi&#8217;asm, wahdatul Adyan, literally the whole works, even a christmas cake), the major scholars of the Barailwi mazhab issued legals edicts, fatwa, warnings, refutations, radud, radds from their Rad guns which included the burzurgs, Allamahs, Fahamahs, Muftis, Mujaddid Millats, pirs, pirs of tariqats. All claiming Tahir ul-Qadiri has left the teachings of Barelwism and a disgrace to Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan, and thus has no connection to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">you know what, we are the clock on this one, let us just reproduce what they said,</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Scholars who are Against Dr Tahir ul Qadri in India</strong></span></p>
<ol>

</ol>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Calling the above Scholarly Giants and Representatives of Sunni Muslims of the Sub-Continent as ‘Takfiri Mullahs’ and their verdicts as ‘Fatwa Baziyan’ by Dr Tahir ul Qadri and his followers, is an insult to Islamic Learning and ‘Ahl us Sunnah wal Jamah’!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Dear Sunni Brothers and Sisters!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">The combined population under the Six Giant Silsilas (Quadriya, Naqshbandiya, Quadriya Barkatiya, Qyadriya Chsihtiya Ashrafiya, Quadriya Razviya &amp; Quadriya Attariya) of the Indian Sub-continent and represented by the above scholars is 75 % of the total Sunni population, and rejecting this massive ‘Jamah’ is an indication of Astray-ness, because the ‘Jamah’ or overwhelming majority can not be ‘Astray’!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>What is Dr Tahir ul Qadri’s Blunder?</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Opposing the Sunni &amp; Hanafi ‘Ijma’ {Consensus} on the matter of Women’s ‘Diyyat’ (Blood-Money).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Promoting and Advocating Unity with the ‘Rawafiz’ and ‘Tafziliya’ upon whose deviancy and astray-ness, the entire Ummah is Unified! That is, according to Dr Tahir, ‘Truth’ {‘Haqq’} should join hands with ‘Falsehood’ {‘Batil’}!</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Opposing the Sunni Consensus of the Sub-continent on the ‘Kufr’ of 4 leading Deobandi scholars and holding the view that the ‘Deobandiya’ are part of the ‘Ahl us Sunnah’! In short, he defies the combined majority of the Sunni Scholars on the matter. In-short, he opposes ‘Hussam ul Haramayn’ and ‘As Sawarim ul Hindiya’. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Holding the view that Sayyiduna Ali is spiritually more superior to Sayyiduna Abu Bakr, a classic example of his deviancy and upholding the ‘Aqidah’ of ‘Rawafiz’ and ‘Tafziliya’.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Practicing and promoting ‘Rafzi/Shiyi’ practices of ‘Taziya’, ‘Alam, ‘Matam’ and ‘Marsiya Khani’ just as the mainstream ‘Rawafiz’.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Holding the view that the Jews &amp; Christians are among the ‘Believers’ as they too believe in One God, A Prophet and a Book sent by God. In his view, there are Believers (Jews, Christians &amp; Muslims) and Non- Believers (Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Parsis, Atheists, etc). </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Practically implementing and promoting the practice that the Christians be allowed to pray in Masjids, and he allowed them to pray in Masjids operated by his organization.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Propagating and practically implementing the view that Muslims should celebrate the Holy day of Christians, i.e. Christmas – the Birth of Christ, as they celebrate the Birth of Prophet Muhammad.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Based upon the above blunders, deviant views, astray ideology, boastful self-praise, proposing  unity with Heretics and unity with the Blasphemers of the Allah, the Prophet Muhammad ~sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam~, Sayyiduna Abu Bakr, other Sahaba and Awliya; the scholars of ‘Ahl us Sunnah wal Jamah’ declared Dr Tahir ul Qadri out of the pale of ‘Ahl us Sunnah’ and branded him ‘Astray’ and declared him the cardinal pole of Deviancy in present times.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">He falsely claims to represent the School  of Imam Ahmad Raza Khan, boasting that he took ‘Ilm’ from his direct students but in-fact opposes him (Imam Ahmad Raza) and his students on matters upon which they stood all their lives! And deceives Millions of Sunnis claiming to represent the ‘Ahl us Sunnah wal Jamah’ and Imam Ahmad Raza Khan! Recently in Hyderabad, he claimed that he took ‘Ilm’ directly from Imam Ahmad Raza in dream for many years!!!! Imagine the great Imam, the Sword of Allah on the Blasphemers of RasulAllah ~sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam~, the one who refuted all his life the Wahhabiya and Deobandiya &#8211; Sayyidi Imam Ahmad Raza teaching Dr Tahir who advocates the Deobandi and their Big Brothers – the Wahhabiya are from the Ahl us Sunnah! What a Lie!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">For those obsessed with Dr Tahir ul Qadri’s so called learning and speeches may re-call or imagine the past scholars like ‘Dawud Zahiri’, ‘Zamakhshari’, ‘Ibn Hazm’, ‘Ibn Taymiya’, and ‘Ibn Qayyim’ and their knowledge and intellect. Despite of their vast knowledge and numerous books on core topics, they were branded as Heretics and Astray by Sunni Scholars! Why?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">It was because they denied the ‘Ijma’ in some matters and on the other hand advocated new Ideologies alien to Islam and Ahl us Sunnah wal Jamah. The same is the case with Dr Tahir ul Qadri.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">These astray scholars showed their haughtiness, self-praise, over-confidence, boastfulness and self admiration, neglecting the advice of contemporary scholars, jeering at them and not retracting from their wrong positions/views/ ideologies. So does Dr Tahir in present times.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">All of the above scholars were known for their exceptional intellect, reasoning, knowledge, and expertise in Islamic learning, but unfortunately they became Astray and were Branded as Heretics! The same is the case of Dr Tahir ul Qadri in present times, his oration and explanation of intricate matters is sometimes excellent, but the same intellect led him to astray-ness and neither he or his followers pay heed to the advice of the contemporary ‘Ahl us Sunnah’ scholars and retract their positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Thus, it would be fair if we say that:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Dr Tahir ul Qadri is the ‘Dawud Zahiri’, ‘Zamakhshari’, ‘Ibn Hazm’, ‘Ibn Taymiya’, and ‘Ibn Qayyim’ of Present Times!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Just Think!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Isn’t it risky to stick and follow one scholar and oppose scores of other scholars on the same matter? Isn’t it dangerous to hold a view or a stance that only one scholar invents, upholds and propagates defying thousands of other religious authorities?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">If we glance on the public and scholarly following enjoyed by Sunni scholars in the sub-continent in terms of population, we shall find the following heading the list.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Shaykh ul Islam Sayyid Muhammad Madani Miyan Ashrafi Jilani Kichochavi.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Taj ul Islam Mufti Akhtar Raza Khan Qadri Bareilvi.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Shaykh al A’zam Sayyid Izhar Ashraf Ashrafi Jilani Kichochavi.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Ameen al Millat Allama Sayyid Ameen Miyan Barkati Marehravi.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Ghazi al Millat Allama Sayyid Hashmi Miyan Ashrafi Jilani Kichochavi.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Muhaddith al Kabir Allama Mufti Ziya ul Mustafa Qadri Razvi Amjadi A’zami. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;">Ameer al Ahl us Sunnah Allama Ilyas Attar Qadri Razvi, of ‘Dawat al Islami’.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Each of the above has a following of lakhs and crores and represents the different dominant ‘Tariqahs’ of the ‘Ahl us Sunnah wal Jamah’ in the sub-continent and all of the above are Unified upon the fact that Dr Tahir ul Qadri opposes the ‘Sunni’ stance on numerous matters and is Astray.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Dear Sunni Brother and Sisters, leaving these personalities of repute and following a lone scholar is not advisable and worth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Was Salam,</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Basharath Siddiqui Quadri Ashrafi</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dr Tahir al-Qadiri hits back (in urdu)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/x-BqG2dVppE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">we are not going to translate it verbatim but he starts and says about Ala Hazrat, Ahmad Raza Khan, my shaykh the crown jewels i.e. creme de la creme and that he has three separate routes i.e. isnads going back to Ahmad Raza Khan, he says Kiya Batein Karteh hain which would translate to current day language, &#8220;What you smoking blud, you mad, you tripin rudeboi,&#8217; and then he goes onto cite his chains back to Ahmad Raza Khan and says he is the direct student of</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Maulana Zia ud Din Madani who was a direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan Barailwi</span></li>

</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and then, wait for it&#8230;&#8230;.. thats right you&#8217;ve guessed it, another dream story, what another one&#8230;. serious, oh yes, he says </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&#8220;Ahmad Raza Khan gave me his spiritual blessings in my DREAM, directly and made me his student&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">for real, we have to take break now, this is heavy, TIME OUT, we will get back to this, let me just sit down just had a head spin and wobble,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Let us now move onto Mr Mohammad Naveed Ashrafi, the wobbler, this is his refutation of Mr Tahir ul Qadiri</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/t9nKX5M10t0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is what you call dear readers, refuting their own creed, teachings and buzurgs and their holy Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and by Irfan Shah Mashadi, a frequent panelist on Ummah TV, the very channel Mohammad Naveed Ashrafi present his wobblies from, the former, Irfan Shah is famously notorious for having a&#8217; flowery tongue&#8217;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/NB-ngbrNNng?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">and in this video he says Allah swears, what Mazhab are these guys on, oh I remember Barelwism of Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z0gFgDmFjU0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">a simple search on youtube of him will show numerous videos encouraging children to swear etc. these are the teachings of these barelwis and their reality, perhaps we need to talk to the government about safeguarding!!!!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">before we move onto the next part lets see a counter from Dr. Tahir Sahib</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzgjMkGBnzI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and before we leave this unfinished saga, which we will explore in the next part, we would like to show Mohammad Naveed Ashrafi about how his scholars of the Ahle Sunnat wal-Jamat, who appear on his so called Barelwi channel have been actually arrested by Bibi Theresa May&#8217;s and the Quens police despite the fact they denied it, see below (please mute, you know how it is these boys, they just know how to wobble to beats)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrNs5HyEU2s?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not a surprise to most intelligent minds the vile and abhorrent rhetoric that emanates from Mohammad Naveed Ashrafi and his disastrous shenanigans on Ummah channel. His words and comments are well known and inflammatory but Ahl al-Sunnah are well acquainted with this because the forefathers and elders of the Sufi Barelwi sect were indifferent. It is also unsurprising because Naveed Ashrafi is only but treading the path of his elders like Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan who was also very sharp with his tongue and mind as we shall come to see.</p>
<p>Naveed Ashrafi, who has since removed the following post from his facebook, said the following</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-7403 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg?resize=381%2C420" alt="naveed ashrafi" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg?resize=272%2C300 272w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg?resize=768%2C846 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg?resize=930%2C1024 930w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg?w=1440 1440w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg?w=1236 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You see dear readers this is the type of rhetoric that emanates from these so called modern day Sufi Barelwis and although at times it can be overlooked  but sometimes such despicable remarks need to be closed down combined with a basic history lesson on the view of the Sufi Barelwi elders, namely Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi who is considered the patron of the Barelwi sect with its origins in the northern indian state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brailwis.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-148 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brailwis.jpg?resize=300%2C150" alt="brailwis" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brailwis.jpg?resize=300%2C150 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brailwis.jpg?resize=100%2C50 100w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brailwis.jpg?w=660 660w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>The Shrine of Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan, venerated by grave worshippers</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The likes of Naveed Ashrafi and others of his ilk have continuously spewed such hate filled rhetoric at the expense of the Salafi&#8217;s and Ahl al-Hadith, who have unquestionably and undeniably been at the forefront in refuting, reprimanding and curbing the horrendous and despicable crimes of the Khariji terrorist renegades for decades. This Saudi and Wahhabi narrative that is oft repeated will be clarified in subsequent posts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The only thing he did get right, was calling us Salafi&#8217;s, Alhamdulillah even the Mushriks and Mushrik tentacles know we follow the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the Salaf us-Saleh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The point being the inflammatory post of Naveed Ashrafi is a clear manifestation of inciting hate based on fallacious and evil ideas. He was also removed from Ummah channel for 12 months or so, due to this remarks about Ahl al-Sunnah while using derogatory terms, nonetheless Naveed Ashrafi himself is unimportant and insignificant when it comes to this narrative because if we retort back to history and look at the lives and teaching of his forefathers, we will find nothing but Khariji, takfiri, hatred, incitement of violence, discord, slur and discord amongst the muslims as well as general society, even to the extent of creating social upheaval, a basic understanding of living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will inshaAllah show in forthcoming articles how Ahmad Raza Khan disseminated and incited hatred and inter Muslim sectarianism just as his ardent underlings are doing today, under the guise of social cleansing of the Salafi&#8217;s and Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama&#8217;ah on their third grade Channels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, prior to that let us look at what one of their own self professed renegades and the recently shamed, debunked and sour loser of the Tawhid Vs Shirk debate, namely Mr Asrar Rashid said about the position and viewpoint of the Spiritual leader and guide of the Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s ie Ahmad Raza Khan on the British. This is his clarification</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9dfDq3Ge_Rk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So here this representative of the Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s is claiming Ahmad Raza Khan was waging war against the British are (this is what this essentially means) and thus the followers of the Barelwi&#8217;s sect are the ones responsible for the discord and civil unrest in England not the Salafi&#8217;s or as the Mr Ashrafi put it the Wahhabi&#8217;s.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact of the matter is this souls are delusioned and ignorant of the basic facts and realities of their own leaders and spiritual guides and due to their infinite thinking capacity they are unable to think beyond the two words that regurgitate in their minds and tongues, ie Wahhabi&#8217;s and wobblers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ask Mohammad Naveed Ashrafi, beg your Theresa May to shut down and control the ignorant, two faced Barelwi&#8217;s sympathesiers who spew deceptive lies and in reality are the real khawarij renegades.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Mohammed Naveed Ashrafi has called out Bibi Theresa May against the Wahhabi&#8217;s, let us remind her and Mr Ashrafi that sometimes sharp people like Mr Ashrafi himself develop dementia and selective thinking. Overwhelmed by sheer hatred that at times in their unbalanced hormonal rage against the Salafi&#8217;s and Ahl Al Sunnah they forget the finer details of their own ancestry which leads them to their psychotic episodes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If Mohammed Naveed Ashrafi had any knowledge of his Ala Hazrat and his spiritual Pirs grandfather, namely Maulana Raza Ali Khan, he would have known his credentials and &#8216;efforts&#8217; in that he was anti British &amp; a freedom fighter and he also vehemently verified the fatwa of &#8216;Jihad&#8217; against the British Government!!! This information and other details are well documented in numerous books and a basic read of readily available books will churn out ample collaborating statements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bigben_2282465b.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-356 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bigben_2282465b.jpg?resize=300%2C187" alt="bigben_2282465b" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bigben_2282465b.jpg?resize=300%2C187 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bigben_2282465b.jpg?resize=100%2C62 100w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bigben_2282465b.jpg?w=620 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps next time he calls out Wahhabi&#8217;s in his idiotic rage, he might also slip in some history lessons of his shirk infested ancestry when he has a chat with Bibi Therasa May.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">oh yes and also, when the likes of Mohammad Naveed Ashrafi are constantly wobbling back and forth in their Sufi Hadra dances, Zikr Mehfils, esoteric dances and trances resembling the Hindus and Jews as part of their heretical belief system of reaching union with the creator and or his incarnation in them, we should not expect anything less from them after all the activities above except spewing the word, &#8216;wobblers&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84_1422014721.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1415 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84_1422014721.jpg?resize=300%2C150" alt="98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84_1422014721" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84_1422014721.jpg?resize=300%2C150 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84_1422014721.jpg?resize=100%2C50 100w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84_1422014721.jpg?w=660 660w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Please excuse the videos but sometimes people need to be spoken to on their level)</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/IBs35BTKG08?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and for crying out loud, this is a lengthy session on the very same channel Mohammed Naveed Ashrafi regularly appears on while spewing and spluttering his venom against the Muslims.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gk4GGjraKdM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and they call us wobblers &#8211; shamelessness has limits but unfortunately these ill mannered people have redefined it. After spending your lives wobbling and busting moves you have the audacity to call us wobblers? We do not know whether to laugh or to cry at such levels of ignorance which have overtaken the Ummah of Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.</p>
