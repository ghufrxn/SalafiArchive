				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;line-height: normal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: 'Segoe UI','sans-serif'">He was the scholar of Fiqh for the people of Shãm and the first to author books in that country. He was born during the end of the period of the Companions and was from the students of Az-Zuhree and Yahya bin Abi Kathēr. Both of them gave Al &#8216;Awzãee a sahēfah (scripture) containing hadiths and they both permitted him to narrate to the people from these scriptures. Al &#8216;Awzãee used to say,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: 'Segoe UI','sans-serif'">&#8220;We act upon these narrations, but we don&#8217;t narrate them&#8221;.</span></em></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;line-height: normal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: 'Segoe UI','sans-serif'">This is because Al &#8216;Awzãee didn&#8217;t read these suhuf (scriptures) to them, thus it didn&#8217;t please him to narrate from them. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;line-height: normal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: 'Segoe UI','sans-serif'"> Al &#8216;Awzãee had written vast amounts of hadith and sunan in his youth. He wrote fourteen books from his shaykh, Yahya bin Abi Kathēr then they were burnt.  He had a school of thought in Fiqh, just like the four schools of thought and he has followers in Shãm and Spain and then it became extinct. </span></p>

<p><span class="bold">Al-Hafidh Uthman bin Saeed bin Khalid Ad-Darimi As-Sijistani</span><br />
<span class="bold">His Kunya</span>: Abu Saeed (1).<br />
<span class="bold">His Birth</span>: Shortly before 200 Hijri. (2)<br />
He lived in Herat, and traveled many regions, he traveled to Hijaz, Iraq, Sham (3), Egypt, and other countries. He stayed in Jurjan (4) in 273 H. (5)</p>
<p>He met in those lands the prominant Huffadh (scholars of hadith) and Imams, the ones that he learned from:</p>
<p><span class="bold"><span class="artGreen">* In Hijaz:</span></span><br />
&#8211; Ibn Abi Owais.</p>

&#8211; Musa bin Ismail At-Tabudhaki<br />
&#8211; Sulaiman bin Harb<br />
&#8211; Ahmad bin Yunus<br />
And others.</p>
<p><span class="bold"><span class="artGreen"> In Sham:</span></span><br />
&#8211; Yahya bin Saleh<br />
&#8211; Yazid bin Abd Rabeh<br />
&#8211; Haywah bin Shuraih<br />

&#8211; Saeed bin Abi Maryam<br />
&#8211; Abdel Ghaffar bin Dawud<br />
&#8211; Nuaim bin Hammad<br />

<p><span class="bold"><span class="artGreen">He learned Hadith and its sciences</span></span> from:<br />
&#8211; Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal<br />
&#8211; Ishaq bin Rahwaih<br />
&#8211; Yahya bin Ma&#8217;een<br />
&#8211; Ali bin al Madini<br />
And others.</p>
<p>He studied Fiqh under Al-Buwaiti, the companion of Imam Shafi&#8217;i, and Arabic linguistics from Abu Abdullah Ibn Al-A`rabi. (7)</p>
<p><span class="bold">His Students:</span><br />
&#8211; His son: Muhammad bin Uthman. (8)<br />
&#8211; Al Mu&#8217;ammal bin Al-Hasan bin Isaa.<br />
&#8211; Abul Abbas Ahmad bin Al-Azhar.<br />
&#8211; Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Abdoos At-Tara&#8217;ifi.<br />
&#8211; Hamed Ar-Rafa&#8217;<br />
And others. (9)</p>
<p><span class="artRedTitle">His Life And Scholars&#8217; views of Him:</span></p>
<p>&#8211; <span class="artBlue">Ibn Hibban</span> mentioned him in Thiqat (Trustworthy ones), and said: &#8220;One of the Imams of the world, he narrates from Abu al Waleed and the people of Iraq.&#8221; (10)<br />
&#8211; <span class="artBlue">Ya&#8217;qub al Qarrab</span> said: &#8220;I have not seen the like of Uthman b. Sa`id neither has he seen the like of himself. He studied Literature under Ibn Al-A&#8217;rabi, Fiqh under Abu Ya&#8217;qub al-Buwaiti, and Hadith from Yahya bin Ma&#8217;een and Ali bin al Madini. He was leading in these sciences, may Allah have mercy on him.&#8221;<br />
&#8211; Muhammad bin al Mundhir said: &#8220;I heard <span class="artBlue">Abu Zur&#8217;ah Ar-Razi</span>, and I asked him about Uthman bin Saeed, so he said:&#8217; He has been gifted in authoring fine works.&#8217; &#8221;<br />
&#8211; <span class="artBlue">Abul-Fadl al-Jarudi</span> said: &#8220;He was an Imam to be followed in his lifetime and after his death.&#8221;<br />
<span class="artBlue">Al-Hasan bin Saheb Ash-Shashi</span> said: &#8220;I asked Abu Dawud As-Sijistani (11) about Uthman bin Saeed, so he said: &#8216; From him we learned Hadith.&#8217; &#8221; (12)<br />
<span class="artBlue">Abu Hamid Al-A&#8217;mashi said:</span> &#8220;I have not seen from the Muhaditheen anyone like Muhammad bin Yahya, Uthman bin Saeed <span class="artTakhrij">[Ad-Darimi]</span>, and Ya&#8217;qbu bin Sufyan.&#8221; (13)</p>
<p>Abu Uthman As-Sabuni narrated with his own chain that Imam Qutaibah bin Saeed said at the end of his book &#8220;al Iman&#8221;:<br />
&#8220;If you see a man loving Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Malik bin Anas, Al-Awza&#8217;i&#8230;&#8221; and he mentioned a number of Imams, then he said: &#8220;Then know that He is upon the Sunnah.&#8221; Then <span class="artBlue">Abu Uthman As-Sabuni</span> said: &#8220;And I added to those that Qutaibah rahimahulllah mentioned: That whomever loves them, he is upon the Sunnah, from the Imam of Hadith whom are to be followed, and to be upon their guidance&#8230; from them are: Muhammad bin Idrees Ash-Shafi&#8217;i&#8230;&#8221; and he mentioned a number of scholars, from them was: Uthman bin Saeed Ad-Darimi. (14)</p>
<p><span class="artBlue">Adh-Dhahabi</span> said about him: &#8220;The Imam, Allamah, the Hafidh, the Critic &#8230; he was persevere upon the Sunnah, and well-versed in debating.&#8221;<br />
He also said: &#8220;Uthman ad-Darimi was like a tree trunk in the eyes of the innovators&#8217; (15), and it was said that he is the one who stood up against Muhammad bin Karram &#8211; whom the sect al-Karramiyah are attributed to &#8211; and exiled him from Herat.&#8221; (16)</p>
<p><span class="artBlue">Taj Ad-Deen As-Subki</span> said about him: &#8220;One of the Trustworthy scholars, and whom was mentioned by Al-Abbadi in his &#8220;Tabaqat&#8221; saying: &#8216; The Imam of Hadith and Fiqh&#8230;) (17)</p>
<p><span class="artBlue">Al-Hasan Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Abdoos</span> said:<br />
&#8220;When I wanted to travel to Uthman bin Saeed Ad-Darmi, I came to Abu Bakr Muhammad b. Ishaq b. Khuzaimah, and I asked him to write to him for me, so he wrote to him. I entered Herat in Rabee&#8217; al Awwal, 280 H. I went to Uthman bin Saeed, and delivered the letter to him. He read it and welcomed me, and asked me how Abu Bakr Ibn Khuzaimah was doing, then he said to me: &#8216;When did you arrive?&#8217;<br />
I said: Tomorrow.<br />
He said: &#8216;My son, go back to them, for you haven&#8217;t come yet.&#8217;<br />
so I got embarrassed.<br />
Then he said: &#8216; Don&#8217;t be shy my son, for I have resided in your country for two years, and your shaikhs at that time were able to bear from me things like this.&#8217; &#8221; (18)</p>
<p><span class="bold">His Works:</span><br />
&#8211; A large Musnad (19)<br />
&#8211; Ar-Rad ala al-Jahmiya (Refuting Jahmiya)<br />
&#8211; Naqd or Ar-Rad ala Bishr al Mirrisi (Replying to the heretic Bishr al Mirrisi d. 218 H.) (20)</p>
<p><span class="bold">His Death:</span><br />
He passed away in Dhul Hijjah, 280 Hijri.</p>
<p><span class="artRedTitle">His Statments in Some Matters of Belief (Aqeedah)</span> :</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">&#8211; Tawheed:</span><br />
Uthman Ad-Darimi said: &#8220;And the meaning of Tawheed in the Ummah is saying: &#8216;La Ilaha Illa Allah Wahdahu La Sharika Lahu&#8217; (21).&#8221; (22)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">&#8211; Istiwa and Allah&#8217;s Elevation:</span><br />
He said:<br />
&#8220;And the Muslims have agreed that Allah is above His Throne, above His Heavens.&#8221; (23)<br />
&#8220;And we knew, with no doubt, that Allah is above His Throne, above His Heavens, like He described Himself, separate from His creation.&#8221; (24)<br />
&#8220;For Allah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;la is above His Throne, above His Heavens, separate from His creation, so whoever doesn&#8217;t know Him like this, then he doesn&#8217;t know His God Whom he worships.&#8221; (25)<br />
He said in regards to Allah&#8217;s saying -translation of the meaning-: <span class="artAya">{And Pharoah said, &#8220;O Haman, construct for me a tower that I might reach the ways * The ways of the heavens, so that I may look at the God (Ilah) of Moses, but indeed, I think he is a liar.&#8221;}</span> <span class="artTakhrij">[40:36-37]</span> :<br />
&#8220;In these ayat is a clear explanation, and an obvious indicator that Musa was calling Fir&#8217;awn (Pharoah) to know that Allah is above the heaven, and because of that, he (Fir&#8217;awn) ordered to build a big tower, and wanted to see Him (Allah Ta&#8217;ala).&#8221; (26)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">Allah being with His creation -Ma`iyyah-</span>:<br />
He said: «Some of them said: Let&#8217;s put aside the interpretation of scholars, we only depended on the Quran for evidence, so bring the Book of Allah. We said: ‘yes … however, you are ignorant of its meaning, so strayed from the straight path, and you clung to the middle of the ayah, and deliberately overlooked its beginning and its ending, because Allah –Azza wa Jal- began the verse with His knowledge of them, and ended it with that, He said: <span class="artAya">{Have you not seen that Allah knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth? There is no Najwa (secret counsel) of three, but He is their fourth&#8230;}</span> until His saying: <span class="artAya">{and afterwards on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they did. Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of everything}</span>, so this is evidence that He meant His knowledge of them and their deeds, not that He Himself is in every place with them as you claim.» (27)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">On Tashbih in Allah&#8217;s Attributes</span>:<br />
He said:<br />
<span class="artAthar">«As there is nothing like Him (Allah), thus there is no hand like His Hand.»</span> (28)<br />
<span class="artAthar">«As there is nothing like Him, there is no hearing like His Hearing, nor sight like His Sight, and there is nothing in creation that they can be compared, or likened or resembled to.»</span> (29)<br />
<span class="artAthar">«All of these ahadeeth, and even more than it, mention the descending of the Lord, Most High; and the people of Fiqh and knowledge from our scholarly teachers are upon believing in them; none of them deny any of these ahadeeth or refrained from narrating them until this group (i.e. jahmiyyah) appeared, who then opposed the ahadeeth of the Messenger of Allah and expended great effort to oppose them, so they questioned: ‘How does He descend?’, to which we replied: ‘We were not commanded to know how He descends in our Religion, and our minds cannot comprehend/grasp it, and there is no creation that is equal to Him that we may equate His acts or attributes with.»</span> (30)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">On Seeing Allah in the Hereafter</span>:<br />
«When Allah put a restriction for seeing Him in the Hereafter with His saying: <span class="artAya">{Looking (ila) at their Lord (Allâh)}</span> (i.e. with the preposition “ila” which means to/towards), we knew that it is the seeing of the eyes.» (31)</p>

And here, Hafidh Adh-Dhahabi used the &#8220;tree trunk&#8221; instead of the &#8220;speck&#8221; as an exaggeration, to show how much pain he was to the people of innovation, because he stood up to them strongly, and was severe against their innovations.<br />

<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Abdul Hamid Ibn Abdurahman: One Hadith</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[63] From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Abdulhamid Ibn Abdurahman Ibn Zayd Ibn al-Khatab from Abdullah Ibn Abdullah Ibn al-Harith Ibn Nawfal from Abdullah Ibn Abas that Umar Ibn al-Khatab (Radi Allahu Anhu) set out for ash-Sham and when he was at Sargh, near Tabuk, the commanders of the army, Abu Ubaydah Ibn al-Jarah (Radi Allahu Anhu) and his companions, met him and told him that the plague had broken out in ash-Sham. Ibn Abas (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8220;Umar Ibn al-Khatab (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8216;(Call) all the first Muhajir unto me.&#8217; He assembled them and asked them for advice, informing them that the plague had broken out in ash-Sham. They disagreed (had a difference of opinion). Some said, &#8216;You have set out for something, and we do not think that you should leave it.&#8217; Others said, &#8216;You have the companions of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) and the rest of the people with you, and we do not think that you should send them towards this plague.&#8217; Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8216;Leave me.&#8217; Then he said, &#8216;(Call) Summon the Ansar to me.&#8217; They were summoned and he asked them for advice. They acted as the Muhajirun had and disagreed (had a difference of opinion) as they had disagreed. He said, &#8216;Leave me.&#8217; &#8220;Then he said, &#8216;Summon to me whoever is here of the aged men of Quraysh from the Muhajirun of the conquest.&#8217; He summoned them and not one of them differed (had a difference of opinion). They said, &#8216;We think that you should withdraw the people and not send them towards the plague.&#8217; Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) called out to the people, &#8216;I am leaving by camel in the morning,&#8217; so they set out. Abu Ubaydah (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8216;Is it flight from the decree of Allah?&#8217; Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8216;Better that someone other than you had said it, Abu Ubaydah. Yes. We flee from the decree of Allah to the decree of Allah. What would you think if these camels had gone down into a valley which had two slopes, one of them fertile, and the other barren. If you pastured in the fertile part, wouldn&#8217;t you pasture them by the decree of Allah? If you pastured them in the barren part, wouldn&#8217;t you pasture them by the decree of Allah?&#8217; &#8221;(then Ibn Abas (Radi Allahu Anhu) said) Abd ar-Rahman Ibn Awf (Radi Allahu Anhu) arrived and he had been off doing something and he said, &#8216;I have some knowledge of this. I heard the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) say, &#8220;If you hear about it (a plague) in a land, do not go forward to it. If it comes upon a land and you are in it, then do not depart in flight from it.&#8221; (Ibn Abas (Radi Allahu Anhu) said) &#8216;So Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) praised Allah and then set off.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Abdul Hamid Ibn Abd ur-Rahman) in Bayhaqi (7/217, 218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 2/894- 896 hadith no.1720, book 45, chapter 7, hadith no.22, and in it: (the words) fadaaw tahum (is present) instead of fadaaw hum) at-Tamhid (8/361 &#8211; 363) al-Istidhkar: (no.1652)          </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.5729) and Muslim (no.2219) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) There are some points of wisdom in people not going to the place where a plague (epidemic) has broken out and occurred in that area and for the people to not run away from there who live in that area where the plague has occurred (and stay there instead) for example: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">a. If this illness (plague) spreads and affects someone who is outside the affected area then his aqidah can become corrupt that this illness is infectious and has the capability to cause many people to become ill. This situation is the same for the person who gets infected by coming into the area where the plague is, therefore this prevents bad and corrupt aqidah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">b. Chaos, turmoil and fear is not spread.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Even if an authentic hadith is a Khabar Wahid, it is a proof because Umar (RadiAllahu Anhu) acted upon the hadith narrated by one companion Abd ur-Rahman Ibn Awf (RadiAllahu Anhu). See hadith (no.9)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) Those who are in power should act upon the advice of the people of solution and agreement in ijtihadi affairs (matters).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The general Muslims should consult their reliable and upright brothers in important matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) If there is no clear proof for an issue in the Qur’an, Sunnah or Ijma then a general proof can be used as evidence or ijtihad can be done.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) The real knowledge is the Qur’an and hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) It is possible that a smaller scholar has knowledge of a proof which a bigger scholar doesn’t have.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani (the false Prophet) writes in contradiction to this authentic hadith that, “And I know that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said when a plague occurs in any place then the people of that city should leave the city without stopping otherwise they will be amongst those who fight against Allah the Most High.” (Majmu&#8217;ah Ishtiharat vol.2 pg.713) Mirza’s explanation here is a complete and utter lie.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">9) After acquiring knowledge of the Hadith of the Messenger’s (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) one should submit and accept it immediately instead of saying he said and such and such said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">10) In the blessed era of the noble companions there was nothing called taqlid (blind following).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Asaakir narrated this from Muhammad Ibn Abdurahmaan Ibn Ubaydullah al-Qattaan (Tareekh Dimishq (1/102)) and Abul Abbaas Muhammad Ibn Ya’qoob al-Asam narrated this from Abbaas Ibn Waleed Ibn Mazeed (Juz al-Asim: (no.51), also Haakim (4/509) hadeeth (no.8554) Bayhaqee (Dalail an-Nubuwah (6/448)) and Aboo Na’eem al-Isbahaanee (Hilyatul Awliyaa (5/252) and other than them have transmitted it from the chain of Sa’eed Ibn Abdul Azeez from Yunus Ibn Maysarah Ibn Halbis from Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and both Haakim and Dhahabee have declared it authentic on the conditions of Bukharee and Muslim! </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Both of these chains (of Bayhaqee and Asim) are <i>[Hasan]</i> good.  </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[BIOGRAPHY OF THE NARRATOR OF THE HADEETH]  </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A Summarised comprehensive discussion of Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) is as follows: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Name and lineage:</b>    </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Muhammad Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas Ibn Waa’il Ibn Haashim Ibn Sa’eed Ibn Sa’d Ibn Sahm Ibn Amr Ibn Hasees Ibn Ka’b Ibn Lu’ay Ibn Ghaalib al-Qurashee as-Sahmee al-Makkee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Students: </b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Aboo Umaamah As’ad Ibn Sahl Ibn Haneef (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), Anas Ibn Maalik (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), Jubayr Ibn Nafeer al-Hadhramee, al-Hasan al-Basree, Humayd Ibn Abdurahmaan Ibn Awf, Zar Ibn Jaysh al-Asadee, Saalim Ibn Abee al-Ja’d, as-Saa’ib Ibn Furookh ash-Shaa’ir, Sa’eed Ibn Musayyab, Shuayb Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas Waalid Amr Ibn Shuayb, Ta’oos Ibn Kaysaan, Aamir ash-Shu’bee, Abdullah Ibn Buraydah al-Aslamee, Abdullah Ibn Ubaydullah Ibn Abee Maleekah, Ataa Ibn Abee Rabaah, Ikrimah Mawlah Ibn Abbaas, Amr Ibn Deenar al-Makkee, Qaasim Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abee Bakr as-Siddeeq, Mujahid Ibn Jabr, Masrooq and Abu Burdah Ibn Abee Musa al-Ash’aree and other than them. Rahimahullah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Virtues:</b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) gave Abdullah Ibn Amr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) permission to write his hadeeth. (Sunan Abee Dawood: (no.3646) and its chain is authentic, Musnad Ahmad (2/162) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. Aboo Hurayrah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, “There is none among the companions of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) who has narrated more Hadiths than I, except `Abdullah bin `Amr (bin Al-`As) who used to write them and I did not.” (Saheeh Bukharee (no.113) His written collection is famously known as as-Saheefah as-Saadiqah from the chain of Amr Ibn Shuayb from his father from his grandfather. (Also see al-Muwatta, Ibn al-Qaasim’s narration with my verification (pg.49-50) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. Handhalah Ibn Khuwaylid al-Anmbaree (al-Ghazzee/<i>Thiqah</i>) narrated: “I was with Mu’awiyah (Radiullahu anhu) and two men came arguing about the (cutting off the) head of Ammaar (Ibn Yassaar (Radiullahu anhu), both of these men were claiming to have killed him. Then Abdullah Ibn Amr (Radiullahu anhu) said, “Whichever one of you wants to be happy, then be happy (!) because I heard the Messenger of Allah (Sallalaahu Alayhee wa sallam) say, “a rebel (rebellious, insurgent) group will kill him (Ammaar (Radiullahu anhu).” Mu’awiyah (Radiullahu anhu) said, “Why are you with us (in the battle of Sifin)?”  He (Abdullah Ibn Amr (Radiullahu anhu) replied, “My father complained to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalaahu Alayhee wa sallam) about me, so he said (to me), “whilst your father is alive then obey (listen and follow him) and don’t disobey him”. So (that’s why) I am with you and I don’t kill and fight.” (Musnad al-Imaam Ahmad (2/164-165) hadeeth (no.6538) and its chain is authentic). Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, “What is my connection with Sifin and what is my connection with killing and fighting the muslims? I wish that I died 10 years ago. By Allah! I didn’t strike a sword in this (battle), nor throw a spear and neither did I shoot an arrow. (Tabaqaat Ibn Sa’d (4/266) and its chain is authentic)    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Knowledge of narrations:</b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The number of his narrations is 700 from which 7 are in the in the Saheehayn (TN. Saheehayn means the two Saheehs i.e. Saheeh Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Death:</b><b> </b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the incident (event) of Hirrah, Dhul Hijjah 63 Hijri (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a major difference of opinion as to when he died and the writer of this book has given preference the saying of Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. And Allah knows best. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>It is not allowed to go to an area where there is a plague and to run away from it (if you are there when the plague breaks out)</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #000080">Abdullah Ibn Amir Ibn Rabia al-Adawi: One hadith</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[9] From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Abdullah Ibn Amir Ibn Rabia that Umar Ibn al-Khattab (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) went out to ash-Sham. When he came to Sargh, near Tabuk, he heard that the plague had broken out in ash-Sham. Abd ar-Rahman Ibn Awf (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) told him that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, &#8220;If you hear that a land has a plague in it, do not go forward to it. If it comes upon a land which you are in, do not depart in flight from it.&#8221; So Umar Ibn al-Khattab (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) came back from Sargh. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> <span style="color: #000000">– [SAHIH]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000"><span style="line-height: 1.5">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing this hadith with al-Qadhi Ahmad Ibn Mohammed Ibn Esa al-Burti in the Musnad of Abdurahman Ibn Awf (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) (no.6) and its chain is </span><em style="line-height: 1.5">[Hasan]</em><span style="line-height: 1.5"> good</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/896,897 hadith no.1722, book 45, chapter 7, hadith no.24) at-Tamhid (6/210) and al-Istidhkar (no.1654)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.5730, no.6973) and Muslim (no.2219) from the hadith of Malik</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADEETH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Salim Ibn Abdullah Ibn Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrated that because of the hadith of Abdurahman Ibn Awf (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) returned back. (Sahih Bukhari: (no.6973) and Sahih Muslim: (100/2219) this is the one of the most highest examples of following of the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Khabr Wahid is a proof with the condition that the person narrating is reliable and trustworthy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) If a person becomes victim to a plague</span><span style="color: #000000"> the area they are in, it is possible the person&#8217;s belief can become corrupt. Perhaps this is the reason why it is forbidden to go to the area where there is a plague or to leave that area (if you are there when the plague breaks out).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) This is an example of the love the companions (RadhiAllaahu Anhum) had for the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam)</span></p>
