				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question: </strong>How can we make a combination between the report <strong>&#8220;with His left Hand&#8221;</strong>, mentioned in the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa, in <em>Saheeh Muslim </em>and his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, saying: <strong>&#8220;And both His hands are right-handed?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>There is no contradiction between the two hadeeths that is apparent on the outset. Thus his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, saying: <strong>&#8220;And both His hands are right-handed&#8221; </strong>is an affirmation of Allaah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]
<p>So this description, which the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has informed us of is an affirmation of Allaah&#8217;s removal from any anthropomorphic qualities. Thus, the hand of Allaah is not like the hand of a human being – left-handed and righthanded.</p>
<p>On the contrary, <em>both </em>His hands are right-handed, may He be far removed from any defects.</p>
<p>As for the other point, then it is that the report: <strong>&#8220;with His left hand&#8221; </strong>is <em>shaadh</em>,<sup>1</sup> as I have clarified in the checking of &#8220;<em>Al-Mustalahaat-ul-Arba&#8217;ah Al-Waaridah feel-Qur&#8217;aan</em>&#8221; (no. 1) of Al-Mawdoodee.</p>
<p>What further supports this is that Abu Dawood also reported this hadeeth and (in it, he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said, <strong>&#8220;with His other hand&#8221; </strong>in the place of <strong>&#8220;with His left hand.&#8221; </strong>This report is in conformity with his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, other saying: <strong>&#8220;And both His hands are righthanded.&#8221; </strong>And Allaah knows best.</p>
[<strong><em>Al-Asaalah</em></strong>, Issue #4]
<p>Footnotes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Translator&#8217;s Note: A <em>shaadh </em>hadeeth is a hadeeth reported by a reliable narrator, which contradicts (the report of) a narrator that is more trustworthy than him.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><br />
Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Just as Imam Ibn Hibban was lenient and soft in praising and commending narrators he was also very strict and harsh in dispraising and criticising them in numerous places. The majority of the scholars of Hadith have categorised mudallis narrators in a number of levels or categories and one should refer to Tabaqat al-Mudallisin of Hafiz Ibn Hajr for such categorisations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari the great researcher and mujtahid said about Imam Sufyan al-Thawri,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;His tadlis was very little.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise Imam Ibn Ma&#8217;in also accepted and took the narrations of Sufyan al-Thawri which he narrated as AnAna i.e. the narrations he did tadlis in and you can refer to Ibn Rajabs Sharh of E&#8217;llal Tirmidhi for this. This is the reason why Hafiz Ibn Hajr categorised Imam Sufyan al-Thawri in the second level of narrators in his Tabaqat al-Mudallisin thus he and other Imams of Hadith accepted his narrations of AnAna as if he had heard them directly. Therefore, the opinion of Imam Ibn Hibban holds no weight compared to the position of the majority of the scholars of Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is further remarkable is that I have all of the Sahih Ibn Hibban and I have read all of it, he presents narrations of mudallis narrators who are of the third level in so many places as evidence to conflicting issues and he also grades the narrations as Sahih i.e. authentic. The reports are such that the narrators do not clearly say they heard the reports directly, this is something you can read for yourself. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, when Imam Ibn Hibban not follow through with this rule himself, how can his mere opinion be imposed as evidence or proof on others when the majority of the scholars of Hadith oppose him.   </span></p>
