<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Question:</strong> If the lower garment is raised above the knees is wudhu invalidated? What part of the body if uncovered invalidates wudhu? Does raising the lower garment to the thighs break and invalidate wudhu?</span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Answer:</strong> Wudhu is not invalidated, nor does it break If garments or clothes are raised above the knees or to the thighs, or if private parts are uncovered. This means a person’s wudhu does not break if clothes are removed from these body parts. However, if a person touches his private parts without clothes (or a barrier) then it is necessary for him to renew or repeat his wudhu. The Noble Prophet ﷺ said,</span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>Whoever touched his private parts should perform wudhu</em>. (Sharh Ma’ani al-Athar, 1/58, Chapter, does touching the private parts obligate Wudhu or not).      </span></h4>

Performing the ablution thoroughly despite difficulties, taking a lot of paces towards the Masjid, and waiting for the next prayer after observing a prayer, and that is Ribat (Preparation for Jihad which is performed by guarding the Muslim borders), that is Ribat, that is Ribat.</span><br />

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES] &#8211; [MUSLIM]</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (1/161 hadith no.385, book 9, chapter 18, hadith no.55), at-Tamhid (20/222) al-Istidhkar (no.355)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Muslim (no.251) from the hadith of Malik </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) The scholar can ask his students questions in order to make them understand an issue. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) This is an excellent hadith from the many ahadith which are to do with virtuous deeds. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) The meaning of performing the ablution thoroughly is to do it in accordance to the Sunnah of the noble Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) so that no body part is left dry and no Sunnah is left out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The meaning of difficulties is the cold (water or weather) etc. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) The meaning of Ribat is to guard the Muslim borders and likewise preparing for the Salah and waiting for the next Salah is also Ribat. Walhamdullilah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">T.N &#8211; There are two meanings of Ribat. One is to provide security and defense on the Islamic borders. The other is to prevent your nafs from those desires which are not allowed and not failing in this. Just as someone performs Jihad upon the nafs and this Mujahadah on the nafs is equivalent in reward to Jihad in Allah’s cause. Therefore it is mentioned in the Qur’an, “…She was very near to disclose his (case, i.e. the child is her son), had We not strengthened (and fortified) her heart (with Faith)…” (28:10) and Allah says, “…and to strengthen (and fortify) your hearts…” and there is also an indication to this meaning in another place in the Qur’an, “…For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Ruh (proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself…” (58:22) because their hearts were not like this previously, “…and their hearts are empty like the wind…” and from this the expression ‘Fulanun Rabitul Ja’sh’ is derived, which means a person who has a firm and strong heart. So by performing the above mentioned actions in the hadith one&#8217;s heart will remain firm and strong on the religion of Islam. For more details see the letters Raa Baa Taa in Imam Raghib al-Isfahani&#8217;s book Mufradatul Qur&#8217;an. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) The longer the distance it is to reach to the Masjid for you the more reward you will obtain. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) Abu Bakr Ibn Abdurahman (Tabi&#8217;i) said, &#8220;Someone who goes to the mosque in the morning or the afternoon with no intention of going anywhere else, either to learn good or teach it, is like someone who does jihad in the way of Allah and returns with booty.&#8221; (al-Muwatta 1/160, 161 hadith no.383 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Sahih]</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) Abu Hurairah (Radi Allahu Anhu) used to say, &#8220;If any one of you prays and then sits down in the spot where he has prayed, the angels ask blessings on him saying, &#8216;Allah, forgive him. Allah, have mercy on him.&#8217; And if he moves from the spot where he has prayed and sits elsewhere in the Masjid waiting for the prayer, he remains in prayer until he prays.&#8221; (al-Muwatta 1/161 hadith no.384 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Sahih]</em>)</span></p>

Later on (a pot full of) water for ablution was brought to Allah&#8217;s (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). He put his hand in that pot and ordered the people to perform ablution from it. I saw the water springing out from underneath his fingers till all of them performed the ablution (it was one of the miracles of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam).</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.169) and Muslim (no.2279) from the hadith of Malik</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) From this <em>[Sahih]</em> authentic hadith it is known that Allah made a miracle occur to His beloved Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) by allowing a spring of water to flow through his blessed fingers. Therefore this hadith is a great proof from the many proofs of the true Prophethood and Messengership of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) The distinguishing feature of the people of Iman is that they have full Iman in the Majestic Quran and authentic ahadith and they don&#8217;t have any type of doubt. Whilst the distinguishing feature of those who reject the Quran and Sunnah is that they do not have Iman in the Majestic Quran, authentic ahadith and established miracles due to their own so called wisdom. Rather they try to refute and reject them because of their atheistic interpretations and standards of mystical thoughts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) An individual should try their best to perform all the apparent causes along with making dua. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) Allah is the creator of nature and the laws surrounding it. Whenever and whatever He intends to do something, it happens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) It is allowed for a lot people to do Wudhu from one vessel. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) In some authentic narrations it is mentioned that the number of people who did Wudhu was around 70. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) There are many other narrations which mention the same type of miracle occurring. For example during the pledge of Ridwan Allah allowed a spring of water to flow from a vessel when the the fingers of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was put inside it and around 1500 companions drank water to their fill. For details see Imam Bayhaqi&#8217;s book Dala&#8217;il an-Nubuwah.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) One should exert all effort and strength to find water and perform wudhu with it in order to pray Salah. It is only allowed to perform tayamum when one cannot find water. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Hadith no.69 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Wiping the neck (in wudhu) is a means of protection against being shackled (on the day of judgement)”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Tahqiq  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith is fabricated (Mawdu). Imam an-Nawawi has declared it to be fabricated (Mawdu) in al-Majmu Sharh al-Muhadhab (1/465). In addition he clarified and explained that this is not the speech of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Also, Imam Suyuti has quoted the saying of Imam an-Nawawi in Dhayl al-Ahaadeeth al-Mawduah (pg no.203) and confirmed the same. Ibn Hajr has briefly mentioned in Talkhis al-Habir (1/423) that Abu Muhamad Juwayni is the one who has mentioned this hadith and he has made it clear that the Imams of hadith do not look favourably on the chain of this narration. Imam Gazali has mentioned this hadith in Wasit and Ibn Salah has followed up on this and has explained that this hadith is not recognised to be from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) but rather it is the saying of some of the scholars from the salaf. Ibn Hajr has said that (Ibn Salah) probably meant (and was referring to the statement which is in) Kitab al-Tahur by Abu Ubayd that from Abdurahman Ibn Mahdi from Mas’udi from Qasim Ibn Abdurahman from Musa Ibn Talha who said ‘Whosoever wipes the neck along with wiping the head he will be protected from being shackled on the day of judgement’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: It is possible to say that though it is a chain of transmission that stops at a Companion (Mawquf), it can take the ruling of having the strength of a hadith that goes back to the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) (Marfu), since this type of information cannot be obtained on the basis of personal opinion and therefore this would make it mursal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: The narrator Mas’udi suffered from a lot of confusion in making mistakes therefore his hadith that are Marfu are not classified as being a proof therefore how can a Mawquf (hadith) become a proof? Ibn Hajr (1/434 – 453), explained that Abu Nu’aim mentioned in Tarikh Isbahan that Muhamad Ibn Ahmad narrated to us he said that, Abdurahman Ibn Dawud narrated to us he said that, Uthman Ibn Khardhad narrated to us that, Umar Ibn Muhamad Ibn Hasan narrated to us he said that, Muhamad Ibn Amr Ibn Ansari narrated to us from Anas Ibn Sirin from Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) that when Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) used to do wudhu he would wipe his neck and would mention the saying of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) that whosoever performs wudhu and wipes his neck then a shackle will not be placed on his neck on the day of judgement. Also it is in ar-Rumani’s book al-Bahr that I saw a small booklet which Abul Husain Ibn Faris narrated from the chain of Fulaij Ibn Sulaiman from Nafi’ from Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, ‘Whosoever performs wudhu and wipes his neck with his hands then he will be protected from having a shackle on his neck on the day of judgment’ then he said insha Allah this hadith is Sahih.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: There is a distance the size of an enormous desert between Ibn Faris and Fulaij. It should be noted that who are those narrators between them which have not been mentioned.                     </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: In Mawdu’at (pg no.73) Shaikh Ali Qari has attributed the hadith of Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) to Musnad al-Firdaws and declared the chain as being Da’if.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: The root cause of the problem in this hadith is Muhamad Ibn Amr al-Ansari. He is Abu Sahl Basri whose weakness has been agreed upon and therefore Yahya Ibn Sa’id declared him to be at the highest level of weakness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also he said that he narrated unfamiliar hadith from Hasan and Abu Nu’aim’s Shaikh is also Da’if and his name is Muhamad Ibn Ahmad Ibn Ali Ibn al-Muharam. Imam Dhahabi has wrote in Mizan that he is from the Kibar teachers of Abu Nu’aim. Imam Daraqutni has narrated from him and declared him Da’if. Birqani said that there is no harm in him. Ibn al-Fawaris said that there was nothing good concerning him rather he is Da’if. Ibn Iraqi said in Tanzi ash-Sharia (2/75), after mentioning the narration of Abu Nu’aim from Tarikh, that it has Abu Bakr al-Mufid who is Abu Nu’aim’s Shaikh. Ibn Iraqi said that the problem in this hadith is this person. A more detailed tahqiq of this hadith will be come under the hadith no.755 insha Allah Ta’ala.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: This type of hadith is classified as being Munkar especially when it goes against all the hadith which show how the wudhu of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was and none of those hadith mention the wiping of the neck. However it is in the hadith of Talha Ibn Musarif that he narrates from his father from his grandfather that he said, I saw the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) wipe his head only once until his hands reached his nape (the back of his head). In another narration he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) used to wipe his head starting from the front to the back part of the head until both his hands went past under his ears. This hadith has been mentioned by Abu Dawud and other Muhadithin. It is said from Ibn Uyaynah that he regarded this narration as being Munkar and it is appropriate to declare this hadith as being Munkar because it has 3 hidden defects (‘Ilahs) each ‘Ilah has the capacity to make it Da’if so how can this hadith not be Da’if whilst there are three ‘Ilahs present in it. In this hadith there is weakness, Jahalah and there is a difference of opinion on whether Musarif’s father was a companion or not. This is the reason why Imam Nawawi, Imam Ibn Taymiyah, Hafidh Ibn Hajr Asqalani and other Muhadithin have declared it to be Da’if. I have explained the weakness in Da’if Sunan Abi Dawud (no.15).</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"> Issue: Pertaining To Wiping Over The Neck (In Wudhu)</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is in Fatawa Qadhi Khan no.18 and Tatar Khaniya from Fatawa Khaniya no.15, and Qadhi Khan from Kabiri Halabi no.24 that wiping the neck is not Sunnah and not Adab (T.N. Adab is that which the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) did only once or twice throughout his life. It is a rewardable act with no reproach for one who abandons it. It has also been defined as praiseworthy manners.). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is mentioned in Fathul Qadir no.14 that this is a Bid’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is mentioned in Tatar Khaniya that Imam Muhamad did not mention about wiping on the neck at all in his book al-Asl. Malasikin and other than him have also said the same. In addition there is no authentic hadith that has been reported from him about wiping the neck on its own.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Qayim said in Zadul Ma’ad that there are no authentic ahaadeeth established from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) about wiping the neck.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is mentioned in Talkhis Ibn Hajr said that Qadhi Abu Tayib said there is no sunnah established on this issue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is mentioned in Sharh Muhadhab that there is nothing established from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) on this issue. This is not a sunnah rather it is a bid’ah.</span></p>
