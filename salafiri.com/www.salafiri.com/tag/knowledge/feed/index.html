<em>[ابن المبارك (٦١) والطبراني (٢٢/٣٦١) والجامع لأخلاق الراوي (١٥٩) بأسانيد حسنة]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>The Prophet ﷺ said: &#8220;From the signs of the hour are three, one of them is that people will take knowledge from the Ṣaghāir&#8221; </strong><em>[Ibn al-Mubārak 61, al-Ṭabarānī 22/361, al-Jāmi&#8217; li akhlāq al-Rāwī 159 with Ḥasan asānīd]</em><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right">قِيلَ لِابْنِ ‌الْمُبَارَكِ: ‌مَنِ ‌الْأَصَاغِرُ؟ قَالَ: الَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ بِرَأْيِهِمْ<em> [الجامع لأخلاق الراوي (١٠٥٢) وسنده صحيح]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Ibn al-Mubārak was asked &#8220;Who are the Ṣaghāir?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Those who say from their opinions&#8221; </strong><em>[al-Jāmi&#8217; li akhlāq al-Rāwī 1052 with Ṣaḥīḥ Isnād]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">قَالَ أَبُو صَالِحٍ: فَسَأَلْتُ ابْنَ الْمُبَارَكِ: مَنِ ‌الْأَصَاغِرُ؟ قَالَ: أَهْلُ الْبِدَعِ <em>[الجامع لأخلاق الراوي (١٦٠) وسنده صحيح]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">(In another narration)<strong> Abū Ṣāliḥ (Maḥbūb bin Mūsā) said: I asked Ibn al-Mubārak &#8220;who are the Ṣaghāir?&#8221; He said: &#8220;The people of Bid&#8217;ah&#8221; </strong><em>[al-Jāmi&#8217; li akhlāq al-Rāwī 160 with Ṣaḥīḥ Isnād]</em></p>

<p>&#8216;Abdurraḥmān ibn Mahdī رحمه الله said:<br />
<strong> &#8220;It is Ḥarām for a man to talk about matters of religion except what he heard from a trustworthy person&#8221; </strong><em>[Ḥilyat al-Awliyā 9/3; Isnād Ṣaḥīḥ]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">قال ابن سيرين: إنّ هذا ‌العلم ‌دين فانظروا عَمَّن تأخذونه <em>[ابن سعد (٩/ ١٩٣) وابن أبي شيبة (٢٨٣٣٦) والكامل لابن عدي (١/ ٢٥٣) والعلل لأحمد (٤١٩٩) والجرح والتعديل (٢/ ١٥) ومقدمة صحيح مسلم والشمائل المحمدية (٤١٧) ومعجم ابن الأعرابي (١٦١٣) والمجروحين (١/ ٢٧) والمدخل للبيهقي (٤٨٣) والفقيه والمتفقه (٢/ ١٩١) والكفاية (ص ١٢١) بأسانيد جياد]</em></p>

<p>Ibn Mas&#8217;ūd رضي الله عنه said:<br />
<strong> &#8220;People will be upon goodness as long as knowledge comes from their seniors and their Salaf. When they get it from their Ṣaghāir, they get destroyed&#8221; </strong><em>[al-Ṭabarānī 8591, Jāmi&#8217; Bayān al-&#8216;ilm 1057, al-Kāmil by ibn &#8216;Adī 1/260]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">قال ابن قتيبة: يُريدُ لا يزالُ الناسُ بخيرٍ ما كان علماؤُهُم المشايخَ، ولم يكن علماؤُهُمْ الأحداثَ؛ لأنّ الشيخَ قد زالتْ عنه مَيْعَةُ الشَّباب، وحَدُّةُ، وعَجَلَتُهُ، وسَفَهُهُ، واستصحبَ التَّجْرِبَةَ، والخِبْرَةَ، فلا تدخلُ عليه في علْمِهِ الشُّبْهَةُ، ولا يَغْلِبُ عليه الهَوَى، ولا يَميلُ بِهِ الطَّمَعُ، ولا يَسْتَزِلُّهُ الشَّيْطانُ اسْتِزْلالَ الحَدَث، ومَعَ السِّنِّ الوَقارُ، والجَلالَةُ، والهَيْبَةُ. والحَدَثُ قد تَدْخُلُ عليه هذه الأمورُ التي أمِنَتْ على الشّيخ، فإذا دَخَلَتْ عليه، وأَفْتَى هَلَكَ، وأهْلَكَ. <em>[المسائل لابن قتيبة (ص ٥٩) ونصيحة أهل الحديث (8) والفقيه والمتفقه (٢/ ١٥٦) بإسناد صحيح]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ibn Qutaybah رحمه الله said:<br />
<strong>He means: People will be upon goodness as long as their scholars are the seniors and that their scholars are not the juniors because a shaykh has moved beyond the intensity, hastiness, and foolishness of youth, and he possesses experience and expertise. Therefore, doubts do not enter his knowledge, desires do not overcome him, greed does not sway him, and Shayṭān cannot cause him to slip like a youth. And with age, he has dignity and respect. While the junior can be affected by these matters from which the shaykh is safe. If these (influences) enter upon someone and he issues a Fatwa, he ruins himself and ruins others </strong><em>[al-Masāil by Ibn Qutaybah p. 59, Naṣīḥah Ahl al-Ḥadīth 8, al-Faqīh wa al-Mutafaqqih 2/156; Isnād Ṣaḥīḥ]</em><strong><br />

<h2><strong>Someone Who Has Excelled in Studying a Madhhab Such that He Has Memorised It and Bases His Answers on it Alone is Not Called a Scholar but a Muqallid–So What of Someone Who Has Studied Nothing At All?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Questioner: </strong>A questioner is asking saying, ‘A Muslim who has memorised one of the four schools of thought and has accepted what it permits and [also what it] does not sanction, is it allowed for him to give a religious verdict based upon that to those who ask him questions?’</p>
<p><strong>Al-Albaani: </strong>It is not allowed for him to give a <em>fatwa</em> based upon what he has learned from his <em>madhhab </em>except by clarifying that it is the <em>madhhab </em>of so and so and not upon the basis that it is some knowledge which he has arrived at through his own personal study–because the blind-follower is not a scholar, the blind-follower is narrating what he has heard.</p>
<p>So based upon this he should say, ‘The answer to what you asked about according to the <em>madhhab</em> which I have studied is such and such,’ and he should not say, ‘The answer is such and such,’ because the difference between these two answers is that the second one, i.e., being resolute that the answer is such and such, this is the state of the scholar who is versed in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p><strong>As for the blind follower, even if he is from the major, from those who are assumed to be from the major scholars, as long as he is a blind-follower then he is not a scholar.</strong></p>
<p>In the opinion of the scholars, a scholar is the one who is as Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<p align="center"><em>“Knowledge is, “Allaah said … His Messenger said …</em><br />
<em>The Companions said …” and it is not hidden.”</em></p>
<p>This is the scholar.</p>
<p>As for a person who has spent his life studying the sayings of a particular<em>madhhab</em> without knowing whether its proofs are from the Book or the<em>Sunnah</em> or <em>ijmaa’</em> or <em>qiyaas</em>–then he is a blind-follower, and according to the agreement of the scholars, the blind-follower is called ignorant and is not called a scholar.</p>
<p>For this reason in the book of judgments found in the books of <em>fiqh</em> it is stated that, ‘… it is not allowed for a <em>jaahil </em>[an ignorant person] to be given the position of a judge,’ the scholar explaining this said, ‘Namely, the blind follower,’–however much he knows about his <em>madhhab</em> he is still a blind follower and is not a scholar for whom it is permissible to give a religious verdict [<em>fatwa</em>].</p>
<p>And from the fruits of this distinction between the real/true scholar and between what some of the blind-followers have aptly named a, ‘figurative/metaphorical scholar’, i.e., a blind-follower, the difference between these two is that the real/true scholar gives a religious verdict based upon proof, he either says, ‘Allaah said,’ or ‘Allaah’s Messenger said,’ or ‘The consensus [<em>ijmaa’</em>] in this is …’ or he says, ‘There is no text [concerning the issue at hand] but I’m just giving my opinion, and this is my <em>ijtihaad</em>, and whoever has something better than it, let him bring it to us.’</p>
<p>As for the metaphorical/figurative scholar, i.e., the blind-follower, he is the one who gives an answer based upon his <em>madhhab</em>–and since the common folk do not differentiate between true/real knowledge and metaphorical knowledge, then this metaphorical scholar has to say, ‘My <em>madhhab</em> is such and such,’ and he should not say, ‘The answer is such and such,’–<strong>because he is not acquainted [with true knowledge] and he does not know.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Seeking knowledge is incumbent upon every Muslim and something we should continuously strive for. The scholars – the inheritors of the Prophets, have a lofty status in Islam and Allah has mentioned them with virtue in the Quran. One can read numerous ayahs of the Quran which mention the status of the Ulama and what Allah has given them from al-Ilm</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is important to refer to the Ulama who are grounded and firm in knowledge because Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Allah will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge” (al-Mujadilah 58:11)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Say: ‘Are those who know equal to those who know not?’ It is only men of understanding who will remember (i.e. get a lesson from Allah’s Signs and Verses)” (al-Zumar 39:9)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Seeking knowledge from the younger students of knowledge and also referring to them at the expense of not seeking it from the senior scholars is of great concern, even more so in our times of catastrophic confusion and overwhelming chaos. The definition of a scholar or an alim does not necessarily dictate an age range, there are those whom Allah has blessed and granted them immense knowledge at a young age, undoubtedly they are unique and favoured from the bounties of Allah due to his, The Most Highs, saying</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Verily We: It is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption). (Surah al-Hijr:9)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is not hidden from the Muslim that some of the companions were young in age but still mountains of knowledge – possessing vast knowledge of the Quran and Sunnah. There were other scholars who were young in age, not reaching the age of 40 but were still considered scholars and righteous servants who dedicated their lives to spreading the clear teachings of Islam but their recognition and testimony in this regard came after their demise, and was not usually common during there lifetime. Furthermore, this is not an absolute principle that a scholar has to always old in age and that we always have to only ask the major scholars or the kibar as a scholar can be young in age</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Using the generality of the following hadith, it offers an objective recourse to understanding the term ULAMA. Abdullah ibn Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) said, that Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The blessings are with your elders.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(<em>Ibn Hibban</em> (no.955), <em>Hakim</em> (1:62), Tabarani, <em>al-Awsth</em> from <em>Majma’a al-Bahrayn</em> no.261), al-Bazzar, <em>Musnad</em> (no.1957), Ibn Abdul Barr, <em>Jam’e Bayan al-Ilm Wa Fadlihi</em> (1:613-614 no.1053), Abu Nu’aym, <em>Hilyah</em> (8:171-172), Ibn A’diyy, <em>al-Kamil</em> (2:509), Khatib al-Baghdadi, <em>Tarikh Madinah al-Islam – Tarikh Baghdad</em> (11:165), al-Qadha’i, <em>Musnad al-Shihab</em> (no.36-37). The hadith is Sahih with supports.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Suleiman al-Ruhaili, May Allah preserve him said in response to a question,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“</em><em>There’s no doubt, that knowledge indeed should be taken from the Akabir and a person must have a Tazkiyyah. However, who are the Akabir? The Akabir are those whom their knowledge has magnified (their status) and they are known for knowledge, even if they are young in age, even if they are youth. There were Akabir from the Sahabah who were young in age; knowledge was taken from them and their knowledge illuminated the world. This affair is from the important affairs in this issue, and it is, that the one who is young could be magnified (in status) by his knowledge; such that he is known by his profound beneficial knowledge. This (scenario) took place in abundance amongst the Salaf, starting with the Sahabah may Allah be pleased with them (and it took place) after the Imams. A Tazkiyyah (is also) a must; for verily, this knowledge is Din. So it is a must that we carefully look at the one we take our Din from.” (</em>Source:<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafyink.com/tazkiyyahconditionknowledge/)">http://www.salafyink.com/tazkiyyahconditionknowledge)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Can a Scholar &#8211; “Shaykh,” be Young</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, the condition of who a scholar is has other factors that affect it and the scholars themselves have set out guidelines for the Muslims to ascertain who the real Sunni major scholars are. This is further based on recommendations and recognition by the Ulama of the time and not based on the personal opinion or diminished understanding or the existence of some scholars who were actually young in age, in such cases these scholars were of the times before which is totally different in our times. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well circulated about Imam Malik that he was 17 years old when he first started to issue Fatawa, only after 70 scholars had testified to his ability to do so. (Nawawi, <em>Adab al-Fatwa wal Mufti wal Mustafti</em> (p.18), Qadi A’yadh, <em>Tartib al-Madarik</em> (1:127).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Although there is contention whether Imam Malik was actually 17 when he first started to teach and issue legal edicts (Abu Zahra, <em>Imam Malik</em> (p.53). It was nonetheless, when he was of young age.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Shafi’i likewise was in his teens when he started to issue legal edicts.  (Ibn Abi Hatim, <em>Adab al-Shafi’i</em> (p.39).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah was 17 when he began to issue legal edicts and became a Mufti. There are numerous other exceptions to the normal rule of reaching an old age with white beards before a person is understood to be a scholar and therefore it is highly questionable to make this as the main asal or fundamental to define and describe who a scholar is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In our times using the criteria of the existence of scholars who were young in age to say we have scholars in our era who are also young in age needs serious reevaluation. This understanding, although it is purely the personal opinion of some people, and at times formed due to obstinacy, it opens the doors to great trials and tribulations which will lead to further misguidance and disastrous consequences. Abdullah ibn Amr (RadhiAllahu Anhu) reported, The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Verily, Allah does not take away knowledge by snatching it from the people but rather he takes away knowledge with the death of the scholars until he leaves no scholar behind and the people turn to the ignorant as their leaders. They are asked to give religious judgments without knowledge, thus they are led astray and lead others astray.”</em> (<em>Bukhari</em> no.100, <em>Muslim</em> no.2673)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also known that people attend the various universities or madaris and after studying for approximately 8 years or so, they graduate and are often given honouary. If all of them were understood to be scholars, it would degrade the station and rank of sacred knowledge achieved by the senior scholars who Allah has described in the Quran as</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Only those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Forgiving.” (Surah Fatir:28)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“But those firm in knowledge say, &#8220;We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.&#8221; And no one will be reminded except those of understanding.” (Surah Ale-Imran:7)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholars of earlier times who were young in age continued to seek knowledge from other scholars and this continued until they died. The very same senior scholars testified to their rank in ilm. In our times after graduating from a university after 8 years, using the title of Shaikh for someone or anyone who has just reached the age of 30-35 is gross negligence of the sacred knowledge. This is opening the doors to major problems just for the sake of personalities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Seeking Knowledge from the Kibar (the senior) Scholars as opposed to the Sighar (the younger ones)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Returning and referring back the major scholars ie Ulama and the elders of this Ummah, old in age, has some precedence from a statement of the illustrious companion Abd Allah ibn Mas’ud (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The people will not cease to be upon good as long as they take knowledge from their senior ones and from their trustworthy ones and from their scholars. So if they take it from their younger ones and their evil ones, they will be destroyed.”</em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em> </em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Abd al-Razzaq, <em>al-Musannaf </em>(no.20446, 20483), Tabarani in <em>Mu’jam al-Kabir</em> (Vol.9 no. 8089, 8590-8592), <em>Mu’jam al-Awsth</em> (1:135), Ibn Mubarak, <em>al-Zuhd</em> (p.281 no.815), Ibn A’diyy, <em>al-Kamil</em> (1:164), Ibn Abdul Barr, <em>Jam’e Bayan al-Ilm Wa Fadlihi</em> (1:616 no.1057-1058), Khatib al-Baghdadi, <em>al-Faqih wa’l Mutafaqih </em>(2:79) and in <em>Nasihah Ahl al-Hadith</em> (p.28-29 no.7) and in <em>Mukhtasar Nasihah Ahl al-Hadith</em> (p.93). Abu Ubayd, <em>Gharib al-Hadith</em> (3:369), al-Daylami, <em>Musnad al-Firdaws</em> (5:230 no.7710). The latter transmits it from Ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) which is a mistake as it is the well known statement of Ibn Mas’ud (RadhiAllahu Anhu). Shaikh al-Albani graded the chain to be authentic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Salam ibn Burjis, may Allah have mercy on him said<em>,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“And indeed the phenomenon of taking knowledge from the younger ones amongst the students of knowledge has become widespread in this era. And in reality this phenomenon is a chronic disease, an enduring sickness, preventing the (true) student from what he intends and something by which he twists away from the correct path which would lead to knowledge. And that is because taking knowledge from the younger people – those whose feet have not become firmly grounded in knowledge and whose beards have not become white in it (seeking knowledge), despite the presence of a person who is greater than them in age and one whose feet are more firmly grounded – then this weakens the foundation of the beginner and prevents him from taking benefit from the knowledge of the senior scholars, and from acquiring their manners which knowledge and time have made good – and other than that from the justifications that are suggested by the narration of ibn Mas’ud (RadhiAllahu Anhu) when he said: <strong>“The people will not cease to be upon good as long as they take knowledge from their senior ones and from their trustworthy ones and from their scholars.</strong> <strong>So if they take it from their younger ones and their evil ones, they will be destroyed.”</strong> (‘Awa’iq al-Talab </em>(p.23)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Position of Imam Ibn Qutaybah (d.276H)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Salam ibn Burjis, May Allah have mercy on him said that Imam Ibn Qutyabah, may Allah have mercy on him, held the opinion that the <em>sighar </em>(lesser ones) were the ones who were lesser in age. Imam Ibn Qutaybah was asked about the statement of Abd Allah ibn Mas’ud (RadhiAllahu Anhu) to which he replied,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He (ibn Mas’ud) intended – that the people will not cease to be upon good as long as their scholars are the elders, and their scholars are not the youthful ones, because for the old man, the pleasure of youthfulness, and its self containment and its foolishness have disappeared from him. And he has taken on experience and knowledge as his companions.</em> <em>So doubt does not come upon him in his knowledge; nor does desire get the better of him; nor does greed make him turn away and nor does Shaytan make him slip up with the errors of the young person. Thus with age there is dignity and honour and reverence.</em> <em>And it may be these matters– matters which the old person is secure from – enter upon the youth; so when they enter upon him, and he gives fatawa (Islamic rulings), he is destroyed and he destroys (others).” </em>(Imam Khatib al-Baghdadi<em>, Nasihah Ahl al-Hadith</em> (p.29-30 no.8), <em>Mukhtasar Nasihah Ahl al-Hadith</em> (p.93), Shaikh Abdul Salam ibn Burjis, <em>Awa’iq al-Talab </em>(p.24) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So when this is the affair with the people adopting this with some of the companions, one could only imagine the invalidity of referring to very young students in our era. Allahul Musta’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is appropriate here that we define the correct understanding of those whom it is proper to apply the term scholar to. And this is extremely important due to the fact that many people do not comprehend this issue, they have mixed individuals into the ranks of the scholars that do not belong there. The end result of this is the intellectual disorder that we are living in today. Many people in general, and students of knowledge in particular, have begun to think that everyone who writes a book, verifies a manuscript, gives a khutbah, or delivers a lecture is a scholar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed, those who deserve the term &#8220;scholar&#8221; be applied to them in these times of ours are few. They are fewer than the few &#8211; in fact they are very few. This is because the scholar has special characteristics, many of which cannot be found in a majority of those who ascribe to knowledge today. A scholar is not someone who is prolific or eloquent in his [Islamic] speeches and lectures and so on. A scholar is not someone who authors a book or provides verification and referencing for a book or manuscript. Determining who is a scholar according to these standards is unfortunately the criterion in the minds of many of the youth and common folk today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (d.795H) – May Allah have mercy on him – said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;We have been put to trial by a group of ignoramuses amongst the people who believe that some modern-day individuals that are prolific in speech are more knowledgeable than those who came before them. Among them is he who thinks that a certain individual is more knowledgably than everyone that came in the past, including the Companions and those that succeeded them, due to the large amount of his clarifications and statements.&#8221; He went on to say: &#8220;Many of the latter day people have been affected by this, and so they feel that whoever has a great amount of speech, debates and arguments on issues of the Religion, is more knowledgeable than someone who isn&#8217;t like this!&#8221; …….. Ibn Rajab went on to say: &#8220;So it is an obligation to believe that not everyone who excels in his display of speech and words on knowledge is more knowledgeable than one who is not like this.&#8221; </em>(<em>Bayan Fadl Ilm al-Salaf A’la Ilm al-Khalaf</em> (p.38-40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was at the time of Ibn Rajab, rahimahullaah, so what if he were to observe the fake ‘scholars’ of our time who fill tapes and books with their speech. The people become deceived by them because of the great amount of books they publish every month. So they think that they are scholars!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the factors that should be used to distinguish who it is proper to apply the term &#8220;scholar&#8221; to in these times is: seniority in age and that taking knowledge from the senior scholars is a condition for the acquirement of knowledge. This is especially so in these times, since the senior scholar is most likely possesses more knowledge, has a more complete intellect, and is farther removed from the overwhelming desires, and so on as the narration of Ibn Mas’ud (RadhiAllahu Anhu) is a testament to this. (from the words of the compiler, Jamal bin Furayhan al-Harithi from Shaikh Saleh al-Fawzan’s, <em>al-Ajwibah al-Mufidah An Asilah al-Manahij al-Jadidah</em> (p.130-131), 3<sup>rd</sup> Edn. (Dar al-Menhaj, Cairo, 2003)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Umayyah narrates the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) was asked concerning the signs of the hour. To which he replied,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When knowledge is taken from the younger ones (Asaghir)”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Tabarani, <em>Mu’ajam al-Kabir</em> (22/362), Haithami, <em>al-Majma’a</em> (1:135), Ibn Mubarak, <em>al-Zuhd </em>(no,61), Lalika’i, <em>Sharh Usul al-Ei’tiqad Ahl al-Sunnah </em>(1:102), Abu Amr al-Dani, <em>al-Fitan</em> (2:62), Ibn Abdul Barr, <em>Jam’e Bayan al-Ilm Wa Fadlihi</em> (1:612 no.1051-1052), al-Harawi, <em>Dhamm al-Kalam</em> (2:137), Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi, <em>al-Ilm</em> (2:16), Ibn Mandah, <em>al-Ma’rifah</em> (2:220). The Hadith is Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Asaghir – Younger ones, are the People of Innovation</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nu’aym said I said to Ibn al-Mubarak,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Who are the younger ones (Asgahir).” He replied, “Those who speak with their opinions (ie in the Shari’ah) or either the young narrating from the elders but not narrating from the younger ones.” And Abu Ubayd (Qasim bin Salam) mentioned in explanation of this report of Ibn al-Mubarak that by the younger ones – the asaghir, he means the people of innovation and not the people of Sunnah.”</em> (<em>Jam’e Bayan al-Ilm Wa Fadlihi</em> (1:612), <em>Gharib al-Hadith</em> (3:369)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu Ubayd (d.224H) further explains, based on his understanding, this means giving precedency and preference to the opinions of the later people over that of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam), this is what is meant by taking knowledge from the younger ones –asaghir. (<em>Gharib al-Hadith </em>(3:369-370), <em>Jam’e Bayan al-Ilm Wa Fadlihi</em> (1:612).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The most truthful speech is the speech of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). The worst of the affairs are the newly invented matters – innovations. “The people will not cease to be upon good as long as they take knowledge from their senior ones.”</em> (<em>Jam’e Bayan al-Ilm Wa Fadlihi</em> (1:615 no.1054). Its chain authentic and its narrators are trustworthy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also transmitted from Abd Allah ibn Mas’ud (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>The people will not cease to be upon good as long as they take knowledge from the companions of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam), they are their seniors/elders. As for those who seek knowledge from their younger ones – asaghir then they will be destroyed.” (Jam’e Bayan al-Ilm Wa Fadlihi</em> (1:617 no.1060). It is authentic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Abdul Barr (d.463H) summarises the statements and says the statements of Ibn al-Mubarak and Abu Ubayd have preceded in explanation of the younger ones &#8211; asaghir. Some people of knowledge were of the view that asaghir – the younger ones refers to when fatawa are sought from the ignorant ones. He mentions, it is because every scholar thinks he is a senior one according to his own understanding whatever his age may be. He then goes onto mention the various companions, who although young in age, would still issue legal edicts. This being said, the status of the most virtuous people from amongst mankind – the companions after the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) have indeed been blessed by Allah the Exalted, the Sublime. <em>(Jam’e Bayan al-Ilm Wa Fadlihi</em> (1:617-618)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>General Narration Revering the Scholars and the Elders</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawawi (d.676H) established the following chapter in his <em>Riyadh al-Salihin</em>, <strong><em>Chapter 44 &#8211; Revering the Scholars and Elders, Preferring them to others and raising their Status</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong> And then brings over 10 Ahadith in reverence of the Scholars and older people. Although this does not directly refer to the older Scholar, it does however show the lofty status of the older people, with maturity, with ilm and those who accepted Islam first. Such general narrations do however indiciate looking at the older ones for guidance and help, who are firm and grounded in the principles. As an example</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="348">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em> Abu Mas`ud `Uqbah bin `Amr Al-Badri Al-Ansari (RadhiAllahu Anhu) reported: Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “The person who is best versed in the recitation of the Book of Allah, should lead the prayer; but if all those present are equally versed in it, then the one who has most knowledge of the Sunnah; if they are equal in that respect too, then the one who has emigrated (to Al-Madinah) first, if they are equal in this respect also, then the oldest of them. No man should lead another in prayer where the latter has authority, or sit in his house, without his permission”. (Muslim no,673]. In another narration in Muslim (no.673): Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “One who is senior most in accepting Islam, should lead the Salat (prayer)”. Yet another narration is: Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “A man who is well versed in the Book of Allah and can recite it better, should lead the Salat (prayer); if (all those present) are equal in this respect, then the man who is senior most in respect of emigration, if they are equal in that respect too, then the oldest of them should lead the prayer.” [Muslim no.291]. </em>(<em>Riyadh al-Salihin</em> (2:211-212)</span></li>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Need for Returning to the Senior Scholars with regard to the Important Issues</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The researcher Ahmad al-Shihhi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The scholars are the ones to be referred to and turned to regarding the important issues, especially in matters that concern the welfare of the Muslim ummah. If you look at the condition of the first generations from the Salaf as-Saalih, you would find that they were strict with regard to returning back to the senior scholars that were alive in their time, especially in getting rulings that resulted in making tabdee’ (declaring someone an innovator) or takfeer (declaring someone a disbeliever). </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Look at the example of Yahyaa bin Ya’mar Al-Basree and Humaid bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Himayree Al-Basree, when the Qadariyyah appeared in their time and they began to manifest contradictions to the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, which necessitated that they be declared disbelievers or that they be pronounced innovators and removed from the fold of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah.  However, they did not rush into making a ruling against them. Rather, they went to those who held the position of being referred to with regard to issues of knowledge, from the scholars. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And he was ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa). So they informed him of what occurred to them and he issued a ruling to them stating the misguidance and deviation of (this group of) the Qadariyyah. Yahyaa bin Ya’mar said: “The first person who spoke (deviant views) with regard to Al-Qadar in Basrah was Ma’bad Al-Juhnee. Humaid bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Himayri and I set out to make Hajj or ‘Umrah, and we said to each other: “If only we could meet one of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger so that we could ask him about what these people are saying about Al-Qadar. So Allaah granted us that ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa) enter the masjid So I and my companion gathered around him – one of us on his right and the other on his left. I felt as if my companion entrusted me with speaking to him, so I said: “Abu ‘Abdur-Rahmaan, a people have appeared in our land that recite the Qur’aan and pursue knowledge…[and he mentioned some other points about them]…and they claim that there is no such thing as Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-Decree) and that it is rejected.” He responded: “If you meet these people, inform them that I am free from them and thy are free from me. By the One whom ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar swears by, if one of them had the likes of Mount Uhud in gold and he were to give it away in charity, Allaah would not accept it from him, until he believes in Al-Qadar.“ Then he said: “My father reported to me…” Sahih Muslim (no. 93) </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And look at the example of Zubayd ibn Al-Harith Al-Yami when the Murji’ah appeared in his time and he saw that they had oppositions to the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, which necessitated that they be ousted from the fold of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. Yet, he did not rush into making a ruling against them. Instead, he went to one who had the position of being referenced in religious matters in his time from the people of knowledge and fatwaa, those who took their knowledge from the Seniors amongst the Companions, who in this case was Abu Waa’il Shaqiq bin Salamah Al-Asadi Al-Kufi (rahimahullaah). So Zubayd went to him informing him of what had occurred, and Abu Wa’il issued a fatwaa to him based on a text from Allaah’s Messenger, which indicated the falsehood of the misconceptions of the Murji’ah and their deviating from Ahlus-Sunnah. Zubayd said: “When the Murji’ah appeared, I went to Abu Waa’il and mentioned that to him, so he said: ’Abdullaah narrated to me that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>‘Reviling a Muslim is sinfulness and fighting against him is disbelief.’</strong>” (Bukhari (no.48) and Muslim (no.218) </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So if you were to compare between the condition of these people with regard to how they looked toward the people of knowledge in their time and between the condition of many of those who have become unstable in their repentance in this time of ours, you would find a huge difference between the two examples. Those people (in the first example) strove hard to implement this rule, and they did not rush to make a ruling against those people of their time whose deviation become apparent, until they first presented their case to the people of knowledge, those capable of issuing rulings (fatwaa) from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So when they heard the ruling, they bit onto it with their molar teeth and distanced themselves from those deviants who were in opposition to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. But as for today, then it is very rare that you can find those who strive hard to implement this rule. Rather, you will find those who have no concern for the words of the people of knowledge and fatwa with regard to warning against the people of desires and innovation. So they wage war against the fatawa (religious rulings) of the scholars and they distort their (intended) meanings. We ask Allaah to save and protect us!” </em>(<em>al-Wasayah al-Saniyyah Li-Ta’ibina Ilas Salafiyyah</em> (p.34-39), The book was read to Shaikh Rabi bin Hadi al-Madkhali and Shaikh Abdul Malik Ramadani)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>On The Knowledge, Status and Recognition of Who a Scholar is</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Khatib al-Baghdadi (d.463H) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Imam (leader of the Muslims) must screen the state of the muftis, he must look at the one who is most qualified and must endorse his rank; and the one who is not qualified, he must stop him from giving fatwa and warn him with punishment if he gives fatwa (without qualification). How can the Imam (leader of the Muslims) judge who is qualified or not for this status of a mufti? It is by asking the Ulama of his time and those who are known as the truthful people of his time.”</em> (Nawawi, <em>Adab al-Fatwa wal Mufti wal Mustafti</em> (p.17-18)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We clearly find from this that a scholar, an Alim or the Ulama are recognized to be from amongst the Ulama when other Ulama of their time recgonise, acknowledge and testify to their knowledge. This overwhelmingly excludes the modern day celebs for whom the titles “Shaikhs/Shaykhs” are grossly used for; it most certaintly is a practice that has to be seriously abolished. This grand title only belongs to the real, major and established scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Malik said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“A person should not claim by himself to be qualified for this rank (Mufti/Scholar) until someone who is more knowledgable than him does not endorse (or disqualify) this (status).”</em> (<em>Adab al-Fatwa wal Mufti wal Mustafti</em> (p.18), <em>Tartib al-Madarik</em> (1:127)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baz said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is binding upon the society to give the scholars their true worth and to act upon their guidance and advise, and to work hard in defending them, abstain from backbiting them and to preserve their honour.”</em> (<em>Majmu’ al-Fatawa </em>(7:127)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Abdul Barr (d.463H) included a chapter in his book <em>Jami Bayan al-Ilm wa Fadlihi  </em>under the heading:  <em>Who has the right to be called a Faqeeh or a Scholar in Reality and not Figuratively? And who is allowed to issue fatwa according to the scholars?</em> The avid reader may refer to this book, for it is filled with narrations mentioning returning the older ones and senior scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>All complete praise and glory belongs to Allāh, the sustainer and controller</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>of the universe. May there be abundant salutations, peace and</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>blessings upon the Noble Prophet, the best of mankind</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Muḥammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam),</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>his family and his companions.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By the weak slaves of Allāh,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ḥibbān Malak</span></p>

<p class="list-group-item-text ftwa-single-q "><strong>We are students who are seeking knowledge. We study ‘aqeedah with some teachers who are teaching us Ash’ari ‘aqeedah. They interpret the hand of Allaah as meaning His power or His blessing, and His being above His throne (istiwaa’) as meaning His sovereignty, and so on. What is the ruling on studying with these teachers?</strong></p>
<div id="available-date">Praise be to Allaah.</div>
</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
<div class="list-group-item-text ftwa-single-answer font-nrmal">
<p>These people who interpret the Qur’aan in this manner, whether they are called Ash’aris or some other name, have gone astray from the path of the righteous salaf. Not even one letter of what these people say in their misinterpretations has been narrated from the righteous salaf. Let them bring one word from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or from Abu Bakr, or ‘Umar, or ‘Uthmaan, or ‘Ali, to say that they interpreted Allaah’s hand as meaning His power, or that they interpreted His being above the Throne (istiwaa’) as referring to His Sovereignty, or that they interpreted His Face as meaning reward, or that they interpreted His love as meaning reward, etc. Let them produce one word from them to show that they interpreted these aayahs and similar verses in the manner that these people interpret them. If they cannot produce any such thing, let it be said that either the righteous salaf, headed by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the leader of the pious, were unaware of the meaning of this tremendous ‘aqeedah (of Islam), or they did know it but they concealed the truth. But neither of these can be said of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or of any of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs, or of his Companions (may Allaah be pleased with them). If that is the case then we have to follow their path (the path of the Prophet and the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs).</p>
<p>My advice to these people is to fear Allaah and to abandon what So and so said, and to come back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the way of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs who came after him. They should know that there will come a Day when they will return to Allaah, when they will not be able to use the opinion of So and so as evidence. By Allaah, So and so will not be able to help them on that Day.  Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>“And (remember) the Day (Allaah) will call to them, and say: ‘What answer gave you to the Messengers?’”</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>[al-Qasas 28:65]</i></p>
<p>He did not say, Remember the Day when (Allaah) will call to them and say, ‘What answer gave you to So and so…?’</p>
<p>And Allaah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>“So believe in Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad), who believes in Allaah and His Words, and follow him so that you may be guided”</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>[al-A’raaf 7:158]</i></p>
<p>Allaah commanded us to believe in him and follow him. If this is the case then how can a person believe in Allaah and His Messenger in the true and complete sense, then turn away from the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the way in which he believed in his Lord, and misinterpret the way in which Allaah has described Himself in His Book or the way in which His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has described Him, simply because of illusions which they call rational thought?</p>
<p>I advise them to come back to Allaah and to abandon any other opinion, and follow what Allaah and His Messenger say, for if they die following that they will have died following the truth. But if they go against that then they are in grave danger and those whose opinions they are following will not protect them from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>“(Remember) the Day when every person will come up pleading for himself, and every one will be paid in full for what he did (good or evil, belief or disbelief in the life of this world) and they will not be dealt with unjustly”</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>[al-Nahl 16:111]</i></p>
<p> I repeat this advice to every believer, to come back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with regard to what he believes about his Lord and God, following the path of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the rightly guided khaleefahs who came after him, and the imams of the Muslims who led the people in following the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), without referring to rational thought, which is no more than an illusion, concerning issue that have to do with Allaah and His names and attributes. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah spoke well when he described the ahl al-kalaam (“Islamic” philosophers) as “having been given intelligence but not knowledge, and had having been given smartness but not sincerity.” So one has to deepen one’s knowledge on the basis of the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). I ask Allaah to help us all to have faith and to cause us to meet Him when He is pleased with us, for He is Able to do all things. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds, and may Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.</p>
<p>I call upon all seekers of knowledge to call their brothers to that which they have heard, for by Allaah it is the truth. Whoever claims to have truth other than this, we will accept it and adhere to it (if it can be proven to be true).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated Abu Ubaydah</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Checked &amp; Additional Notes</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: center;" align="center"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;" align="center"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;" align="center"></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“and to say about Allah what you do not know.” [Surah al-Baqarah Ayah 169]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a serious crime to attribute something to Allah which he did not say. It is very severe as it is unlawful. This is why it is considered as the 4th thing in the Quran which is forbidden and all the Shariahs and religions agree in this being forbidden. Such an action cannot be allowed in any circumstance and it can only be declared as being </span><span style="color: #000000;">haram.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are 2 types of things which are forbidden:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. That which is forbidden itself (inherently) [haram dhati], which is forbidden and cannot be allowed [halal] in any condition. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. That which is temporarily forbidden [haram aridhi], that which can be forbidden at any given time and not forbidden at any other time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Most High says in regards to those things which are forbidden itself (haram dhati):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Say, &#8220;My Rab has only forbidden immoralities &#8211; what is apparent of them and what is concealed” [Surah A’raf Ayah 33]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After this He informed us about forbidden things which are more dangerous than immoralities, meaning:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“and sin, and oppression without right” [Surah A’raf Ayah 33]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then He mentioned something severely forbidden:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down authority,” [Surah A’raf Ayah 33]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After this He explained an action which is more forbidden (which is mentioned above):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“and that you say about Allah that which you do not know.” [Surah A’raf Ayah 33]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The higher the level of a forbidden thing the the greater the amount of sin it has. This is not just one sin rather it is a collection of sins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. Attributing a lie to Allah and attributing such a saying to Him which does not beautify Him. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. Changing His religion (Din)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. Negating what He established, and establishing what He negated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4. Declaring something false as true and truth as false. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5. Having enmity for His friends and having friendship with His enemies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6. Loving what He does not like, and hating what He loves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7. Talking about things in which are  inferior to His statements, actions attributes and essence</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What can be more severe in being forbidden than this, this is the origin of kufr and shirk. All of the foundations of misguidance and innovations in the religion are based on this. The basis of misguided acts of worship all emanate from talking about Allah without knowledge. That is why the Salaf severely and strictly prohibited this. And this is why Allah said it is forbidden to make something halal or haram without any proof or evidence:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And do not say about what your tongues assert of untruth, &#8220;This is lawful and this is unlawful,&#8221; to invent falsehood about Allah” [Surah an-Nahl Ayah 116]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Talking without knowledge is a branch of shirk and kufr. Every mushrik and kafir will be guilty of talking without knowledge. However it is not necessary that every person who speaks without knowledge (talking about Allah without knowledge) is also a mushrik and kafir, as sometimes talking without knowledge reaches the level of innovation in the religion and Ta’til (rejection) of the attributes (of Allah). So talking without knowledge is a part of shirk and kufr.</span></p>
