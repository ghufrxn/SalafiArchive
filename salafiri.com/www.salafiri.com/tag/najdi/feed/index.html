				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h4><span style="color: #000080">The Author (Shaykh Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhab, may Allah have mercy on him) said,</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #800000">&#8220;The Fourth Principle: That the Mushriks (Polytheists) of our time are more severe in their Shirk than [those Mushriks] that came before, for verily those that came before would commit Shirk in times of ease, whilst dedicating [their worship] solely to Allah in times of difficulty, whereas the Shirk of the Mushriks of our time is constant, in ease and in difficulty. The proof is the statement of the Most High:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #800000"><strong><em>&#8216;And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allâh, making their Faith pure for Him only: but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others.&#8217; [Al-Ankabut, 29:65]</em>&#8220;</strong></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080">The Explainer (Shaykh Salih Al-&#8216;Usaymi, may Allah grant him success) said,</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">&#8220;<strong>And the objective of this Principle is: </strong>To clarify the severity of the Shirk of the people during the time of the author, and whoever is after them is from the latecomers (Muta&#8217;akhirin), and verily they are more severe in Shirk than the ones that came before (Al-Awwalin).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>And the benefit of establishing its severity is: </strong>Realising that that the state they (i.e., the Mushriks of our time) is more worthy of Takfir (excommunication) and fighting than the Mushriks that came before, and this was declared by the author in another book of his, &#8216;Kashf Ash-Shubuhat&#8217;, and the Mushrikun were mentioned with the disbelief with which they were described previously in the initial statement of the author, <span style="color: #800000">&#8216;Verily the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ fought&#8230;&#8217;¹</span>, so they disbelieved by Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b>And a collection of Shari&#8217;i (legislative) evidences and events which have occurred due to the Divine Decree indicate that the Shirk of the later Mushriks is more severe than the Shirk of the earlier Mushriks in ten aspects:</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The First Aspect: <span style="color: #800000">&#8216;For verily those that came before would commit Shirk in times of ease, whilst dedicating [their worship] solely to Allah in times of difficulty.&#8217; </span></strong><span style="color: #800000"><br />
</span>As for the later Mushriks, then they commit Shirk in times of ease and difficulty alike. The author mentioned this aspect here in &#8216;Qawa&#8217;id Al-Arba&#8217; and additionally in &#8216;Kashf Ash-Shubuhat&#8217;, and he used the aforementioned Ayah as evidence from Surah Al-Ankabut, for travelling in the ocean on &#8216;Al-Fulk&#8217; &#8211; i.e., a ship &#8211; is a time of difficulty, for their hearts would be filled with fear and they would call on Allah alone sincerely. Then, when they would set foot on land and be in a state of ease, due to their safety from the harm which they had feared, they would return to their Shirk, calling upon other than Allah, and a group [of scholars] after the time of the author mentioned this, from them: his grandsons Sulayman bin &#8216;Abdillah and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Hasan, and &#8216;Abdullah Aba Butayn, and Sulayman bin Sahman.<br />
The aforementioned Ayah clarifies the state of the earlier Mushriks between times of difficulty and ease, as for the state of the latecomers, then they are continuous in their Shirk, rather they increase in it when calamities befall them and when their fear intensifies! So the matter has been clarified by those that have witnessed their condition, and the writings of their pens attest to their (i.e., the Mushriks of our era) precedence over the [earlier Mushriks] in Ash-Shirk with the Rabb of Al-&#8216;Alamin. Meaning: That the Ayat are evidence regarding the reality of the condition of the [earlier Mushriks]; For verily they would commit Shirk in times of ease whilst dedicating [their worship] solely to Allah in times of difficulty.<br />
As for the latecomers, then if you wish to know their reality with regards to them committing Shirk in both times of ease and difficulty, then upon you is to witness their condition if you are from the countries which have been afflicted with this [i.e., widespread Shirk], or to read into what has been written regarding them, and you will find their Shirk in every case, whether in ease or in difficulty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Second Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would call upon the Muqarrabun (those brought near to Allah) from the Prophets, Angels and Righteous besides Allah, or they would call upon trees or stones that are not sinful, and these later Mushriks call upon the Fussaq (wicked evildoers) and Fujjar (criminals) besides Allah. The author mentioned this aspect separately in &#8216;Kashf Ash-Shubuhat&#8217; as well, and Muhammad bin Isma&#8217;il As-San&#8217;ani attested to the actualisation of these events during his time in &#8216;Tathir Al-I&#8217;tiqad.&#8217;²<br />
The root cause of their supplications, whilst witnessing their sins, is fear of their evil, for verily they believe they have influence and control [over the creation] such that they can cause harm to them, despite them being in such a repulsive condition.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>The Third Aspect</strong><strong>:</strong> That the earlier Mushriks affirmed that what they were upon was in opposition to the call of the Prophets and Messengers, for verily they said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong> &#8216;Has he made the âlihah (gods) (all) into One Ilâh (God &#8211; Allâh). Verily, this is a curious thing!&#8217; [Surah Sad, 38:5]</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the later Mushriks, then verily they claim that their actions are in accordance to the call of the Prophets and Messengers, and &#8216;Abdul-Latif bin Abdur-Rahman mentioned this by meaning in his refutation on Dawud bin Jarjis, and likewise his student, Sulayman bin Sahman, mentioned it.<br />
So the earlier Mushriks denied the statement, &#8216;La ilaaha illAllah&#8217;, whereas the later Mushriks claimed to be from its people and did not deny its statement, so the earlier Mushrikun rejected it by wording and meaning, whereas the later Mushriks affirm its wording whilst rejecting its meaning. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Hasan brought this benefit in &#8216;Fath Al-Majid&#8217;, and Ibn Qasim in &#8216;Hashiyah Kitab At-Tawhid&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fourth Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would not commit Shirk with Allah in anything from the Dominion, nor in a completely unrestricted ability to dispose of affairs (At-Tasarruf Al-Kulli Al-&#8216;Am), rather they would say in their Talbiyah, <em>&#8216;Labbayk Allahumma Labbayk! (Here I am Allah, Here I am), Labbayk La Sharika Labbayk (Here I am, you have no partner), Except the partner that You have, You control him and that which he controls.&#8217; </em><br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they ascribed complete sovereignty and disposal of affairs of the cosmos to those whom they venerate, and they invoke them due [to their belief] that they have control of the creation and that which occurs in it, and this is Shirk which was not known in the time of Al-Jahiliyyah (Ignorance). &#8216;Abdullah bin Faysal bin Su&#8217;ud mentioned this aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fifth Aspect: </strong>That many of the later Mushriks invoke their objects of worship besides Allah whilst believing they are independent (i.e., not dependent on Allah). As for the earlier Mushriks, then they would invoke their objects of worship in order to seek nearness to Allah, and they believed them to be intercessors and intermediaries, as opposed to many of those Mushriks that came after &#8211; even if they claim otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Sixth Aspect</strong>: That, generally, the Shirk of the earlier Mushriks was restricted [generally] to Al-Uluhiyyah (Worship), and would rarely occur in other than it. As for the later Mushriks, then their Shirk is much, in &#8216;Uluhiyyah, Rububiyyah (Allah&#8217;s actions), and Asma&#8217; w&#8217;as-Sifat (Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes). Rather, Sulayman bin Sahman declared [this] to be one of the differences between the Mushriks of our times who are in a far more evil state than the Mushriks of Al-Jahiliyyah; that the earlier Mushriks affirmed Tawheed of Rububiyyah, for verily their Shirk was only in Al-Uluhiyyah, and this confirms what we mentioned previously.³</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Seventh Aspect:</strong> That the later Mushriks claim that intending [acts of worship], invoking, and devoting [acts of worship] towards the Righteous is from their rights, and to abandon this is to loathe and disregard them, and the earlier Mushriks did not mention this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Eighth Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks used to affirm their Shirk, just as was mentioned previously in their Talbiyyah, and they used to call their Raghbah (Fervent Desire) towards those that they venerated &#8216;Ibadah (Worship)&#8217;.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they claim that they do not commit Shirk with their Rabb, and they call their Raghbah towards those that they venerate &#8216;Mahabbah (Love)&#8217;, and they are liars in this claim of theirs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> <strong>The Ninth Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would only ask their false-deities to fulfil their worldly needs, such as returning a missing person, and they would not take them as preparation for the Day of Judgement (Yawm Al-Din), due to their rejection of the Resurrection, or due to their belief that they will be rewarded with wealth and children after the Resurrection on account of their favour with Allah.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they desired from their objects of veneration fulfilment of their needs in this world, and in the Hereafter. Hamad bin Basir bin Mu&#8217;ammar mentioned this aspect, may Allah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Tenth Aspect:</strong> That the earlier Mushriks would venerate Allah and His symbols, so they would venerate oaths taken by Allah, and they would protect those that sought refuge by Allah and His House (i.e., the Ka&#8217;ba), and they would believe that Al-Bayt Al-Haram is greater than the houses of their idols.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then verily one of them may take an oath by Allah, truthfully or falsely, whilst he would not dare to falsely take an oath by the one he takes as an object of worship and veneration, nor would he protect the one that seeks refuge by Allah and his House, whilst protecting the one who seeks refuge by the one whom they venerate, or by his grave, and they believe that staying at the tombs of the saints is greater than staying in the Masjid. The majority of them believe that Istighatha (seeking aid) by their false-deities, by their graves, is more beneficial and more successful than Istigatha with Allah in the Masjid! And this aspect was derived from the various speech of Sulayman bin &#8216;Abdullah in &#8216;Taysir Al-&#8216;Aziz Al-Hamid&#8217;, and some of it from the speech of Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandson (Taqi&#8217;uddin), and the author [himself], and As-San&#8217;ani, and Hamad bin Nasir bin Mu&#8217;ammar, and &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Aziz Al-Husayyin, and &#8216;Abdul-Latif bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Hasan, from the scholars of the Rectifying Da&#8217;wah, may Allah have mercy on them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>(Sharh Qawa&#8217;id Al-Arba&#8217; of Shaykh Salih Al-&#8216;Usaymi, may Allah preserve him, p.29-33,<br />
</em><em>Transcribed from his lesson on the 29th of Rabi&#8217; Al-Awwal, 1436H, in Masjid An-Nabawi)</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: left"><span style="color: #000080">[TN: The Shaykh, may Allah preserve him, added two more aspects in his lesson the following year:]</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">&#8220;<strong>The Eleventh Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would not seek from their false-deities everything which they sought from Ar-Rahman, for they had requests which they would seek from their false-deities, and requests they would seek from none other than Allah, out of veneration for Allah (Perfect and Exalted He is), so they made the most lofty requests specifically for Allah.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they would seek from their false-deities that which they do not [even] seek from Allah, and made their greatest requests for those that they deify, and would not seek them from Allah, Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandson, mentioned this aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Twelfth Aspect:</strong> That within the later Mushriks are those that claim that Allah manifests in the image of their objects of worship from the creation, so they worship them for verily [they believe] that Allah manifests in them, and not a single one from the earlier Mushriks believed that Allah manifests in an image other than His Self from the creation. Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandson, also mentioned this in meaning. His companion, Ibn Al-Qayyim, relayed this from him in &#8216;Rawdhatul Muhibbin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> The Author, may Allah have mercy on him, said, <strong>&#8220;The First Principle: That you know that verily the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ fought would affirm that Allah, Exalted is He, is the Creator and the One who controls all affairs, and that [this belief] did not enter them into Islam.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Qawa&#8217;id Al-Arba&#8217;)</em></p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:] </strong>Imam Amir As-San&#8217;ani, may Allah have mercy on him, said, <strong>&#8220;Rather, it has reached such a state that they flee to the graves of the oppressors&#8230;&#8221; </strong><em>(Tathir Al-I&#8217;tiqad p.99, Matkabah Al-Wadi&#8217;i edn.)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan expained, <strong>&#8220;When oppression and injustice occurs from the rulers or other than them, they would seek refuge with [the occupants of] these graves to spare them from the injustice and oppression, so this is seeking refuge with other than Allah, to the extent that a poet said:</strong></p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: center"><strong><em>&#8216;O those who fear the Tatar, seek protection by the grave of Abi &#8216;Umar<br />
</em></strong><em><strong>Seek refuge by the grave of Abi &#8216;Umar, he will save you from harm.'&#8221;<br />
</strong></em><em>(Sabil Ar-Rashad fi Sharh Tathir Al-I&#8217;tiqad p.191)</em></p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: left">³ <strong>[TN:]</strong> Allah, Most High, says,</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;Who provides for you from the sky and the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs?&#8221; They will say: &#8220;Allâh.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Will you not then be afraid of Allâh’s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allâh)?&#8221;&#8221;<br />
</strong></em><em>(Surah Yunus, 10:31)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Debunking Yasir Qadhi(ism)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point by Point on Debunking Yasir Qadhi (ism) In light of his DISPATCH: Yasir Qadhi on Salafis and Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab, Science and Miracles, Yajuj and Majuj.</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Part 4</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Timestamp 1:00</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Host Mahin Says: I have heard, there is a guy in our WhatsApp group that calls him Sheikh ul-Islam of America, Ali al-Boriqi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Host SIM: oh Ali is very learned as well Mashallah that’s a huge compliment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Comment</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says in the glorious Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">[And they should consider that] when those who have been followed disassociate themselves from those who followed [them], and they [all] see the punishment, and cut off from them are the ties [of relationship], Those who followed will say, &#8220;If only we had another turn [at worldly life] so we could disassociate ourselves from them as they have disassociated themselves from us.&#8221; Thus will Allah show them their deeds as regrets upon them. And they are never to emerge from the Fire. (Surah al-Baqarah:166-167)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a prime illustration of how individuals like this Ali al-Boriqi, who are fanatical followers, fall into extremism, the very thing they irresponsibly accuse others of! This level of praise is if at all only for the major scholars of this Ummah. In fact, we don’t even find the students of the major scholars of our times referring to them with such loaded titles of eminence. How is then the case for someone who is only 45 and and has perhaps only studied Islamic sciences for around a decade, with most parts being centered on a corrupt methodological approach anyway.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We then see Yasir Qadhi at this moment of sheer humility letting off a smug smirk lasting for a good few seconds. There is obviously no uproar, nor a dare I say quote unquote remark, actually there isn’t even a weak sigh or gasp of dismay at the utterance of such a chilling testimony. This is Yasir Qadhi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Compare Yasir Qadhi to the humility of Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan. Yasir Qadhi during the course of the podcast stated that he started to deliver sermons when he was 16 and that he has been lecturing preaching and teaching for almost three decades and during this moment of enlightened self-amazement, he says “wow, Subhanallah” (Time stamp 11:15).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us now compare him to who the real scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah are, why? Because he has repeatedly asserted that the west should refer to the Scholars of the WEST. Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan was born in 1933 and in 1950 he was appointed as a teacher in a school in Buraydah. Therefore, Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan has been teaching the Islamic sciences, issues legal edicts ranging from creed to governance and so on for the best part of 69 years, yes dear readers 69 years. I am quite certain the intelligent person will see the enormous disparity between precision, depth and accuracy in the knowledge of Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan and the other scholars of our times and between the insignificant role Yasir Qadhi actually has in the West. Moving on, a scholar who has taught Islam, the true “strand” of Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah, Salafism or as Yasir likes to define as the Najdi Da’wah said the following when:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Questioner praises Shaykh Fawzan for his defence of the Islamic Aqidah and Shari’ah. He says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“May Allah show goodness to you, this questioner calls Allah to witness, as well as those present here, that he loves you for the sake of Allah, he asks Allah, The Exalted, The Most High that He forgives you, gives you Tawfiq and rewards you on Behalf of Islam and the Muslims, due to what you do in defending the Aqidah and the Shari’ah.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan replies:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Firstly we ask Allah that He loves you, just as you love us for His sake, as for your statement that I defend Islam, then in reality I am not of this rank. I am less than this, I am deficient and I Seek the forgiveness of Allah, however we hope in Allah, that he gives victory to Islam, a victory from Himself and He forsakes the enemies of Islam by his Honour and His Ability, may He Be Glorified, the Most High.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Example &#8211;  Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The questioner says: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah grant you good. How does one reach the level of knowledge possessed by Shaykh Ibn Baz and You?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan replies:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I don’t have knowledge! As for Shaykh Ibn Baz, yes he had knowledge, may Allah forgive him and have mercy on him. As for us, we are poor (in terms of knowledge) like you. However, it is obligatory upon us to learn.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allahu Akbar, May Allah have mercy on the noble Scholars Ahl al-Sunnah, just look at their humility and simplicity, a true sign of knowledge which leads to Taqwa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Third Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A host introduces Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan during a lecture and he continues to praise him for almost one and a half minutes. When Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan finally speaks he says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim, Alhamdulillah Wassalatu Wassalam Ala Rasullillah Wa Ala Alihi Wa Sahbi wa Man Wala, to proceed: Indeed, you have EMBARASSED me, where you have lifted me to a place I have not reached, I’m to say the least just a seeker of knowledge just like one of you. Rather, perhaps amongst you there are those who greater and more noble.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fourth Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yasir Qadhi goes onto mention his Islamic achievements that he wrote books and delivered lectures on this i.e in defence and propagation of the Najdi Da’wah, like Kitab al-Tawhid, Kashf al-Shubuhat and Qawa’id al-Arba’a and propagation of the Najdi Da’wah. He goes onto say I quote unquote:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Quote <span style="color: #ff0000;">“Dare I say to this day NOTHING (emphasis his) has been written in the English language that is more of an advanced defence of the Najdi da’wah then my critical analysis of shirk which is still available in the English language.”</span> Unquote (Timestamp, 12:50)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan was asked:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Allah has blessed you to author many books; are there any books you deem better?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: which books?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Questioner Your Books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: (with some concern) You want me to praise my own book? (The Shaykh chuckles)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: I deem all of my books to be weak.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fifth Example –Shaykh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A host introduces Shaykh al-Albani for approximately two and a half minutes. Shaykh al-Albani while following the Sunnah of Allahs’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam begins by reciting the Khutbatul Hajah. He then thanks the host for his words and praise and then says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I have no answer to it except to follow the example of the First Khalifah, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq RadhiAllah Anhu, who was the first and true Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. When he heard someone praising him, and it is my belief that no matter how much the one who is exaggerating in his praise (it was the truth) since he was the Khalifah of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam yet. (THE SHAYKHS STARTS CRYING from timestamp 4:29 until 5:00 and in between says Allahul Musta’an and then continues) Yet he used to say “Oh Allah don’t hold me responsible for that which say, make me better then that which they think of me and forgive me for that which they don’t know” (The Shaykh is still shaken and upset) This is what the great Siddiq said. What is there for us to say after him? So I say Following his example (while the Shaykh is still upset) Oh Allah don’t hold me responsible for that which say, make me better then that which they think of me and forgive me for that which they don’t know” The truth is and I say the truth, I am not the person that was described by our noble brother but I am merely a student of knowledge, nothing else.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Sixth Example –Shaykh Muhammad b. Saleh al-Uthaymin</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yasir Qadhi proudly claims he was the student of Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin, is this the case? I will scrutinise this claim later. Let us look at the humility of Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin. A host asks Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin if it was permissible for a person to recite a poem, so Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin grants them permission. He starts reciting:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“My Ummah after this night comes</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Dawn that its light spread across the world</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Good is awaited and the opening is soon</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the truth will be victorious despite of the efforts of evil</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By a revival that Allah has blessed</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That is pure and free of any defects</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as Ibn Saleh (i.e. Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin) is amongst us</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as Ibn Saleh is amongst us</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh of our revival</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With his likes we wish for support and victory</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin interjects and says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I do not agree with this line, no I do not agree because I don’t want the truth to be attributed to individuals. Everyone makes mistakes and if we attribute the truth to individuals and then that person dies, the people will fall into desperation. If you wish (i.e) change that line to “As long as we have the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of his Messenger” It would be better.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reciter then continues his recitation:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as we have the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of his Messenger</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Uthaymin…</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin then interjects again: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“No Oh Shaykh (like I just told you) Don’t say this, no no, stop, stop.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reciter continues and it seems like he does not understand what the Shaykh is trying to point out:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Jurist..</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin stops them and they say let us continue by the will of Allah. Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“No, by Allah I don’t want, no I am not joking, you only have this? Then ask your question. The poem was absolutely uncalled for. I advise you from now and after, not to tie the truth to men. Firstly, men can deviate even Ibn Mas’ud RadhiAllahu Anhu said: “Whoever is to follow someone then follow those who have passed away because those who are alive are not safe from trials.” If you attribute the truth to men a person could be deceived by himself, we seek refuge of Allah from that and adopt wrong ways. Therefore, I advise you not to attribute the truth to men. Firstly, a man is not safe, I ask Allah to make us firm, a man is not safe from mistakes and trial. Secondly, he will die, no one remains alive, “We granted not to any human being immortality before you then if you die, would they live forever (Surah al-Anbiya, 21:34). Thirdly the sons of Adam, humans may be deceived if he sees people honouring and flocking to him. He might be deceived, he might think he is infallible or claim that he is and believe everything that he does is the truth and that every path he takes is permissible. This could lead him to destruction, a man praised another man a the presence of the Messenger of Allah Salallahu alayhi Wsallam, The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam told him: Woe to you, you have cut the neck of your friend (his back). I thank the brother in advance though I have not heard what he says about me to what he expresses of his feelings towards me I ask Allah to make me as he best sees me no more but I don’t like being praised, I will reward you inshallah and so I ask Allah to reward you and to recompense you”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(YouTube: Don’t Tie the Truth to Men – The Humility of Ibn Uthaymin. Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfKeWwSILvE)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfKeWwSILvE)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After these illustrative examples showing how our scholars displayed humility and how Yasir Qadhi displays the direct opposite. It would be most pertinent to remind the readers secondarily and Yasir himself primarily concerning the issue of Riya- the hidden shirk or polytheism. Yasir Qadhi is usually very quick in listing the names of his books relevant to the Sunni Salafi Aqidah but rarely if at all ever mentions his book on Riya – showing of. On page 43 of the book he mentions how the dangers of riya are the destruction of the Ummah and then on page 45 the love of praise and the most important on page 32, it increases misguidance. It seems likes Yasir Qadhi has not only left Salafism and the Najdi Da’wah but also the basic concepts of self rectification and personal purification of the soul and it is a must that he reads his book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly in this part I would like to leave the readers with words of Shaykh Abd al-Razzaq al-Badr where in he states and the aim to highlight the idea of being humble</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Mutarif ibn Abdillah ibn ash-Shik-kheer who was a scholar from Tabi’in, he saw a man wearing a cloak and walking or strutting boastfully. So, he said to the man: “Oh slave of Allah, this is the type of boastful walking or strutting of those whom Allah hates.” The man replied, “Don’t you know who I am? This man was wearing this beautiful cloak and his appearance was attractive and he was strutting, and someone has the nerve to speak to him in this manner?! Thus he replied, Don’t you know who I am?! Meaning if you knew who I was you would not speak to me like this. Mutarrif said: “On the contrary, of course I know who you are!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You started as a sprinkled drop of sperm</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You will end up as a soiled corpse</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in the meantime you are carrying faeces around (in your intestines)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So I know who you are</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the man went about his way and he no longer strutted and these words of Mutarrif taught this man some manners.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(YouTube: How to humble an arrogant person – By Shaykh Abdur Razzaq Al-Badr. Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee. Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv62pV2BOXw)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv62pV2BOXw)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The purpose of knowledge is that is saves a person from disobeying Allah and his Messenger. Allah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error. (Surah al-Ahzab:36)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hasan al-Basri said: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">there are two types of knowledge, one that which is in the heart which is beneficial knowledge. The second type of knowledge is that which is on the tongue which is Allah’s evidence against mankind. (Sunan al-Darimi, 1:350 no.374, Dar al-Tasil)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With this being said, it is first and foremost for us to be humble and know our status in terms of ilm. Secondly for my fellow Muslims, brothers and sisters to to sit back a little and realise that true scholarship, academia and knowledge is with the Rabbani scholars of this Ummah, their virtue and status is well universal and agreed upon. Thirdly, do not be naïve and let people play with your emotions and Islam, for indeed you alone are responsible for your actions when you have to stand before Allah without any leader, scholar or interpreter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the subsequent parts I will highlight many inconsistencies, contradictions and the true reality of Yasir Qadhi, InshaAllah.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a very short part but hopefully In Sha Allah equally succinct and elucidatory. The Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s all the time call us Najdiyyah coupled with a few other descriptive words or nice adjectives. In fact the Salafi&#8217;s and the Ahl al-Hadith, who are the real Ahl al-Sunnah wal Jama&#8217;ah are very often always referred to as Wahabi&#8217;s or Najdi&#8217;s. At times these Sufi Barailwi&#8217;s write articles and treatise&#8217;s explaining the hadith of the horns of shaytan  refers to najd and the emergence of Shaykh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab from that region i.e. the Najd.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So they say oh you najdis or you najdiyyah, you come from a place which has been cursed i.e. the najd and the emergence of wahhabi&#8217;s was prophesized. When it is explained to them, and the understanding of najd is presented to them with the clear evidences from the scholars of geography and hadith explanations, they remain defiantly adamant that Najd refers to the Wahhabi&#8217;s and for this reason they are evil and cursed. etc and so on. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are sure the readers are familiar with this oft repeated fallacious narrative but what can one do when someone deliberately wants to remain obstinate and ignorant of the truth. In such cases a person who wishes good for these blind following Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s has to choice but to retort to measures which will perhaps illustrate the point, in order for it to sink these thick cell walls of the Sufi&#8217;s because being reasonable, academic and pursuing an evidence approach does not work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, it has also forced us to present the following, so the Sufi&#8217;s and Barelvi&#8217;s have to think long and hard before they traverse this path of Sufi Barelwi teachings. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fact of the matter is, the father of their own Imam, who they blindly make taqlid of without any shame, hesitation or denial, Ie the father of Imam Abu Hanifah was from NAJD,,&#8230; thats right, the father of Imam al-A&#8217;zam, their respective Imam, for both the Barelvi&#8217;s and Deobandi&#8217;s was actually from Najd, have look at this scan from Imam Abu Hibban&#8217;s book <em>Kitab al-Majruhim Minal Muhadithin</em></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So now one begs and asks a question, all this time these rude and ill mannered people have been constantly calling us Najdis, whereas in reality the dad of their own Imam was also from Najd. We will see how they explain this one away especially the meaning of Najd. Either the latter is true or they confess and admit, the dad of their Imam was from Najd, which essentially means the origins and roots of Imam Abu Hanifah were also Najdi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the next time you think you want to be a little sharp with your tongue by calling us najdi&#8217;s, remember the dad of the very Imam that you resort to make blind taqlid of, likewise the Imam you consider to be the greatest Imam and in the same way, the very Imam you say making taqlid of is obligatory, was of NAJDI origin because his dad was from NAJD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now we assume if you have a little shame. self dignity and respect for yourself you will use the term Najdi for us, because it would mean your Imam and his father are with us., get the point oh you real Najdi&#8217;s  </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We continue and say, yes Saudi Arabia has been supporting former terrorists who were on the payroll, who eventually became PIRs, set up their shrines and tombs while making thousands (see grave below)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;">3. <strong>Mawlana Abdul Ma’bud Jilani (d.1406/1985)</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mabud.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7519" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mabud.jpg?resize=175%2C300" alt="ma'bud" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mabud.jpg?resize=175%2C300 175w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mabud.jpg?resize=598%2C1024 598w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mabud.jpg?w=724 724w" sizes="(max-width: 175px) 100vw, 175px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tahir ul-Qadiri mentions Abdul Ma&#8217;bud Jilani (See PART 2), the first thing is can they show us where Ma&#8217;bud is Allah&#8217;s name, Ma&#8217;bud the creation or worshippers cannot be Allahs name and this is yet another example to this people riddled with Shirk, referring to himself as Abdul Ma&#8217;bud, we are only the servants and worshippers of Allah Azzo Wa jal. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Jilani died when he was 165 years old and is buried in pakistan and was given the title of Baba Ji i.e. Holy man. He was the direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi, he visited and also studied with him for a short while. He is also one of the links to the Deobandi&#8217;s and the Deobandi Church father Mawlana Imdadullah Muhajir Makki, whose beliefs were riddled with Shirk and was a senseless proponent of Wahdatul Wajud. Jilani was his Khalifa as were the Deobandi church fathers like Nanotwi and co. This shows the intrinsic link between these two brothers in faith which highlights our view that they are essentially the same fraternity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will now cite what they have said themselves, one from amongst them said</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333399;">Hazrat Shaykh Abdul Mabood al-Jilani and King Abdul Aziz al-Saud:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;">Shaykh Abdul Mabood’s wife invited me one night for dinner. It was the first time I had the opportunity to visit and chat with his wife and the rest of his family in a less formal way. That evening I noticed that there was a plaque on the wall, written in Arabic, and sealed with a wax impression that appeared to be the standard of the royal family of Saud. I asked about it and this is what I was told.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;">After he had performed his pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, Shaykh Abdul Mabood remained in the Hijaz, teaching. King Abdul Aziz bin Saud had just recently taken control of the country and was under tremendous pressure from the Wahhabi scholars in Ryadh to control the emerging influence of the Sufis in the Hijaz, as well as the Shias and their interests in the shrines of the members of the Prophet’s family. Succumbing to their threats, King Abdul Aziz launched a campaign against these two groups, by destroying the shrines of the <em>awliya</em>’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;">Shaykh Abdul Mabood after having petitioning the King on many occasions to stop these activities met with treachery. The king had put a warrant for the Shaykh’s arrest. The Shaykh banded together with others wanting to preserve these holy places, and waged battles against any army that attempted to hurt or destroy these shrines. The conflict raged on for many months. The warrant for the Shaykh’s arrest had become a bounty hunt as the king placed a large sum of gold on Shaykh Abdul Mabood’s head.  After some time the Shaykh was arrested and brought to stand trial in the court of King Abdul Aziz. The trial lasted for but a few minutes, the charges were read and the sentence handed out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;">The Shaykh was brought in front of King Abdul Aziz. Shaykh Abdul Mabood’s head had already been wrapped in clothe and the axe and chopping block were already in the courtyard of the palace. The king leaned over to the Shaykh and asked if there were any last words. The Shaykh began to recite several poems about the qualities of the Prophet’s family and how they should be remembered and cherished for all times. The king was moved to tears. For not only were the words of the Shaykh overwhelmingly beautiful but the king recognized those poems as having been written by his grandfather and recited to him almost every night. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;">King Abdul Aziz al-Saud ordered the clothe to be removed from the Shaykh’s head and for him to be set free. The king approached Shaykh Abdul Mabood and humbly requested his forgiveness. . As a personal show of gratitude to the Shaykh, the King decreed that from that day forward, Shaykh Abdul Mabood would be the guest of the kingdom on the pilgrimage to Hajj.  The kingdom of Saudi Arabia would cover all of his travel expenses and costs to stay in Mecca and Medina. The Shaykh was given an official plaque with this decree. It was this plaque, I asked about on the wall.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;">Prior to receiving this gift, the Shaykh had already performed the Hajj for many years. When I had met him in 1983, he had already completed over 100 pilgrimages to Hajj. As far as we know, he holds the record for attending the pilgrimage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;">His wife went on to tell me that Shaykh Abdul Mabood remains in bed most of the year. A few weeks before Hajj, he starts to move around more and a few days before he sets off to Hajj, he walks around, full of energy. She said that his hair turns from white to gray and even turns black as the Hajj approaches. In her time as wife of the Shaykh, he had lost and grown another set of teeth. As a junior wife, she remembered coming into a household of two other senior wives that the Shaykh had several sets of teeth come in and fall over his lifetime.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, interesting, sifting through the emotional ordeal presented for Malik Abdul Aziz, because we know from documented history he was not like this, he was resolute and firm in his beliefs as he was a Muwahhid. Thus, making emotional points like this is nothing new from the sufi Barailwi&#8217;s. Let us look over some points,</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Jilani Had a plaque of the Saudi Royal Family (as a Tawiz) on his Wall</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;Plaque on the wall, written in Arabic, and sealed with a wax impression that appeared to be the standard of the royal family of Saud.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this Barelwi holy man reveres the Saudi Royal family by putting their family plaque on his wall, so where are the barailwis cursing the Saudi&#8217;s and the government, and saying petrol dollars, US Saudi, let them levy these points against their own &#8216;PIR,&#8217; a lover of the Wahabi Najdiyyah!!!!!! Tut Tut, pointing fingers only hurts them!</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2. The Khariji, Terror, Extremist Activities of these Barailwi Renegades.</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;The Shaykh banded together with others wanting to preserve these holy places, and waged battles against any army that attempted to hurt or destroy these shrines. The conflict raged on for many months.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now I bet your thinking, &#8216;uh o&#8217;, what on earth is going on here. Well let us just break it down for you, your PIR, Holy man, saint, who died at the age of 165, who you call Arif Billah, the one who knew Allah, waged a battle against the Saudi&#8217;s, he is the church father of modern day terror and kharijism, the leader of the anti Saudi&#8217;s, aiding the British colonialists and western attempt to control the Muslim countries. I just wonder who was supporting him with these battles and his army??? So now who has the Khariji, Terrorist, Extremist origins and kindly apply the Khawarij Narrative to your own SUFI PIR? If only you were that honest and upright!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers this is what you call extreme terrorists and origins of the Khawarij in Saudi Arabia. Perhaps the Sufi&#8217;s and Rafidah Shi&#8217;i colluded in their extreme terror activities and their offshoot are continuing today, in their treacherous campaign to malign Saudi Arabia, its leaders, the peaceful nation which has not propagated nothing but Tawhid and Sunnah. Was it perhaps, the British pound-acquired from pillaging the Muslims countries, perhaps the Shi&#8217;a currency or just the ardent grave worshipper Sufis all uniting to attack Saudi Arabia, the land of Tawhid. Even worse, was it the Neo Cons, Freemasons or even the Rothschild&#8217;s all funding these Khariji renegades???  Talking about the shrines of the &#8216;Awliya&#8217; why are we not surprised at this, just look at Jilani&#8217;s grave, it is anything but the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Note the word &#8216;PIR&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-16-at-11.57.23.png"><img class="wp-image-7517 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-16-at-11.57.23.png?resize=428%2C315" alt="Screen Shot 2017-07-16 at 11.57.23" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-16-at-11.57.23.png?resize=300%2C221 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-16-at-11.57.23.png?resize=768%2C566 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-16-at-11.57.23.png?w=790 790w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>3. Saudi Funded with Petrol Dollars &#8211; Cursing the the Very Hand you Eat out of!!!</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>&#8220;As a personal show of gratitude to the Shaykh, the King decreed that from that day forward, Shaykh Abdul Mabood would be the guest of the kingdom on the pilgrimage to Hajj.  The kingdom of Saudi Arabia would cover all of his travel expenses and costs to stay in Mecca and Medina. The Shaykh was given an official plaque with this decree. It was this plaque, I asked about on the wall.&#8221;</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I suppose there was no shame in taking money from Saudi&#8217;s, living off them, their treatment, their wealth even though they waged a war against them with an army. I also suppose it is acceptable to take Saudi money generated from Petrol. I means its absolutely shameless to throw these childish allegations against Saudi especially since one of your PIR&#8217;s had been leeching the Saudi&#8217;s of their petrol dollars for over 100 Hajjs, I mean just add that up. This is treachery, deception, two faced of the worst kind. If you have no shame at least have shame for your OWN PIR or declare him to be a Khariji Terrorist, just like the Khariji Terrorist zionist jews, who waged a war of terror against the British in Palestine, and of course you know this disease of terror, extremism and killing innocent Muslims has not left the zionist jews till this day. They are all enemies of humanity, equal rights, justice and the sanctity of life. May Allah liberate and and give victory to the Muslims in every place and let us return to Tawhid and the Sunnah, Amin</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What do they usually say, YA NAJDIYYAH, Saudi created by the British, British spies and all sorts, we humbly ask please levy all of these allegations towards your own PIR who died at the age of 165, either that, or issue a full refund of all the money used by your PIR for the 100 Hajj&#8217;s he performed at the behest of Saudi Arabia, if not and you have even a little, a very very small amount of shame, then have the common decency to zip those venomous mouths and long snake tongues which move shamelessly, hurling the neo con and new world order agenda against Saudi Arabia and refrain from becoming the mouth pieces of the Rafidah Shi&#8217;a as well the Ikhwani rabid Khariji renegades, whether they are from within Saudi Arabia or outside.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By Allah we will not remain silent, do you think we cannot respond to your confusion and this treacherous deceptive continuous campaigns against the Salafi&#8217;s and Ahl al-Hadith. The deconstruction and dismantling process has begun InshaAllah&#8230;..</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Fawakah al-Adhab Fi Radd A’la Man Lam Yahkam al-Sunnah wa’l Kitab</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ahmad bin Nasir bin Uthman al-Mu’amari al-Najdi [1225H]</span></strong></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(From the students and disciples of Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab [1206H])</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mushrikin would worship the righteous people and ask them for their needs, believing they were intermediateries and intercessors. Allah the Mighty also warned and reprimanded them from this type of calling and informed them those they call upon cannot help them alleviate their sorrow nor change anything. Therefore every individual who calls upon the Prophets, the righteous, the dead, the angels or the Jinn does so in order to seek help and they ask such entities that are unable to help. They are unable to remove or change their difficulties and calamities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The norm of the mushriks today is that when a calamity or hardship befalls them, they call upon their Shaikhs and saints (Pirs). They continuously cry and call their names and humble themselves whilst submitting themselves in a dire state of need. They feel ease and tranquillity by calling on the names of the Shaikhs and saints and they do this at times of hardship but also generally on a daily basis and they feel ease and peace in this just as a child feels ease and peace when they hear their mothers name or voice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Strangely when they say Oh Ibn Abbas or mention the name of any other righteous person they will never say anything in vain or lie without fearing Allah and when they mention the name of their righteous individuals and saints they will never lie because they think it will harm them or put them into difficulty and hardship and therefore they fear the creation more than the creator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[he goes onto say]&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Obeying and following the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam is mandatory in every affair and by the grace and blessings of Allah, we follow and obey the commands of the Messenger of Allah Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam the most. Whatever he informed us; we follow and affirm more than our hearts and lives and thus obey his commands and rulings. We also follow and obey the rules and regulations he was sent with and we adopt the principles he came with.</span></p>
