(Kauthar);<br />
</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> </span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (1/197, hadith no.464, book 14, chapter 5, hadith no.10), at-Tamhid (2/285) and al-Istidhkar (no.433) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Ahmad (2/465, 533) from the hadith of Malik with the same meaning and narrated by al-Bukhari (no.7335) from the hadith of Malik which is from Abu Hurairah (Radi Allahu Anhu) without any doubt. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Some people say that the meaning of Jannah in this hadith is that this area will be put into Jannah on the Day of Judgement and some other people say that this is where the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayi Wa Sallam) used to live. The people used to learn about the Quran, Iman and things about the religion from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and those who act upon this will end up reaching Jannah. Therefore this has been metaphorically called a garden from one of the gardens of Jannah just like it has been mentioned in a hadith that Jannah is under the shades of swords (Bukhari no.2818). Meaning that the sincere believer who fights in the path of Allah will go to Jannah. See at-Tamhid (2/287) and Allah knows best.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Some people use this hadith to try and establish that Madinah Munawarah is more virtuous than Makkah Mukaramah however this deduction is incorrect and neither have the pious predecessors understood this. In a hadith the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) declared that Makkah Mukaramah is the best part of Allah&#8217;s Earth. See Sunan Ibn Majah (no.3108, and it&#8217;s chain is Sahih and at-Tirmidhi authenticated it no.3925, and al-Hakim on the conditions of the two Shaikhs 3/7 and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him) and at-Tamhid (2/288). No one has the right to talk against this issue after the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) has made a decision. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) If a narrator of a narration has a doubt on which thiqah narrator he specified then this is not harmful rather this narration is Sahih on the condition that the rest of the chain is also Sahih. This is because all the companions are classified as being Udul (i.e. all of them are thiqah) therefore the exact companion not being specified in this chain does not cause it to be harmful. wal-Hamdullilah </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The Hawd Kawthar is a true reality which Allah specifically gave to His beloved (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Ibn Abdul Bar said that the Hawd Kawthar has been mentioned in the mutawatir hadith of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Ahlus Sunnah and the people of truth believe in this and affirm it. Similarly they believe in the hadith which mention the intercession (on the day of judgement) and the punishment of the grave and they affirm this. (at-Tamhid 2/309) </span></p>

I love to see my brothers.&#8221; They (the companions) said: Aren&#8217;t we your brothers, O Messenger of Allah? He said: You are my companions, and our brothers are those who have, so far, not come into the world and I would arrive at the Hawd (Kawthar) before them . They said: Messenger of Allah, how would you recognise those persons of your Ummah who will after you (and have not yet been born into the world yet)? He said: What do you think about a man who had horses with white faces and feet among horses which were all black, tell me, would he not recognise his own horses? They said: Certainly, O Messenger of Allah. He said: These people (my Ummah) will come ono the day of Judgement with white faces, arms and feet (due to the ablution), and I would arrive at the Hawd (Kawthar) before them. Then some people would be driven away from my Hawd (Kawthar) as the stray camel is driven away. I would call out to them (three times): Come here, come here, come here. Then it would be said (to me): These people changed (the Sunnah and the religion of Islam by Innovating things into it) after you (passed away), thus I would say: Get far away (from me), get far away (from me), get far away (from me).<br />

<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [IT&#8217;S CHAIN IS SAHIH]</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES] <span style="color: #000000">&#8211; [MUSLIM]</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (1/28-30 hadith no.57, book 2, chapter 6, hadith no.28), at-Tamhid (20/238, 239) al-Istidhkar (no.51)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Muslim (no.249) from the hadith of Malik </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Apart from specifically making special preparations to travel to a particular grave, it is highly recommended to visit the graveyard in order to make dua for the deceased Muslim people and to reflect and remember death. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Note that the prohibition of visiting graves has been abrogated. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Women are allowed to visit the graves of their close relatives such as their brother etc. just as it is established from the authentic ahadith. See Sahih Bukhari (no.1283) and Sahih Muslim (no.974, Darusalam no.2256)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">A&#8217;isha (Radi Allahu Anha) went to the grave of her brother Abdurahman Ibn Abi Bakr (Radi Allahu Anhuma). (See al-Mustadrak of al-Hakim 1376 hadith no.1392, and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Sahih]</em> and adh-Dhahabi authenticated it)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">However note that it is not allowed for women to go the graves of non-relatives such as the grave of a scholar who was famous amongst the general people. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">See Sunan Abi Dawud (no.3123 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Hasan]</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Rather the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) has cursed (sent La&#8217;nah) on those women who visit graves frequently. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">See Sunan Ibn Majah (no.1576, and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Hasan]</em>) and Sunan at-Tirmidhi (no.1056, and he said: <em>[Hasan Sahih]</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) Asalamu alaikum is a dua. In no way does this mean that the dead can hear because it is wajib for the one who hears the salam to reply back to it and there is no authentic hadith which mentions that the dead person gives the reply of salam. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The meaning of when the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said that those righteous believers who will come after him are his brothers was an indication of his great love and great kindness for them. On the other hand the The Prophet or Messenger (Alayhimusalam) is the Imam, guide, leader and the one who should be obeyed. He is not restricted to only being a big brother (!) it is noteworthy to understand this point fully. The righteous predecessors did not go around saying that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was our big brother and we should respect him (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) as a big brother is respected. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) The Hawd Kawthar is a reality. The people who innovate in the religion and the wrongdoers will be taken far away from it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) will recognise his followers from the Ummah on the day of Judgement because the body parts which they did ablution on will be shining. For example see at-Tamhid (20/261, 262 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Hasan]</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) did not have knowledge of the unseen rather Allah is the only One who has knowledge of the unseen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) It is a highly good deed to act upon the Quran and Sunnah in the era where there are severe amounts of Innovation in the religion, misguidance, disbelief and oppression. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"> </span></p>
