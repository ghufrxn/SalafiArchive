<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">&#8216;Ala Hazrat&#8217; Ahmad Raza Khan al-Barelwi</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The barelwi writer Muhammad Faiz Ahmad Owais writes in one place,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Imam Ahmad Raza Khan was an enemy of the british..&#8221;</em> (Ala Hazrat Ka Salmi Jihad &#8211; <em>The Jihad of the Pen of Ala Hazrat </em>p.8)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He further said,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;He hated the British with a passion and the british rule.&#8221; </em>(Ala Hazrat Ka Salmi Jihad &#8211; <em>The Jihad of the Pen of Ala Hazrat </em>p.10)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Syed Altaf Ali Barelvi has expressed his viewpoint as under:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“Politically speaking, Imam Ahmed Raza believed in complete independence and perfect freedom. He was deadly against the British and the British rule.&#8221;</em> ( The Daily Jung, Karachi dated 25.1.79. p-6)
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another Bareilwi research, Muhammad Masud Ahmad writes,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Imam Ahmed Raza was also against the British regime.&#8221;</em> (Gunah Be Gunah p.17)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">he also said</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Imam Ahmed Raza’s son, Maulana Hamid Raza Khan also hated the British Government. &#8220;</em> (Gunah Be Gunah p.18)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahmad Raza Khan and his family were also against what we would call nowadays, british values. Muhammad Masud Ahmad writes,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Maulana Hamid Raza Khan, the son of Maulana Ahmed Raza Khan criticized British civilization and culture in his presidential address at Muradabad. The forth right criticism of the British civilization and culture which he made in course of his inaugural address at Muradabad, 1925 merits our attention and must be studied. He said at the All India Sunni Conference held at Muradabad from 20th to 23rd Shaban, 1343 A.H/l6th to 19th March, 1925,&#8221;</em> (Gunah Be Gunah p. 20)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad Masud Ahmad further writes,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Imam Ahmed Raza went in 1337 A.H./1919 A, D to Jabalpur on the invitation of Maulana Abdul Salam. It should be noted that it was the year when Khilafat Movement had started and there was opposition to the British Indian Government on a large scale. During his sojourn at Jabalpur, Imam Ahmed Raza used to go for sight-seeing off and on. Mufti Muhammad Burhanul Haque Jabalpuri (son of Maulana Abdul Salam) who is more than ninety years old now, writes: </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“One day after Asr Prayer the Maulana went on buggy for sight-seeing towards Guncarriage factory. A group of British military soldiers was going from the factory to their quarters. On seeing them, Ala Hadrat said, “The wretch, they are completely monkeys.” (Gunah Be Gunah p.24), Ikram Imam Ahmed Raza</em> (Gunah Be Gunah p.91)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">he further says,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;From the foregoing evidence and facts, it is clear that Imam Ahmed Raza was neither a well-wisher of the British, nor liked or loved anything English i.e., their regime, civilization and culture, education system, their ideas and faces.</em> (Gunah Be Gunah p.25)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many other statement from Ahmad Raza Khan and his view of the british, it would take many parts to address all of the issues but suffice it to say the origins of extremist and disruption to british society comes from the teachings of Ahmad Raza Khan. One can consult the book of Muhammad Masud Khan Gunah Be Ghunah and how he highlights the view of Ahmad Raza Khan and his opposition to the sanctity of society in the UK. This is another answer to the so called Henry Jackson Society who have been playing hide and seek with the truth.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Taken from: <strong><span style="color: #000080;">al-Barelwiyyah; Their History and Beliefs Volume 2, <em>Expounding The Belief of the Pious Ancestors and Ahl al-Sunnah w’al Jama’ah</em><em> </em><em>&amp; </em><em>What Opposes it from the Wicked Deviation of the Barelwi Renegades</em></span></strong></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Historical Overview &#8211; Sufi Barelwi Renegades &amp; Their Origins in Extreme Terror and Kharijism; The Barelwi Ancestry and Lineage</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We begin by looking at the Barelwi Ash’arite and Sufi Churchfathers and their affect on the muslim society. It is common knowledge and a specific and particular hallmark of the Barelwi underlings and global sufi sympathisers that the Saudi Wahabis are government funded, they rebel and murder people, Khawarij and all sorts of fallacious delusional points.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will show how the Barelwi forefathers were themselves upon the methodology of killing innocent Muslims and how they colluded against the Muslims. We will also show how some of them were renegades themselves,  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the lineage of Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Naqi Ali Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Raza Ali Khan son of  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Kazim Ali Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Azam Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’adat Yar Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’idullah Khan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Zafar al-Din Qadri Bihari, <em>Hayat A’la Hazrat</em>, (Karachi: Maqtabah Rizviyya, 1:2 Muhammad Sabir al-Qadiri Nasim al-Bastawi, <em>Ahwal wa Athar Hazrat Mujaddid Islam</em> (Lahore: Raza Academy, 1998) p.34 </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Sa’idullah Khan</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He hailed from Kandahar which in present day Afghanistan, he was a pathan belonging to the Barech tribe. He eventually migrated to Lahore with Sultan Muhammad Nadir Shah as part of his war expeditions. He was given prestigious and high ranking positions within Nadir Shahs Safavid Dynasty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then moved to Delhi whilst he was minister of a department. He received the accolade and title of ‘Bravery of war,’ an official title from the Ruler, ie Muhammad Nadir Shah for his bravery and ardent loyalty (Muhammad Sabir al-Qadiri Nasim al-Bastawi, <em>Ahwal wa Athar Hazrat Mujaddid Islam</em>, p.34) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Nadir Shah (d.1747) was the ruler or Iran of the Safavid Dynasty and had the title The Shah of Iran. He was, naturally of Iranian descent belonging to the Afshar tribe hailing from Khurasan. He was born a Shi’i as an Itha Ashari and was an ardent follower of the Jafari school of thought. Due to the political turmoil at the time he would often say to people he was also sunni in order to keep his cohorts to support him and also to keep the opposing Ottoman empire from fighting him. In fact, numerous people serving and working with him failed to highlight whether he was sunni or shi’i, such was his deception</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He attempted to mix the two and made his own madhab called the jafari madhab so that the ottomans would accept him. His aim was to allow the persians to perform Hajj which was under Ottoman control and administration, and his only aim behind this was to make this a revenue stream. (Michael Axworthy&#8217;s, <em>The Sword of Persia</em> (I.B. Tauris, 2006), Tucker, Ernest, &#8220;Nadir Shah and the Ja&#8217;fari Mazhab reconsidered&#8221;, in <em>Iranian Studies</em>, vol. 27, 1-4 (1994), pp,163-179.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He continued to fight for the Safavid dynasty which was in decline at the period and thus Nadir Shah seized the opportunity to launch his own house. Nadir Shah continued to lead numerous military expeditions throughout the lands, which he was successful in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the time Ghilzai Afghans had control of the southeast regions, namely Kandahar. This was later controlled by the Hotaki dynasty. Nadir Shah defeated the Hotaki dynasty in approximately 1738 and took control of Kandahar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is where Sa’idullah Khan joined Nadir Shah and became a part of his dynasty war campaign for domination. Nadir Shah then went onto fight the Mughals and their empire and in the process captured cities like Ghazni, Kabul, Peshawar, parts of Sindh and Lahore.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Nadir Shah’s history and campaign were a far cry from innocence, one only needs to read the annals of history and they will come to know the wicked and evil nature of his deviation, theologically and socially.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The aim is not to present a reading into the evil actions of certain individuals or a history lesson but to show if one makes erroneous and fabricated claims against Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and al-Saud family, the closet will yield some home truths! (For further reading on the generosity and life of Muhammad Nadir Shah Read, Michael Axworthy&#8217;s, <em>The Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from Tribal Warrior to Conquering Tyrant</em>. (I.B. Tauris, 2006), Ernest Tucker, <em>Nadir Shah&#8217;s Quest for Legitimacy in Post-Safavid Iran</em> (Florida, University Press, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the likes of whom the forefathers of Ahmad Raza Khan colluded with, to cause havoc and rampage in muslim territories, the atrocities, genocide, pillaging land, and philandering of wealth and woman of unprecedented levels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to ask the barelwi sympathisers what do they make of the claim, which they often hurl at Ahl al-Sunnah, petrol dollars, the illegal al-Saud state, corroborating with the British, killing innocent muslims, mass murdering and declaring Muslims to be disbelievers. Of course this is sheer nonsense which has been answered in great detail, however the ignorant wandering mind will always have difficulty focusing on the truth and facts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This said, Barelwi Sufi narrow mindedness and genius level of reasoning fails to see and acknowledge how the forefathers of their Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan were part of such acts which were absolutely heinous and catastrophically evil.  </span></p>
