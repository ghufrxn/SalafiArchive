<div class="entry">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>“</strong><strong>Oh, you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best [way].”</strong><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>at-Ta’a</strong> i.e., obedience means total obedience to Allah and his Messenger ﷺ and complete submission of every command. The Ulil Amr are the rulers who the people are agreed upon as their leader or ruler.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Abdullah b. Dinar said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">When Ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma witnessed people agree on the leadership of Abdul Malik he wrote, I hear and obey Abdullah b. Abdul Malik Amir al-Mu’minin according to the Sunnah of Allah and the Sunnah of his Messenger to the best of my ability and my sons have also done the same.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Obedience to them [rulers] entails hearing and obeying things that are liked and disliked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Abu Hurayah RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates from Allah’s Messenger ﷺ who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Whoever obeyed me obeyed Allah and whoever disobeys me has truly disobeyed Allah and whoever obeys the Amir (ruler) has verily obeyed me and whoever disobeyed the Amir (ruler) has truly disobeyed me.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">And another hadith narrated from him i.e., Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu mentions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">It is obligatory upon you to listen and obey the ruler in hardship and ease, in pleasure and displeasure, and even when another person is given preference [unduly] over you.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The words of the hadith, <em>‘Atharati Alayka’ </em>means to single something out which you had a right over. This hadith encourages and obliges us to hear and obey the ruler even If the leader is oppressive. The right to obey him needs to be fulfilled without rebelling against him or to replace him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">On the authority of Abdullah b. Amr RadhiAllahu Anhu from the Prophet ﷺ who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">A Muslim must listen and obey (the ruler) whether he likes it or dislikes, if he does not order sinning as there is no hearing or obeying if he orders you to sin.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The words of the hadith, <em>‘Fima Ahabba wa Kariha &#8211; whether he likes it or dislikes it.’</em> meaning whether he agrees or disagrees with it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">If the leader orders you or applies a ruling when there is a difference of opinion amongst the scholars, then it is impermissible to openly criticise him. If someone wishes to advise him, it should be done privately, and this is not for everyone. This is the duty of the well-known scholars, and it is not necessary that he accepts every advice. It is possible what he ordered might be to help his country.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">It is obligatory to obey the rulers in other matters they command and prohibit, and it is impermissible and unlawful to rebel against them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The Imam of Ahlus-Sunnah waʾl Jama’ah, Abu Muhammad al-Barbahari (d.329H) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Whoever rebels against a Muslim ruler is a Khariji, has caused dissent within the Muslims and contradicted the narrations and dies a death from the days of ignorance (Jahiliyyah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">It is impermissible to fight the ruler or to rebel against him, even if he oppressive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">There is no fighting against the ruler according to the Sunnah because there is destruction turmoil in the religion and worldly affairs.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided.”</strong><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The Rope of Allah according to Ahlus Sunnah wa&#8217;l Jama&#8217;ah includes and incorporates the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of Allah&#8217;s Messenger ﷺ just as it includes and incorporates sticking to the Jama&#8217;ah and its leader.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">On the authority of Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu who reported the Prophet ﷺ said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Verily Allah likes three things for you, and He disapproves three things for you. He is pleased with you that you worship Him and not associate anything with him, that you hold fast the Rope of Allah and not be divided, and He dislikes for in idle talk (gossip – It was said, and he said), asking to many questions and wasting of wealth.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">On the authority of Zayd b. Thabit RadhiAllahu Anhu from Allah&#8217;s Messenger ﷺ who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">There are three things the heart of a Muslim does not fetter from, sincerely performing actions for Allah, advising Muslim rulers and sticking to the Jama&#8217;ah of the Muslims since their supplications include others.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma transmits Allah&#8217;s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Whoever notices something he dislikes from his ruler, he should be patient, for whoever becomes separates a hand-span from the Jama’ah dies the death pre-lslamic period of Ignorance.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Muhammad b. al-Munkadir said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">When Yazid b. Mu&#8217;awiyyah was given the pledge of allegiance it was mentioned to Ibn Umar and he said, &#8216;We are content if there is good in it and we will have patience if there is harm in it&#8217;.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">There are numerous reports that corroborate this meaning, and they also encourage to abandon evil which leads to separation from the Jama&#8217;ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">On the authority of Hudhaifah b. al-Yaman, the people used to ask Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) about the good but I used to ask him about the evil lest I should be overtaken by them. So, I said, &#8216;Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)! We were living in ignorance and in an (extremely) worst atmosphere, then Allah brought to us this good (i.e., Islam); will there be any evil after this good?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Will there be any good after that evil?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Yes, but it will be tainted (not pure.)&#8217; I asked, &#8216;What will be its taint?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(There will be) some people who will guide others not according to my tradition? You will approve of some of their deeds and disapprove of some others&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Will there be any evil after that good?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Yes, (there will be) some people calling at the gates of the (Hell) Fire, and whoever will respond to their call, will be thrown by them into the (Hell) Fire.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah s Apostle! Will you describe them to us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;They will be from our own people and will speak our language.&#8217; I said, &#8216;What do you order me to do if such a state should take place in my life?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Stick to the group of Muslims and their Imam (ruler).&#8217; I said, &#8216;If there is neither a group of Muslims nor an Imam (ruler)?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Then turn away from all those sects even if you were to bite (eat) the roots of a tree till death overtakes you while you are in that state.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Trials and tribulations do not occur except when Allah&#8217;s commands are abandoned as He orders with the truth and patience. Trials and tribulations occur when either the truth or patience is abandoned.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">From the great principles of the religion is cooperation through uniting the hearts. Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them. It is they for whom there is an awful torment.</strong><strong>”</strong><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>“…So, fear Allah and adjust all matters of difference among you…”</strong><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">There are other textual examples in the Quran which command sticking to the Jama’ah, prohibit separation and differing. Those worthy of this principle are Ahlus Sunnah and whoever leaves this principle are the people of separation and division.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Imam Tahawi said while mentioning the beliefs of Ahlus Sunnah wa&#8217;l Jama&#8217;ah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">We do not rebel against our Imams or those in charge of our affairs even if they are oppressive, nor do we wish evil on them, nor do we withdraw from following them. We hold that obedience to them is obedience to Allah, the Glorified, and therefore obligatory as long as they do not order sin. We pray for their right guidance and ask for pardon for their wrongs.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Imam al-Barbahari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">If you see a man supplicating against the ruler, know that he is a person of innovation. If you see a person supplicating for the guidance of a ruler, then know he is a person of Sunnah In-sha-Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Fudayl b. Iyad said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">If I knew my supplication would be accepted, I would supplicate for the rectification of the ruler because a rectified ruler is rectification of the people and the nation.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Al-Barbahari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">We are ordered to supplicate for their (i.e., the rulers) rectification and not to supplicate against them even if they are tyrannical and oppressive, since their tyranny and oppression reflect only on themselves, but their rectitude is good on themselves and the Muslims.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">At-Tahawi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">We follow the Sunnah and the Jama’ah, we stay away from deviation, differing and divisions.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Al-Jama&#8217;ah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Jama&#8217;ah refers to the community of Muslims from the Companions, the Tabi&#8217;in (Successors) and those who followed them until the day of Judgement. Obeying them leads to guidance and opposing them is clear misguidance.  This leads and emphasises obeying the Muslim ruler, not rebelling against him, sticking to the body of the Muslims, staying away from misguided sects and the hypocrites who speak and appear like us but indeed they are more dangerous than the open enemy. Therefore, it is upon every Muslim in general and the specifically for every student of knowledge to acquire beneficial knowledge from the Quran and Sunnah and the statements of the pious predecessors to defend the authentic Aqidah, the pure religion, and the appointed rulers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Umar b. al-Khattab RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">There is no religion without the Jama&#8217;ah and there is no Jama&#8217;ah except with the ruler and there is no ruler except with obedience.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">As for commanding good and forbidding evil, the aim and objective is as Shaykh ul-Islam [Ibn Taymiyyah] mentioned,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">If trying to achieve righteousness through completing good deeds, commanding good and forbidding evil results in more harm instead of good, then it is impermissible.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">When advising the ruler, it is necessary to so with wisdom and good conduct for him to accept.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">On the authority of Iyadh b. Ghanam RadhiAllahu Anhu from Allah&#8217;s Messenger ﷺ who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Whoever intends to advise the ruler, should not do this openly but rather take him by his hand and advise him privately. It is good if he accepts, and if not, you have fulfilled your duty.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Some scholars are of the view if the ruler stops a scholar from issuing a verdict, the scholars does not have the right to issue it. Despite this, if he does issue a fatwa, he will incur sin. This is because legal verdicts are intended to rectify the hearts. For example, it is necessary for the ruler to scrutinize the heart doctor compared to the doctor of the body since he is more important for rectifying the heart and this example also applies to teachers (and scholars).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The Prophet ﷺ said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Leave me as I leave you, for the people who were before you were ruined because of their questions and their differences over their prophets. So, if I forbid something, then keep away from it and if I order you with something, then do as much as you can. Agreed upon.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The honourable Shaykh Abdul Aziz b. Baz said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">It is not from the methodology of the Salaf to spread the sins of the ruler, mentioning them from the pulpits as this leads to turmoil and it prevents people from obeying them in righteousness. This leads to harmful matters and has no benefit. However, the way adhered by the Salaf was to advise the ruler, writing to them, or involving scholars who had connection with them, for them to change them in righteousness.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">As for abusing and cursing rulers and dishonouring them is not from the Manhaj of the Salaf. It is narrated by Anas b. Malik RadhiAllahu Anhu who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">The major Companions of the Prophet ﷺ would prohibit us [from abusing and cursing the rulers] and said, do not abuse them, betray them, and have hatred for them, fear Allah and have patience as indeed the last affair is near.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The first person who started the practise of abusing the rulers and dishonouring them was Abdullah b. Saba al-Yahudi the Yemeni. He portrayed Islam for himself and then travelled to Muslim lands like Hijaz, Egypt, Sham, Kufah and Basrah and incited people against Uthman that he seized Khilafah from Ali and looted wealth without right. He repeated the mantra and claim among people in the various lands that he was enjoining the obligation of commanding good and forbidding evil. This resulted in discoursing the reports of the fitnah and turmoil surrounding the murder of Amir al-Mu&#8217;minin Uthman b. Affan RadhiAllahu Anhu and this remains the case today in people discussing it. The knife with which (Ibn Saba) stabbed the Muslim Ummah could not be removed!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Some modern writers cannot understand the intricacies of these events and so they do not cease to speak ill of Muslim rulers in general and Amir al-Mu&#8217;minin Uthman b. Affan RadhiAllahu Anhu specifically because of the hypocrite Yahudi.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">This is the Aqidah of Ahlus Sunnah wa&#8217;l Jama&#8217;ah in the obligation of hearing and obeying Muslim rulers, not to rebel against them especially when the ruler and his appointed people call to adhering to the Quran and Sunnah and the authentic Aqidah which was adopted by the best people of this Ummah [i.e., Salaf us-Salihin]. When they command and order to establish the prayer and Islamic punishment, establish justice amongst the people, maintain safety and peace in the country, fight corruption and innovations, then it is obligatory on everyone under their rule to aid and obey them, to supplicate for their steadfastness and give them success and long lives.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated &amp; Annotated<br />
</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question 10</strong>: </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is it from the Manhaj of the Salaf to criticise or rebuke the rulers from the Minbars? And what is the Manhaj of the Salaf in advising rulers?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The honourable Shaykh Abdul Aziz b. Abdullah b. Baz said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Answer: 10<br />
</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is not from the methodology of the Salaf to spread the sins of the ruler, mentioning them from the pulpits as this leads to turmoil and it prevents people from obeying them in righteousness. This leads to harmful matters and has no benefit. However, the way adhered by the Salaf was to advise the ruler, writing to them, or involving scholars who had connection with them, for them to change them in righteousness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for repelling evil without mentioning them by name, repelling and reprimanding, fornication, alcohol, riba without mentioning those who commit or engage in them, then this is obligatory and general textual evidence allude to this. It is sufficient to reprimand and warn against evil deeds without mentioning who did them, whether it is the ruler or other than him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the fitnah occurred during the time of Uthman RadhiAllahu Anhu some people said to Usamah b. Zayd RadhiAllahu Anhu,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Have you not spoken to Uthman?” Usamah said, “You think I have not spoken to him unless you heard it? I have certainly spoken to him about the matter and it is between us without bringing it up. I do not like to be the first to bring it up. [<strong>tr.</strong> <em>Musnad Ahmad</em> no. 21784]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the ignorant Khawarij opened the door to evil in the time of Uthman RadhiAllahu Anhu and they openly rebuked and criticised Uthman it was a great fitnah, killing and corruption, the effect of which has still not subsided in people today. To the extent that the fitnah encompassed in what occurred between Ali and Mu’awiyyah RadhiAllahu Anhuma. They killed Uthman and Ali RadhiAllahu Anhuma due to this reason [i.e., openly criticising and rebuking the rulers]. In fact, the same reason led to the killing of many Companions and others which was to openly rebuke and criticise rulers, to mention their sins openly. To the extent that many people had hatred for the rulers and killed them. Iyadh b. Ghanam al-Ash’ari RadhiAllahu Anhu transmits from Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whoever intends to advise the ruler, he should not do this openly but rather take him by his hand and advise him privately. It is good if he accepts, and if not, you have fulfilled your duty. (Transmitted by <em>Ahmad</em> (3/403-404) and Ibn Abi Asim in <em>Kitab as-Sunnah</em> (2/521) [<strong>tr.</strong> <em>Musnad Ahmad </em>no.15333)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask Allah for well-being and safety for ourselves and our Muslim brothers from every evil, Indeed Allah listens and responds.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wa Sallalahu wa-Sallam Ala Sayyiduna Muhammad Wa-Alihi Wa-Sahbihi</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong> Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>[Taken from the Introduction of, The Distinctive Jurisprudence of Ahl al-Ḥadīth; Prayer &amp; Purification Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn Shāh al-Rāshidī al-Sindhī]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have already compiled a biography of <strong>Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn</strong> which was first published online around 2001 and it was the first ever biography of the Shaykh<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> in English. One may refer to it for a basic background of the Shaykh, his teachers, students and writings. This biography has since been used by others with modifications and at the same time some new biographies have been published online, however all of them use the same generic sources and thus without any new information. What follows, I hope, In-Shāʾ-Allāh are brief snippets from the life of the Shaykh that are not in English.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh ʿAtā Allāh Thāqib</strong> lauded him with the following titles;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>Nāṣir al-Sunnah al-Nabawiyyah, Nāṣir al-ʿAqīdah al-Salafiyyah, Qāṭeʿ al-Bidʿah, al-Mujāhid, Lā ʿElā Kalimatallāhi, al-Ṣalb Fi al-Sunnah, al-Malāzim lil-ʿIbādah, al-ʿĀlim al-Fāḍhil, al-Muḥaddith, al-Faqīh, Raʾis al-Muḥaqqiqīn, al-ʿAllāmah, al-Shaykh, t</em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="color: #003366;">he defender of the Prophetic Sunnah and Salafī ʿAqīdah, the destroyer of innovations, the Mujāhid, the upholder of the word of Allāh, firm in the Sunnah, inherent in worship, the virtuous scholar, the scholar of hadith, the jurist, the leader of the researchers, the savant, the learned.</span><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a formidable scholar who spread Islam throught the lands he travelled to. He travelled from town to town, village to village and city to city spreading the message of Tawḥīd and Sunnah and reprimanded Shirk and Bidʿah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once a person upon Tawḥīd called Shaykh Badīʿ to his village to deliver a lecture. When the Shaykh arrived at the Masjid the adminstrators stopped him from delivering his lecture. <strong>He then proceded to his house and delivered his lecture on his roof.</strong> So, in the middle of the silent night, on the roof with only one listener the Shaykh began his lecture, and with his powerful voice and stature, his words echoed and resonated across the whole village, and when he recited the Qurʿān in his uniqe melodious manner and expounded Tawḥīd, the people started to come out of their houses, slowly by slowly until a huge crowd had assembled in the bazzar. <strong>Then they started listening attentively until many of them adopted the dawʿah of</strong> <strong>Tawḥīd</strong>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This relentless effort in calling to <strong>Tawḥīd</strong> in remote parts of Sindh and in Pakistan led to everyone knowing the daʿwah of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth and the call of the Messengers. So much so that when the Shaykh began his daʿwah in Sindh there was not a single Masjid of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth there and when he died there were over <strong>eight hundred (800)</strong> Ahl al-Ḥadīth Masājids in Sindh and its interior. <strong>Shaykh Zubayr ʿAlī Zaʾī</strong> said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>The Shaykh despite being busy in writing and researching, especially the Tafsīr of the Qurʾān, he would diligently take time out for his students. Whenever he would teach, it would seem that he had prepared his notes but in reality this was the phenomenon of his remarkable memory. Some of the most difficult quotes and passages would flow off his tongue without any difficulty. He vehemently opposed the <strong>Khawārij and the Takfirīs and was firm on the methodology of Ahl al-Sunnah wa Ahl al-Ḥadīth</strong>. His every prayer was engrossed in intense servitude and worship that one would sense it was his last prayer.</em><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was intelligent, incisive and perceptive, which was evident from many incidences. Once he was abruptly asked by a muqallid to prove the Ṣalāh from Bukhārī and Muslim and the Shaykh obliged him.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> <strong>Shaykh ʿAbdul ʿAzīz al-Sadḥān</strong> said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>Some of the scholars informed me that the Imām of Ḥaram, Shaykh Muḥammad Subayyal would attend the lessons of Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn in the Ḥaram of Makkah. I was informed that once he was asked a question and he replied by quoting approximately Fourty (40) Ayāt and Thirty (30) Aḥadīth.</em><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>His Remarkable Memory</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the elders who spent time with Shaykh Badīʿ would say he had memorised voluminous books. They included the works of the Salaf, Imām Shawkāni and the works of Imām ibn Ḥazm. They say he knew <em>al-Muḥallā</em> of Ibn Ḥazm by heart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once the Shaykh memorised a whole Sūrah while travelling on a camel, either Sūrah al-Nūr or Sūrah al-Anfāl and the journey was approximately only 30-40 minutes.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> He memorised the whole Qurʾān in Three to Four (3-4) months when he was approximately Thirteen (13) years old.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another scholar mentions that once Shaykh Badīʿ came to their institute and delivered a lecture in which he opened all the doors of the sciences of Islam. <strong>During the lecture the Shaykh quoted from Ḥāfiẓ ibn Ḥajr’s <em>Fatḥ al-Bārī</em> numerous times and also quoted the volume and page numbers.</strong> The scholar mentions that he noted all of the references and quotes. When he returned home after a few days he checked each and every reference and he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>‘By Allāh, every single quote, the volume and page number were unequivocally accurate and I did not find a single difference in the wording of the quotes, they were verbatim.’</em><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Praised by the ʿUlamāʾ</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A teacher in a Salafī University in Pakistan was advising his students of the knowledge and status of Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn and he mentioned an incident. Once a student who wanted to study the Islamic sciences asked <strong>Shaykh ʿAbd ʿAzīz ibn Bāz</strong> which scholar has taqwa and is strong and firmly grounded in knowledge who I can go to to seek knowledge. <strong>Shaykh Ibn Bāz</strong> replied:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>Go to such and such place in Pakistan and there will be a man there called Badīʿ al-Dīn, go to him and seek knowledge from him.</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, the student travelled to Pakistan to Shaykh Badīʿ and told him why he had come to seek knowledge and how <strong>Shaykh Ibn Bāz</strong> had advised him. Upon hearing this Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn started to cry and then said to the student:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #003366;">What a strange thing you say, you leave an ocean of knowledge and come to a small river, return to <strong>Ibn Bāz</strong> and seek knowledge and spend time with him.   </span>    </span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great scholar and Muḥaddith, <strong>Shaykh ʿAtā Allāh Ḥanīf Bhuwjiyānī</strong> wrote in the introduction to one of Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn’s book:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>The learned researcher of our jamāʿah, belonging to the well known Rāshidī family.</em></span><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And his well known student and the notable scholar of Ḥadith, <strong>Shaykh Zubayr ʿAlī Zaʾī</strong> mentions:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>If someone were to me ask while I was standing between Rukn al-Yamānī and Maqām Ibrāhīm about this Shaykh (i.e Badīʿ al-Dīn) I would say; I swear by Allāh I have never seen anyone of the likes of Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn in terms of knowledge and his comprehension.</em><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Zubayr</strong> further said:</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the traits of the people of innovation is that they limit and restrict their understanding of Islam to either a single individual, a city or even a region. Ahl al-Sunnah, the Salafis and the people of Hadith are free from this confined and dangerous restriction. With us, the understanding of Islam is with the great scholars of this ummah, of the past and present, whatever land they resided in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Why are the Deobandis, Barelwis, Ikhwan al-Muslimin, The followers of al-Qadiyani, Ghulam Ahmad Pervez, al-Mawdudi, Sayyid Qutb, Hasan al-Banna, Muhammad Surur, Javed Ghamidi, Hasan Turabi and all of the early deviated sects refuted and reprimanded, while their is an open door policy with those who distort and desecrate the Manhaj of Ahl al-Sunnah while feigning Atharism or claiming they are upon the way and Manhaj of Ahl al-Sunnah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us be clear and unequivocal, no Sunni or Salafi differs with cooperation with anyone so long that it is based on the Quran and Sunnah. This is further understood and applied to those issues and difficult masa&#8217;il that affect the everyday lives of the Muslims. For example in the non-Muslim lands, cooperating on issues related to the burial, post mortem, schools, education, social welfare, the Hijab, the unjust and unfair persecution of Muslims, religious profiling, discrimination at work, prayer and Wudu facilities at civic buildings, religious laws and the list is endless. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A real life example of this in the UK for example was when the fame seeking Salman Rushdie published his shambled book, where the Muslims cooperated in repelling its evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us also remind the readers, in these matters the Salafis and Ahl al-Hadith have worked effortlessly in attempting to bring ease and harmony to the lives of Muslims living in the west, however the people of innovation have always been treacherous and disloyal. For example when the UK Government, Gove and his cohorts were and are still targeting Salafi and Ahl al-Hadith orientated Schools and teaching institutes, did we see any help or cooperation by the people of innovation? Of course not!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The elder scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith in their respective countries, displayed a great level of understanding to navigate through the gauntlet of trials and obstacles placed by the people of innovation. It was this careful and thoughtful traversing based on deep insight that allowed the Da&#8217;wah of the Quran and Sunnah to flourish with Allah&#8217;s aid and assistance alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, as you will read Shaykh Ibn Baz explains (from al-ifta), the people of the Sunnah should clarify the correct creed of the salaf, the innovations and the Islamic law. What we find with the people who advocate unity and blind cooperation with the people of innovation and deviation is that they are absolutely silent, blind and deaf on the innovations and corrupt creed of the people they want to unify and cooperate with. What deception is this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Salafi scholars were and are never like this. It is this rich history of the Ahl al-Hadith which distinguishes it from the people of innovation and deviation, unlike those who are new to the pristine and established methodology of the Ahl al-Hadith, the Mutaqdimin and the Mutakharin, such that they have ignorantly convinced themselves and those around them of a new methodology and approach which not only is non-existant, but rather it opposes and contradicts a methodology that was understood, practised and propagated for almost 1400 years!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly, these matters should be understood based on the methodology of Ahl al-Sunnah, past and present, not just India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Turkey. We ask, show us this methodology of deaf and blind unity and cooperation with the people of deviation and heresy from the early Imams and the Salaf of this Ummah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abd al-Aziz bin Baz, Rahimahullah, who was the most well wishing to the Ummah was asked,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>QUESTION</strong>: </span></span><span style="color: #000000;">Is it permissible  to cooperate with the Islamic groups active in the field? To what extent is cooperation permissible? Please advise, may Allah reward you with the best!       </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong>:</span> It is permissible and even obligatory to cooperate with all Muslims in righteousness and piety as much as possible because Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221; (Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5:2) </strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;By Al-&#8216;Asr (the time). Verily, man is in loss, Except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth, and recommend one another to patience.&#8221; (Surah Al-&#8216;Asr, 103)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is cooperating in righteousness and piety and enjoining one another to adhere to the truth and showing patience to clarify the rulings of Shari&#8217;ah (Law) and warn against Bid&#8217;ah (innovations in Islam) and to make clear the sound creed followed by the Salaf (righteous predecessors of the Ummah (nation based on one creed), the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and those who followed them in righteousness. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Cooperation and recommendation is to enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and to abandon those worthy to be abandoned because Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The believers, men and women, are Awliya&#8217; of one another; they enjoin  Al-Ma&#8217;ruf , and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar ; they perform as-Salah, and give the Zakat, and obey Allaah and His Messenger. Allah will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.&#8221; (Surah At-Tawbah, 9:71) </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dawud (David) and &#8216;Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). That was because they disobeyed (Allaah and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds. They used not to forbid one another from Al-Munkar (wrong, evil-doing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which they committed. Vile indeed was what they used to do.&#8221; (Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 78) </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The similitude of believers in regard to mutual love, affection, fellow-feeling is that of one body; when any limb of it aches, the whole body aches, because of sleeplessness and fever. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) also said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Islam is based on advising one another. Upon this we said: For whom? He replied: For Allah, His Book, His Messenger and for the leaders and the general Muslims. (Related by Muslim in his book of Sahih (authentic) Hadith). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are many Ayahs and Hadiths to the same effect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Imam Ibn Baz, al-Fatawa, 28:248.</em></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Shaikhs Credentials</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Matriculation, Fazil Dars Nizami, Moolwi Fazil, Munshi Fazil, Adib Fazil-Punjab University, Awti, Amir Ja’miyyah Ahl al-Hadith Britannia 1975-1991</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is al-Alim, the propagator, Shaikh Mawlāna Faḍal Karīm ʿAsim. The Shaikh was born on the 24<sup>th</sup> of Rajab 1339H corresponding to the 4<sup>th</sup> April 1908 in Panyām, in the district of Mirpūr in Azād Kashmīr. His fathers name was Shaikh Muḥammad Sharif, who was a pious man. He began seeking knowledge at the tender age of 7 and throughout his early years he attended various madāris and institutes in the local areas in pursuit of knowledge and the sacred sciences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The quest to seek knowledge of the sacred Islamic sciences continued until approximately 1940. The Shaikhs pursuit of knowledge spanned approximately 20 or so years with an approximate break of 7-8 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Early Education</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the age of 7 his mother enrolled him in a madrassah in the village of Sahunah, the Shaikh however did not favour the atmosphere and thus after a short period returned home. The Shaikh continued his education at school and due to his general love of seeking knowledge, his affiliation for it grew stronger and thus his fervor for the sacred Islamic sciences also grew.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Shaikh turned 15 he developed a strong inclination to acquire the Islamic Sciences and thus enrolled at a madrasah in a village which was approximately 10 miles from Jhelum. He studied with Shaikh Amat al-Rasūl who was the teacher at the time, he read the Qurʾan to him as well as some of the basic books on the sciences of the Dīn. The Shaikh at the same time was also attending school and studying for his matriculation. Thereafter the Shaikh travelled to Gujrāt and enrolled in a barelwī madrassah in he area of Begumpura, where he studied for a year and studied their course.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Faẓal Karīm ʿĀṣim completed his matriculation, which is the equivalent of modern day GCSE’s i.e. education from the age of 14-16, at Manawār High School in Chakswārī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">His Travels to Amritsar in Pursuit of Knowledg</span>e</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh travelled to Amritsar in approximately around 1928 when he was in his 20’s and enrolled in Madrassah Dār al-ʿUlūm al-Quds and completed his Dars Niẓamī during a 7-8-year period. During these years in his free time he would attend the famous and leading institute of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth at the time which was Madrassah Ghaznawiyyah Salafīyyah, where he studied and learnt some classical texts and manuals. He studied with numerous scholars in both institutes and benefitted from them. The Shaikh eventually completed his Dars Nizamī and became a Mawlāna.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Teachers</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the Scholars Shaikh Faḍal Karīm ʿĀṣim studied with includes the likes of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Dawūd Ghaznawī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Ḥadīth Naik Muḥammad</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAbd al-Kabīr (Karim) Kāshmirī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muftī Muḥammad Ḥasan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Manāzirīn Thanāullāh Amritsarī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Allāmah ʿAbdallāh Rawparī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muḥammad Khān</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of these scholars were direct students of al-Imām Nazir Ḥussain Muḥaddith Dehlawī as well major scholars in their own right. Who is unaware of the great Shaikh Thanāullāh Amritsārī and his efforts for the Salafī Dawah and the likes of Shaikh ʿAbdullāh Rawparī, who were firm in calling to the teachings of the Qurʾan and Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter Shaikh Faḍal Karīm joined Punjab University and achieved the qualifications of Moulwī Fāẓil, Munshī Fāẓil, Adīb Fāẓil and Awtī from Punjab University. Where he studied Arabic, Farsi and Urdu.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In approximately 1936 the Shaikh returned to his native land of Chakswārī, Azād Kashmir and continued to teach in Manāwar High school and Dadyāl High School for approximately twenty-three-23 years. He then went on to teach at Intermediate College Mirpūr for another 3-three years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Time in England</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh migrated to England in 1962 and began working in a factory despite his Islamic credentials and acquired the status of a British national in 1967. He continued teaching students in various places. When the Shaikh first moved to the United Kingdom he came to Birmingham where he remained for the rest of his remaining life until he passed away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As soon as the Shaikh moved to England he became involved in Daʿwah straight away, he found 2 people who had set up a small masjid and a madrassah in a house. This masjid and madrassah was run by an old person, Mawlāna Muḥammad Aẓīm and Ḥāfiẓ Muḥammad Ilyās. They had formed an organization called Jamiʿyyah al-Muslimīn, Shaikh Faḍal Karīm ʿĀṣim began working with them, he would deliver the Friday sermons and also teach children. He would work his shifts in the factory and would spend the rest of the time in giving Daʿwah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the Khaṭīb of the UK Islamic Mission Masjid in Sparkbrook where he also taught children in 1963, when they first established a masjid in Birmingham. The UK Islamic Mission were affiliated with the Jamāt Islamī movement. During his time at the masjid he also taught the children the Quran and other Islamic sciences. The Shaikh eventually left them due to methodology as well as their methods, which he himself has stated in his writings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the time England was peaceful without any sectarianism and factionalism and the Shaikh was able to continue in his goal and mission. Numerous groups and parties had been established in the UK as well as many scholars of the various methodologies had also migrated to the UK. Slowly by slowly the atmosphere changed from giving daʿwah, reform and cultivation to factionalism. When the ugly head of blind imitation and partisanship raised its head the Shaikh was forced to continue this glorious call independently.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During this period and after leaving UK Islamic Mission Shaikh Faẓal Karīm ʿĀṣim established Muslim Oriental School to cater for the needs of the every growing Muslim community who migrated to the UK. The School was based on mount street in small Heath. With the growing number of Muslims coming to the UK from the Subcontinent, Shaikh Faẓal Karīm began teaching the Qurʿan, Urdu as well English to the new students.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was well aware of the needs of the growing Muslim community as well as the daily issues and problems they would face. The Shaikh was also very diligent and concerned for the educational welfare of the new migrants. The Shaikh, due to his efforts and hard work with the Muslim Oriental School, became known in the community due to his constant struggle and endeavour to help the Muslims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Due to the educational needs of the community and the work Shaikh Faẓal Karīm ʿĀṣim had done within the community specifically in the educational sector, the community formed an educational committee and elected Shaikh Faẓal Karīm ʿĀṣim as the General Secretary.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Ahl al-Hadith</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The work of daʿwah continued and from around 1973 Shaikh Faẓal Karīm ʿĀṣim began thinking about setting up Jamʿiyyah Ahl al-Ḥadīth based on the methodological changes that were taking place. Then around about 1974 The Shaikh began meeting other people who were upon the way of Ahl al-Ḥadīth, he would meet them on a regular basis and discuss ideas and ways to move the Daʿwah forward. These meetings and discussions culminated and was was the impetus for Shaikh Faẓal Karīm ʿĀṣim to set up his own Madrassah which eventually led him and others to set up the Jamʿiyyah Ahl al-Ḥadīth Britannia in the June of 1975 and the first Salafī Madrassah in Alum Rock on George Arthur Road, right next to a Baptist church.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The daʿwah continued and eventually another huge building was acquired in 1977 and Madrassah Salafīyyah 20 Green Lane was officially opened with 4 teachers. The Shaikh continued with his daʿwah efforts and delivered his regular lectures and lessons wherever they were needed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From here on in, numerous other branches were set up around the United Kingdom and in this way the call of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth spread everywhere and fruits of this can be seen today. The Shaikh also began to publish a monthly magazine called Ṣirāt al-Mustaqīm, which is now world famous and is distrusted globally even until today after almost 40 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Faẓal Karīm ʿĀṣim himself said although we set up the Jamʿiyyah Ahl al-Ḥadīth in the UK, the biggest obstacle was being alone. He would visit family members and some other people who sympathized with the Ahl al-Ḥadīth from my native land but they also did not show any interest. In the beginning two people, who despite not having much Islamic knowledge were very enthusiastic about spreading the Da’wah, they were Muhammad Gulzār Nadwī and Muḥammad Siddīq</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Daʿwah Programs, Seminars and Travels Around the World</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Faḍal Karīm ʿĀṣim would often be invited around the world for daʿwah programs, seminars and conferences. He travelled to countries like Holland, Turkey, Irān, Kashmīr, Germany, Denmark, France, Pākistān, Egypt, Greece, Afghanistan, India, Bulgaria, Nepāl, Bangladesh, Palestine, Baltistān, Saudī ʿArabia, UAE, Indonesia, America as well as other countries for daʿwah purposes and for liaison.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Affects of the Daʿwah</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is very obvious with all these efforts the message of Tawḥīd and Sunnah spread throughout the whole of the Britain. Shaikh Faḍal Karīm ʿĀṣim was also instrumental in setting up a Muslim Youth Movement, a department for Daʿwah and Iṣlah, an education department and an Islamic Library. The numerous institutes and madrassahs in the United Kingdom and their teachings are all as a result of Imām Nazir Ḥussain Muḥaddith Dehlawī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the beginning Shaikh Faḍal Karīm Āʿṣim and Mawlana ʿAbdul Karīm Thāqib had already set up Markazī Jamāʿah Ahl al-Ḥadīth and had a few branches elsewhere under which the organisation was fulfilling its duty of daʿwah. There was however no formal structure or any specific organisation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Faḍal Karīm Āʿṣim with the aide of some associates started to use a house in Alum Rock, Birmingham for their activities and also established a madrassah in 1975. It so happened that in the same year in the summer of 1975 a Saudi delegation on the order of Dār al-Daʿwah waʾl-Irshād waʾl Iftā, whose president was Shaikh ʿAbdul ʿAziz ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Bāz, was sent to the United Kingdom for research and daʿwah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The head of this delegation was the great Shaikh Muḥammad ʿAbdul Wahhāb al-Banna and he was accompanied by the well known Albanian Ḥadīth Master, Shaikh Muḥammad Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī. They were also accompanied by translators who were students of knowledge in their own right and studying in Madīnah University at the time. They were asked to accompany the delegation because of the large exodus of the Asian community from the subcontinent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The delegation was accompanied by Shaikh Maḥmūd Aḥmad Mirpūrī, Shaikh Major Muḥammad Aslam and Sharīf Aḥmad Ḥāfiẓ. Shaikh Faẓal Karīm Āʿṣim tirelessly helped them whilst they engaged in daʿwah and propagated the call of Tawḥīd. The delegation was highly impressed and pleased with Shaikh Faẓal Karīm ʿĀṣim’s efforts and diligence and acknowledged the speed and rate of his work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They also noticed the need for further callers to help Shaikh Faẓal Karīm ʿĀṣim and he also expressed the need for young active yet knowledgeable callers to come to the United Kingdom and assist with daʿwah to the rapidly growing Muslim community in their thousands. The delegation advised him to go and meet Shaikh ʿAbdul ʿAzīz ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Bāz and request further assistance as he was the Head of Dār al-Iftā.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During December of the same year ie 1975 Shaikh Faḍal Karīm ʿĀṣim went for Ḥajj and also met Shaikh Ibn Bāz and he mentioned his request for help. He explained the need for daʿwah and the growing Muslim population and how western society was influencing them and how the Muslims were contravening a dejected path.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ibn Bāz asked Shaikh Faḍal Karīm ʿĀṣim how he could help him. Shaikh Faḍal Karīm ʿĀṣim said the three students that came with the Islamic University delegation during the summer could they be sent to the United Kingdom to him. Shaikh Ibn Bāz was very pleased with the request and sent Shaikh Maḥmūd Aḥmad Mirpūrī and Sharīf Aḥmad Ḥāfiẓ to United Kingdom for Daʿwah and teaching at the behest of al-Daʿwah waʾl Irshād waʾl Iftā during the latter part of 1976 when they both had completed their studies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In around 1976 a huge building which used to be a public library and leisure centre in Small Heath was being sold by Birmingham City Council. The building was huge with ample space for all activities and also a place of worship. The building was on an offer <strong>£</strong>24,000. The solicitor advised Shaikh ʿĀṣim to accept the offer and buy the building. However, the shortage of money was the greatest hurdle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While efforts were being made to secure the purchase of this building, a Kuwaiti businessman was visiting Birmingham. His name was ʿAbdul ʿAzīz al-Mutawwaʾ. He found out about the activities of the Jamʿiyyah and the financial problems it was facing. Shaikh al-Mutawwaʾ donated from his own pocket a huge amount of <strong>£</strong>20,000. With the help of further local donations the building was purchased and a centre for the Jamiʿyyah established.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Shaikh as a Writer</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Faẓal Karīm ʿĀṣim compiled a book on issues like Tawhīd, Shirk, Riba, explanation of the Quranic Ayat prohibiting Alcohol. The book also had explanatory notes on Ashraf al-Hawashī. He had given the book to the great Ahl al-Hadith and Salafī Alim Shaikh ʿAzīz Zubaidī via Shaikh Bashīr Anṣārī, however it was never published.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh also wrote regular articles in explanation of the Quran in his monthly magazine, Ṣirāt al-Mustaqīm, which is still being published today. The Shaikh also wrote on a number of other issues and topics that were relevant to the new generation of Muslims growing up in the UK.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh also compiled a book on the history of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth in Europe titled <em>Tehrik Ahl-Ḥadīth Europe Mein</em>. The book is 464 pages and was published in 1997. The Shaikh would also keep a daily journal and or a journal of his travels. This eventually materialized in to a book called <em>Muṭālʿatī Safar</em> which was published in 2000 and is 662 pages.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was praised for his efforts by the likes of the great ʿAllāmah Ehsān Ilāhī Ẓahīr, Shaikh Subayyal, Shaikh Muḥammad Ḥussain Sheikhpūrī and numerous other major scholars</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh left behind praiseworthy offspring so much so that the Shaikhs grandchildren are active in Daʿwah as well as seeking knowledge of the fundamentals of this Din. One grandchild is studying in al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University whilst another has an Islamic translation and publishing company, Dar al-Arqam, who has produced some very beneficial books, Alḥamdulillāh.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh Rahimahullah died in 1424H corresponding to May 2003 and left behind an incredible legacy of the Salafī daʿwah in the west. May Allāh accept his efforts, struggles and daʿwah, forgive his sins and grant him a place in Jannatul Firdaws al-Aʿla. <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
