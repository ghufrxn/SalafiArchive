				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some brother, Muhmmad Moin has compiled a response to an article of Shaikh Zubair Ali Zai’ Rahimahullah on the narrator Mu’mall bin Isma’il. The article is titled ‘<strong>Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel: A look at the research of Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai regarding him,’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without going into the polemics of this ‘looking’ nor trying to address each and every point, I thought it would be somewhat beneficial to shed some light into this looking and the research presented. I do not have much time as I would have liked to address each and every point however this being said, in Sha Allah each and every point has been already addressed in other research, which will, by the permission of Allah be presented in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The brother begins by saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">“Some brother Raza Hassan has translated an urdu article by Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai proving Tawtheeq of Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel. I had read it in the book ‘Ilmi Maqalaat (1/417) by the author. After comparing the translation and the article present in Ilmi Maqalaat, it is clear to me that the brother has quoted it from the urdu Islamic magazine Al-Hadeeth vol.21. This same article was later published in ‘Ilmi Maqalaat (collection of Shaykh Zai’s articles) where he retracted a lot of things he claimed previously (this will be notified during the course of this writing). The title of the article is “Ithbat at-Ta’deel fi tautheeq Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Some people may think why Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel is so much discussed among hardcore muqallids and hardcore ghair-muqallid. There are two reasons for it, Muqallids call him Munkar ul-Hadith because (1) he is the narrator of the tradition which mentions that the Musalli should place his hands over his chest, (2) and he is the narrator of some criticisms of Sufyan Thauri against Abu Hanifa. These are the same two reasons why some harsh Ahle Hadith scholars made Tautheeq of Mu’ammal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai has special methodology of analyzing conflicting statements of Jarh and Ta’deel. He counts the number of criticism and praise, and rejects the minority based on majority. This seems good, but this was not the methodology of scholars of hadith, not even single of them. Rather they would prefer explained Jarh over general Tautheeq, and reject unexplained Jarh against established Ta’deel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">There are several problems with his methodology, and we shall see them during the course of this refutation, Insha Allah. After this brief introduction, let us proceed with the article by Shaykh Zai.-</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Let us examine some of these points. The reader should be aware that author or writer will always amend and change his works due to new information or understanding, this is well known amongst those who write, especially those who write and research issues pertaining to rijal and Jarh wa’t Ta’dil etc.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When this is the case Shaikh Zubair published the said article in his monthly journal, al-Hadith in February 2006 (issue no.21) and we also know the Tahqiqi Ilmi Maqalat volume 1 was printed in 2010, where the treatise is in (1:417-438), giving the Shaikh a total of 4 years to make any necessary changes, retractions and or clarifications if needed and this is not something which is defective, but rather something praiseworthy and highly encouraged as the truth is always beloved to us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair Ali also dates the article in the Ilmi Maqalat (1:438) as 14<sup>th</sup> Sha’ban 1427H which corresponds to September 2006, which therefore shows amendment after approximately 8 months and it appears this is the amended version that was included in the Ilmi Maqalat. Point being there were amendments in a period of 8 months where as 4 years is a very long time and highly likely and very plausible that contents of any article or book can change.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, in our rebuttal of Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmad’s critique of Shaikh al-Albani’s research on the hadith related to placing hands of the chest in his Sifah Salah, we compiled a response titled, <em>‘Answering the Lies on Imam al-Albani -The Issue of placing the hands on the Chest – al-Jawab ar-Rabbani Raf al-Kadhibah Anil Imam al-Albani’ </em>which can be accessed here</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.salafiri.com/answering-the-lies-on-imam-al-albani-the-issue-of-placing-the-hands-on-the-chest-al-jawab-ar-rabbani-raf-al-kadhibah-anil-imam-al-albani/">http://www.salafiri.com/answering-the-lies-on-imam-al-albani-the-issue-of-placing-the-hands-on-the-chest-al-jawab-ar-rabbani-raf-al-kadhibah-anil-imam-al-albani/</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In it, on p.19 we cite this research of Shaikh Zubair as,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“</em><em>Based upon and abridged from the treatise, ‘Ithbaat ut-Ta’deel Fee Tahqeeq Mu’ammal ibn Ismaa’eel’ (manuscript form) of Shaikh Zubair Alee Za’ee.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our rebuttal was published in January 2004, ie 2 years before it appeared in the al-Hadith monthly journal, Shaikh Zubair Rahimahullah provided this paper prior to 2006, which was in manuscript form. It was years later when it was finally published in the magazine and much later in the Ilmi Maqalat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point here is to illustrate the period when this treatise of Shaikh Zubair was first written to the time it was last published with any amendments. We have shown this period at the very least exceeds 6-7 years and also that it is very common and that any individual can appreciate the possibility and need for correction due to a plethora of reasons.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, the authors words,</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">“This same article was later published in ‘Ilmi Maqalaat (collection of Shaykh Zai’s articles) where he retracted a lot of things he claimed previously (this will be notified during the course of this writing)”</span> <span style="color: #000000;">have no relevance and should not be given any importance except but to understand the norm of changes over a period of time particularly when it is concerning such intricate sciences of hadith and mustalah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> We know as Muslims arrogance and pride are destructive traits which have been severely censured in the Prophetic Ahadith. Shaykh Zubair through his works has shown his retractions and clarifications on possible mistakes or errors he may have made and this is the true sign of scholarship, integrity and trustworthiness. This is not an ayb ie something bad or defective but rather something which should be respected, appreciated and praised.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author, Muhammad Moin, should have noticed on the very last page of the al-Hadith monthly journal (Issue no.21, p.25) and no doubt he would have observed this due to his admittance of referring back to the journal, that Shaykh Zubair has a subheading titled, <em>“Announcing a Retraction”</em> where the Shaykh mentions one of his books was composed for publication and after revising the book he graded a narration to be weak after having graded it Hasan in an earlier issue of the al-Hadith journal (Issue no.4 p.40). Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Therefore, I retract from my previous research and grading and May Allah forgive (me)”</em> (13-12-2005) (al-Hadith; Issue no.21, p.25).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This therefore, shows the Shaykhs methodology in referring and retracting back to the truth and this is the Asal of the Sunni, Salafi and Ahl al-Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author goes onto say,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">“Some people may think why Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel is so much discussed among hardcore muqallids and hardcore ghair-muqallid. There are two reasons for it, Muqallids call him Munkar ul-Hadith because (1) he is the narrator of the tradition which mentions that the Musalli should place his hands over his chest, (2) and he is the narrator of some criticisms of Sufyan Thauri against Abu Hanifa. These are the same two reasons why some harsh Ahle Hadith scholars made Tautheeq of Mu’ammal.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The terminology used is crass. obtuse and well lets just say following bandwagon trends, with the least of the issue being deplorable, grossly incorrect and outrageously divergent from the truth. It is enough to satisfy any reader that Mu’mmal bin Isma’il is a narrator of other ahadith in the various books of the Sunnah. In fact, Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i cites every hadith Mu’mmal narrates which shows the reality is totally different from the two reasons inappropriately cited above.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mu’ammal is a narrator of hadith and reports just as equal as other narrators and the Ahl al-Hadith Scholars most certainly do not have tahazzub or ta’assub for particular issues as the author asserts. The truth of the matter is that the very same scholars have defiantly repelled the staunch and bigoted blind imitation ie taqlid prevalent in common society and popular culture. There are a catalogue of incorrect notions and assertions juxtaposed in the authors words, one example being. “some harsh Ahle Hadith scholars…”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Zubayr also mentions the other books of hadith and their respective authors who used Mu’ammal ibn Isma’il as a narrator, like Bukhari no.2700, 7083, Tirmidhi no. 415, 672, 1822, 1948, 2145, 3266, 3525, 3906, 3949, Nasai in al-Sughra no.4097, 4589 and Ibn Majah no.2013, 2919, 3017. Bukhari using Mu’ammal holds great value and importance which is perhaps beyond the scope of this reply but in sha Allah it can be expounded upon later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author continues and says,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">“Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai has special methodology of analyzing conflicting statements of Jarh and Ta’deel. He counts the number of criticism and praise, and rejects the minority based on majority. This seems good, but this was not the methodology of scholars of hadith, not even single of them. Rather they would prefer explained Jarh over general Tautheeq, and reject unexplained Jarh against established Ta’deel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">There are several problems with his methodology, and we shall see them during the course of this refutation, Insha Allah. After this brief introduction, let us proceed with the article by Shaykh Zai.-“</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known to the beginner student of knowledge that an author is likely at times to use general or mujmal phrases with the mindset the reader is perhaps familiar with the sciences of hadith since he is reading such issues which revolve around these detailed sciences. It is also known to such elementary students that an author will also sometimes explain his general statements with a more detailed and comprehensive explanation whereas sometimes he will leave his statement general. So for a third party to clutch onto the general statements of an author and ignore his multitude of detailed statements, is in serious need of improvement to present such research.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It will also be very lengthy to present all of the detailed statements of Shaykh Zubair in this regard who emphatically holds on to and utilizes the methodology of the Scholars of Hadith in investigating, verifying and grading ahadith and he most certainly did not employ a new or special methodology as the author asserts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i says answering a question,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Authentic and weak narrations are of two types. The first type; narrations which are unanimously agreed upon in being authentic or weak.  Hafiz Abu Hatim al-Razi (d.277H) said, “And the agreement of the Ahl al-Hadith on something constitutes evidence.” (Kitab al-marasil p.192 no.703, under the entry of Muhammad bin Muslim al-Zuhri)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah al-Harrani (d.728H) said, “So when the people of jurisprudence unanimously agree on a statement then is not except but considered the truth and if the Ahl al-Hadith unanimously agree in the authentication of hadith then it is not considered except but the truth.” (Majmu’a Fatawa 1:9-10).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So we find accepting a hadith unanimously agreed upon is not an issue of ijtihad but rather the ijma is to be followed. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The Second type: The ahadith which are differed over, whether they are authentic or weak, then in such affairs giving precedence to the view of the majority is an issue of ijtihad. One must remember is incumbent to act upon whatever principle is adopted otherwise contradiction in statement and action is hypocritical. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Note Well (1): Taj al-Din Abdul Wahhab bin Ali al-Subki (d.771H) wrote, “So if the number of disparagers/criticisers are greater in number, the criticism is given precedence.” (Qa’idah fi jarh wa’t ta’dil p.50)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>so we find the narrator who is considered to be disparaged by the majority of the scholars of hadith is also considered to be disparaged according to the later scholars. The authentication and weakening of hadith is an issue of ijtihad. However, this does not mean hanafi’s grade hadith they require to be authentic and render other hadith to be weak. Therefore, it is preferable to give precedence to the position and view of the majority of the scholar of hadith (al-Hadith Issue no.10, Muharram 1426H/March 2005, p.18-19, Fatawa ilmiyyah al-ma’ruf tawdih al-ahkam 2:293-295)</em> End of Shaykh Zubair’s words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My edition of the <em>‘Qa’idah fi jarh wa’t ta’dil’ </em>contains the addition of ‘the ones who praise’ <em>“So if the number of criticisers is greater in number than those who praise, then the criticism is given precedence.” </em>(Taj al-Din al-Subki,<em> Qa’idah fi jarh wa’t ta’dil, ed. Abdul-Fattah Abu Guddah, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. </em>(Beirut: Dar al-Quran al-Karim, 1400H/1980c) 50)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is very beneficial and filled with principles pertaining to the science of Jarh wa’t ta’dil and thus the avid reader is recommended to refer to it. So we find some of the scholars from the mutaqadimin generally used the idea of majority for either praise or agreement and even criticism and Shaykh Zubair was not the only one and there are many example of this in the books on the science of hadith and narrators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the earlier scholars like Imam Yahya ibn Ma’in (d.233H) used majority and minority to determine the Dhabt ie precision of narrators and the mistakes of Hammad ibn Salamah, who was a great Imam of Ahl al-Sunnah. Imam Ibn Ma’in rejected the minority of the students of Hammad ibn Salamah over the majority who narrated from him, which was based approximately on 18 narrators. (Ibn Hibban, <em>Kitab al-majruhin minal muhadithin</em>, ed. Hamdi Abdul Majid al-Salafi. (Riyadh: Dar al-Sami’i, 1420H/2000) 1:34-35)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The brother went onto say,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">This seems good, but this was not the methodology of scholars of hadith, not even single of them. Rather they would prefer explained Jarh over general Tautheeq, and reject unexplained Jarh against established Ta’deel.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again this is poor understanding of Shaykh Zubair’s methodology and highly incorrect to present it in this way. Everyone is agreed on the principle of detailed criticism takes precedence over general praise and no one differs with this especially Shaykh Zubair as we will show. Shaikh Zubair’s presented this approach only when there were statements of praise and criticism and neither were detailed or specific and it was thus difficult to ascertain the reliability of the narrator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example, Hafiz Ibn Abdul Barr had a unique methodology in that anyone who is well known to possess knowledge of such affairs (ie hadith) was considered to be upright unless criticised. (al-Tamhid, (Morocco: 1378H) 1:28), Cf. Ibn Kathir, <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em> explanation of Dr Abdul Aziz al-Saghir Dukhan as <em>al-Sai’ al-hathith</em>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (San’a: Maktabah al-jil al-jadid:1421H/2001) 304, Ibn Kathir, <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith, </em>explanation Shaikh Ahmad Muhammad Shakir, <em>al-Ba’ith al-hathith</em> (Alexandria: Maktaba Dar al-Aqidah 1428H/2007) 77)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Although this has no relevance to majority of minority point, it does however show the uniqueness of every scholar. Naturally Hafiz ibn Salah answered Hafiz ibn Abdul Barr and said this approach was rudimentary and substandard. (Ibn al-Salah, <em>Muqaddimah</em>, ed. A’ishah Abdur Rahman (Cairo, 1990) 288), Cf. E’la al-Din Maglatai, <em>Islah kitab ibn salah</em>, (Cairo Maktaba Islamiyyah, 1428H/2007) no.90, 149)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Moreover, Imam Khatib al-Baghdadi was of the view only one critic is required to disparage a narrator. (Khatib al-Baghdadi, <em>al-Kifayah fi ilm al-riwayah </em>(Cairo, 1988) 84).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again the intent here it so the unique and exclusive views of some of the scholars of hadith of the past ie the mutaqaddimin and therefore singling out Shaykh Zubair for having lone methods needs to be looked at, despite this not being the case as we shall mention. Hafiz Ibn Kathir presents his arguments and puts forth the view that statements of criticisms from these Imams who are experts in this field should be accepted without the reasons for the criticism. He also clarifies if criticism and praise conflict each other, then the criticism has to be detailed. (Ibn Kathir, <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em> with <em>al-Sai’i al-hathith</em>, 304-305, <em>al-Ba’ith al-hathith, 78</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is incorrect and the scholars of hadith were not of this view, in fact this view is very unique and exclusive to the one who said it. So the authors statement,</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">“but this was not the methodology of scholars of hadith, not even single of them. Rather they would prefer explained Jarh over general Tautheeq, and reject unexplained Jarh against established Ta’deel.”</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Should also be applied to Hafiz Ibn Abdul Barr, Imam Ibn Kathir and others and we are sure such examples clearly illustrate our point.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hafiz Ibn Ahmad al-Hakami (d.1377H) mentions if there is conflict between criticism and praise, the former is given precedence and this is the preferred view according to the majority of the scholars of research and there is no difference in this whether those who praise and validate number many or a little. Some have argued if the number of scholars praising and validating are greater in number then their praise is to be taken. However, this is incorrect as the one invalidating or criticizing is aware of the hidden defect in the narrator. It should be clear, this applies and refers to detailed criticism. (Hafiz al-Hakami, <em>Dalil arbab al-falah li-tahqiq fan al-istilah</em>, ed. Khalid bin Qasim al-Raddadi (Madinah: Maktabah al-Ghuraba al-Athariyyah, 1414H/1993) 204-205)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti, Shaikh Ahmad Muhammad Shakir and Shaikh Adam Eithiopi have also mentioned something similar, even if the ones praising are greater in number. He also cites Imam Khatib al-Baghdadi who mentioned this to be the view of the majority of the scholars. Again, this refers to detailed criticism not if the jarh is mubham. (<em>Asa’afu dhul al-watir bi-sharh nazam al-durrar fil ilm al-athar – Sharh al-fiyyah al-suyuti fi ilm al-hadith</em> (Cairo: Dar ul-Athar lil Nashr wal-Tawdih, 1429H/2008) 1:338-339)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Adam Ethiopi also said when there is conflict between jarh wa’t ta’dil the criticism takes precedence when it is detailed and praise takes precedence over vague criticism and then he goes into detail regarding the types of critics. (Adam Ethiopi, <em>Aydah al-sabil fi sharh ittihaf al-nabil bi-muhammat ilm al-jarh wa’t ta’dil </em>(Riyadh: Dar ibn al-Jawzi, 1429H) 49+)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Zubair adds a note to the aforementioned statement of Imam Ibn Kathir and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In criticism and praise, the detailed and specific positions are given given precedence over the vague and general positions…”</em> (Zubair Ali Za’i, urdu trans. <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em>, with verification and notes, fn.1, 60)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He went onto say, clarifying his position which is in line and in accordance with the methodology of the scholars of hadith, he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Benefit (1): &#8211; when both criticism and praise are ambiguous or they are both detailed and reconciliation is not possible then the view of the majority of the Muhaddithin is given precedence.”</em> (Zubair Ali Za’i, urdu trans. <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em>, fn.1, 60)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Kathir goes onto ask a rhetorical question, is this (detailed criticism) given precedence?  Or alternatively is the majority view given precedence (over the minority view) or those who are specialists and experts in this field? He answers it himself and says that there is a well known difference of opinion in Usul al-fiqh, issues of fiqh and in the science of hadith and Allah knows best. Then he says, <em>“The statement of a single person whether criticism or praise is sufficient.” </em>(Ibn Kathir, <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em> with <em>al-Sai’i al-hathith</em>, 305).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Zubair also added a note here and said in response to the rhetorical question posed by Hafiz Ibn Kathir that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The correct view is that if the criticism is detailed it will always be given precedence.” </em>(Zubair Ali Za’i, urdu trans. <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em>, 61)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh then adds a note further explaining what he means by detailed criticism and when the view of the majority of the scholars of hadith and experts is given precedence. (Zubair Ali Za’i, urdu trans. <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em>, fn.1, 61)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Dhiya al-Rehman al-A’zami discusses this issue whilst citing the chapter heading, <strong>“If a person has criticism and praise, which one is given precedence.” </strong>He then goes onto cite three main views. (1) criticism takes precedence over praise, (2) Praise takes precedence over criticism and (3) To give precedence to the position that achieves greater clarity. Then he goes onto cite the statements of the early pious ancestors explaining and evidencing each view.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then brings another chapter titled, <strong>“Not every criticism takes precedence over praise.” </strong>And then the Shaykh evidences this. Such discussions and points add further information and clarity on these issues, especially for the avid reader and student of the discipline. (Muhammad Dhiya al-Rehman al-A’zami, <em>Darasat fi jarh wa’t ta’dil </em>(Varansi: Jamia Salafiyyah, 1403H/1983) 203-207).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The preceding discussion absolves any alleged allegations and or incorrect notions of understanding any reader may have had regarding the precedence of criticism over praise and that Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i did not have a new methodology in scrutinizing ahadith. Furthermore, that he was upon the methodology of the Ahl al-Hadith in verifying and authenticating hadith</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AN ABANDONED <em>SUNNAH</em> THAT MUST BE REVIVED</span><sup>1</sup></strong></h4>
<p>There are many authentic <em>ahaadeeth</em> from the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em> concerned with the command to straighten the rows (for congregational prayer), so this is rarely hidden from any of the students of (Islamic) knowledge let alone their teachers. However it remains unknown to many that straightening the rows requires straightening it with the feet, not just the shoulders. Indeed we have often heard some of the Imams of the <em>Masaajid</em> (Mosques) pointing out &#8211; when ordering the people to straighten the rows &#8211; that the <em>Sunnah</em> is to do so with the shoulders to the exclusion of the feet! Since this is contrary to what is established in the authentic <em>Sunnah</em>, I thought it necessary to mention some <em>ahaadeeth</em> that exist on this topic, as a reminder for whoever wishes to act in accordance with the authentic <em>Sunnah</em>, not being deceived by the widespread customs and habits present in the <em>&#8216;Ummah</em>.</p>
<p>There are two authentic <em>ahaadeeth</em> on this topic: The first is the <em>hadith</em> reported by &#8216;Anas, and the second is that reported by an-Nu&#8217;maan ibn Bashir, <em>may Allah be pleased with them both</em>.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Hadeeth of ‘Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him)</u></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As for the <em>hadith</em> of &#8216;Anas, then it as follows; The <em>hadith</em> of &#8216;Anas ibn Malik. [The Prophet <em>ﷺ</em> said:]
<p><em>&#8220;Straighten your rows and come close together, for indeed I see you behind my back&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>The hadith is reported by al-Bukhaari (2/176 &#8211; <em>al-Fath</em>, <em>Boolaaq</em> edition), Ahmad (3/182 and 263), and al-Mukhallis in <em>al-Fawaa&#8217;id</em> [1/10/2], all of them reporting via a number of transmission paths (<em>turuq</em> sing. <em>tareeq</em>) from Humayd at-Taweel who said &#8216;Anas ibn Maalik narrated to us saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;The call for commencing of <em>salaah</em> was made, the Messenger of Allah <em>ﷺ</em> turned to us and said&#8230;&#8221; (then he mentions the above <em>hadith</em>).</p>
<p>Al-Bukhaari adds in one narration of this <em>hadith</em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;(He turned to us and said) before pronouncing the opening <em>takbir</em>&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Also adding at the end</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;&#8230; each of us would adjoin his shoulder with that of his companion (standing next to him) and his foot with that of his companion.&#8221;</p>
<p>This addition also occurs in the report of al-Mukhallis and Ibn Abi Shaybah [1/351] with the following wording: &#8216;Anas said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;&#8230; so I saw each of us adjoining our shoulder with those of our companions and also (adjoining) our feet with those of our companions, but if you were to practice this today, a person would flee (from you) like a restless mule.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its chain of narration (<em>sanad</em>) is also <em>sahih</em> according to the conditions stipulated by the Two Shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim).</p>
<p><em>Al-Haafidh</em> (Ibn Hajr) ascribed this wording to Sa&#8217;eed ibn Mansoor and al-Isma&#8217;eelee. Al-Bukhari gave a chapter heading for this <em>hadith</em> by saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Chapter: Adjoining the shoulder with the shoulder and the foot with the foot in the row (for prayer).&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><u>The Hadeeth of an-Nu’maan ibn Basheer (may Allah be pleased with him)</u></strong></p>
<p>As for the <em>hadith</em> of an-Nu&#8217;maan (ibn Basheer) then it is as follows:</p>
<p>The <em>hadith</em> of an-Nu&#8217;man ibn Basheer. [The Prophet <em>ﷺ</em> said:]
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Straighten your rows (he said it three times), by Allah either you straighten your rows or Allah will cause conflict between your hearts.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The <em>hadith</em> has been selected by Abu Dawood [no. 662], Ibn Hibban [no. 396], Ahmad [4/276] and ad-Doolaabi in <em>al-Kunaa</em> [2/86] from Abul-Qasim al-Jadalee Husayn ibnil Haarith who said; I heard an-Nu&#8217;man ibn Basheer say:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allah<em> ﷺ</em> turned to us and said &#8230;&#8221; (then he mentioned the above <em>hadith</em>).</p>
<p>Then an-Nu&#8217;man ibn Basheer added:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;&#8230; so I saw each man joining his shoulder; knee and ankle with that of his companion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <em>sanad</em> of this <em>hadith</em> is <em>sahih</em>, al-Bukhaari quoted it in discontinuous (<em>mu&#8217;allaq</em>) form in a decided manner (indicating that he considered it authentic). Ibn Khuzaymah also connected its chain of narration in his <em>sahih</em> [1/82,83] and al-Mundhiree [<em>at-Targheeb</em> 1/176] and al-Haafidh [<em>al-Fath</em> 2/176] both confirmed this. Ibn Hibbaan selected the <em>hadith</em> in his <em>Sahih</em> [14/396 &#8211; Mawaarid] reporting through the <em>tareeq</em> of Ibn Khuzaymah.</p>
<p>The text of the <em>hadith</em> is also reported by ad-Doolaabi by way of Baqeeyah ibnil Waleed who said: &#8220;Hurayz narrated to us saying: I heard Ghaylaan al-Muqri&#8217; narrate from Abee Qutaylah Marthad ibn Wadaa&#8217;ah (who said: I heard) an-Nu&#8217;man ibn Basheer say &#8230;&#8221;, (then he mentioned the <em>hadith</em>).</p>
<p>There is no problem with the sanad for the purpose of supporting reports (<em>mutaab&#8217;aat</em>), its reporters are reliable apart from Ghaylaan al-Muqri&#8217; . Perhaps he is Ghaylaan ibn &#8216;Anas al-Kalbee (their <em>mawlaa</em>) ad-Dimishqee. If that is the case then his condition (as a reporter) is unknown. A group of the reporters have narrated from him and <em>Al-Haafidh</em> (Ibn Hajr) said about him: &#8220;He is acceptable (<em>maqbool</em>).&#8221; Then it became clear that identifying this reporter in the <em>sanad</em> as al-Muqri&#8217; was a mistake, as al-Bukhaari and ibn Hibbaan had said, and that in fact he is Ghaylaan ibn Ma&#8217;shar al-Muqraa&#8217;ee [<em>Lubab</em> 3/237]. Ibn Abi Haatim [7/53] has given a biography for him, mentioning that a number of people have reported from him, and Ibn Hibbaan [5/290] declared him reliable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE <em>FIQH</em> OF THESE <em>AHADITH</em></strong></p>
<p>In these two <em>ahaadeeth</em> there are a number of important points of benefit and <em>fiqh</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>The obligation to straighten the rows for <em>salaah</em>and to stand close together in them, due to the command mentioned in the <em>ahaadeeth</em>. The rule concerning such commands is that they constitute an obligation (<em>wujoob</em>) except if accompanying evidence (<em>qareenah</em>) proves otherwise as is well established in the science of <em>fiqh</em> The <em>qareenah</em> here in fact emphasizes the obligation, and that is in the saying of the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>, <em>&#8221; &#8230; or Allah will cause conflict between your hearts&#8221;</em>, since such a warning is never given for leaving that which is not obligatory as is quite clear.<sup>2</sup></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>The forming and straightening of the rows mentioned in the <em>hadith</em>is only achieved by joining the shoulder and the side of ones foot with the shoulder and foot of the adjacent person. This is because that is what the Companions, <em>radiallahu &#8216;anhum</em>, did when ordered to straighten the rows and stand close together in them. Hence <em>Al-Haafidh</em> (Ibn Hajar) said in <em>al-Fath</em> after mentioning the additional saying of &#8216;Anas in the first <em>hadith</em> that I have quoted above:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">&#8220;This (wording) is an explicit explanation that the mentioned action (of the Companions) was done in the time of the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>. With this in mind the usage of this action as a pretext for explaining what straightening the row means becomes complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is regrettable that many Muslims have neglected this <em>Sunnah</em> of straightening the row, or rather they have lost it altogether, except for a few of them. For I have not seen this practiced by any group amongst them except <em>Ahlul-Hadith</em> (the People of the <em>Hadith</em>). I saw them in Makkah in the year 1368H enthusiastic and concerned with adhering to the <em>Sunnah</em> as with other <em>Sunan</em> of <em>al-Mustafah</em> (Muhammad the Messenger of Allah) <em>ﷺ</em><em>.</em> This contrary to others from the followers of the <em>madhaahib</em> &#8211; and I do not exclude the <em>Hanaabilah</em> (Hanbalis), for this <em>Sunnah</em> has become utterly forgotten amongst them. In fact they have consecutively abandoned and turned away from it. This is because most of their <em>madhaahib</em> state that the <em>Sunnah</em> in this regard is that a space of four fingers width should be kept between ones feet, and more than this is disliked, as is detailed in <em>al-Fiqh &#8216;alal-Madhaahib al-Arba&#8217;ah</em> [1/207].</p>
<p>This spacing has no foundation in the <em>Sunnah</em>; rather it is based on mere opinion. If it were correct then it would be necessary to restrict this practice to the <em>Imam</em> and the one praying on his own so that the authentic <em>Sunnah</em> (of standing close in the row) would not be opposed with this practice, as the fundamental principles of <em>fiqh</em> (<em>al-Qawaa&#8217;id al-&#8216;Usooleeyyah</em>) necessitate.</p>
<p>In short I appeal to the Muslims &#8211; especially the Imaams of the <em>Masaajid</em>, those who are concerned to follow the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>, and to acquire the virtue of reviving his <em>Sunnah</em>, I appeal to them to act by this <em>Sunnah</em>, have concern for it, and call the people to it until they unify upon it, and by what they will be saved from that warning <em>&#8221; … or Allah will cause conflict between your hearts.&#8221;</em><sup>3</sup></p>
<p>I add in this addition<sup>4</sup> (of my book): It has reached from one of the callers to Islam (<em>du&#8217;aat</em>) that he belittles the status of the <em>Sunnah</em> that the Companions practiced, and which they did so with approval of the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>. He insinuates that the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em> did not teach them this practice. So he has not realized &#8211; <em>and Allah knows best</em> &#8211; that</p>
<ul>
<li>this was their understanding and that</li>
<li>the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>approved of their understanding and their practice. This is sufficient amongst <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> to affirm the legitimacy of this practice, because the witness sees what the absent does not, and the Companions are people whose followers will never be wretched (unsuccessful).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>In the first <em>hadith</em>there is an affirmation of a clear miracle (<em>mu&#8217;jizah</em>) given to the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>, and that was his ability to see behind him without turning his head. However it should be known that this was exclusively for the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em> when he was in <em>Salah</em> since nothing exists in the <em>Sunnah</em> that states that he used to see behind him without turning his head outside the <em>Salah</em>. <em>And Allah knows best</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">(i) this was their understanding and that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">(ii) the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>approved of their understanding and their practice. This is sufficient amongst <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> to affirm the legitimacy of this practice, because the witness sees what the absent does not, and the Companions are people whose followers will never be wretched (unsuccessful).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>In the two <em>ahaadeeth</em>there is a clear proof for something that many people do not know about, although it has become recognized in the field of psychology, and that is the fact that outer (apparent) evil and corruption affects inner evil and corruption and vice versa. There are many <em>ahaadeeth</em> about this; perhaps we will undertake the task of gathering and referencing them at some later opportunity if Allah, <em>The Most High</em>, wishes.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>The entering of the <em>Imaam</em>into the opening <em>takbeer</em> for prayer when the <em>mu&#8217;adhin</em> says <em>&#8216;The Prayer is about to start,&#8217;</em> (“…qad qaamatis salaah…”) is an innovation in the religion (<em>bid&#8217;ah</em>) due to its contradicting the authentic <em>Sunnah</em>, as these <em>ahaadeeth</em> prove &#8211; especially the first one. The <em>ahaadeeth</em> show us that after the <em>iqamah</em> has been called there is a duty upon the Imam which he must fulfil, and that is commanding the people to straighten the rows, reminding them of that, for he is responsible for them and will be asked. <em>“&#8230; And all of you are shepherds and all of you will be asked about your flock.&#8221;</em></li>

<li>Translated from <em>Silsilah al-Ahadith as-Sahihah</em>of <em>Shaykh</em> Muhammad Nasir ud-Din al-Albaani, vol. 1, pp. 70-74, <em>hadith</em> 31 and 32</li>
<li><strong>TRANSLATORS NOTE</strong> ~ Standing close in the row, filling the gaps and straightening the line carries a great reward and virtue as well as being obligatory. This is mentioned in a number of ahaadeeth, like the following: <em>&#8220;The best of you are those who stand with their shoulders closest </em>(to the one standing next to them)<em> in the salaah, and there is no step greater in reward than that taken by a man toward a gap in the row thus filling it.”</em>Reported by at-Tabaraanee in al-Awsat, refer to Saheeh at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb (1/200).<em>&#8220;Whoever fills a gap in the row, Allaah raises him up due to it a rank and builds a house for him in al-Jannah.”</em>Reported by at-Tabaraanee in al-Awsat and al-Asbahaanee in at-Targheeb, the hadeeth is Saheeh as occurs in Saheeh at-Targheeb (no.505).</li>
<li><strong>TRANSLATORS NOTE</strong> ~ There are a number of ahaadeeth that explain the virtue of reviving the Sunnah and calling the people to guidance and righteousness. For example the Prophet (ﷺ) said: <em>“Whoever calls to guidance will have the same reward as all those who follow him in that guidance but this will not take anything away from their reward. Whoever calls to untruth will carry the same sin as the sins of all those who follow him in that, but that will not take anything away from their sins.”</em>Reported by Ahmad in his Musnad, Muslim in his Saheeh and others.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><br />
Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Just as Imam Ibn Hibban was lenient and soft in praising and commending narrators he was also very strict and harsh in dispraising and criticising them in numerous places. The majority of the scholars of Hadith have categorised mudallis narrators in a number of levels or categories and one should refer to Tabaqat al-Mudallisin of Hafiz Ibn Hajr for such categorisations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari the great researcher and mujtahid said about Imam Sufyan al-Thawri,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;His tadlis was very little.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise Imam Ibn Ma&#8217;in also accepted and took the narrations of Sufyan al-Thawri which he narrated as AnAna i.e. the narrations he did tadlis in and you can refer to Ibn Rajabs Sharh of E&#8217;llal Tirmidhi for this. This is the reason why Hafiz Ibn Hajr categorised Imam Sufyan al-Thawri in the second level of narrators in his Tabaqat al-Mudallisin thus he and other Imams of Hadith accepted his narrations of AnAna as if he had heard them directly. Therefore, the opinion of Imam Ibn Hibban holds no weight compared to the position of the majority of the scholars of Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is further remarkable is that I have all of the Sahih Ibn Hibban and I have read all of it, he presents narrations of mudallis narrators who are of the third level in so many places as evidence to conflicting issues and he also grades the narrations as Sahih i.e. authentic. The reports are such that the narrators do not clearly say they heard the reports directly, this is something you can read for yourself. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, when Imam Ibn Hibban not follow through with this rule himself, how can his mere opinion be imposed as evidence or proof on others when the majority of the scholars of Hadith oppose him.   </span></p>

He lived in Herat, and traveled many regions, he traveled to Hijaz, Iraq, Sham (3), Egypt, and other countries. He stayed in Jurjan (4) in 273 H. (5)</p>
<p>He met in those lands the prominant Huffadh (scholars of hadith) and Imams, the ones that he learned from:</p>

&#8211; Ishaq bin Rahwaih<br />
&#8211; Yahya bin Ma&#8217;een<br />
&#8211; Ali bin al Madini<br />
And others.</p>
<p>He studied Fiqh under Al-Buwaiti, the companion of Imam Shafi&#8217;i, and Arabic linguistics from Abu Abdullah Ibn Al-A`rabi. (7)</p>
<p><span class="bold">His Students:</span><br />

&#8211; Al Mu&#8217;ammal bin Al-Hasan bin Isaa.<br />
&#8211; Abul Abbas Ahmad bin Al-Azhar.<br />
&#8211; Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Abdoos At-Tara&#8217;ifi.<br />
&#8211; Hamed Ar-Rafa&#8217;<br />
And others. (9)</p>
<p><span class="artRedTitle">His Life And Scholars&#8217; views of Him:</span></p>
<p>&#8211; <span class="artBlue">Ibn Hibban</span> mentioned him in Thiqat (Trustworthy ones), and said: &#8220;One of the Imams of the world, he narrates from Abu al Waleed and the people of Iraq.&#8221; (10)<br />
&#8211; <span class="artBlue">Ya&#8217;qub al Qarrab</span> said: &#8220;I have not seen the like of Uthman b. Sa`id neither has he seen the like of himself. He studied Literature under Ibn Al-A&#8217;rabi, Fiqh under Abu Ya&#8217;qub al-Buwaiti, and Hadith from Yahya bin Ma&#8217;een and Ali bin al Madini. He was leading in these sciences, may Allah have mercy on him.&#8221;<br />
&#8211; Muhammad bin al Mundhir said: &#8220;I heard <span class="artBlue">Abu Zur&#8217;ah Ar-Razi</span>, and I asked him about Uthman bin Saeed, so he said:&#8217; He has been gifted in authoring fine works.&#8217; &#8221;<br />
&#8211; <span class="artBlue">Abul-Fadl al-Jarudi</span> said: &#8220;He was an Imam to be followed in his lifetime and after his death.&#8221;<br />
<span class="artBlue">Al-Hasan bin Saheb Ash-Shashi</span> said: &#8220;I asked Abu Dawud As-Sijistani (11) about Uthman bin Saeed, so he said: &#8216; From him we learned Hadith.&#8217; &#8221; (12)<br />
<span class="artBlue">Abu Hamid Al-A&#8217;mashi said:</span> &#8220;I have not seen from the Muhaditheen anyone like Muhammad bin Yahya, Uthman bin Saeed <span class="artTakhrij">[Ad-Darimi]</span>, and Ya&#8217;qbu bin Sufyan.&#8221; (13)</p>
<p>Abu Uthman As-Sabuni narrated with his own chain that Imam Qutaibah bin Saeed said at the end of his book &#8220;al Iman&#8221;:<br />
&#8220;If you see a man loving Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Malik bin Anas, Al-Awza&#8217;i&#8230;&#8221; and he mentioned a number of Imams, then he said: &#8220;Then know that He is upon the Sunnah.&#8221; Then <span class="artBlue">Abu Uthman As-Sabuni</span> said: &#8220;And I added to those that Qutaibah rahimahulllah mentioned: That whomever loves them, he is upon the Sunnah, from the Imam of Hadith whom are to be followed, and to be upon their guidance&#8230; from them are: Muhammad bin Idrees Ash-Shafi&#8217;i&#8230;&#8221; and he mentioned a number of scholars, from them was: Uthman bin Saeed Ad-Darimi. (14)</p>
<p><span class="artBlue">Adh-Dhahabi</span> said about him: &#8220;The Imam, Allamah, the Hafidh, the Critic &#8230; he was persevere upon the Sunnah, and well-versed in debating.&#8221;<br />
He also said: &#8220;Uthman ad-Darimi was like a tree trunk in the eyes of the innovators&#8217; (15), and it was said that he is the one who stood up against Muhammad bin Karram &#8211; whom the sect al-Karramiyah are attributed to &#8211; and exiled him from Herat.&#8221; (16)</p>
<p><span class="artBlue">Taj Ad-Deen As-Subki</span> said about him: &#8220;One of the Trustworthy scholars, and whom was mentioned by Al-Abbadi in his &#8220;Tabaqat&#8221; saying: &#8216; The Imam of Hadith and Fiqh&#8230;) (17)</p>
<p><span class="artBlue">Al-Hasan Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Abdoos</span> said:<br />
&#8220;When I wanted to travel to Uthman bin Saeed Ad-Darmi, I came to Abu Bakr Muhammad b. Ishaq b. Khuzaimah, and I asked him to write to him for me, so he wrote to him. I entered Herat in Rabee&#8217; al Awwal, 280 H. I went to Uthman bin Saeed, and delivered the letter to him. He read it and welcomed me, and asked me how Abu Bakr Ibn Khuzaimah was doing, then he said to me: &#8216;When did you arrive?&#8217;<br />
I said: Tomorrow.<br />
He said: &#8216;My son, go back to them, for you haven&#8217;t come yet.&#8217;<br />
so I got embarrassed.<br />
Then he said: &#8216; Don&#8217;t be shy my son, for I have resided in your country for two years, and your shaikhs at that time were able to bear from me things like this.&#8217; &#8221; (18)</p>
<p><span class="bold">His Works:</span><br />
&#8211; A large Musnad (19)<br />
&#8211; Ar-Rad ala al-Jahmiya (Refuting Jahmiya)<br />
&#8211; Naqd or Ar-Rad ala Bishr al Mirrisi (Replying to the heretic Bishr al Mirrisi d. 218 H.) (20)</p>
<p><span class="bold">His Death:</span><br />
He passed away in Dhul Hijjah, 280 Hijri.</p>
<p><span class="artRedTitle">His Statments in Some Matters of Belief (Aqeedah)</span> :</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">&#8211; Tawheed:</span><br />
Uthman Ad-Darimi said: &#8220;And the meaning of Tawheed in the Ummah is saying: &#8216;La Ilaha Illa Allah Wahdahu La Sharika Lahu&#8217; (21).&#8221; (22)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">&#8211; Istiwa and Allah&#8217;s Elevation:</span><br />
He said:<br />
&#8220;And the Muslims have agreed that Allah is above His Throne, above His Heavens.&#8221; (23)<br />
&#8220;And we knew, with no doubt, that Allah is above His Throne, above His Heavens, like He described Himself, separate from His creation.&#8221; (24)<br />
&#8220;For Allah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;la is above His Throne, above His Heavens, separate from His creation, so whoever doesn&#8217;t know Him like this, then he doesn&#8217;t know His God Whom he worships.&#8221; (25)<br />
He said in regards to Allah&#8217;s saying -translation of the meaning-: <span class="artAya">{And Pharoah said, &#8220;O Haman, construct for me a tower that I might reach the ways * The ways of the heavens, so that I may look at the God (Ilah) of Moses, but indeed, I think he is a liar.&#8221;}</span> <span class="artTakhrij">[40:36-37]</span> :<br />
&#8220;In these ayat is a clear explanation, and an obvious indicator that Musa was calling Fir&#8217;awn (Pharoah) to know that Allah is above the heaven, and because of that, he (Fir&#8217;awn) ordered to build a big tower, and wanted to see Him (Allah Ta&#8217;ala).&#8221; (26)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">Allah being with His creation -Ma`iyyah-</span>:<br />
He said: «Some of them said: Let&#8217;s put aside the interpretation of scholars, we only depended on the Quran for evidence, so bring the Book of Allah. We said: ‘yes … however, you are ignorant of its meaning, so strayed from the straight path, and you clung to the middle of the ayah, and deliberately overlooked its beginning and its ending, because Allah –Azza wa Jal- began the verse with His knowledge of them, and ended it with that, He said: <span class="artAya">{Have you not seen that Allah knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth? There is no Najwa (secret counsel) of three, but He is their fourth&#8230;}</span> until His saying: <span class="artAya">{and afterwards on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they did. Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of everything}</span>, so this is evidence that He meant His knowledge of them and their deeds, not that He Himself is in every place with them as you claim.» (27)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">On Tashbih in Allah&#8217;s Attributes</span>:<br />
He said:<br />
<span class="artAthar">«As there is nothing like Him (Allah), thus there is no hand like His Hand.»</span> (28)<br />
<span class="artAthar">«As there is nothing like Him, there is no hearing like His Hearing, nor sight like His Sight, and there is nothing in creation that they can be compared, or likened or resembled to.»</span> (29)<br />
<span class="artAthar">«All of these ahadeeth, and even more than it, mention the descending of the Lord, Most High; and the people of Fiqh and knowledge from our scholarly teachers are upon believing in them; none of them deny any of these ahadeeth or refrained from narrating them until this group (i.e. jahmiyyah) appeared, who then opposed the ahadeeth of the Messenger of Allah and expended great effort to oppose them, so they questioned: ‘How does He descend?’, to which we replied: ‘We were not commanded to know how He descends in our Religion, and our minds cannot comprehend/grasp it, and there is no creation that is equal to Him that we may equate His acts or attributes with.»</span> (30)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">On Seeing Allah in the Hereafter</span>:<br />
«When Allah put a restriction for seeing Him in the Hereafter with His saying: <span class="artAya">{Looking (ila) at their Lord (Allâh)}</span> (i.e. with the preposition “ila” which means to/towards), we knew that it is the seeing of the eyes.» (31)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/86 hadith no.190, book 3, chapter 10, hadith no.44), at-Tamhid (11/23), al-Istidhkar: (no.166)    </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Abu Dawud (no.826) and Tirmidhi (no.312 and he said: <em>[Hasan]</em> good) and Nasa’i (2/140, 141 hadith no.920) from the hadith of Malik and authenticated by Ibn Hibban (al-Mawarid: no.454)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) Imam Bayhaqi has declared Umara Ibn Ukaimah al-Laythi as being “an unknown man” (as-Sunan al-Kubra 2/159 and Kitab al-Qira’at no.327) </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">However Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibban and other than them have said he is trustworthy (based on authenticating etc.) therefore it is most correct that Ibn Ukaimah is trustworthy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Imam Tirmidhi said, “There is nothing in this hadith which can criticise the person who is the saying of recitation (of fatiha) behind the imam” (Sunan at-Tirmidhi no.312) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) The narrator of this hadith, Abu Huraira (Radi Allahu Anhu), is himself of the saying for (reciting) fatiha behind the Imam in other loud prayers. See hadith no.139 </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) &#8220;When the people…(to the end of the sentence in the hadith)” are the words of Imam Zuhri which have ended up becoming part of the hadith and this is not established with an authentic chain to be the words of Abu Huraira (Radi Allahu Anhu). See al-Takhlis al-Habir (1/231 hadith no.343) and Nasrul Bari fi Tahqiq Juz Qira’at al-Bukhari (no.95) </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Note: The narration in Sunan Abu Dawud (no.827) is rejected because of the chain being broken (where it says) “From Zuhri he said Abu Huraira” See Nasrul Bari (page no.153) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) To see the detailed proofs of (reciting) fatiha behind the Imam see hadith no.139 and (the book) &#8216;al-Kawakib ad-Duriyah fi Wujub al-Fatiha Khalf al-Imam fil Bahriyah&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) Reciting loudly behind the Imam is not allowed unless there is a Sharia compliant excuse.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) For a detailed analysis and research on the topic of reciting behind the Imam see Imam Bukhari’s book Juz Qira’at (with my verification: Nasrul Bari fi Tahqiq Juz Qira’at of Bukhari) and studying the book of the Muhadith Abdurahman Mubarakpori Tahqiq al-Kalam is very beneficial. </span></p>
