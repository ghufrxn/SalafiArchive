				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">QUESTION</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people claim it is permissible to make tabarruk ie seek blessings from the relics of the scholars and righteous people; they present evidence and say the companions sought blessings from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, so what is the ruling concerning this affair? Also in the form that is deemed permissible, is not a non-Prophet being compared to the Prophet of Allah ﷺ? Also is it permissible to seek blessing from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ after his demise? And is it permissible to seek wasilah ie intercession of the blessings of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ?</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is impermissible to seek blessing from the relics of anyone other than the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, for example the water remaining after wudu, his hair, his sweat or any other part of the body. All of these things are specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and this is because Allah had blessed his body and anything else that he touched. This is the reason why no companion sought blessing or virtue from each other during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ or after his death, even to the extent that blessings or tabarruk was not sought from the four rightly guided Khulafa Rashidun or from the other virtuous companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, such actions and the understanding of the companions is a clear and manifest evidence they understood tabarruk ie blessings to be specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ which was impermissible for anyone else. It is also impermissible for anyone who is not a Prophet because it leads to and is a means to Shirk with Allah which is also the false worship of others. Likewise, and similarly it is not correct to make wasilah of the essence or selfness of Prophet ie dhat, his attributes, his blessings, his station and status because it lacks evidence. This is also due to the fact that it is a means and also leads to Shirk with Allah, this is extremism as well as exaggeration in the status and station of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the reasons is is impermissible is because none of the companions adopted or practiced this type of wasilah. If this was something good, they would have surely preceded us.  Another reason why it is impermissible is because it opposes evidence s from the Shari’ah. Allah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Allah has the most beautiful names, so call him by them.” (al-A’raf:180)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Apart from Allah&#8217;s name, it is permissible to make wasilah through his attributes like Honour, mercy and speech which is established and proven from the authentic hadith, in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would seek refuge in Allah through his Speech, Honour, Mercy and Power. (Muslim no.2202, 2708).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also by having Iman in Allah and his Messenger, it is a means of loving both. Hence it is permissible to seek nearness or closeness to Allah via his righteous good deeds. This is exemplified in the incidence of the people of the cave, who sought shelter in a cave from rain when eventually a rock covered the entrance and blocked it. The people did not have the power to remove the rock, so they began to figure out a way in how to deal with the calamity, and so they agreed to supplicate to Allah by mentioning the good deeds they had done, and would use them as interecessors. So one used his good conducts with is parents as a means to seek nearness to Allah, so the rock moved a little. The second person used his deed of abstaining from fornication as a means to seeking closeness to Allah despite having the ability to do so, so the rocked moved a little more. The third person sought means of closeness by mentioning his good deeds of being honest and trustworthy, eventually the rocked moved from the entrance of the cave and they were eventually able to leave. This is an incident of the people or nations before, so It contains admonition and guidance for us all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This answer has been further expounded by Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim in their respective books. Allamah Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan has also addressed it in his <em>Fath al-Majid Sharh Kitab al-Tawhid.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the hadith of the blind man who sought intercession through the Prophet ﷺ which also mentions the Prophet ﷺ interceded on his behalf, so Allah restored his sight (Ahmad 4:134, Tirmidhi no.3579, Ibn Majah 1404, see also Shaikh al-Albani’s al-Tawassul wal-Wasilah p.75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we should know, this hadith did not mention his station or status as a means of closeness or intercession but rather it was due to the supplication of the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, his intercession, using his own wasitah and wasilah as the hadith clearly states. Furthermore, the people will go to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for this type of intercession on the Day of Judgement so that Allah makes Judgement on them quickly (Bukhari 7410, Muslim 193).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, and similarly the people of Jannah will come to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and ask him to intercede with Allah on their behalf for them to enter Jannah quickly (Muslim 196).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the aforementioned forms of Wasilah, whether they are related to when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was living or the afterlife, all in all of them are related to the Wasilah or du’a of intercession and not due to his selfness, ie Dhat or due to the right of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Tuhfatul Ikhwan Bajwibah Muhimmah Tataluq Biarkan al-Islam</em> (Question 5 p.29), see also <em>Majmu’a Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawah</em> (7:67)   </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muqallidin argue, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong><em>&#8220;These people read a few books here and there and they think they have become Mujtahids of the era.&#8221;</em></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Jalil Samrudi (d.1393H) <em>Rahimahullah,</em> answers and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an old sickness of the muqallidin which they employ due to their desires, in order to declare the scholars of Ahl Al-Hadith ignorant and also a trick to deceive the ignorant people. They do not sense an accomplishment unless they say these words. It is stated in  &#8216;<em>Din al-Khalis&#8217;</em> (2:138) (Of Shaykh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;These people are extremely harsh with someone who issues a verdict according to the Quran and Sunnah, they declare him to be an ignorant person while ignoring his verdict due it to being contrary to the verdicts of their leaders whom they consider to be upon the truth.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;<small class="english">And those who have wronged are going to know to what [kind of] return they will be returned.&#8221; (al-Shu&#8217;ra:227)</small></span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is just idle speech and had they proven the Ahl al-Hadith were ignorant from the statements of scholars it would have been considered and looked into, is it not be the case and the opposite that the scholars have declared the muqallidin ignoramuses. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Qayyim said in <em>al-A&#8217;lam al-Muwaqi&#8217;een</em> (1:7)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Abu Amr (Ie ibn Ibn Abdul Barr) and other scholars said the people are agreed and have a consensus (Irma) that the muqallid is not considered to be from the people of knowledge.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Bakhtari said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;It is known the scholars are blessed with knowledge and the Ignorant people of taqlid said to the people of knowledge they were enemies.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Juwayni well known as Imam al-Haramayn said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The ruling on the muqallid is that he is a lay person (i.e. jahil)&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, no scholar has expressed taqlid to be knowledge and therefore one cannot ascertain points and views just by uttering them. Knowledge is what Allah and his Messenger ﷺ said and what the companions said and not anything contrary to this. Mulla Ai Qari said in<em> Sharh Fiqh al-Akbar,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Anything which does not have Akhbarana or Hadathana (i.e. he informed us or narrated a hadith to) are satanic whisperings.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And whoever wants to benefit further from such issues then let him refer to my treaties, <em>&#8216;al-Ba&#8217;ith al-hathith fi fadhal ilm al-hadith wa ahlila al-dahith&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;Irsal al-barid liqat&#8217;e lifa ahl al-taqlid wal-tardid liman as ahl  al-hadith ill awl al-jadid&#8217; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Taken from Hasan al-ta&#8217;dil bard man snafu al-jarh al-jamil p.409-410 from Majmu&#8217;a rasa&#8217;l vol.3)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Islām and the Veneration of Graves and Annual Gatherings</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>For the Muslim to Ponder and Reflect</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Ataullah Hanif Bhojiyani [1407H]</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/al-allamah-shaikh-muhammad-ataullah-hanif-bhojiyani-1407h/">[READ BIOGRAPHY HERE]</a></span></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Part 1</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The word used is ʾUrs which alludes to and if very commonly associated with wedding festivities however is Sūfī terminology it means the festivities and gatherings that take place annually around graves (or built up as shrines)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The history of the people of shirk and the Mushrikīn is a testimony that exaggerating their praise for their dead and venerating and respecting graves beyond the normal bounds was from amongst the major reasons they deviated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Corruption and Depravity in Making Graves into Shrines</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Without a doubt the bodies of the deceased and their graves require a given level of decorum however, this does not mean they are venerated by building structures over their graves and turning them into shrines. Likewise, nor does it mean to give these graves and shrines the same status as the house of Allāh, in that it is obligatory to undertake long ardent journeys as part of the Dīn to visit it and recommended to visit the Prophets Masjid and there is certainly no evidence making it permissible to seek aid and assistance from the dead and thereby calling upon them and supplicating to them just as we do with Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Origins of Idol and Grave Worship</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is shameful that in addition to all kinds of gross indecency and open sinning that takes place at such shrines and tombs, they are also venerated and idolised just as the Masajid are. They celebrate the birthdays fuelled with festivities at the graves and they also pray towards them as the Qiblah. They make tawaf of the graves and prostrate to them and in reality this is also idol worship which is shirk. This is the deplorable evil Islam came to eliminate and this is also the rot and foundation of idol worship. Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Qayyim said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Idol worship started with the veneration of the dead by making their pictures and by touching their graves and praying near them (ie their graves).”</em> [Ighāthah al-Luhfān Fī Masāʾid al-Shayṭān [2:197]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Grave Worship is the Hallmark of the Jews and Christians</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also known despite their claim of believing in the oneness of the creator the jews and christians became engrossed in this catastrophic calamity and became deeply embroiled in shirk ie polytheism. In this regard Allāhs wrath was upon them. The Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said five days before his demise,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Beware of those who preceded you (jews and christians) and used to take the graves of their Prophets and righteous men as places of worship, but you must not take graves as mosques; I forbid you to do that.&#8221;</em> [Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim [1:210]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[Trans. Note] the full text of the hadith as narrated by Jundub (RadhiAllahu Anhu), </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“I heard from the Messenger of Allāh</em><em> (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</em><em>) five days before his death and he said: I stand acquitted before Allāh that I took any one of you as friend, for Allāh has taken me as His friend, as he took Ibrāhim as His friend. Had I taken any one of my Ummah as a friend, I would have taken Abū Bakr as a friend. Beware of those who preceded you and used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous men as places of worship, but you must not take graves as mosques; I forbid you to do that.” </em>[Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim [no.532]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Annual Celebrations and Gatherings are the Root of Grave Worship</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the forms of veneration is what has been mentioned in the previous ḥadīth, another form is what they practice in terms of the worship they conduct on their annual birthday celebrations and their days which they celebrate just as they celebrate Eiʿd day as. Shaikh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“As for making structures over graves and venerating them, is unlawful with Allah and his Messenger. It is also veneration to specify a specific time in order to visit these graves and to generally gather around them at a specific time is also a form of veneration celebrations.”</em> [Iqtiḍā Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqim [p.181]   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">he also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Eid is the title of a specific place, a place where there is intent to worship Allah by gathering there. For example Masjid al-Haram, Mina, Muzdalifah, Arafah which have been titled as Eid by Allah. Such are places where the people gather on specific days where they supplicate, make Zikr and offer sacrifice. The Mushrikin also had similar places or gatherings where they would accumulate and perform similar acts (or worship) but when Islam came it finished such acts. The graves of the Prophets and the righteous people also fall under this category.” </em>(Iqtiḍā Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqim (p.156)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning the graves of the Prophets and the righteous people should not be made into places of gatherings or festivities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Taqlid of the Hindu</span>’s</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shah Waliullah writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The habit and norm of the fire worshippers and the idol worshippers of Hindh is to establish a particular day to gather at a specific place to make celebrations. The pir worshippers have followed in their footstep and celebrate Eid Ghadir Kum or annual celebration at the grave of some holy person. They indulge in all kinds of luxuries and extravagance, thereby pleasing shaytan and upsetting the elders.” </em>(Balagh al-Mubin (p.31)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He writes at another instance,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“From the major innovations is to make numerous fabrications concerning the affair of the grave and then to make them into places of festivities and gatherings.”</em> (Tafhimat Ilahiyyah 2:64)</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated, Compiled &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have alluded to this issue in the epilogue and I intend further clarification in this chapter. The terminologies or definition of both taqlid and Ittiba themselves highlight the differences between them. From the perspective of the Shari’ah, Ittiba is mentioned in the following Ayah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>كِتَابٌ</strong><strong> أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ فَلَا يَكُنْ فِي صَدْرِكَ حَرَجٌ مِنْهُ لِتُنْذِرَ بِهِ وَذِكْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>اتَّبِعُوا</strong><strong> مَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا مِنْ دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۗ قَلِيلًا مَا تَذَكَّرُونَ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Surah A’raf 2:3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">[This is] a Book revealed to you, [O Muhammad] &#8211; so let there not be in your breast distress therefrom &#8211; that you may warn thereby and as a reminder to the believers. Follow, [O mankind], what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies. Little do you remember. [Surah A’raf 2:3]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Ayah mentions both taqlid and Ittiba </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">i.e. <strong>اتَّبِعُوا مَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ &#8220;Follow, [O mankind], what has been revealed to you&#8221;  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an evidence and proof for Ittiba and the definition of taqlid has preceded this which means to accept the statement of someone that does not constitute evidence. This may be understood from the following Ayah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>وَلَا</strong><strong> تَتَّبِعُوا مِنْ دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ &#8220;and do not follow other than Him any allies&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Khawaiz Mandad Maliki said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whoever’s statement you follow whose statement is not obligatory to follow without evidence, you make Taqlid of them and Taqlid is not correct in the deen of Allah. What is obligatory upon us is Ittiba with evidence and we follow based on evidence which permissible in the deen whereas Taqlid is impermissible”</em> [al-Tahrir Fi Ilm al-Usul al-Taqrir wa’l Tahbir [3:353].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Trans note: he also ie Khawaiz Mandad said, <em>“Taqlid in the shariah means to refer to someone’s statement who himself does not have evidence for it and that is prohibited (Mamno’a) in the shariah and ittiba (following/obeying) is something that is established by the way of evidence.”</em> (Jami Bayan al-Ilm Wa-Fadhlihi [2:993 no.1895, Ibn Qayyim also cites something similar in A’laam al-Muwaqieen [2:197], as does Suyuti in ar-Radd Alal Akhlad Ilal Ard [pg.123]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Other scholars have also alluded to a similar meaning for example Kamal ibn al-Humam, Ibn Amir al-Haj and Allamah Shanqiti as their statements have preceded. Imam Ahmad Rahimahullah also defined Ittiba in this manner.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Dawud said that he heard Imam Ahmad stating that Ittiba is that of a person who follows and obeys the rulings and commands transmitted through authentic narrations of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his companions – may Allah be pleased with them all.  It should be noted that the people have the option with regards to the statements of the Tabi’een. He further said do not make taqlid of me or Malik, al-Thawri or Awzai,’ rather take from where they took from (ie the Quran and Sunnah). He further stated </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“From a man having little fiqh, is evident in him making taqlid of other individuals in the Din”</em> [Masail Abu Dawud [pp.113], A’lam al-Muwaqqi&#8217;een [3:489].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Source: <span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Legal Status of Taqlid [pp.22-24]</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated Abu Ubaydah</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Checked &amp; Additional Notes</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: center;" align="center">Surah al-Ahzab Ayah 56</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="color: #000080;">Taken from Bada&#8217;i al-Fawa&#8217;id (Amazing points of benefit) 2/160-164</span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsir of the ayah: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Indeed, Allah confers blessing upon the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam), and His Angels [ask Him to do so]….”</em> (Surah al-Ahzab Ayah 56)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Question: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is the meaning of Allah the Most High sending Salah and Salam on His Prophets (Alayhimusalam), this Salam is a type of request [talab] and supplication [dua] (call). How can Allah’s Salam be a permissible (valid) supplication?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Answer: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no doubt that for request [talab] three things are necessary:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. The one who requests (seeks someone or something) [talib]</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> 2. The one who is required (or the thing sought after) [matlub]</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> 3. Meaning who it is requested from [Matlub manh]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However this only applies when some person requests another person or asks them a question, give the order or prohibit. However if the seeker seeks something from his own self [nafs] then at that particular time there will only be 2 pillars instead of 3. Meaning the seeker [talib] and the sought after [matlub]. (The) [matlub manh] (meaning who it is requested from) will be his own self [dhat]. This is also clear that the seeker and who it is requested from, being united (joined, connected, merged or integrated) is not impossible. Seeking is actually, a branch of intending. Just like a person can want something from himself [nafs] in the same way he can seek (something from himself) and the same way he can order himself [dhat] or prohibit (himself) in the same way he can make (himself) the one who it is requested from [matlub manh]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is in Surah Yusuf: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Indeed, the soul is a persistent (commander) enjoiner of evil”</em> [Surah Yusuf Ayah 53]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is in Surah Wa an-Naziat:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“But as for he who feared the position of his Lord and prevented the soul from [unlawful] inclination”</em> [Surah Wa an-Naziat Ayah 40]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When a person can order (command) or prohibit himself, even though he has another commander present over him, so then why can’t Allah command and prevent Himself whilst He has no other commander or preventer present over Him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The meaning of Allah the Most High’s salam on the Prophets (Alayhimusalam) is that He has sought peace (security, safety, wellness) from Himself for them. For more clarification review (and see) the following Ayats:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He has decreed upon Himself mercy.”</em> [Surah An’am Ayah 12]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He has established upon Himself a necessity and obligation (incumbency) whereby nobody else can be involved (or interfere) in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“and incumbent upon Us was support of the believers.”</em> [Surah ar-Rum Ayah 47]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In citation of these, there are those Ayat where an oath is given along with informing about doing some task (action). He said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“So by your Rab, We will surely question them all”</em> [Surah al-Hijr Ayah 92]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“So by your Rab, We will surely gather them”</em> [Surah Maryam Ayah 68]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These Ayat contain encouraging (motivating) to do good actions and preventing from doing bad actions.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> The remaining (Ayat) are where there is an oath given on the last (previous) action. Information there is only intended. Such as:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ya, Sin. By the wise Quran. Indeed you, [O Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam)], are from among the messengers”</em> [Surah Yasin Ayah 1 to 3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Swearing an oath on the proof which the rejecters are denying is asserting and confirming the information. On this subject there are those Ayat which Allah the Most High has reported about the previous decision. He said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“And Our word has already preceded for Our servants, the messengers, [That] indeed, they would be those given victory And [that] indeed, Our soldiers will be those who overcome.”</em> [Surah as-Safat Ayah 171 to 173]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Just as Allah makes a certain action obligatory (incumbent) on Himself, the same way he makes (some actions) prohibited (on Himself). It is in the hadith:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“My servants, I have made oppression unlawful for Me” (Muslim 4/199 (2577) The Book of Virtue, Enjoining Good Manners, and Joining of the Ties of Kinship, Chapter: The Prohibition Of Oppression)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note: Here it should be clearly understood that whatever Allah the Most High makes compulsory on Himself, that is His what he likes  and also makes it his plan to do and those things which He has made prohibited [Haram] on Himself then He has declared them to be not preferred and detestable and intends to leave them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In summary, whichever things that He likes then He makes that thing a reality, and whichever things He does not like (is not preferred, detestable) He does not make that thing occur. Contrary to His servants, those actions that he (Allah&#8217;s servant) likes, it is not necessary that they occur. The same way those matters (issues, affairs) that he thinks is detestable, it is not necessary that he avoids (abstains from) them. The actions of the servants and actions of the Creator have both clearly be shown to be different from this text.</span></p>
