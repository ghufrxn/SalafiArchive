				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>by </strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaymah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">This statement shows the Manhaj of the Salaf regarding the innovators and their interaction with the rulers. Although we cannot derive legal rulings or establish a specific Manhaj from this single statement, it does however show the view of one venerated Salaf (although there are others – see further points). Likewise, the early scholars of hadith used this statement for theological and methodological conclusions as evidenced by them in transmitting it in their respective early books of Aqidah and Manhaj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">It is of equal importance and something by the way of thought provoking to individuals who adhere to the ‘card’ of <strong>“the salaf differed over certain matter”</strong> when it comes to the rulers. As Salafis, we do not endorse unrestricted blind praise for rulers, but this report further adds to the scope of discussion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Two affairs are encompassed in this statement which are a reminder to those who exert time and effort in reinventing religious trends when the Salaf established them for us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Imam Abu Amr Ubadah bin Nusayyin al-Kindi (d.118H)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">He was from the Tabi’in who died in 118H. Imam Ibn Hibban said in his <em>ath-Thiqat</em> he died when he was young. (<em>Tahdhib ut-Tahdhib</em> (2/287) (ar-Rislaah). Imam Ibn Sa’d said about him, <em>“He was thiqah and died in 118H during the reign of the Khaliph Hisham bin Abdul Malik.”</em> (<em>Tabaqat Ibn Sa’d</em> (9/459 no.4686) (Khanji). Imams Ahmad, al-Nasa’i, Ibn Ma’in, Ijli and Ibn Numayr all declared him thiqah (<em>Tahdhib ut-Tahdhib</em> (2/286-287).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Ghaylan bin Muslim was from the founding members of deviant Qadari sect. Hisham bin Abdul Malik was the Umayyad ruler.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>The Statement</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>“A man came to Ubadah bin Nusayyin and said, “The leader of the believers, Hisham cut Ghaylan’s hands and feet and executed him.” He said, “Is what you say true”? He replied, “Yes.” Ubadah said, “By Allah he acted in accordance with the Sunnah and applied the correct judgement, I will write to the leader of the believers and praise him for his actions.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Transmitted by</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(1) al-Firyabi, <em>Kitab al-Qadr</em> (p.216 no.285) (Dar Ibn Hazm)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(2) Abu Zur’ah ad-Dimashqi, <em>at-Tarikh</em> (p.161-162 no.800) (DKI)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(3) Ibn Battah, <em>al-Ibanatul Kubra</em>, Kitab ath-Thani (2/239 no.1851) (Darul Rayah)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(8) Ibn Hajr, <em>Lisan ul-Mizan</em> (2/6/314 no.6009) (Dar ul-Basha’ir)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Benefits</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(1) Expressing happiness and rejoicing when innovators die, and this refers to the callers to innovation and active ardent supporters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(2) Verifying news and making sure reports and incidents are true and accurate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(3) Communicating the truth by endorsing and openly agreeing with judgements and rulings according to the Quran and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(4) Judging and weighing all actions according to the Sunnah, whether it’s the general Muslims or the rulers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(5) Praising the rulers for their actions that coincide and conform to the affairs of the Sunnah and those which aid Islam by refuting and curb the incursion of the deviant innovators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(6) The Salaf did praise the rulers as those who equally reprimanded their evil in accordance with the constraints of the Sunnah. We do not intend by this that you start a fan club but intelligently acknowledge that if you quote statements of openly rebuking the rulers you also have statements which praise the rulers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(7) The writing of Ubadah to Hisham shows the scholars of the Salaf communicated with the rulers through writing. If in this example it is was for praise, then it is also a given they would have written to advise them on other matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Further Benefits</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(1) Scholars like Numayr bin Aws, a Qadhi from Dimashq also wrote to Hisham congratulating him on executing Ghaylan (al-Uqayli, <em>Kitab adh-Dhu’afa al-Kabir</em> (3/437) (Dar ul-Baz).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(2) Raja’ bin Haywah also wrote to Hisham praising him for his actions. (<em>Kitab adh-Dhu’afa al-Kabir</em> (3/436), <em>Lisan ul-Mizan</em> (2/6/314)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(3) Hisham bin Abdul Malik had ordered Imam al-Awza’i to debate with Ghaylan to establish evidence against him and to refute his views. Ghaylan remained adamant on his heretical views and with the evidence established against him, he was executed due to Imam al-Awza’i’s fatwa of execution. (<em>Lisan ul-Mizan</em> (2/6/314), Muhammad Ibn Abd Rabbah, <em>al-Iqd al-Farid</em> (2/193) (DKI), al-Baladhuri, <em>Ansab al-Ashraf</em> (8/419)(Dar ul-Fikr).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(4) Maymun bin Mihran, Iyas bin Mu’awiyyah a judge in Basrah, and Rabi’ah al-Ra’y also a judge all debated Ghaylan before the reign of Hisham but under the rule of the Umayyads and at their behest. (at-Tabari, <em>Tarikh ar-Rasul</em> (7/203) (Dar ul-Ma’arif), <em>Ansab al-Ashraf</em> (8/390), Ibn Kathir, <em>al-Bidayah Wan-Nihayah </em>(9/349) (DKI), <em>al-Iqd al-Farid</em> (2/191-192), Abu Nu’aym, <em>Hilyatul Awliya</em> (3/260) (al-Maktabah as-Salafiyyah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">So, I hope based on fairness and the bravery of the new mujaddids they can ascribes labels such as ‘sell-outs’ to the Imams and scholars cited above.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a small treatise in which Shaikh Abdul Qadir al-Junayd explains and elucidates the harm and evil of backbiting Muslim rulers. He also discusses the weakness of the reports transmitted from the Salaf which are used by some claimants of Salafiyyah. This is important since some claimants of Salafiyyah are advocating the permissibility of backbiting rulers publicly on account of these reports from the Salaf which is an aberrant view. They hide behind these reports to express a legitimate difference of opinion from the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When there is inherent desire to please the nafs to publicly ridicule and rebuke Muslim rulers on account of the shortcomings of the Ummah, this is nothing but weakness. The same people divert attention from evil corruptive sins of the heart and body resort to this; failing to address their accountability as an Ummah. This is the way of the cowards.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since the spread of emotional outbreaks by the practitioners of evil, ruler or non-ruler, the same claimants of Salafiyyah abandon the Quran and Sunnah which detail how to deal with these affairs. To such an extreme that a brother said Salafis were duped in this issue based on these reports. Unbeknown to most, these reports from the Salaf are severely weak and have no support from the vast majority of the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Salaf do not support this view and the detractors have failed to prove this. They resort to cherry picking odd aberrant reports to support their redundant view. Shaykh Abdul Qadir has shown the clear weakness of these reports and refuted those who encourage backbiting Muslim rulers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Presenting and screening themselves behind a singular, lone, odd, aberrant and contradictory statement from one Salaf is rudimentary and certainly insufficient to formulate legal points of Manhaj. This is further problematic when they clearly oppose the plethora of reports and statements from them which well documented in the early works of Aqidah and Manhaj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many people and claimants of Salafiyyah have been spreading these statements without recourse to research or relying on Sunni scholars for understanding. Merely quoting statements without context and the mere thought of the existence of a report is hardly thrilling. Nonetheless, this treatise will dampen the mood! Some brothers have been sharing scans while others continuously repeat these statements from websites, e.g., <strong>http://abu0hamza.blogspot.com/2016/06/2882.html?m=1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly, as a summary, the view of the Salaf in this matter is very clear and it was comprehensively expressed by Imam Abu Bakr al-Isma’ili (d.371H) when he said, <em>“Know, May Allah have mercy on us and you, indeed the Madhab of Ahlul Hadith wa Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jama’ah is….” </em>(<strong><em>Kitab I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnah</em></strong> p.35)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And then he said about the rulers, <em>“To supplicate for their rectification and that they turn towards being just.”</em> (<strong><em>Kitab I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnah</em></strong> p.55 no.58. (KSA: Maktabah Dar ul-Minhaj, 1431H. 2<sup>nd</sup> Edn. Ed. Jamal Azzun). This opposes backbiting rulers openly since its deception and treachery.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Manhaj of the Salaf on this issue can also be summarised with the view and statement of Imams Malik and Sufyan ath-Thawri when they said, <em>“It is better to be under the rule of an oppressive ruler for 70 years than not have a ruler for even an hour.” </em>(<strong><em>Tartib al-Madarik wa Taqrib al-Masalik</em></strong> (2/493), <strong><em>ad-Dibaj al-Madhab Fi Ma’rifah A’yan Ulama al-Madhab</em></strong> (1/125)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah echoes this by mentioning 60 years, wherein he said, <em>“The wise people said 60 years with an unjust ruler is better than a night without a ruler.”</em> (<strong><em><u>Majmu’a al-Fatawa</u></em></strong> (30/136)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the Salaf understood how to deal with oppressive rulers and would not want a believer to backbite them for 70 years! This explains it is better to have patience with an oppressive ruler then not have one and the ensuing harm.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have presented a simple translation of the Shaykh’s treatise and added detailed explanatory notes when needed. I did not reference the reports and ahadith in the introduction since the Shaykh clarifies he penned this elsewhere in a lengthier treatise. The intention is to render this into English at some stage, In-Sha-Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reader might encounter different numbers for reports in Ibn Abi Dunya’s book <strong><em>as-Samt</em></strong> and <strong><em>al-Ghibah wan-Namimah</em></strong>. This is because authors have used two different editions in their books. The publication of <em>Dar ul-Gharb</em> edited by Najm Abdur Rahman Khalaf and <em>Dar ul-Kutub al-Arabi</em> edited by Abu Ishaq al-Huwayni. These two have been used by numerous authors hence the numbering issue. Shaykh Abdul Qadir used the Dar al-Kutub al-Arabi edition and so are the scans.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have presented scans where necessary and at other times I have referenced books with their publishers, so the avid reader can refer to them for further research. Some of the scans presented were originally shared on social media by the advocators of backbiting the oppressive ruler, and so I have presented themin this treatise for them to know this is a direct response to them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Qadir’s words are in <strong>black bold typography </strong>and my additional notes are in blue, marked with [AK] at the beginning and END] when my notes are complete for each relevant section.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abul Qadir al-Junayd begins his small treatise by saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>All praise belongs to Allah and salutations on his Messenger Mustafa Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To proceed,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has been transmitted from some Imams, they did not consider it backbiting to speak against the oppressive Muslim ruler, Therefore, some students of knowledge in our time, may Allah correct them, use this as evidence for the permissibility of rebuking the ruler openly by backbiting them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This line of argument is defective due to the following reasons.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First – 1<sup>st</sup> Reason</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first thing to note; these reports which have been transmitted from these Imams are not authentic. These reports will be mentioned in due course, along with who transmitted them with clarifying their defects which indicate their weakness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second – 2<sup>nd</sup> Reason</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even if one statement from them was established to be authentic, their statements are not evidence according to the agreement of the scholars. Rather their statements in and of themselves require evidence as numerous people of knowledge have said. Evidence or proof is the statement of Allah, his Messenger Sallalalhu Alayhi Wasallam, the statement of the Companions and the ijma of the scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Third – 3<sup>rd</sup> Reason</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Backbiting a fellow Muslim is haram whether it’s the ruler or those being ruled over, based on the texts of the Quran, Prophetic Sunnah and the ijma of the scholars. The ruling of it being haram does not leave this status except by other evidence from the Shari’ah. There is no evidence in the Shari’ah that specifies the ruler.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, there are no ayahs of the Quran, there are no clear authentic Prophetic hadith, nor are there any clear authentic reports from the Companions nor is there any ijma. Rather backbiting the ruler is more harmful and worse in terms of its severity on the general Ummah and the various Muslim lands. The likes of Abu Bakr al-Isma’ili ash-Shafi’i, Ibn Abi Zamanin al-Maliki, Ibn Salah ash-Shafi’i and Ibn Taymiyyah all said speaking against the ruler was backbiting. It is also permitted based on ijma as quoted by Ibn Taymiyyah to backbite the wicked sinner who publicises his evil sins. This is also supported by numerous texts of the Shari’ah.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fourth – 4<sup>th</sup> Reason</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed, the statement of the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam is established and clear in its meaning which states, <em>“Whoever has advice for the ruler, he should not do it publicly, rather, he should take him by his hand and advise him privately. If he accepts it, he accepts, and if he does not, he would have fulfilled his duty.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith prohibits and denounces backbiting the ruler.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This point is further confirmed and clarified based on the reason this hadith was transmitted, its background and the understanding of the Companions, May Allah be pleased with them all, in how commanding the good and forbidding the evil encompasses advising. This also includes guidance to whoever errs in this affair of the rulers. The hadith mentions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>It is reported that Iyadh bin Ghanam lashed the governor of Dara when it was conquered, so Hisham bin Hakim spoke harshly with Iyadh until he (Iyadh) was angry. Then, a few nights later, Hisham bin Hakim came to him to excuse himself and said, “Did you not hear the Prophet say, “The worst punishment on Yawm ul-Qiyamah will be for the one who is worse in punishing people?” Iyadh bin Ghanam said, “Oh Hisham bin Hakim, we know what you know and saw what you saw, and we accompanied who you accompanied. Did you not hear Allah’s Messenger Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam say, “Whoever wants to advise the ruler, he should not do so publicly. Rather, he should take him by his hand and advise him (privately). If he accepts it (that is good). If not, he has fulfilled his obligation.” You, Oh Hisham, you are reckless, when you are reckless with the ruler of Allah, do not fear the ruler of Allah will kill you, since you will be someone killed by the ruler of Allah?”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The statement of the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam<em>, “…He should not do it publicly, rather, he should take him by his hand and advise him privately&#8230;”</em> indicate a prohibition and a command. The foundational principle is that a command denotes an obligation (an obligatory act) and a prohibition denotes something which is unlawful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The transmission of this hadith has been outlined in the lengthier treatise and a discussion related to its authenticity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fifth – 5<sup>th</sup> Reason</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Companions RadhiAllahu Anhum differed and disagreed with this view (of backbiting the ruler) and what they deduced from the texts. Their views take precedence over the views of others from amongst them. In fact, the statement of one (Companion) is considered evidence according to the view of Ahlus Sunnah if no one opposes it (i.e. another Companion). What about then if they all were agreed on one view? Rather, they complied and agreed with the Prophetic texts and their statements and actions are explanatory confirmations of this matter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah said in an-Nuniyyah (p.226),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Knowledge is what Allah said, His Messenger said,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>his Companions said, as they were the first to know,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Any knowledge attributed to any other than them is haughty,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>It is between the Messenger and the opinion of so and so.”</em></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is authentically transmitted from Sa’id ibn Jubayr who said, <em>“I asked Ibn Abbas, “Shall I command my ruler with good?” Ibn Abbas said, “If you fear he will kill you, then no. If you must do so, then do it (privately) between you and him and do not backbite your ruler.”</em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma prohibited him from rebuking the ruler publicly through backbiting since backbiting is unlawful.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is authentically transmitted from Tawus who said<em>, “I mentioned the rulers in front of Ibn Abbas and a man became insolently brazen (with his statements) and no one was more insolent than him in the house. Ibn Abbas heard him and said, “Oh Hazhan do not make yourself a fitnah for the oppressors.” He then became small and humbled to the extent that no one was seen so small and humbled in the populus than him.”</em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma considered speaking of the shortcomings of the rulers to be a source of tribulation and aiding the oppressive people in their evil and corruption. This statement is conveying the warning against publicly rebuking the ruler by backbiting him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This report has been referenced in the longer treatise.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is established (authentically) from Sa’id bin Jumhan that he said, <em>“I met Abdullah bin Abi Awfa RadhiAllahu Anhu and he was a sight to behold. I greeted him with salam and he said to me, “who are you?” I replied, “I am Sa’id bin Jumhan.” He asked me, “What did your father do?” I replied, “He killed the Azariqah.” He said, “May the curse of Allah be upon the Azariqah, may the curse of Allah be upon the Azariqah. </em><strong><em>Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said they (Khawarij) are the dogs of hellfire. I said, “Al-Azariqah (a sect of the Khawarij) alone or all the Khawarij?” He said, “Rather all the Khawarij.” I said to him, “But the ruler oppresses the people and does this, and he does that to them (i.e. their evil). So, then he grabbed me by my hand and pinched it very hard and said, “Oh Son of Jumhan, stick with the great majority (of scholars), stick with the great majority (of scholars).</em></strong><strong><em> If the ruler listens to you then advise him in his home (in private), inform him of what you know. If he accepts (that’s good) and if not then leave him, for you are not more knowledgeable than him.”</em></strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, Abdullah bin Abi Awfa RadhiAllahu Anhu rebuked Ibn Jumhan’s speech when he mentioned the evil of the ruler concerning his affair of governance by backbiting him. He said to advise the ruler privately if he listens to you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This report has been referenced in the longer treatise and with a discussion whether it is Sahih or Hasan (authentic or good).</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is transmitted by <strong><em>al-Bukhari</em></strong> (no.3267) and <strong><em>Muslim</em></strong> (no.2989) and it is his wording on the authority of Usamah bin Zayd RadhiAllahu Anhu when it was said to him, <em>“</em><em>Why don’t you visit Uthman and talk to him? Thereupon he said, “Do you think that I have not talked to him that you also hear? By Allah. I have talked to him (about things) concerning me and him and I did not like to divulge those things about which I had to take the first step</em><em>.”</em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This report establishes the Companions of the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam did not rebuke their rulers or leaders publicly if many people were around them. This was their way to do it behind closed doors and not publicly which was not their norm RadhiAllahu Anhum. Furthermore, Usamah RadhiAllahu Anhu did not want to be the first to open the door to fitnah by rebuking the ruler publicly.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>It is reported that Iyadh bin Ghanam lashed the governor of Dara when it was conquered, so Hisham bin Hakim spoke harshly with Iyadh until he (Iyadh) was angry. Then, a few nights later, Hisham bin Hakim came to him to excuse himself and said, “Did you not hear the Prophet say, “The worst punishment on Yawm ul-Qiyamah will be for the one who is worst in punishing people?” Iyadh bin Ghanam said, “Oh Hisham bin Hakim, we know what you know and saw what you saw, and we accompanied who you accompanied. Did you not hear the Allah’s Messenger Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam say, “Whoever wants to advise the ruler, he should not do so publicly. Rather, he should take him by his hand and advise him (privately). If he accepts it (that is good). If not, he has fulfilled his obligation.” You, Oh Hisham, you are reckless, when you are reckless with the ruler of Allah, do not fear the ruler of Allah will kill you, since you will be someone killed by the ruler of Allah?”</em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith and incident has been referenced in the lengthier treatise wherein I have mentioned its authenticity whether it is Sahih or Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point of deduction is, when Iyadh bin Ghanam RadhiAllahu Anhu knew someone wanted to publicly and openly rebuke the ruler by the way of recklessness, he said, <em>“</em><em>You, Oh Hisham, are reckless. When you are reckless with the ruler of Allah.”</em></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Dawud at-Tayalisi said in his <strong><em>Musnad</em></strong> (no.928), From Humayd bin Mihran from Sa’d bin Aws from Ziyad bin Kusaib who said<em>, “Ibn Amir mounted the minbar while wearing a fine garment. </em><em>Abu Bilal said, “Look at your leader wearing clothes of the wicked! Abu Bakrah who was (sitting) under the minbar said, “I heard Allah’s Messenger Sallalalhu Alayhi Wasallam saying, &#8220;Whoever insults Allah&#8217;s leader then Allah disgraces him.&#8221;</em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>At-Tirmidhi</em></strong> (no.2224) transmitted it through his chain of transmission (Abu Dawud at-Tayalisi’s) with the wording, <em>“</em><em>I was with Abu Bakrah under the Minbar of Ibn Amir while he was giving a Khutbah wearing a fine garment. Abu Bilal said, “Look at our Amir wearing clothes of the wicked!&#8217; So, Abu Bakrah said, Be quiet! I heard Allah’s Messenger saying, “Whoever insults Allah&#8217;s ruler on the earth, Allah disgraces him.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam at-Tirmidhi said, <em>“This hadith is Hasan Gharib.”</em> Allamah al-Albani graded it Hasan according to his last view. Hafiz al-Bazzar said in his <strong><em>Musnad</em></strong> (no.3670),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This hadith has been transmitted from Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam with similar words, and I do not know anyone to have transmitted this from Allah’s Messenger Sallallahu alayhi Wasallam with this wording except Abu Bakrah.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say, Sa’d bin Aws al-Adawi is in the chain. As-Saji said concerning him <em>“Truthful.”</em> Ibn Hibban and Ibn Khalfun mentioned him in <strong><em>ath-Thiqat</em></strong>. Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani said, <em>“Truthful but had errors.”</em> Adh-Dhahabi said, <em>“He was declared weak by Ibn Ma’in while others said he was thiqah and Ibn Hibban mentioned him in his <strong>ath-Thiqat</strong>.”</em> Al-Albani was inclined towards his tawthiq.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Humayd bin Mihran he is thiqah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point of deduction from this report which establishes proof is that Abu Bakrah ath-Thaqafi RadiAllahu Anhu rebuked the man’s speech in front of the worshippers regarding the representative of the ruler and silenced him. He informed him this type of rebuking is insulting the ruler which results in Allah disgracing the one who does it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Sixth – 6<sup>th</sup> Reason</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of Anas bin Malik RadhiAllahu Anhu who said, <em>“Our elders from the Companions of Allah’s Messenger Salallahu alayhi Wasallam forbade us (warned us from) “Do not revile your rulers, do not deceive them, do not have hatred for them, have taqwa of Allah and have patience for indeed the affair is near.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by Ibn Abi Asim in <strong><em>as-Sunnah</em></strong> (no.1015) and al-Bayhaqi in <strong><em>Shu’bal Iman</em></strong> (no.7523) and others. Allamah al-Albani said, <em>“the chain is good – jayyid.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point of deduction is due to the prohibition of reviling the rulers in every affair, in cheating them while being ordered to have patience due to the corruption that would result in the Din, this world and for the worshippers. This is even though he might be correct in his cursing (i.e. the reason) and permissible by the way of punishment in the same way as long as the cursing does not entail words or cursing that are haram or transgress boundaries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, backbiting the ruler, rebuking him publicly by backbiting and mentioning his faults openly is prohibited even more so. The corruption of backbiting is worse than being abusive because its corruptive effects encompass the Din, this world and the ummah as a whole and it spreads. He does this to portray he is concerned for the religion and the Ummah. This is then accepted by the people and spread far and wide while misguiding many people. This is in opposition to abuse as this affects the abuser and he is vilified by the general public.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Backbiting the ruler and spreading his faults is not from the affair of advising him. The opposite to advising the ruler is deception and betrayal. We have been commanded to advise and prohibited from deceiving or betraying.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Seventh – 7<sup>th</sup> Reason</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shari’ah came to expel evil and corruption from the Ummah. Ayahs of the Quran, texts from the Prophetic Sunnah both general and specific all elaborate this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allowing the ruler to be backbitten especially when he is oppressive and publicly rebuking him through backbiting is from the main reasons that bring evil and corruption in the ummah. This approach makes backbiting continuous and increase in its severity. This reason and affairs lead to rebelling against the just and oppressive ruler and the spread of the Madhab of the Khawarij.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is transmitted by <strong><em>al-Bukhari</em></strong> (no,3267) and <strong><em>Muslim</em></strong> (no.2989) and it is his wording on the authority of Usamah bin Zayd RadhiAllahu Anhu when it was said to him, <em>“</em><em>Why don&#8217;t you visit Uthman and talk to him? Thereupon he said: Do you think that I have not talked to him but that I have make you hear? By Allah. I have talked to him (about things) concerning me and him and I did not like to divulge those things about which I had to take the first step</em><em>.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The wording in <strong><em>al-Bukhari</em></strong> is, <em>“</em><em>Somebody said to Usamah, &#8220;Will you go to so-and-so and talk to him?” He said, “Do you think that I have not talked to him but that I have make you hear.  I talk (advise) to him privately without opening the door (of trials), for neither do I want to be the first to open it (i.e. rebellion),”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The jurist Siraj ud-Din Ibn Mulqaain ash-Shafi’i said in his book, <strong><em>at-Tawdih Li-Sharh al-Jam’i as-Sahih</em></strong> (19/180),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“His saying [I talk to him privately] meaning speaking out by rebuking the rulers openly would be from the affairs of opposing the rulers of the Muslims, it would cause splitting of the Muslim ranks and disrupt and separate the body of the Muslims. Just as the affair was when Uthman was confronted with public rebuking.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Imam Abdul Aziz ibn Baz said in <strong><em>Majmu’a al-Fatawa</em></strong> (8/210-211)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“…</em><em>When the ignorant Khawarij opened the door to evil in the time of Uthman RadhiAllahu Anhu and they openly rebuked and criticised Uthman, it was a great fitnah, killing and corruption, the effect of which has still not subsided in people today. To the extent that the fitnah encompassed in what occurred between Ali and Mu’awiyyah RadhiAllahu Anhuma. They killed Uthman and Ali RadhiAllahu Anhuma due to this reason [i.e., openly criticising and rebuking the rulers]. In fact, the same reason led to the killing of many Companions and others which was to openly rebuke and criticise rulers, to mention their sins openly. To the extent that many people had hatred for the rulers and killed them.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is authentically transmitted from Abdullah bin Ukim that he said, <em>“I will never aid the killing of any Khaliph after Uthman.” It was said to him, “Were you involved in spilling his blood?” he replied, “I consider mentioning his faults the same as spilling his blood.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Transmitted by Ibn Sa’d in <strong><em>at-Tabaqat al-Kubra</em></strong> (3/80, 6/115), Ibn Abi Shaybah in his <strong><em>Musannaf</em></strong> (no.32706 and no.32043) al-Bukhari in <strong><em>at-Tarikh al-Kabir</em></strong> (1/31 no.45), ad-Dawlabi in <strong><em>al-Kunna wal-Asma’</em></strong> (no.476) and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Abdullah bin Ukim was a Mukhadram, meaning he encountered and was alive during the time of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam but he did not hear or meet him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Eighth – 8<sup>th</sup> Reason</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Permitting backbiting the ruler especially if he is oppressive and rebuking him publicly by backbiting, is slander and defamation in the Shari’ah. It is alleging there are contradictions in the Shari’ah. So how does one prevent the causes of evil and corruption in the Ummah, the prevention of which is supported by numerous texts (of Islam), both general and specific when at the same time the main reason which leads to evil, and corruption is being allowed or permitted?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The explanatory meaning above is evidence that you cannot find in the Shari’ah what they want to make permissible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, besides these affairs, May Allah reward you, the reports you have encountered with the following meaning, we will investigate them,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is not backbiting when speaking about three people, the innovator, a wicked sinner who sins publicly and the oppressive ruler.”</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] There is a difference of opinion concerning Sharik bin Abdullah whether he is weak or Hasan in hadith. Many of the scholars and Imams of hadith, rijal and Jarh wat-Ta’dil have criticised and praised him. For further details refer to <strong><em>al-Jam’i li-Kutub adh-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin wal Kadhabin</em></strong> (7/261-281 no.5506) where the latter has collated over 20 pages concerning him by the way of his integrity in hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Further to differences on his trustworthiness, Sharik is a Mudallis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The following scholars all classed and graded him to be a mudallis. Hafiz Ibn Hajr in <strong><em>Tabaqat al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.75 no.56), Hafiz al-Ala’i in <strong><em>Jam’i at-Tahsil Fi Ahkam al-Marasil</em></strong> (p.77 no.23), Sabt ibn al-Ajami in <strong><em>Kitab at-Tabiyin Li-Asma al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.33), <strong><em>Manzumah Mahmud al-Maqdisi</em></strong> (line 4), Abu Zurah al-Iraqi in<strong><em> Kitab al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (no.28), Hafiz Suyuti in <strong><em>Asma Man Urifa Bi-Tadlis</em></strong> (no.31), Muhammad Tal’at  in <strong><em>Mu’ajam al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.248-250) (KSA: Adwa as-Salaf 1426H/2005, 1<sup>st</sup> Edn.).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Shaikh Zubair Ali Za’s discusses this to some extent despite declaring him hasan in hadith. See his <strong><em>Fath al-Mubin Fi Tahqiq al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.75 no.56). The Shaikh Rahimahullah also quotes Imam Ibn Hazm and Ibn Qattan al-Fasi declaring Sharik a Mudallis (<strong><em>al-Muhalla</em></strong> (8/263 issue no.1383 and 10/333 issue no.2016) <strong><em>Bayan al-Wahm wal-Iyham</em></strong> (3/533-534) (KSA: Dar Tayybah, 1432H/2011) 2<sup>nd</sup> Edn.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Al-Qufili in his checking of <strong><em>Sharh Usul al-I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah</em></strong> said<em>, “Also transmitted by Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Dunya in <strong>al-Ghibah</strong> (no.98) and in <strong>as-Samt</strong> (no.235) through the route of Sharik bin Abdullah an-Nakha’i from Uqil bin Khalid al-Ayli from al-Hasan al-Basri with the same wording. However, its chain is weak due to Sharik al-Qadhi and there is a disconnection in the chain between Uqil and al-Hasan and Allah knows best.” </em>(<strong><em>Sharh Usul al-I’tiqad</em></strong> (1/310)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Najm Abdur Rahman in his checking of <strong><em>Kitab as-Samt</em></strong> said, <em>“Its narrators are from the thiqat.”</em> (<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan</em></strong> (p.343 no.235) (Lebanon: Dar ul-Gharb, 1406H/1986) 1<sup>st</sup> Edn.). This is not the case, and he did this because he made assumptions on who this Uqil is and despite bringing criticism on Sharik. Al-Huwayni answers Najm’s words with surprise and astonishment, as you will read below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Ishaq al-Huwayni, who many of the advocators of backbiting the ruler publicly take from and who is known to have serious errors in Manhaj, grades the chain weak, he says, <em>“There is weakness in the chain and Sharik an-Nakha’i had a weak memory….some of them claim the narrators are trustworthy! Despite what they said about Sharik an-Nakha’i (in terms of weakness)!!”</em> (<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan </em></strong>of Ibn Abi Dunya (p.145 no.234) (Lebanon: Dar ul-Kutub al-Arabi, 1410H/1990, 1<sup>st</sup> Edn.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Lalaka’i also transmits this in his <strong><em>Sharh Usul al-I’tiqad</em></strong> with the following chain, from al-Hasan from Ahmad bin al-Hasan bin Yunus from Muhammad bin Uthman from Ahmad bin Yunus from Mandal from Musa bin Ubaydah from Sulayman bin Muslim from al-Hasan, <em>“It is not unlawful to backbite three people, one is the person of innovation who is extreme in his innovation.”</em> (<strong><em>Sharh Usul al-I’tiqad</em></strong> (1/231 no.278) (Maktabah al-Islamiyyah – Nashat bin Kamal).

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It seems that Imam al-Lalaka’i made ikhtisar of the riwayah perhaps owing to only mentioning the point of discussion (backbiting the people of bid’ah) or perhaps the feasible possibility he was not convinced of the authenticity of the other two types of people. It is therefore also possible he might have summarised report (no.276), the report above or again, he might not have deemed the other wording to be authentic, Allahu Ta’la A’lam.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So, it seems Abdullah bin Shawdhab encountered al-Hasan’s era, but he did actually meet or transmit any narrations or reports from him. So, there is a disconnection in the chain which renders it weak.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] See also <strong><em>Mawsu’ah Ibn Abi Dunya</em></strong> (4/379) and this report is extremely weak. END]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The chain for this report is very weak due to Kharijah bin Mus’ab who is abandoned. As for Ibn Jaban or Jaban I could not determine who he was (and thus his trustworthiness) as others have also said. Ibn Abi Dunya also reported this with the same chain in <em>al-Ghibah wan-Namimah</em> (no.101) but in marfu form and this is another defect (that is transmitted in marfu form)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] This chain although it is the same, the only variation is Jaban instead of Ibn Jaban.  Najm Abdur Rahman Khalaf said in his checking of <strong><em>Kitab as-Samt</em></strong>, <em>“In the manuscript of al-Zubaydi it says Ibn Jaban.”</em> (<strong><em>Ittihaf</em></strong> (7/557) (<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan</em></strong> (p.345) (Lebanon: Dar ul-Gharb, 1406H/1986) 1<sup>st</sup> Edn.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Kharijah bin Mus’ab was a very weak narrator, heavily criticised, abandoned in hadith and would do tadlis from liars.  Imam al-Bukhari said it was impossible to decipher his authentic hadith from others (ie weak) (<strong><em>Kitab ad-Dhu’afa</em></strong> (no.108), <strong><em>Tarikh ash-Saghir</em></strong> (p.192). He was also accused of Irja (<strong><em>Ahwal ar-Rijal</em></strong> (p.355), abandoned in hadith <strong><em>adh-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin</em></strong> (no.184) of an-Nasa’i, he was accused of lying and abandoned by most of the scholars of hadith. Ibn Ma’in said he was a liar (<strong><em>Tarikh Ibn Ma’in</em></strong> (3/253)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">For comprehensive statements concerning him refer to <strong><em>al-Jam’i li-Kutub adh-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin wal Kadhabin </em></strong>(5/135 no.3902), where the author devotes approximately 8 pages to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Kharjah bin Mus’ab was also a mudallis. Hafiz Ibn Hajr brings his entry in <strong><em>Tabaqat al-Mudallisin</em></strong> and said, <em>“al-Khurasani, the majority of the scholars of hadith declared him weak and Ibn Ma’in said, “He would perform tadlis from liars.”</em> (<strong><em>Tabaqat al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.155 no.136).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Sabt ibn al-Ajami in <strong><em>Kitab at-Tabiyin Li-Asma al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (no.24) and Muhammad bin Tal’at also declared him to be a Mudallis (<strong><em>Mu’ajam al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.174-175)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Shaikh Zubair Ali Za’i in his summary said<em>, “Matruk – abandoned and accused of doing tadlis on liars. Hafiz Ibn Hajr said, “Matruk, he would do tadlis from liars and Ibn Ma’in declared him to be a lair.”</em> (<strong><em>at-Taqrib no.1612) </em></strong>from<strong><em> Fath al-Mubin Fi Tahqiq Tabaqat al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.155 no.136).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Bukhari also said, <em>“Waki abandoned him, and he (Kharijah) would do tadlis on Ghiyath bin Ibrahim. (Ghiyath is weak in his hadith”</em> (<strong><em>adh-Dhufa as-Saghir</em></strong> (no.108 p.259), <strong><em>Tuhfa al-Aqwiya Fi Tahqiq Kitab adh-Dhu’afa</em></strong> (p.41), <strong><em>Tarikh ash-Saghir</em></strong> (p.192)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Shaikh Zubair also said in his checking of <strong><em>Kitab adh-Dhu’afa as-Saghir</em></strong>, <em>“Kadhab – a liar, matruk – abandoned, did tadlis from liars.” </em>(<strong><em>Tuhfa al-Aqwiya Fi Tahqiq Kitab adh-Dhu’afa </em></strong>(p.41 no.109) (Pakistan: Maktabah al-Islamiyyah, 1433H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, Ibn Jaban is not known on the scale of the scholars of praise or criticism. This then adds to the weakness of the report. Najm Abdur Rahman Khalaf said, <em>“I could not find a biographical note for him</em> (<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan</em></strong> (p.345)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">He continues and says, <em>“I think it was misspelt and it should be Ibn Jad’an al-Basri. He is one of the narrators who narrated from al-Hasan al-Basri. His name is Ali bin Zayd bin Jad’an at-Tamimi. He is weak. He was from the fourth tabaqah and he died in 131H, some said before that. (<strong>Taqrib</strong> (2/37<strong>), Tahdhib</strong> (7/322-324)” </em>(<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan</em></strong> (p.345)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Al-Huwayni in his checking of <strong><em>as-Samt</em></strong> said, <em>“The chain is very weak.

Ed. Abu Ishaq al-Huwayni) END]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Other people have transmitted this report from al-Hasan al-Basri and sometimes these reports only mention the innovator, sometimes they only mention the wicked sinner and sometimes they mention both.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] As mentioned there are various reports from Imam al-Hasan al-Basri in many books. Some of these reports are authentic and some are weak. Reports concerning innovators can be found in books of Aqidah and Manhaj that discuss the reprehension of innovations and innovators. Some of these reports are from Rabi bin Sabih, as-Salat bin Tarif, Uthman bin Matar, Yunus bin Ubayd and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Some are related to etiquettes and manners for example, from Qatadah from al-Hasan who said<em>,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“There should be no sense of respect between you and a wicked sinner.”</em> (<strong><em>Adab al-Mufrad</em></strong> no.1018, Shaikh al-Albani authenticated it)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Another interesting report of al-Hasan al-Basri with the chain from al-Mubarak bin Fadhalah from al-Hasan who said, <em>“When wicked sinning becomes open, it is not backbiting to speak about them. He said the same regarding the effeminate man and the Haruriyyah (the Khawarij).”</em> (Ibn Abi Dunya in <strong><em>as-Samt</em></strong> (no.236), <strong><em>al-Ghibah wan-Namimah </em></strong>(no.98)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The narrators in the chain are thiqah except al-Mubarak who is truthful but also mudallis and narrates with Aan-Aan, however all the various reports from al-Hasan that speak about backbiting the innovators support this transmission since some are authentic</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Khattabi (d. 388H) said while expanding the Manhaj of Imam al-Hasan al-Basri when he said, <em>“Who amongst is like al-Hasan today who will carry out his tasks with regards to giving sincere advice and aspiring admonishment. May Allah rectify us and our rulers, for they are corrupt because of our sins.” </em>(<strong><em>al-Uzla</em></strong> p.235. Damascus: Dar Ibn Kathir 1410H/1990 2<sup>nd</sup> Edn. Ed. Yasin Muhammad al-Sawwas)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This shows this was the Manhaj of Imam al-Hasan al-Basri of advising the rulers and not backbiting them. Imam al-Khattabi recalls this in his era of the 4<sup>th</sup> century and expresses the need for someone to be like Imam al-Hasan al-Basri.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">There are many reports from al-Hasan al-Basri which show apparent contradictions with this view, for example Imam Ibn Abdul Barr transmit from al-Hasan al-Basri said<em>, “One who acts without knowledge is like one who travels off the path; and the one who acts without knowledge corrupts more than he rectifies. So, seek knowledge in a way that does not harm your worship, and seek to worship in a way that does not harm (seeking) knowledge. For verily, there were people (the Khawarij extremists) who sought to worship (Allah) but abandoned knowledge until they attacked the Ummah of Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam with their swords. But if they had sought knowledge, it would not have directed them to do what they did.”</em> (<strong><em>Jam’i Bayan al-Ilm wa Fadlihi</em></strong> no.905)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">These reports contradict his insightful words which Imam Ibn Abi Hatim mentions in his explanation of the Quran, when al-Hasan al-Basri said, <em>“If people called on Allah when put to trial because of their rulers, Allah would relieve their suffering, but instead they resorted to the sword, so they were left to it. And not one day of good did they bring. Then he recited <strong>(Quran 7: 137),</strong></em><strong> “<em>And the good word of your</em></strong><em><strong> Rabb</strong></em><em><strong> was fulfilled for </strong></em><em><strong>Bani Isra’il</strong></em><em><strong>, for the patience and</strong></em> <em><strong>perseverance they had, and We</strong></em><strong> <em>destroyed the works of Pharaoh and his people and what they had</em> <em>erected.</em></strong><em><strong>”</strong></em> (<strong><em>Tafsir al-Quran al-A’zim Musnadan Aan Rasul Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was-Sahabah wat-Tabi’in,</em></strong> (7/311 no.883), Ibn Sa’d in <strong><em>at-Tabaqat al-Kubra</em></strong> (7/164), and as-Suyuti in <strong><em>ad-Darr al-Manthur</em></strong> (3/532)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">And when l-Hasan was on his deathbed some of his companions came to him and said<em>: “Oh Abu Sa’id, offer us some words you can benefit us with. He replied, “I will equip you with three words, then you must leave me to face what I am facing.( 1) Be the farthest of people from those things you have been forbidden (2) And be the most involved of people in the good you have been commanded to do (3) and know that the steps you take are two steps: a step in your favour and a step against you, so be careful where you come and where you go.”</em> (<strong><em>Hilyatul Awliya</em></strong> (2/154)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">And when al-Hasan said to the people regarding the oppression of al-Hajjaj<em>, “If he is a punishment for you then do not oppose Allah’s punishment with the sword but with peace and supplication.”</em> (<strong><em>Tarikh Dimashq</em></strong> (12/177)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This again shows, the need to be patient when faced with oppression. It is not the case if one argues that al-Hasan said with peace and supplication and by backbiting him since this is incomprehensible. Yes, this is about not rebelling but the advice of the Salaf is to be patient and advise privately. END]</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abdur Rahman bin al-Maghra’a’s trustworthiness and reliability is disputed. Ali bin al-Madini, Ibn Adiyy and others criticised him for his narrations from al-A’mash and this report is from and through the route of al-A’mash.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] Ali bin al-Madini said concerning Abdur Rahman bin Maghra’a, “<em>He is nothing he transmitted 600 hadith from al-A’mash, we discarded them as they were not transmitted like that.” </em>Also<em>, “Trustworthy narrators did not corroborate his hadith, he narrated odd and strange narrations from other than al-A’mash and all of them were weak</em>.” Yahya ibn Ma’in said <em>“He is nothing.”</em> As-Saji said, <em>“He is from the truthful people but has weakness.”</em> Abu Ahmad al-Hakim said, <em>“His hadith are not supported.”</em> Abu Zurah said, <em>“Truthful”,</em> al-Khalili said, <em>“Thiqah.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Refer to <strong><em>al-Kamil</em></strong> (5/471), <strong><em>al-Iktifa Fi Tanqih adh-Dhu’afa</em></strong> (2/406), <strong><em>Mukhtasar al-Kamil</em></strong> (p.490), <strong><em>adh-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin</em></strong> (2/101) of Ibn al-Jawzi, <strong><em>Diwan ad-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin</em></strong> (p.246), <strong><em>Mughni fidh-Dhu’afa</em></strong> (1/614), <strong><em>Mizan </em></strong>(2/520), <strong><em>Qanun adh-Dhu’afa</em></strong> (p.229) from <strong><em>al-Jam’i li-Kutub adh-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin wal Kadhabin</em></strong> (8/441 no.6433)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Najm Abdur Rahman said in his checking of <strong><em>as-Samt</em></strong>, <em>“Its chain is Hasan and Abdur Rahman bin al-Maghra’a is truthful.”</em> And then he said, <em>“They (scholars of hadith) resented the hadith he transmitted from al-A’mash since he was not supported by other trustworthy narrators.” </em>(<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan </em></strong>of Ibn Abi Dunya (p.338 no.223). So, there is a problem with al-Maghra’a from al-A’mash and his saying the chain is Hasan is incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Al-Huwayni in his checking of <strong><em>as-Samt</em></strong> said, <em>“There is weakness in the chain. Although Abdur Rahman bin Maghra’a is truthful his hadith from al-A’mash have been criticised.”</em> (<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan </em></strong>of Ibn Abi Dunya (p.142 no.222). END]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>Ad-Darimi</em></strong><strong> (no.394) also transmitted it but without the words <em>“the oppressive ruler.”</em> He ad-Darimi transmits, <em>“From Makhlad bin Malik from Abdur Rahman bin Maghra’a from al-A’mash who said, “Ibrahim (an-Nakha’i) did not consider it backbiting when speaking about innovators.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] This shows the wording especially the phrase, <em>“The oppressive/unjust ruler”</em> is controversial and disputed by the very fact it is lost in transmission in some reports. This is further problematic when the transmission is through the same narrators. Since the chain of transmission is the same in <strong>Ibn Abi Dunya </strong>except Musa bin Yusuf and Makhlad bin Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Makhlad bin Malik is awthaq than Musa bin Yusuf and thus his riwayah is taken and accepted. Makhlad is a narrator of <strong><em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em></strong> and Imam al-Bukhari’s Shaikh. His narration in <strong><em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em></strong> is (no.4074).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abi Nasr Ahmad bin Muhammad al-Bukhari al-Kalabadhi (d.398H) has an entry for him in his book on the narrators of al-Bukhari. He says, <em>“al-Bukhari transmitted from him in the Ghazwa of Uhud.”</em> (<strong><em>Rijal Sahih al-Bukhari</em></strong> (2/725 no.1205) (Lebanon: Dar al-Ma’rifah, 1407H/1987, 1<sup>st</sup> Edn.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">For further details on Makhlad refer to Imam al-Bukhari’s <strong><em>Tarikh al-Kabir</em></strong> (4/438 no.1914. <strong><em>Tahdhib ul-Kamal</em></strong> (27/340), <strong><em>Tahdhib ut-Tahdhib </em></strong>(12/625-626 no.6937), <strong><em>al-Hidayah wal-Irshad</em></strong> (2/725), <strong><em>al-Mu’ajam al-Mushtamil</em></strong> (p.289)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">For arguments sake, some researchers did authenticate this riwayah in <strong><em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em></strong>, like Shaikh Subhi Hasan Hallaq (p. 106 no.408) and his saying the rijal are trustworthy and ad-Darimi is the only one who reported it, it is still not worthy of evidence since it does not contain the words which are disputed, namely the oppressive or unjust ruler.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Shaikh Muhammad Ilyas, a student of Shaikh Ibn Baz, alludes to its weakness. He says, <em>“The narrators of this narration are thiqah however there is criticism regarding Abdur Rahman bin Maghra’a’s narrations from al-A’mash and al-Lalaka’i transmits it with an authentic chain.” </em>(<strong><em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em></strong> (1/240 no.408)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Nabil Hashim al-Ghamari also alluded to Abdur Rahman bin Maghra’a’s narrations from al-A’mash being criticised and that his reports from him were unsupported. He declared the chain of the report to be hasan, due to a supporting report in Imam al-Lalaka’i’s <strong><em>Sharh Usul I’tiqad</em></strong> (no.276). (<strong><em>Fath ul-Manan Sharh Musnad al-Jam’i</em></strong> (4/418 no.427) (Lebanon: Dar al-Basha’ir al-Islamiyyah, 1436H/2014, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edn. Ed. Nabil Hashim)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Again, this is not opposing the weakness of the former report since its words are different, this report does not mention the oppressive or unjust ruler. END]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Lalaka’i also transmitted it in his book <em>Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus-Sunnah</em> (no.276) through the route of Sulayman bin Hayyan from al-A’mash from Ibrahim with the wording, <em>“It is not backbiting when speaking about the people of innovation.”</em></strong></span></p>

This is because the author transmits the report without a narrator between them yet in no.19 and no.168 he transmits with narrators between them. Furthermore, al-Bukhari said about Ahmad bin Imran, “He was criticised.”, Abu Zur’ah “He was abandoned.” adh-Dhahabi said in <strong>Mizan</strong>, “Abu Hatim abandoned him.” This is why in <strong>al-Jarh wat-Ta’dil</strong> (1/1/65) Abu Hatim said, “He did not write anything from him, but he only encountered his era.”… Abu Hatim clarified in another book that he was abandoned in hadith…So, it is possible adh-Dhahabi may have not taken the statement due to other reasons. Some people said, “The chain is Hasan (good) Ahmad bin Imran, a group of scholars said he was thiqah while others said he was weak.” This is a lie in this matter, where are the those who said he was thiqah? And where was he declared thiqah?

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The teacher of Ibn Abi Dunya, Muhammad bin Ubad bin Musa is weak. And Marwan bin Mu’awiyyah is a mudallis and would transmit with AanAan.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani in his book <em>Ta’rif Ahlul Taqdis Bi-Maratib al-Mawsufin bit-Tadlis</em> (p.45 no.105) he said, <em>“He is famous for tadlis and he would do tadlis of his shuyukh and ad-Daraqutni described his affair like this.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] Marwan bin Mu’awiyyah despite being thiqah is also a mudallis, who did tadlis of his teacher’s name. This is as Hafiz Ibn Hajr described him in <strong><em>at-Taqrib ut-Tahdhib</em></strong> (p.742, no.6579) (Syria: Mu’assasah ar-Risalah, 1436H/2015, 1<sup>st</sup> Edn. Ed.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Muhammad bin Tal’at describes his tadlis and criticism over 7 pages in his <strong><em>Mu’ajam al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.436-443 no.154) (KSA: Adwa as-Salaf 1426H/2005, 1<sup>st</sup> Edn.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i further said while explaining Imam Ibn Ma’in’s statement when asked by ad-Duri about Marwan transmitting from Ali bin Abil Walid, he replied, <em>“He is Ali bin al-Ghurab”</em> (<strong><em>Tarikh ad-Duri</em></strong> (no.2843), also (no.2611), <strong><em>Tahdhib ul-Kamal</em></strong> (27/408).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imam Yahya bin Ma’in said, <em>“I have not seen more devious tadlis from anyone except him.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] This is mentioned in <strong><em>Tarikh ad-Duri </em></strong>(no.2843). It should be noted ad-Darimi in his recension from Imam Ibn Ma’in reports him to be thiqah, yet this contradicts most of Ibn Ma’in’s statements concerning Marwan. For a comprehensive overview of Imam Ibn Ma’in’s statements on refer to <strong><em>Mawsu’ah Aqwal Yahya ibn Ma’in Fi Rijal ul-Hadith wa I’llalihi</em></strong> (4/293-296 no.3646) (Tunisia: Dar ul-Gharb, 1430H/2009, Edn, 1<sup>st</sup> Ed.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Nu’aym also transmitted it in his book <em>Hilyatul Awliya</em> (5/41) and mentioned the same text through the chain Abu Hamid bin Jabalah from Muhammad bin Ishaq from Abbas bin Muhammad from Khalf bin Tamim from Za’idah from Mansur.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hamid bin Jabalah is in the chain, and I could not find any statements of praise or criticism for him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Khallal also transmit in his <em>Kitab as-Sunnah</em> (no.789) without mentioning the part of the rulers, he said, <em>from Harb from Muhammad bin Abdur Rahman from Abu Usamah from Za’idah who said, I said to Mansur, “Oh Abu Uttab, the day on which one of us fasts (for seeking reward) he denounces those who denounce Abu Bakr and Umar?

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] This is reported in <strong><em>as-Sunnah</em></strong> of al-Khallal as Shaikh Abdul Qadir said, (1/391 no.789) (al-Faruq al-Hadithiyyah) and (1/400 no.774) (KSA: Dar al-Awraq, 1439H/2018. 3<sup>rd</sup> Edn.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The chain contains Muhammad bin Abdur Rahman bin al-Hasan bin al- al-Ju’fi. Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Shaybah said, <em>“he memorised hadith with good memory of hadith that were connected and disconnected.”</em> Ibn Hibban mentioned him in <em>ath-Thiqat</em> and said he preserved hadith and his hadith transmitted from Sham are very strange and odd. Maslamah bin Qasim <em>said the people criticised him and he narrated abandoned reports</em>. Ad-Daraqutni said, <em>he is relied upon</em>, Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani said, <em>truthful and a preserver of hadith but he transmitted odd and strange reports.</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>I say: This report is not evidence for backbiting the oppressive ruler rather it is clear evidence which prohibits it. When I mentioned these defects of this report to a detractor, may Allah correct him, he thought the meaning was, it was allowed to backbite the rulers when not fasting. He abandoned the clear claim and did not pay attention to the answer of Mansur to the question. The statement of the one who backbites is not evidence and the affair requires a legal Islamic text to support it.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Zakariyyah bin Dalwiyyah is in the chain and in Khatib’s biographical entry for him in his <em>Tarikh</em> he does not mention any statement of criticism or praise concerning him and I could not find anyone declaring him trustworthy, and this is what others also said.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] I could not ascertain which edition Shaykh Abdul Qadir used, nonetheless the report number is the same. This report of Imam Sufyan is in <strong><em>al-Jam’i Shu’bal Iman</em></strong> (9/126-127 no.6374) of Imam al-Bayhaqi (KSA: Maktabah ar-Rushd, 1437H/2015, 4<sup>th</sup> Edn.) with the checking of Dr. Abdul Ali Abdul Hameed Hamid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Dr. Abdul Ali Abdul Hameed Hamid said in his grading of the report, <em>“There is a narrator in the chain whose (trustworthiness) I could not ascertain. Zakariyyah bin Dalwiyyah – I could not determine his trustworthiness. As-Suyuti mentioned this report in <strong>ad-Durr al-Manthur</strong> (7/577) and he transmitted it only through the author (i.e. Imam al-Bayhaqi).”</em> (<strong><em>al-Jam’i Shu’bal</em></strong> Iman (9/126 in the footnotes to no.6374, refer to the scan above)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This then indicates this is the only chain for this report, which has been shown to be weak. Some have put forward the argument Imam al-Bayhaqi said Zakariyyah was an <em>“Abid – a worshipper” </em>(<strong><em>al-Jam’i Shu’bal Iman </em></strong>(9/192), then we know this is not praise that has any bearing on the authentication and trustworthiness of a narrator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Throughout <strong><em>al-Jam’i Shu’bal Iman</em></strong> the muhaqqiq and tracer of the hadith Dr. Abdul Ali Abdul Hameed Hamid repeats this criticism on Zakariyyah, for example (6/134-135 no.3974) wherein he declared the chain to be weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Let the reader unequivocally note Imam al-Bayhaqi transmitted 60 reports prior to this report from Imam Sufyan bin Uyaynah in the same book that he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Backbiting is worse to Allah than fornication and drinking alcohol, since fornication and drinking alcohol is a sin between you and Allah. If you repent from them, Allah will accept your repentance. Yet backbiting is not forgiven unless the one backbitten forgives you.”</em> (<strong><em>al-Jam’i Shu’bal Iman</em></strong> (9/98 no.6314).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Bayhaqi says, <em>“This is what Sufyan bin Uyaynah said (i.e. it his statement). It has also been reported with a weak chain from the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasalam and with another mursal chain.”</em> (<strong><em>al-Jam’i Shu’bal Iman</em></strong> (9/98).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The muhaqqiq Dr. Abdul Ali Abdul Hameed Hamid under this report said, <em>“Its chain, the narrators are trustworthy except the Shaikh of the author as I was unable to ascertain his trustworthiness. Sufyan is Ibn Uyaynah, I was unable to find this report (elsewhere)”</em> (<strong><em>al-Jam’i Shu’bal Iman</em></strong> (9/98 under hadith and footnote no.6314).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The checking or verification of <strong><em>Shu’bal Iman</em></strong> was first published several decades ago, and information was not widely available hence ascertaining the trustworthiness of the Shaikh of Imam al-Bayhaqi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Tahir al-Faqih is the Shaikh of Imam al-Bayhaqi in this report and his biographical entries are found in numerous books. His name is Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Mahmish.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Abdul Qadir al-Junayd said, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>This is the best report I have seen in this matter. Ishaq is confined by the evidence that have preceded (which prohibit backbiting). He is indeed a man who is wrong and correct at times and his statements or opinions are not hujjah, rather he requires evidence for them to be accepted. It might also be the case he might have had other reasons, explanations or possibilities (for this statement).”</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] This is the statement of Imam Ishaq bin Rahaywah. Although this statement is quoted in <strong><em>Kitab as-Sunnah</em></strong> of Harb bin Ismail al-Kirmani (d.280), it is not actually from it. The compiler, Adil Al Hamdan added additional chapters as addenda from various early books of creed and Masail which were transmitted by Harb but were not directly related to Masail of the Sunnah, namely creed and Manhaj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This addendum starts from (p.291) of <strong><em>Kitab as-Sunnah</em></strong> (Adil Al Hamdan, Dar al-Loloaa, 2019 2<sup>nd</sup> edn) and this report is under the chapter of backbiting the people of innovation. We know the chapter was not from Imam Harb al-Kirmani but Adil Al Hamdan deemed it appropriate to categorise this report (no.660/121) under this chapter based on his understanding of the report.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">He also brings other such reports regarding backbiting the people of innovation. This then being the first answer that this report is more appropriately regarding the oppressive rulers who were innovators and those who believed in the innovated belief of the Quran being created.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Harb al-Kirmani brings this report in his <strong><em>Masail</em></strong> (2/886 no.1415) and the researcher of the book does not make any comment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Let the reader note, did not those who shared this report fail to read the numerous other chapters in this addendum regarding the censure and refutation of the <strong>Khawarij</strong> (p.308+ no.576/37+) and <strong>advising the ruler </strong>(p.307+ no.574/35+) and there are many other topics like this that would put the claimants in comprising situations, like the, <strong>wilayah of a mushrik, marrying open sinners (Fusaq) and the people of desires or praying behind the Qadariyyah and innovators like them</strong> and more importantly, <strong>refuting and censuring desires and innovations and warning against its people and their books</strong> (p.316+ no.596/57+).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So, would the claimants happily based on having this report to show the Salaf differed in speaking ill of the rulers also <strong>take the statements on Abu Hanifah and his people of false opinions</strong> transmitted by Imam Harb al-Kirmani in the same book, refer to (p.276-289 no.529-539), particularly report (no.536) which is also from the same Ishaq!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The inference here is, if you take an isolated or lone view of Imam Ishaq which opposes the view of most of the scholars of the Salaf to show a difference of opinion exists or is validated, then surely you should also accept all the reports that show differences on other Masail and this example from Imam Ishaq himself on the veracity of Abu Hanifah. This is a rhetorical point for consideration and not for the blind followers of Abu Hanifah to show hypersensitivity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Since we know the other reports are weak and the inference of the Salaf allowed backbiting the oppressive ruler is incorrect and wrong. So, we must then assume Imam Ishaq’s statement must be specific to a particular matter. For example, this might apply to a ruler who has an innovated belief like Khalq ul-Quran.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The statement could also refer to when someone lodges a complaint to the Qadhi or he needs to offer testimony in a legal case. Another possibility is, it could be an older statement or view which Harb transmitted. As Shaykh Abdul Qadir al-Junayd, there is scope for a valid explanation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Lastly, it is not from the Manhaj of the Salaf or Ahlus Sunnah to form legal Islamic positions based on isolated or lone reports or views while ignoring the absence of evidence. There must be clear, decisive and authentic texts from the Shari’ah, namely the Quran and Hadith that evidence and validate a legal view. Allahu Ta’la A’lam END]</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>This is the best report I have seen in this matter. Ishaq is confined by the evidence that have preceded (which prohibit backbiting). He is indeed a man who is wrong and correct at times and his statements or opinions are not hujjah, rather he requires evidence for them to be accepted. It might also be the case he might have had other reasons, explanations or possibilities (for this statement).”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>(Athar al-Waridah Fi Jawaz Ghibah al-Hakim al-Ja’ir Ma’a Dirasah Asanidiha wa Alfadhuha wa Bayan Dhu’afuha wal Ijabah Anha Waradal Istidlal Biha</em> p.20)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abdul Qadir bin Muhammad bin Abdur Rahman al-Junaid.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] This is the statement of Imam Ishaq bin Rahaywah. Although this statement is quoted in <strong><em>Kitab as-Sunnah</em></strong> of Harb bin Ismail al-Kirmani (d.280), it is not actually from it. The compiler, Adil Al Hamdan added additional chapters as addenda from various early books of creed and Masail which were transmitted by Harb but were not directly related to Masail of the Sunnah, namely creed and Manhaj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This addendum starts from (p.291) of <strong><em>Kitab as-Sunnah</em></strong> (Adil Al Hamdan, Dar al-Loloaa, 2019 2<sup>nd</sup> edn) and this report is under the chapter of backbiting the people of innovation. We know the chapter was not from Imam Harb al-Kirmani but Adil Al Hamdan deemed it appropriate to categorise this report (no.660/121) under this chapter based on his understanding of the report.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">He also brings other such reports regarding backbiting the people of innovation. This then being the first answer that this report is more appropriately regarding the oppressive rulers who were innovators and those who believed in the innovated belief of the Quran being created.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Harb al-Kirmani brings this report in his <strong><em>Masail</em></strong> (2/886 no.1415) and the researcher of the book does not make any comment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Let the reader note, did not those who shared this report fail to read the numerous other chapters in this addendum regarding the censure and refutation of the <strong>Khawarij</strong> (p.308+ no.576/37+) and <strong>advising the ruler </strong>(p.307+ no.574/35+) and there are many other topics like this that would put the claimants in comprising situations, like the, <strong>wilayah of a mushrik, marrying open sinners (Fusaq) and the people of desires or praying behind the Qadariyyah and innovators like them</strong> and more importantly, <strong>refuting and censuring desires and innovations and warning against its people and their books</strong> (p.316+ no.596/57+).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So, would the claimants happily based on having this report to show the Salaf differed in speaking ill of the rulers also <strong>take the statements on Abu Hanifah and his people of false opinions</strong> transmitted by Imam Harb al-Kirmani in the same book, refer to (p.276-289 no.529-539), particularly report (no.536) which is also from the same Ishaq!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The inference here is, if you take an isolated or lone view of Imam Ishaq which opposes the view of most of the scholars of the Salaf to show a difference of opinion exists or is validated, then surely you should also accept all the reports that show differences on other Masail and this example from Imam Ishaq himself on the veracity of Abu Hanifah. This is a rhetorical point for consideration and not for the blind followers of Abu Hanifah to show hypersensitivity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Since we know the other reports are weak and the inference of the Salaf allowed backbiting the oppressive ruler is incorrect and wrong. So, we must then assume Imam Ishaq’s statement must be specific to a particular matter. For example, this might apply to a ruler who has an innovated belief like Khalq ul-Quran.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The statement could also refer to when someone lodges a complaint to the Qadhi or he needs to offer testimony in a legal case. Another possibility is, it could be an older statement or view which Harb transmitted. As Shaykh Abdul Qadir al-Junayd, there is scope for a valid explanation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Lastly, it is not from the Manhaj of the Salaf or Ahlus Sunnah to form legal Islamic positions based on isolated or lone reports or views while ignoring the absence of evidence. There must be clear, decisive and authentic texts from the Shari’ah, namely the Quran and Hadith that evidence and validate a legal view. Allahu Ta’la A’lam END]</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> What is not intended here is that one does not testify to someone being in Paradise/Hellfire whom the Prophet ﷺ testified for from other than these Ten, rather what is intended is a refutation of the Rafidha who reject the Hadith of the Ten Promised Paradise.</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:] </strong>Many scholars included this issue in their books of creed as it is a hallmark of the People of the Sunnah established from the Mutawatir (mass-transmitted) Ahadith of the Prophet ﷺ &#8211; Shaykh Salih Aal Ash-Shaykh said, &#8220;And this issue, as it is explicit &#8211; the matter of wiping over the Khuffayn (leather socks), is from the issues of Fiqh and not from the issues of Creed. However, it enters into the issues of Creed because Ahlus-Sunnah  differentiate [themselves] from a number of sects by their view on wiping over the Khuffayn, and those that oppose it are the Khawarij &#8211; I mean a group from them &#8211; and the Rafidha, as well as a number of people that oppose this issue in their respective lands that do not ascribe to a sect from the [various] sects.&#8221; <em>(Sharh Al-&#8216;Aqidah At-Tahawiyyah of Shaykh Salih Aal Ash-Shaykh 2/694)</em></p>
