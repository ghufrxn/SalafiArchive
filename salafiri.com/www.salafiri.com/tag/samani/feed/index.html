<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Zakareeyah bin Ghulam Qadir</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Allaah Ta’ala gave proofs in His Noble Book concerning the excellence of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, and following their way, Allaah Ta’ala said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&lt;&lt;And the first to embrace Islaam of the <em>Muhajirun</em> and the <em>Ansar</em> and also those who followed them exactly. Allaah is well pleased with them, as they are well pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.&gt;&gt;   [Tawbah: 100]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From Ibn Mas’ood that the Prophet  said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘The best people are my generation then those who will come after them and then those after them.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, the Companions are the example and they are the ones to follow. It is obligatory upon every Muslim to follow them in what they understood from the evidences of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, because they were the most knowledgeable of the people and they had the most correct understanding of the <em>Sharia’</em> texts out of all the people.  Consequently, if a Muslim takes other than their understanding then he will deviate away from the straight path, since the Companions stood with insight, and they viewed everything with their perceptive knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abu Zayed al-Qayrawani said in his book ‘al-Jaama’ (117):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘Submission to the Sunnan (plural of Sunnah) cannot be opposed with opinion, nor is it repelled with Qiyas (analogy).  As for the interpretation of the Salaf as-Salihthen that is how we interpret, and what they acted upon is which we act upon, what they left off is what we leave.  It is sufficient to adhere to what they adhered to, and that we follow them in that what they clarified.  We take them as an example in what they extracted and viewed from the hadeeth. We do not rebel against the Salaf as-Salih in what they differed or what they interpreted, and everything that we have just mentioned is the stance of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah and the Imams of the people in Fiqh and hadeeth.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As-Sama’ani said in ‘Sown al-Mantiq’ (158):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘Indeed we have been ordered to follow and been encouraged to do so.  And we have been prohibited from innovating and we have been rebuked concerning Bida’. The flag/sign of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah is their following the Salaf as-Salih, and them leaving everything that is innovated and heresy.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The supporter of the <em>Sunnah</em> al-Asbhaani said in his book ‘al-Hujjah Fee Bayaan al-Muhajjah’ (2/437-440):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘Knowledge is not having lots of narrations; rather it is following and using those narrations. It is to take the Companions and the Ta’abieen (the Successors of the Companions) as exemplary, even if it means having a little knowledge.  Whoever opposes the Companions and the Ta’abieen then he is misguided, even if he has a lot of knowledge.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Asbhaani continues:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘And that is to clarify for the people the matter of their Deen, so it is upon us to follow the Companions because indeed the Deen came from Allaah Ta’ala and it did not come from the intellects and opinions of men, but rather the Messenger  clarified the Sunnahfor his Ummah. And he explained it to his Companions.  Therefore, whoever opposed the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  in anything from the Deen then he has become misguided.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Rajab said in the book ‘Fadl Ilm as-Salaf ‘ala Ilm al-Khalaf’ (72):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘The beneficial knowledge from these sciences, are all precisely connected to the texts with the Book and the Sunnah, the understanding of the meaning of these sciences and their restrictions are with what has been narrated from the Companions and the Successors and those who followed them, regarding the meanings of the Qur’aan and the hadeeth.  Likewise, what has been mentioned from them of what they said regarding issues of Halaal and Haraam, as well as Zuhd, softening of the heart and knowledge and other issues.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymeeyah said in ‘Kitab al-Eemaan’ (p.114):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘To understand this principle of al-Eemaan the Murjia’ turned away from the explanation of the Book and the Sunnah, and the statements of the Companions, and the Successors who followed them in goodness. The Murjia’ relied upon their own opinions and they interpreted this principle with their own understanding of Arabic language.  This is the way of the people of Bida’. This is why Imam Ahmad said: ‘The people mainly make mistakes regarding interpretation and analogy.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is why we find the Mu’tazilah[1], Murjia’[2], Rafidah[3] and other than them from the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> explain the Qur’aan with their own intellect, as well as what they interpreted with Arabic language.  This is why you find them not relying upon the Ahadeeth of the Prophet , the Companions, and the <em>Ta’abieen</em> and the Imams of the Muslims.  So the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> do not rely upon the Sunnah, or upon the consensus of the <em>Salaf</em> or their <em>Aathaar</em>, rather they rely upon the intellect and language, and we find that they do not rely upon the books of <em>Tafseer</em> based upon narrations, and upon hadeeth and <em>Aathaar</em> of the <em>Salaf</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Ibn Taymeeyah also said in ‘Majmoo Fatawa’ (10/362):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘So knowledge which has been legislated and the rituals of worship which have been legislated are taken from the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah , as for what came from those after them, then it is not befitting that we take that as a foundation even though they are excused for their mistakes, rather they will be rewarded for theirIjtihad (exertion in deriving a ruling) or due to Taqleed (blind acceptance).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, whoever establishes speech regarding the science of <em>Usool</em> (principles) and its branches upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Athaar</em> narrated from the previous generations then he has achieved the Prophetic way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, whoever establishes his purpose, worship, good deeds and an understanding connected to the principles of righteous actions and its branches of circumstances of the heart and physical actions upon <em>al-Eeman</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em>and the guidance, which Muhammad  and his Companions were upon, then he has achieved the Prophetic way. And this is the way of the Imams of guidance; you find that Imam Ahmad would say when the principles of the Sunnah were mentioned:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘The principles of the Sunnah are adhering to what the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  were upon and the books of <em>Tafseer</em> which have narrations from the Prophet  and the Companions and the successors. This is what is relied upon in its knowledge based principles and its branches………………..’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, regarding <em>Zuhd</em>, <em>Raqaaiq</em> (softening of the heart) and matters of the heart since its knowledge is relied upon the book of <em>Zuhd</em> which has narrations about the Prophets <em>-salawaatAllaah alaihim-</em> from Adam to Muhammad, then upon the way of the Companions and successors and those after them were not mentioned.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">[Taken from ‘Tawdeeh Usool al-Fiqh ‘ala Manhaj Ahl-ul-Hadeeth’ p.41]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Difference Between The Salafi’s and The Ashari’s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Herein lies the difference, the usool of the salafee is that “ we read the ahadeeth so that our intellects, opinions, desires and other than that are to be in conformity with the hadeeth leaving off everything and accepting the hadeeth” whereas the asharee says “we read the hadeeth so that it can be in conformity with our intellects and our madhab and if it does not then we either make taweel of the hadeeth to make it agreeable with our madhab, and if this is not possible then we leave the hadeeth” A great calamity indeed!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Hayaat Sindhee in Iqaz al-Humam (pg.81) whilst he was discussing the methodology of the Hanafee Ahlur  Rai said that they were engrossed in giving precedence to opinion over the text of the prophetic traditions.  This matter would be incomplete if we did not therefore mention here that the above innovated principles and other than it are not something that the modern day Asharees have established but they borrowed this from their forefathers the Hanafee, maturidee Jahmees, that is,  the current day Deobandee and Barelwis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus we find from the classical hanafee books of Usool and jurisprudence such as Talweeh’ pg.17 and ‘Usool Bazdawee’ pg.34, Usool Karkhee pg.12 stating that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“any ayat or hadeeth which is contradiction to our Madhab then we will either make taweel of it and if we cannot make taweel of it to fall within our madhab then we shall leave it”    </em>and,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“any ayah of the quran which is against our madhab then we shall either say it is abrogated or give precedence to our madhab, but it is better that we make taweel of the ayah to make it in accordance with the saying of the madhab”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Icing on the cake is that which has been said by the grandfather of the Barelwis Muftee Ahmed Yar Khan Naeemi (Jaa al Haqq, Chapter on blind following) says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“we accept the Quran and hadeeth if it is accordance with our Imaam and leave it if it contradicts the saying of our Imaam, even if it is an authentic hadeeth. To take the Quran and hadeeth upon its apparent meaning is the root of Kufr”.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So to take the attributes on their apparent meanings as accepted by the Ijmaa of the salaf is Kufr!  So here we see the deep rooted relationship between the Ashaaiarah and Hanafee Madhab, a dangerous cocktail indeed!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, if one looks carefully at the Qur’an one can clearly see that especially in relation to all of the aspects of Islaam and the aqeedah one must have just as much reliance on the Qur’an as one has on the Sunnah and one cannot suffice without the other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So concerning the Ashaa’irah, how is it that they can say that the Qur’an is to be relied upon because the ahadeeth which talk about the Names and Attributes of Allah and which clearly state that the Attributes are to be taken literally are in contradiction with various ayaat of the Qur’an. We say to them have they not read in the Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Do you not ponder over the Qur’an? And if it had been from any other than Allah then in it you would have found much conflict and difficulties.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous tabi’ee and explainer of the Qur’an Imaam Ibn Jareer at-Tabari said concerning this verse of the Qur’an,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“No doubt the revelation which would come to the Prophet of Allah would come in a clear way so that the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam could explain its meanings and tell the people about the obligations from it. Had these orders or had these revelations to the Prophet been from any other than Allah then the orders that were given by the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam in his sunnah would have differed, the meanings would have differed and the whole religion would be in conflict, but this is not the case.”(</em>Tafseer Tabaree vol.5 pg.189)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> So one can clearly see from this that had any of the sunnah been in conflict with the Qur’an then the whole religion would be something which would be unrecognisable and full of conflicts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Shafi’ee Rahimahullah said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It should be known that there is no difference to what Allah has revealed in the Qur’an and the obligations that the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam has told us about from his Sunnah, they have both come in the same manner.” (</em>ar-Risaalah ash-Shafi’ee pg.183)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Allaamah Ibn Hazm Rahimahullah says in his tremendous book ‘al-Ihkaam’:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We have clearly substantiated that there is not a single ayah of the Qur’an which is in opposition to the authentic hadeeth and no authentic hadeeth which is in opposition to any ayah of the Qur’an, there is no separation or conflict. Whoever says that there is a conflict between an authentic hadeeth and an ayah of the Qur’an then his saying is rejected and based upon falsehood.” (1/112)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Qayyim Rahimahullah said in his book A’laam ul-Muwaqqi’een:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“From the principles of the Sharee’ah it is not possible to say that any ayah of the Qur’an differs or has a conflict with a hadeeth of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam or an obligation emanating from it. In fact the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam has forbid people to claim there to be such a distinction, what is upon us is to affirm and accept that which has been revealed, for all of this is proven from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam and the revelation that Allah has sent upon him. Anyone who says other than this is upon clear misguidance and mistaken”. (</em>A&#8217;laam ul Muwaqqi&#8217;een vol.2 pg.38)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning the verse of the Quraan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And those people who have bought faith upon that which the messengers have bought and make no distinctions between them&#8230;.” (</strong>Soorah an-Nisa 4:152)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa&#8217;dee said in his tremendous Tafseer Tayseer al Kareem,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“This verse of the Qur’an clearly shows that Allah </em><em>Subhanahu wata’ala is informing us that which he has told us about concerning himself and those narrations which have been brought by the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam by way of obligations then it is mandatory for us to have belief upon it all!” (</em>Tayseer al-Kareem ar-Rahmaan Fee Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan vol.2 pg.210 with the checking of Muhammad Zuhree an-Najjar)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>In Sooratul Nahl ayah 44 it says,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“With clear signs and Books (We sent the Messengers). And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the reminder and the advice (the Quran), that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought”.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Imaam Shafi’ee said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allah Subhanahu wata’ala in His Book and religion has given the status to the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam which has been mentioned in the Qur’an itself. Therefore it is obligatory upon mankind that they accept the revelation which has been revealed to the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam by way of the Qur’an and that which has also been revealed to him by the way of the hadeeth with which he speaks. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam when he spoke he made no contradictions with the Qur’an and in fact it is just an explanation of that which Allah had already revealed upon him by way of the Qur’an.” (</em>Jaami ul-Ilm pg.118)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore it is clear that there is no hadeeth whether it is concerning the Names of Allah or his Attributes , calling upon Allah alone, worshipping only Allah or any other Ahkaam concerning the Aqeedah or other than it in contradiction to the Qur’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah has said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The sunnah was revealed upon the Prophet just as the Qur’an was also revealed upon him.” (</em>Majmoo’a al-Fataawa of Ibn Taymiyyah vol.13 pg.364)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Shawkaani says whilst explaining the hadeeth ‘I have been given the Quran and something similar to it’:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This means he has been given the Qur’an and similarly the sunnah has also been given to him by way of revelation, and this is revelation {hadeeth} which has not been mentioned in the Qur’an.” (</em>Irshaad Al Fuhul of Shawkaani pg.33)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This clearly shows that it is a fallacy for any deviant sect including those such as the ashaa’irah to claim that ‘where in the Qur’an does it say that the Hand of Allah is to be taken literally or Allah has two Eyes or that Allah has a foot which is to be taken literally having a meaning?’. In essence, the Ashaairah ask the Salafees for evidence of the existence of the principles concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah as upheld by the salaf from within the Qur’an only and this shows that they have left the way of the Ahlul Ilm and the way of the salaf in this matter also. We reply,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah Subhanahu wata’ala says in the Qur’an <strong>An Nisaa 59,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger ), if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination”.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Imaam Shaatibee says </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This ayah clearly shows that there is no conflict in the sharee’ah because Allah Subhanahu wata’ala has told those that are in conflict to refer to the sharee’ah i.e. the Qur’an and the sunnah in order to finish the conflict. So it is clear that conflict will only seize once one can refer to that which can make the conflict end. Thus, if that which is commanded to refer back to {quran and sunnah} were to have in itself conflicts then there is no point in referring to it and those who say this are upon a way which is misguided”. (</em>Al-Muwafaqaat of Shaatibee vol.4 pg.119 and Al-I’tisaam of Shaatibee vol.2 pg.309-310)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a tremendous saying of Imaam Shaatibee and more or less sums up what is to be said. How can the ashaa’irah reject certain ahadeeth because it does not fit in with their minds or they say it opposes the Quran? Not all principles concerning aqeedah are found solely in the Quran but we look also to the hadeeth with the understanding of the salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Qayyim says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If the Book of Allah and the authentic sunnah of the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam did not have the quality of resolving conflicts then Allah Subhanahu wata’ala would not have told people who are in conflict to refer to them both. For verily he would not tell the people to refer to the Book and the sunnah of the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam had there been a conflict between them two in the first place”. (</em>I&#8217;laam ul Muwaqqi&#8217;een vol.1 pg.49)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Asharis for hundreds of years have not understood what the Sahaaba and tabi’een understood thousands of years ago. For example, concerning the conflicts that the people talk about between the authentic hadeeth and the Qur’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Imaam Maymoon bin Mehraan who was born in the year 40A.H. and passed away in the year d.118A.H having met many companions said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“To refer back to Allah Subhanahu wata’ala is to refer to his Book and when the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam was alive then the people would refer to him in person and now that he has passed away then one must refer to his blessed sunnah.” (</em>Tafseer Tabari vol.5 pg.96, Mushkilul Athaar of Tahawi vol.1 pg.484, al-Faqeeyah of Imaam Khateeb al-Baghdadi vol.1 pg.144 with a hasan isnaad.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Shawkaani says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Verily there is a consensus of all of the muslims from the salaf and those after them in the present times from the companions and other than them that in the affairs of the religion where there is a conflict between the sayings of the scholars then it is obligatory for the person to refer back to the Book of Allah and the sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad sallalahu alaihi wasallam and this has been mentioned in the Qur’an in Soorah Nisa ayah 59:</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>‘O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.’</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And this is to refer to Allah Subhanahu wata’ala meaning to refer to His Book and to refer to the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam means to refer to the Sunnah after his death. There is no one that has differed concerning this, from amongst the muslims.”</em> (Sharh as-Sudoor pg.1)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We the Ahlul Hadith have learnt the Quran, Aqadah, Hadith and Fiqh as part of our Islamic responsibility so that we can serve this Deen in a manner that best suites this Ummah. In response to our dedication and efforts the hanafis deobandis of Bury and Dewsbury decided to setup Tablighi organisations against the Salafi Dawah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The efforts of Ahlul Hadith was spreading by Allahs mercy and in the year of 2000-2001, the elder generation of the deobandis felt the need to arrange emergency meetings to discuss ways of creating counter measures in an attempt to curb the Salafi Dawah. Such meetings or conferences were held in India and the UK to address this situation. It is therefore intriguing to contemplate if Mr Yasir is aware of this history but decided to conceal it just like Mohammad Ilyas sahib concealed the true founder of the 6 principles of the deobandi Manhaj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a historical fact that the people of truth are always less in number but their Dawah is very effective and consequently the deobandi contingency become very fearful of this threat. In a desperate and cheap attempt, the Deobandis decided to approach the masses and make false statements against the Salafis, such as <em>“oh the Salafis will drive you away from the taqleed of the imams and the burzugh… how can we allow our children to abandon the Deen of our forefathers of Deoband.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was at this point this these people promoted the term <em>ghair muqalid </em>in reference to Ahlul Hadeeth.  It was light of these crocodile tears that the deobandis had the apparent justification in setting up institutions around the UK.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this one may ponder how the Salafi Dawah is gaining strength if they lack the Madaris as Mr Yasir claims. A further point to note is to ponder how is it that Hanafis are embracing the Salafi Dawah and not the reverse? We can conclude that Mr Yasir is a victim of the inferiority complex, to make statements such as “<em>they hardly have any proper madaris</em>” shows he has no intelligence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a known fact that the Salafis have always propagated their Manhaj with small quantities of people but the large number of deobandi and hanafis from the subcontinent along with their kosher money have led to their institutions. This followed with an influx of migrants from the subcontinent who are mainly hanafi and heobandi who have contributed to the numbers in the UK. This has now become a point of argument by those who lack in concrete proof in defence of the deobandi hanafi sect which is corrupted with Shirk and Bid’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be noted here that the vast majority of these migrants are the laymen and do not possess a concrete understanding of the correct Aqidah and it is very cunning of Mr Yasir in using this to promote a false argument highlighting that the Salafis are weak in number. We should also emphasise that if success is judged by numbers then the Sahaba would have been on the brink of failure during the battle of Badr, but it was because of their correct Aqidah and firm Iman that won the battle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir further states </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“<em>it’s funny how they chant one word salaf when they have no link to the pious salaf as salaf means that came before us.”</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have addressed this comment previously and revisiting this would be unnecessary. It is very ironic that Mr Yasir uses the word chant as this is a term his Sufi Manhaj promotes in their circles of zikr, this is because the deobandis are essentially Naqshabandi who are well known for their methods of worship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It seems Mr Yasir was excluded from these circles of remembrance where they CHANT like individuals intoxicated with harmful substances. In light of this we do not follow the Salaf and if we choose to, then it needs to be substantiated with evidence and this is easy for us. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi as his name suggests claims to be hanafi, therefore please attempt to highlight the current day deobandi belief &amp; practices from the manhaj of Imam Abu Hanifah. This is a challenge which will be met with certain failure. Meanwhile we the Salafis can bring forward our proofs which emphasises that our Manhaj and Aqidah has not been diluted but rather it is a mirror reflection of the Companions, Tabieens and Taba-Tabieens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have previously stated examples such as books of Aqidah i.e creed issues as Mr Yasir phrases it. Furthermore, he has misunderstood the word Salaf in terms of what it denotes, and the meaning that it draws. This is a further example demonstrating the ignorance of Mr Yasir who embarrasses himself by spitting at himself whilst attempting to spit at the sun in the presence of his deobandi devotees.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One may contemplate how an overly enthusiastic deobandi is capable of such diabolical profanities whilst his senior counterparts would seek refuge in such foolish statements. Mr Yasir should realise that the term Salaf cannot be restricted to an era but rather it must align with the principles of the Quran and the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore any individual whose beliefs, madhab and opinions do not conform and agree with the Quran and Sunnah or that they oppose the people of truth will be upon misguidance. A manifestation of this situation can be understood in the case of Ma’bad al-Juhani 70H, the leader of the Qadiriyyah, Ghilan Dimashqi 105H, the head of the Jahmis, Jahm ibn Safwan 128H, Ja’d ibn Dirham 124H and Wasil ibn A’ta 131H, the head of the Mu’tazilah (Refer to Qadiyah Way-Ta’weel).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The aforementioned individuals were from the leaders of the Salaf of Mr Yasir. We urge him to investigate his own Salaf, the likes of Jahm, Wasil to name a few. Mr Yasir is a very confused individual who claims to be an Ashari but in reality he and his sect are Kullabis which is derived from the Jahmi’s. In light of this we cannot consider Mr Yasir a serious student of knowledge from whom knowledge can be taken from (this is for those who belong to his sect).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Safarini has stated that the Salaf must be upon righteousness and truthfulness so that knowledge can be sought from them. Their character must be of good conduct and individuals who strongly oppose the people of innovation. He further states in regards to the Salafis,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“They are labelled or titled with names that are not linked by the people like the Khawarij, Rawafidh, Qadariyyah, Murjiah, Jabariyyah, Jahmiyyah etc”</em> (Lawamah Al Anwar 1/20)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir further states </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Yes they do follow the misguided Salaf”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Only one needs to read the books of rijal and history to understand the Salaf within the deobandis and hanafis. For instance we can study the example of Abu Mute’a al-Balkhi and his beliefs (Refer to Lisan ul-Mizan Vol. 2, Mizan ul-E’tidaal Vol. 1 and Kitab al-Kunna Vol. 2 of ad-Daulabi).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A further example to look at is the E’tizaal and Irja and their respective origins. Al-ikmaal (1/252-253) of ibn Makaula is yet another example to look at wherein it provides information on the individual who pulled the reigns of the horse of the wife of Jahm Ibn Safwan. Much more can be stated about Mr Yasir’s Salaf and therefore he needs to address the matters of his own house before he chooses to attacks others with foolish remarks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir further states </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“By changing your name, the reality doesn’t turn into gold.”</span> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ironically this is the very point Ahlul Hadith have been driving forward. To label oneself as a hanafi does not imply that one is now amongst the hanafi scholars of the classical era who were free of the deviant beliefs as those hanafis of today. The same principle can be applied when choosing to label oneself as an Ashari or Maturidi who also did not share the deviant practices as Mr Yasir, such as seeking aid from the deceased or from the souls of the righteous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It only takes one to study the statements of their respective hanafi deobandi scholar to realise that he has more right to ilm to label himself a hanafi, and claims that he is a muqallid of Imam Abu Hanifah in trivial matters of the deen. Whilst in matters of Manhaj and Aqidah they choose to acknowledge Imam Abul Hasal al-Ashari and Imam Abu Mansur Maturidi (Muhannad Ala Mufannad Page 22).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore we ask Mr Yasir to present his sufi beliefs from these scholars i.e. their elders from whom they take their knowledge from and emulate. In light of this if Mr Yasir is not fully versed with Muhannad Ala Mufannad then this a clear sign of ignorance in his knowledge and a classical example of someone to have some shame and regret.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However if on the other hand My Yasir is completely unware of this book then we would highlight that this book does not fall short in being the ultimate reference guide for the Sufi deobandi forefathers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir should be familiar with the calibre and the number of the deobandi elders who satisfied the beliefs and the fundamental principles of this book. Nonetheless, addressing the original point, labelling oneself a hanafi whilst the heobandi doctrines are derived heavily from the Greeks and Hindus and in addition to having the ideas of Jahm Ibn Safwan, Ja’d Ibn Dirham and Wasil Ibn Alta is a matter that needs to be reflected upon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is intriguing to see that Mr Yasir has the audacity to present himself in front of an audience to critique Ahlul Hadith whilst the state of his own affairs is a disgrace. If he truly believes that he is surely upon truth then we ask him to highlight the concepts of wahdatul wujood, seeking aid from the deceased, seeking aid from the living in a manner that is beyond the capacity of a person, holding the belief that calamities can be alleviated from the creation of Allah and so forth from the works of Imam Abu Mansur Maturidi and Imam Abul Hasan al-Ashari. This is a challenge that he will fail miserably.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the final tirade then it amounts to nothing but an overly excited child with sweets. We eagerly await your response. With regards to the flapping, then we say that once Ahlul Hadith have dealt with Mr Yasir al-Hanafi, he will not be able to crawl back to deoband let alone flapping, that is if he is not disowned by the real academics amongst them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the very deoband which was established in a Hindu city where their respective goddess would be worshipped and venerated. It is also the very deoband which was formed through the donations of Hindus and the British East India Company.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our advice for Mr Yasir before he chooses to undertake his long journey back to Deoband where the goddess of Durga was worshipped i.e. Devi van, Devi gan or Devi Vandan is to equip yourself with pen and paper so that you can actually acquire the knowledge of your forefathers in Devgand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also a JazakAllah Khair to Abu Hashim for his diligence and efforts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Written by the two weak slaves of Allah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise be to Allah lord of the worlds to whom we praise and seek his aid and assistance without any intercessors. May there be abundant salutations upon the noblest messenger, his family, his companions and all those Muslims who follow until the last day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Very recently some proponents and ardently staunch followers of the Hanafi Deobandi Madhab under the guise of the Hanafi Fiqh  have made some slanderous remarks which were based on bigoted ignorance, deliberate opposition of the true reality, state of affairs and malicious misrepresentation of the facts through social media platforms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The perpetrator of these remarks were carried out by neonate, new kids on the block with new found levels of testosterone, namely Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi. Our aim is not to entertain the mind-set of this individual or his scathing remarks as this will lengthen this brief response. Rather we wish to highlight some key points to show the slanderous lies and ignorance of this individual.     </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I also like to request our Sunni brothers to refrain from uploading any youtube videos, creating articles against the likes of the Hanafi and Deobandi sect including their overly exaggerated teachers such as Maulana Qasim Nanautwi, Ashraf Ali Thanvi and Rashid Ahmad Gangohi who are not well versed with this sect and their school of thought. The brothers should understand that attempting a refutation against the aforementioned individuals, the Deobandis and Hanafis will result in a subsequent response from them which may be difficult for those brothers to rebut and thereby causing embarrassment on behalf of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah. It is indeed easy quoting what Ashraf Ali Thanvi said etc but when accusations are levied against us these brothers are no where to be seen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The effects of this scenario will make our brothers look weak and defeated. In summary, it is very simple to upload videos which make criticism of the Deobandi Manhaj by our zealous brothers however any response from the opposition is met with silence. Therefore our brothers should realise their respective limits when dealing with such matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us proceed and analyse the confused statements of Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi. He stated the following…</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>“Salafis” </em><em>Who are very new to this ummah, maybe a hundred years or so, though they take many of their creed issues from Hafiz Ibn Taymiyyah, bin Baz, Uthaymin et al who were nowhere near the salaf</em>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Response: We do not know if we are to laugh at this statement or cry at the Jahala of this individual. Such statements have become so monotonous or repeated that it is deemed as ignorance to even raise such a point. This statement has demonstrated the childish and immature behaviour and pathetic mind-set of this person</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If we are to accept his statement that the Salafis existed for no more than 100 years or so then consider the following.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir died in 1164H (approximately 272 years ago). He wrote in his refutation of the Ashari’s which mentions Allahs Kalam Nafsi (i.e. the incorrect Aqidah),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“(They say) Allah does not speak but they are internal sounds!!! Then you cannot even find the smell of this in the Quran and Sunnah” (Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqaid an-Hadithiyyah (also referred to as Athariyyah pg.21). </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this Mohammad Yasir has either demonstrated his poor mathematical skills or he has shown poor understanding of the Salafis and Ahlul Hadith. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir died in 1164H refuting the Asharis but also the fact that he was a bona fide scholar of the Salafis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be noted critically here that during this period Deoband was not even in existence and therefore we should redirect the statements of Muhammad Yasir on the forefathers of the Deobandi sect which did not exist over 100 years ago until the intervention of the British Empire through the East India Trading company.  (Refer to our treatise, The Deobandis &amp; The British Government. At the following link <a href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-deobandis-the-british-government/">http://www.salafiri.com/the-deobandis-the-british-government/</a>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is clearly apparent from this short analysis that Mr Yasir is having a hard time grasping basic mathematics, books of the Salaf and History. What reliance can we have in his short outburst?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He states</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Salafis”, <em>who are very new to this ummah, maybe a hundred years or so</em>”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">in this case we him to consider the following.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Sam’ani (562H) said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Salafi, they are those who are attributed to the Salaf and following the Madhab of the Salaf, as I HAVE HEARD FROM THEM” (al-Insab 7/723)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Ibn Athir (630H) adds to the statement of Allamah Sam’ani and says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“A group (of people) are well known with this Nisbah (i.e. attribution of being a Salafi)” (al-Ikmal (4/471-470) of Ibn Makaula, al-Tashabha Fir Rijal (1/364) and al-lubab (2/126).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If we accept Mr Yasir’s statement that the Salafi’s are a century old then please explain with your amazing mathematical mind, how Allamah Samani stated he heard from the Salaf that they followed the Madhab of the Salaf during the 6<sup>th</sup> century Hijri? And that Allamah Ibn Athir stated that he saw a group calling themselves Salafi during the 7<sup>th</sup> century Hijri?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not wish to invest too much time educating Mohammad Yasir of the definition of Salafi, however we ask him to refer to his own Ashari Scholar Ibrahim bin Muhammad Baijauri (1277H) in regards to the definition of Salaf (Refer to his Tuhfatul Murid).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known to most people that the Salafi’s are the ones who adhere to the way of the Salaf and their Madhab and it is for this reason that we label ourselves as Salafis. We should emphasise here that being a prerequisite of being a Salafi is NOT to follow Shaikh Bin Baz, Shaikh ibn Uthaymin and Imam Ibn Taymiyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather Allamah Safarini has explained that the later scholars who adopted the way of the companions, Tabieen and Taba Tabieen are known as the Salaf (Lawameh al-Anwar (1120).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taimiyyah (728H) and Hafidh ibn Rajab (795H) have included Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal (241H), Imam Shafi’ee (204H), Ishaq Ibn Rahawaihah (221H) and Imam Abu Ubaid (224H) to be from amongst the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some authorities have stated that the first three generations was the period of the Salaf. This can be confirmed within at-Tahaf Fi Madhab  as-Salaf (pg.117-118), Lawameh al-Anwar (1/20), Dar Tarudh an Aql Wan Naql (1/207 &amp; 7/134) of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Fadhal Ilm as-Salaf Alal Khalaf (p.60) of Hafidh Ibn Rajab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Ajurri superseded them in this and included Imam Ahmad and the scholars of his era from amongst the Salaf (ash-Shariah (p.14)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this, the intelligent reader will acknowledge with certainty that we take our creed issues </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">from Imam Ahmad (241H) from his Usul us-Sunnah and as-Sunnah as narrated by his sons and students</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and the list continues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this, the slanderous accusations highlighting that we take our matters of creed from the likes of Shaikh Bin Baz, Shaikh Ibn al-Uthaymin and Imam Ibn Taymiyyah is a disgraceful and fabricated lie. One would contemplate as to where does Mr Yasir take his issues of creed from?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Does he take them from his Imam Abu Mansur al-Maturidi or the Ashaa’irah? Further to this, one would ask to what extent did the former of these individuals understood their creed with respect to the Salaf. Mr Yasir labels himself as an Ashari but yet he has not been able to substantiate the origins of his Aqidah, whether this be early or late Ashari or the Kullabiyyah. Furthermore, your Deobandi Church forefathers have stated in their respective books such as Maulana Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri, Qari Tayyab and Maulana Yusuf Binnori that they adopt and follow the Aqidah of Abu Hasan al-Ashari and Abu Mansur al-Maturidi however they choose to follow Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahimahullah) in fiqh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is astonishing to see that they abandon the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah in favour of their Deobandi forefathers, we ask you, what is wrong with the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah? Whilst you follow the Aqidah of the Khalaf? Also can you explain which book of the Salaf or their teaching did the Deobandi’s acquire the Sufi tariqah, Chistiyyah or the Naqshbandiyyah from?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is difficult to fathom as to how Mr Yasir chooses to follow a diluted Aqidah and yet have the audacity to claim that the Manhaj of Ahlul Hadith is no more than 100 years old. An intelligent student of knowledge would come to terms with the fallacy and fictitious nature of My Yasir’s baseless statements and his corrupted diluted Madhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> At the very least he could have adopted the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah as cited in Fiqh ul-Akbar or in his Wasiyyah Al-Imam Abu Hanifah. It is clear that Mr Yasir evidently has no shame in labelling himself as a Hanafi whilst he follows the Aqidah of his Deobandi forefathers. So either deny the attribution of these books to Imam Abu Hanifah and the Aqidah contained therein or accept the words of your own Imam, the same Imam you spend your lives defending his fiqh and yet on the other hand you turn a blind eye to his beliefs, this is the most hypocritical manipulation of the worst dimension.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We therefore stress that he should spend some useful time in reading Imam Abu Hanifah’s Aqidah in Wasiyah (p.38) (We would be surprised to say the least if he has even heard of this book) or Imam Abul Hasan al-Ashari’s Al-Ibanah (p.55). In light of these references we would expect Mr Yasir to revert to making claims that Imam Abul Hasan Al-Ashari’s Al-Ibanah has been tampered when he fails to provide an educated response.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further states in his allegations</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“<em>Also the fact that in this country they have hardly any proper madaris, except for a few crash course “Halaqas”</em>”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a further lie, the Salafis and Ahlul Hadith have been teaching in their respective madrassahs for years well before Bury and Dewsbury appeared on the scene. Madrassah’s were and are well established throughout the United Kingdom with names like Madrassah Salafiyyah. We would surely know as we studied in them in the early 80’s and the teaching was regular and consistent from the mid 70’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The level and methods of teaching were evident and widespread where students would deliver lectures and sermons as training in the annual conferences. The evidence is in your face yet due to his vehement bigoted and staunch animosity for the Ahlul Hadith he is so blind to the truth when it is right in front of him and even if it was to slap him in the face, he would still be upon his farcical and slanderous absurdities. The videos are on Youtube, may be when he has time from his repugnancy he might have a look!!! All this when deoband was still in deoband on paper!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also a JazakAllah Khair to Abu Hashim for his diligence and efforts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Written by the two weak slaves of Allah</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Difference Between The Salafi’s and The Ashari’s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So one of the modern Barailwi Sufis Mawlana Hashmi Mian of India says in one of his speeches entitled <em>“ who are the saved sect”</em> (available to see on you tube. Hashmi Mian is one of the so called imams and muftees of the breylwee sect in India and beyond. He has on numerous occasions said in his talks that his aim in life is to “humiliate the wahaabees, ahlul hadeeth. May allah guide him or humiliate him with that which he desires for others. Ameen.) that</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Ahlul Hadeeth say that Allah has a hand so we reply, how can we say Allah has a hand for if we accept that then every hand is naturally connected to an arm, and every arm has a shoulder, and every shoulder has a neck, and every neck has a face, and every face must have a head thus they say Allah is a man!!”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Observe, the fallacy and foolishness of this caller to the gates of hellfire who has no shame in uttering such nonsense about the creator. He uses his intellect {or lack of} and lets his imagination run wild and in doing so leaves the principle of the Ahlul Hadeeth that “<em>we make no tashbeeh, resembelance between any of the attributes of Allah and those of the creation”</em> based upon the verse <strong><em>“there is nothing like unto him, and he is the all hearing and all seeing”</em></strong> (Ash Shura 42:11). This in one of the humiliated ones who left the creed of the Salaf as recorded by the Ahlul Hadeeth as is evident in his speech.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed Hashmi Mian Baralwi did not pluck his principle of precedence to qiyas, analogy and opinion over the text but it is with regret that we say such principles are the corner stone of the Hanafi Usul and Jurisprudence, it is not a coincidence therefore that the bulk of the modern day Ashaa’irah have their roots with the Hanafi madhab, Allah’s aid is sought. For example, the famous Hanafee book of Principles Husaami, a book which is a foundational book read as mandatory in the sub continent as part of the dars Nizami course says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If a narrator of hadeeth is of sound memory, just and upright but not a faqeeh {one who understands fully what he narrates} then if his narrations are in accordance with analogy and intellect  they are taken otherwise the narrator will be left such as the likes of the companions ABU HURAYRAH AND ANAS” </em>(Husami Ma Sharh an-Nami pg.152)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The book regarded as one of the most impressive texts on Hanafi Usul, Nur ul-Anwar also mentions the same as does another fundamental text of Hanafi Usul, namely Usul ash-Shashi. (Refer to Nur al-Anwar pg.181 and Usul ash-Shashi pg15)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Glory be to Allah, how those who have left the Ahlus Sunnah have even gone beyond the bounds and not left in criticising and rejecting ahadeeth from our masters like Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) and Anas (RadhiAllahu Anhu), may Allah be pleased with them saying that they were not faqihs ie jurists as those who understood the benefits of what they narrated. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has been expounded in some detail concerning the Ashaa’irah, and many Scholars of the past before, have raised their pens concerning the Ashaa’irah? Are there not more important matters to discuss like all the various troubles, famines and issues that are occurring in the world today?, Then the answer is simple, verily the knowledge about Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and His Names and Attributes is from the most important of knowledge and through it we get to know our lord and those who oppose this must be opposed and clarity must be made, for the people will never be able to worship Allah the way he ought to be worshipped if they do not even know about their lord and deny and explain away his attributes as mentioned by our prophet Muhammad Salalahu Alayhi Wasalam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, due to the Ashaa’irah having innovated principles, contra to the Sunnah which remains the same whereas bidah continues to evolve and change from time to time, then, the modern day Asharis have continued their attack upon the way of the Salaf by using newly innovated principles, different from many of the Asharis before them in many respects, thus it is of utmost importance to answer the allegation as and when they are made. It is a very important issue and one that extremely relevant today pertaining to the principles of having correct Aqidah as to the names and attributes of Allah.  One can refer to an excellent discussion on the importance of such a topic by referring to the great book of Imam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah entitled ‘Madarij us-Salikin’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another one of the great Imams of the past al-Allamah Abul Muzaffar as-Sam’ani who passed away in the year 489H said as quoted in the tremendous book <em>al-Hujjah fee Bayanil Mahajjah lee Abee Qasim al-Asbahani</em> Rahimahullah said concerning Ahlus Sunnah and who they are and the differences between Ahlus Sunnah and the various sects which have gone away from Ahlus Sunnah that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Know O Reader that one of the main differences between Ahlus Sunnah and the Ahlul Bid’ah is the issue of the intellect (aql). The Ahlul bid’ah have made the basis of understanding this religion based upon their intellects therefore any ayah of the Qur’an or any Hadeeth which goes against the intellects they try to explain it away by way of ta’weel or reject it whereas the Ahlus Sunnah say that the foundation of the deen is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the blessed Prophet Muhammed </em><em>sallalahu alaihi wasallam and it is the intellect which must be in line with that, for verily if the basis of the deen was upon intellect then Allah Subhanahu wata’ala would have had no need to send the revelation or the Prophets and the whole subject of enjoining the good and forbidding the evil through these Prophets would have been left futile and baseless based upon everyone’s own ideas and thoughts. No doubt, it is sufficient to show the fallacy of giving precedence to one’s intellect over the texts established from the Qur’an and the authentic sunnah for one to see that if the basis of the deen was based upon intellect then the believers would have had a choice to leave obeying the ahkaam and obligations set down by Allah and His Messenger up until they did not understand them. However, this is not the case and has never been the case concerning the religion of al-Islaam. So we can see that when we look at many aspects of the religion for example the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and various other issues of aqeedah then one thing that becomes clear is that we cannot understand or explain away or even reject the Names or Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala based upon our intellects for if we did this, then no doubt we would be extremely misguided and the punishment of Allah would be made mandatory for us.” (</em>al-Hujjah fee Bayanil Mahajjah Li Abi Qasim al-Asbahani vol.1 pg.348-349)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Praise be to Allah, we can see here from the salaf another way concerning the methodology that the likes of the ashaa’irah have leading them to split away from Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah and this is by them using their intellects as a basis to misunderstand and distort the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala. And it is the basis of their intellects which has made them become one of the misguided sects away from the Ahlus Sunnah and Ahlul Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reader ought to pay particular attention to the Imam’s words in that the intellect is something which is weak and there is no space for it over and above the textual evidences from the quran and Sunnah generally in the deen and specifically concerning the meaning of the names and attributes of Allah. So we see many of the people using their intellects to say <em>“ How can we accept Allah has a face because the we as humans have faces therefore Allah does not have a face but when he mentions the word face in the book and Sunnah in the Quran it must mean the pleasure and bounty of Allah”</em>. This is exactly the type of intellectual rhetoric that the Salaf have forbid from and it leads to rejecting the attributes of Allah, thus rejecting a part of Tawhid. Allahs aid is sought.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lets look further, al-Imam al-Hafiz Qawam as-Sunnah Abul Qasim Ismail bin Muhammad al-Asbahani Rahimahullah said in al-Hujjah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Some of the scholars have said that the reasons people have split away from the Ahlus Sunnah are based upon seven premises for which the sects have become misguided:</em></span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Their position regarding the essence {dhaat} of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala. </em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Concerning Allah’s Attributes and Names. </em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Concerning the actions of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala. </em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Concerning their position about Iman (belief). </em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Concerning their position on punishment for those who sin. </em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Concerning their belief and position about the Qur’an. </em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Concerning their position about the Kheelafah and Imamate. </em></span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Ahlus Sunnah is the saved sect which opposes the various other sects in these 7 categories and it takes that which has come from the Qur’an and the authentically proven Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam. For verily Allah Subhanahu wata’ala has said in His Qur’an Soorah Shura Ayah 11: “There is none like him and he Sees and Hears everything.” So we can see from this ayah that there is none like unto Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and we only give the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala which he has given for Himself in His Book and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam and the people have a consensus upon this. So any individual who goes against the Names and Attributes of Allah which have been mentioned in the Book and Sunnah then he is misguided. We say, that Allah has free will, He is Alive, He Hears, He Sees, He Speaks, He gives life and death, amongst various other Attributes and He has been with these Attributes from the very beginning, eternally. Even though many sects claim that they are upon this way concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah but in reality they have invented innovations into the deen and have fallen into the trials and tribulations of ta’weel (figurative interpretation of the Ashaa’irah) going and following the mutashaabihah (that which is ambiguous from the shariah) whereas, Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah cling to the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam and the Ijmaa’ of the Salaf us-Saliheen and they do not go outside of this, nor do they try to find a way to make figurative interpretations and ta’weel so that they fall into that which is unclear. The belief which is based upon figurative interpretations against the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the Salaf is an innovation and falls into the saying of the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam, “that which is not from our command, deen is rejected.” </em>(al-Bukhari no.255, Muslim no.1817, al-Hujjah fee Bayanil Mahajjah li Abi Qasim al-Asbahani volume 2 pgs.409-411)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One can clearly see that the likes of Imaam Asbahani who passed away in the year 535A.H. had a clear understanding at that time, that the groups like the Ashaa’irah and the mu’tazilah and other than them who fell into figurative interpretations outside the understating of the Qur’an, Sunnah and Salaf concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah, in reality, left the fold of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah and fell into making Bid’ah (innovation) in Aqidah and for this reason the likes of Imam al-Asbahani and various other Ulama made it clear regarding the distinction between Ahlus Sunnah and Ahlul Bid’ah such as the Ashaa’irah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here we see from the above that another reason for the destruction of the Aqidah and methodologies of the Ashaa’irah is that they fell into that which was ambiguous and left that which was clear from the Book and the Sunnah and the consensus of the blessed Salaf. If one looks at the seven categories it is as clear as the day that almost all sects that left the Ahlus Sunnah have faltered in at least one of the areas, thus leaving the Jama’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Turning to some of the doubts that the Ashaa’irah and other then them raise then from amongst them is that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“if the Attributes are taken, the way the Ahlul Hadith take them, that is literally with a clear meaning as was intended in the Arabic language, without any ta’weel without any tasheebh without any distortions {taghayyur} or ilhaad {rejections} in any of the meanings or acceptance, then this would be in contradiction with the Qur’an because it says in Surah Ash-shuraa ayah 11, “There is nothing like Him” yet various ahadeeth confirm for Allah eyes, the Seeing, the Hearing and the Hands and the Coming and the Foot and so on concerning Allah. Therefore we leave that which has come in the narrations concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala since they are in contradiction with the Qur’an, and the Qur’an would therefore take precedence”. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Of course this principle of theirs as stated above is an innovated principle that has no basis. For the sake of brevity we will keep the answer to this false principle very brief and just mention some of the sayings of the Salaf past and present to show that in the generality of Islam there is absolutely no contradictions between the authentic Ahadith and the Qur’an and there certainly is no contradiction when it comes to the blessed Aqidah concerning the Names and Attributes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">  Baqiyyah bin Waleed Rahimahullah says that he heard Imaam Awzaa’ee Rahimahullah say to him concerning the people who do not take the authentic narrations when in contradiction to their opinions and own analogies, say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whenever you read an authentic narration to a person of bid’ah against his bid’ah then he will see this as something evil.”</em> (Sharf Ashabul Hadeeth of Khateeb Baghdadee who said the chain is authentic.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ajuree Rahimahullah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“That the people who are of knowledge and intellect, whenever they mention an authentic narration from the Messenger of Allah </em><em>sallalahu alaihi wasallam so it is only the ignoramus who will then say that I only accept that which has come in the Qur’an. It will be said to him ‘you are an individual who has an illness and concerning the likes of you the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam has warned us’.”</em> (ash-Shariah pg.49)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Imaam Ash-Shafi’ee Rahimahullah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is no instance in which a Sunnah (hadeeth of the Messenger of Allah </em><em>sallalahu alaihi wasallam) will be in contradiction to the Book of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala” (</em>ar-Risaalah of ash-Shafi’ee pg.546)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muhaqqiq Imaam Shaatibee said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Contradiction is generally of two types, one is an actual contradiction and one is the one that the scholar perceives to be a contradiction. As for the actual and true contradiction then this is impossible between the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam.” (</em>al-Muwafaqaat vol.4 pg.294)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So how about the ignorant Ashari of today or past who would say that he does not take Allah Subhanahu wata’ala having Hands or Allah Subhanahu wata’ala having Eyes as established from the authentic ahadith because this is in contradiction with Sooratul Ikhlaas where it says that, there is none like Allah or that Allah Subhanahu wata’ala has no example?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> So in using his aql over the texts of the hadith and in thinking that when the salaf say “Hand of Allah” it means hand like the hand of any of the creation or it means the bounty of Allah he began first by rejecting the hadith and this then lead him to inevitably reject numerous ayaat of the Qur’an which mention Allah’s hand. Therefore, it is clear that those that twist the meaning of an authentic narration so that they can make it fit with their intellects and make it conform to their madhabs have chosen a calamitous path and it is these people that the Salaf warned about.</span></p>
