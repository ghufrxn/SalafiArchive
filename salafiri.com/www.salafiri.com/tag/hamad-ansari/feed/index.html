<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">by</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq al-Athari</span></strong></h3>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This Article discusses</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The idea of compiling hanafi books of Hadith to support the Madhab</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Did Mawlana Anwar Shah co-author <em>Athar al-sunan</em> &amp; Shaikh Abdur Rashid Rebuttal of this Claim</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The oppression of Mawlana Zafar against Mawlana Sanbhali for opposing the hanafi Madhab</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Mawlana Ashraf Ali Thanwi on the bigoted stauch fanatical muqallidin</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaykh Mahmud Hasan on Mawlana Ashraf Thanwi and his incompetence </strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The View of Scholars regarding <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan</em></strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">__________________________________________________</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Jawameh, Masanid, Sunan and Ajza and others are from amongst the treasures of Hadith for the Muslim Ummah collectively,  as well as having fundamental roles in that all of the scholars have adhered to them in every era. They have benefited from them with regards to their understanding and comprehension. However It is also a known fact that some of our hanafi scholars have been overwhelmed with the constant reminder and thought that such books contain less narration in support of their madhab. Thus, they attempted to compile and collate ahadith in support of their madhab in order to alleviate this problem to such an extent that they wrote books such as <em><strong>Sahih Bihari</strong></em> instead of Sahih Bukhari and <em><strong>Hanafi Bulugh al-Maram</strong></em> instead if Bulugh al-Maram.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the Indian subcontinent the first person was most probably Maulana Shaikh Abdul Haq Muhaddith Dehlavi who authored <em>Fath al-manan fi ta&#8217;id madhab an-nu&#8217;man</em> based on the methodology of <em>Mishkat</em> of Chapters of Fiqh under which he collated ahadith. Wherein he criticised the opinion and positions of the other jurists and gave precedence to the opinion of Imam Abu Hanifah with great fervour and effort.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad bin Ali Zahir Ahsan &#8216;Shawq&#8217; Nimawi A&#8217;zimabadi also attempted to fulfil this vacuole and thus authored <em>Athar as-sunan</em> and explanatory notes to it titled as <em>at-Ta&#8217;liq al-hasan,</em> which he mentioned himself in his book <em>Radd al-sakin</em> which was printed in 1312H from Qaumi Press in Lucknow. It contained an advertisement and an announcement as follows, in great fervour and effort.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;<em>It is known that Mishkat and Bulugh al-Maram are first taught in the subject of Hadith and their respective authors belonged to the Shafi&#8217;i madhab. Most of the Hadith they contain are in support of the Shafi&#8217;i madhab and contradict the hanafi madhab. This leads to the teachers becoming ghayr muqallid and most of the students become very disheartened with the hanafi madhab after reading these books of Hadith. When the time comes for the six books of Hadith their minds become even more changed. The hanafi scholars have not authored any such book as a teaching primer which contains ahadith from the various books of Hadith which support the hanafi madhab, so these poor student have nothing to study as a primer (from the perspective of the hanafi madhab) and thus why should their beliefs remain as they are and why should they not become Ghayr muqallid under the current circumstances. These are some of the reason and thoughts why this poor servant authored a book of Hadith called Athar as-Sunan. The intent is to collate and compile the ahadith from the well established books of Hadith as well as from rare books in the Arab and non Arab world and then cite their respective chains in the marginal footnotes.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Trans Note: Shaykh Abdur Rashid Fawqani, the son of Shaykh Nimawi has also cited the statement above in his <em>al-Qawl al-hasan</em> (p.14)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Nimawi has cited such adverts in some of his other works with regards to <em>Athar as-sunan</em>. He completed it up to the book of prayer in 1313H. [Trans Note: Shaikh Abdur Rashid Fawqani in his <em>al-Qawl al-hasan</em> has referenced most places and books where Shaykh Nimawi talks about his <em>Athar al-sunan, </em>End of Trans Note]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Trans Note: Shaykh Abd al-Fattah Abu Guddah has confirmed this reason as well as mentioning some other divergent points, he obviously defends the view of the hanafi madhab being hadith and report orientated but the reality is far from this, as it will come clear from the writings, He, Shaykh Abd al-Fattah Abu Guddah says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The reason for compiling this immense beneficial book is what occurred in the course of this century when a group of people in some cities of India arose, before the partition of Pakistan, calling themselves “Ahl al-Hadith,” claiming that the school of the Hanafi masters, which is the school of the majority of Muslims in those large and expansive lands, conflicts with the Prophetic hadiths in many issues, just as they claimed also that the Hanafi masters prefer analogy over the noble hadith, and just as they denied also taqlid of the four Imams (Allah be pleased with them) that are followed, and they lengthened their tongues with respect to Hanafi jurisprudence and more specifically with respect to the jurist of this nation Imam Abu Hanifah.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Outstanding scholars from those Indian lands arose to challenge these deviant beliefs and they falsified these claims through many well-researched hadith-related works. They explained in these (works) the reliance of the Hanafi masters in their jurisprudence and their school on the noble hadiths, and that they prefer the noble hadith and even weak hadith over analogy, and that analogy with its conditions is from the proofs which must be acted upon, and in drawing evidence from the Sunnah and relying upon it, the Hanafis are not less than other than them from the Imams, if not stronger than other than them in relying on hadith and narration.&#8221;</em> Translation taken from (Link Below) from I&#8217;la al-sunan 1:4) End of Trans Note]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq continued and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It must be duly noted that Mawlana Muhammad Anwar Shah Kashmiri wrote in <em>Nayl al-farqadayn</em> that he helped and co-authored <em>Athar as-sunan</em>. Allamah Nimawi&#8217;s son, Mawlana Abdur Rashid Fawqani wrote with regards to what Allamah Anwar Shah Kashmiri wrote in <em>Nayl al-farqadayn</em> that he co-authored the book with him when he said, <em>&#8220;I assisted/aided (him to write it) with him.&#8221;</em>  In that, while Allamah Nimawi was writing <em>Athar as-Sunan</em>, he would send part by part to me and thus in this regard I was the co-author.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Trans Note: One can see the words of Shaykh Anwar Shah Kashmiri from the scan below from the <em>Nayl al-farqadayn</em> (p.56)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Nayl al-farqadayn</em> (p.56)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The claim of Mawlana Anwar Shah co-authoring <em>Athar al-sunan</em> has been reproduced by the Deobandi&#8217;s and affirmed by Shaykh Abd al-Fattah Abu Guddah by him reproducing the words of Shaykh Binnouri in his <em>Tarajim sittah min fuqaha al-alam al-islami, he says</em></span></p>
<div style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Mawlana Muhammad Zahir Ahsan al-Nimawi (d. 1322/1904), Allah have mercy on him, the famous hadith-scholar, author of Athar al-Sunan, would seek assistance from Shaykh (Anwar Shah al-Kashmiri) with regards to the ambiguities of hadith, by correspondence through letter-writing. He would seek help from him while writing his book Athar al-Sunan and he would present to him what he had written piece by piece. This is what I heard from the revered Shaykh (himself), Allah have mercy on him. He said in his book Nayl al-Firqadayn: “The deceased Shaykh (al-Nimawi) while writing that book would send it to me piece by piece, until I became an aide therein; and I added many things to it after him.” The Shaykh, Allah have mercy on him, at that time was a youth whose reputation was not (yet) manifest to the people while the hadith-scholar al-Nimawi was an experienced scholar, and in spite of this, this was his (manner of) interacting (with ‘Allamah Kashmiri), and this shows his intellectual humbleness and his estimation of men. Allah raise both their statuses. (Tarajim Sittah min Fuqaha al-‘Alam al-Islami, p. 29)</em></span></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Taken from the translation of Muzammil Husayn from <span style="color: #000080;"><strong><a style="color: #000080;" href="https://friendsofdeoband.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/taqriz-of-ila-al-sunan-by-shaykh-abd-al-fattah/">HERE</a></strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmad has also reproduced this on this website See <span style="color: #000080;"><strong><a style="color: #000080;" href="http://www.darultahqiq.com/al-qawl-al-hasan-defence-atharus-sunan-shaykh-al-nimawi-2/">HERE</a></strong></span> and presents the same assertion as claimed by Shaykh Abd al-Fattah Abu Guddah, Mawlana Binnouri and Shaikh Anwar Shah himself in his <em>Nayl al-farqadayn</em>, all of which have been cited above. The irony and the sad state of affairs is that on the very same page (link above) Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmad talks about the <em>Qawl al-hasan</em> and this alleged triumph, he perhaps actually forgot to look at the contents of <em>al-Qawl al-hasan</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">http://www.darultahqiq.com/al-qawl-al-hasan-defence-atharus-sunan-shaykh-al-nimawi-2/</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmad shares a digitised edition  (link above) of  Shaykh Abdur Rashid Fawqani&#8217;s <em>al-Qawl al-hasan</em> in which he answers, clarifies and rebuts the claim of Shaykh Anwar Shah Kashmiri regarding his assistance in co-authoring <em>Athar al-sunan</em>, Shaikh Abdur Rashid also cites reasons and gives examples as to why this is an incorrect notion. It is embarrassing to reproduce assertions and then the very same book you share rebuts and refutes the very same claims you present! I am sharing two scans here which show the refutation and rebuttal of the claim of Mawlana Answar Shah Kashmiri, while the avid reader can refer to the link above to download the complete book</span></p>

<em><span style="color: #ff0000;"> al-Qawl al-hasan (p.23)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">End of Trans Note]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq continues,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdur Rashid Fawqani said this is incorrect because when the book was written i.e. the period it was written in, Allamah Kashmiri was still a student as he graduated in 1312H from seeking knowledge of the various sciences. It is however possible that some parts of <em>Athar as-sunan</em> may have been sent to Allamah Kashmiri after it was completed, where he offered his advice and suggestions. (al-Qawl al-hasan p.19.24)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also interesting to note here, that one of the foremost students of Allamah Kashmiri, Mawlana Muhammad Anwari of La&#8217;ilpur expressed his sorrowful anger at the clarification of this reality by Mawlana Abdur Rashid and wrote in one of his letters, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;You did not even control yourself from expressing derogatory remarks about your illustrious venerated father in his praise and nor did you reflect upon &#8216;do not speak ill of the dead except with their goodness.&#8217; You advocated and took full charge against Shah Kashmiri which will not result in anything except pleasing the opponents.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This letter is 2 pages which Mawlana Abdur Rashid answered it in 6 pages, in which he further clarified his stance and position with more clarifications and evidences, that during the time <em>Athar as-sunan</em> was authored, Allamah Kashmiri was a student. However when he (Anwar Shah) was appointed as a teacher in Delhi, he (Mawlana Nimawi) might have sent his research to him after 1313H and sought his opinion in draft form. We found this letter and the response to the earlier letter which Mawlana Abdur Rashid penned himself in an edition of <em>al-Qawl al-hasan</em>. We thought it was appropriate to correct and clear the misunderstanding that was suggested in the passage of <em>Nayl al-farqadayn</em> and hence the reason to mention this here.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was also for this reason (i.e. a book of hadith supporting the hanafi madhab) that Mawlana Ashraf Ali Thanvi authored <em>&#8216;Ihya as-sunan&#8217;</em> but it&#8217;s manuscript was wasted/lost before it even went to print. It is most probable that Mawlana Thanvi realised the need for such a book due to <em>Athar as-sunan</em>. It is mentioned in the letter of Mawlana Abdur Rashid Fawqani which we cited earlier, that he said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Mawlana Muhammad Sahul of Bhagalpur who was the Principle of Madrassah Shams al-Huda in Patna, Aziamabad, mentioned to directly to me, &#8220;We were sitting in a gathering of Shaikh ul-Hindh Mawlana Mahmud Hasan in Deoband when someone said that Mawlana Ashraf Ali Thanvi is writing a book in the same way that Athar as-Sunan was written. When Shaikh ul-Hindh heard this he said &#8220;Mawlana Ashraf Ali is also my student but he cannot write (a book) like Athar as-Sunan.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this was the opinion and thought of the respected teacher about his foremost student and thus we are not in a position to add anything further to this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After a period of time when Mawlana Thanvi thought about this idea again, he authored <em>&#8216;Jam&#8217;e al-athar&#8217;</em> which was a compilation of narrations supporting his Hanafi Madhab, however this could not progress beyond the chapters of Salah and so only this was published. Thereafter he authored <em>&#8216;Tab&#8217;e al-athar&#8217;</em> which was essentially explanatory notes to his <em>&#8216;Jam&#8217;e al-athar,&#8217;</em> in which he attempted to reconcile and clarify mutually contradictory ahadith according to his capability, both books were published in approximately 1315H from Matba&#8217;a Qasimi in Deoband.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then in approximately 1331H he realised both books were very small and brief and were only up to the discussion of the Chapter of Salah, thus the need to have a book on the compilation of Ahadith in Fiqh in support of the hanafi madhab on all of the various differences and discussions. He thought such a book should be precise, concise, explanatory and comprehensive with regards to the narrations and their understanding contained therein. He also thought he would not be able to complete such a task alone by himself and thus passed this mammoth task on to Mawlana Ahmad Hasan Sanbhali.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As Mawlana Ahmad Hasan progressed with this task, Mawlana Thanvi would also progressively review and revise the work and if he felt the need to change anything he corrected it. So this method continued up to the book of Hajj and the book was called <em>&#8216;Ihya as-sunan.&#8217;</em> Later, when Mawlana Sanbhali reviewed and revised the book he altered a lot of things to the extent that he even changed the corrections of Mawlana Thanvi so much so that the original and initial criteria and methodology of writing the book changed. (Ie compiling hadith supporting the hanafi madhab and reconciling the hadith with the madhab) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the first volume was printed Mawlana Thanvi stopped any further publishing of the book due to the numerous gross errors and mistakes because the original guideline and methodological reason the book was being authored were not upheld. So he then passed the task on to Mawlana Zafar Ahmad Uthmani Thanvi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first thing Mawlana Zafar Ahmad Uthmani Thanvi did was to write and publish a clarifying supplement on the first volume published by Mawlana Sanbhali and his gross errors which was called, <em>&#8216;al-Istadrak al-hasan a&#8217;la ihya as-sunan.&#8217; </em>Thereafter, Mawlana Uthmani took on the task from the beginning until the end when he finally completed the book, which was published by Idarah al-Quran al-Ulum al-Islamiyyah Karachi with the name of <em>I&#8217;la as-Sunan</em> in 16 volumes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It must be noted sometimes when Mawlana Uthmani says in <em>I&#8217;la al-Sunan</em> <em>&#8220;Some people say (Qala Ba&#8217;dun Nas)&#8221;</em> he mentions the position of Mawlana Ahmad Hasan Sanbhali from <em>&#8216;Ihya as-Sunan&#8217;</em> and refutes it with great vigour and rancour. In fact in the introduction of the second edition of <em>&#8216;Ihya as-Sunan&#8217;</em> Mawlana Thanvi writes about the methodology and position of Mawlana Sanbhali that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;To the extent that he altered the book from its initial methodology and changed its original purpose and intent.&#8221;</em> (Muqaddimah I&#8217;la al-sunan pg.25)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning, the original manhaj or methodology of the book was the defence of the hanafi madhab but Mawlana Sanbhali continued to support and conform to the position of the muhadithin (ie scholars of hadith) and changed the original and main purpose of the book. It is such audacities of Mawlana Sanbhali that Mawlana Uthmani had to write in one instance, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;May Allah destroy him&#8221;</em> (I&#8217;la al-sunan 7:94)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Sanbhali said concerning the report <em>&#8220;There is no Jumu&#8217;ah or tashriq except in urban cities/towns&#8221; (TN transmitted in Musannaf Ibn Shaybah, Nasb al-Rayah, Fath al-Bari) that</em> Abu Ishaq Sabi&#8217;i narrated it and he became forgetful, to which Mawlana Uthmani replied, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Oh to wonder what a waste of literacy, did you weaken the Hadith just because of Abi Ishaq al-Sabi&#8217;i?&#8221;</em> (I&#8217;la al-sunan 1:1)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather he writes in the introduction to <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan,</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When I say &#8216;some people said in their &#8216;Ihya&#8217; or If I only say &#8216;some people say&#8217; then I intend by this the author of &#8216;Ihya al-sunan&#8217; ie Al-Sanbhali, in this book of his he has brought some intricate allegations on the hanafi&#8217;s and some of the salaf based on hatred, enmity, ignorance and gross errors and thus I have answered them.&#8221;</em> (Qawaid ulum al-hadith p.472)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning that Sanbhali rebelled against the hanafi madhab and thus Uthmani, had to quite frankly answer him in a hostile way. Such instances will be highlighted as we move through this treatise, inshaAllah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Zahid Kawthari writes about &#8216;<em>I&#8217;la al-sunan,&#8217;</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I tremble at (the phenomenon) of this compilation and the organisation (of this book)&#8221;</em> (In the commendation of I&#8217;la al-sunan p.5).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Trans Note: This is what Shaykh Abd al-Fattah al-Guddah cites from Zahid al-Kawthari in his muqaddimah to the <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To such an extent that Mawlana Ashraf Ali Thanwi said this is such a great achievement that has come from the saintly Imdadiyyah Thana Bhavan and one cannot find any other examples like it from other institutes in India. This achievement is the collation and compilation of ahadith which support and conform to the madhab of Imam Azam Abu Hanifah. (Introduction to Qawaid ulum al-hadith p.11)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said that if only &#8216;<em>I&#8217;la al-sunan&#8217;</em> had been compiled and produced from the Saintly Imdadiyyah Thana Bhavan, then this alone was sufficient for its virtue and to karamah (ie miracle) (introduction to Qawaid ulum al-hadith p.12).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have scrutinised this book in the following pages and have concentrated on the principles and rules used by Mawlana Uthmani to authenticate and weaken ahadith. We will look at how the Mawlana uses these principles and also the times he remains silent on narrations from &#8216;<em>Kunz al-a&#8217;mal&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;Jama al-fawaid&#8217;</em>. How he grades narrations in <em>Musnad Imam Ahmad</em> as acceptable when the narrators have been declared to be weak and abandoned by most of the scholars of praise and criticism. How at times he renders a narrator to be contentious on account of the words of a single scholar of Hadith and how such a narrators Hadith is hasan. How at times it is said, tadlis and Irsal of narrators of the first three generations are unproblematic and harmful according to the hanafi&#8217;s and then when their narrations oppose the hanafi madhab, their tadlis becomes problematic and renders their report to be weak! To the extent that if narrations of outright liars and fabricators supports the view of the hanafi madhab, there is an overwhelming level of defence of them and the benefits of why the narrations have been cited!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They have adopted such means and measures of making tawil of the authentic ahadith that it makes one remember the letter Mawlana Thanwi wrote to Mawlana Gangohi wherein he said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Most of the common Muqallidin are so bigoted and staunch that if they come across an Ayah or Hadith contrary to the view of their Mujtahid it does not settle in their hearts and rather they develop feeling of rejecting it in their hearts. Then they turn to tawil, however far fetched it may seem even if the other evidences are far stronger and even if the evidence of the Mujtahid in this issue is not beyond the realms of Qiyas. These people will not necessarily have the urge in their hearts to make tawil but in order to champion and promote the superiority of their madhab, they believe making tawil is obligatory and they cannot accept from their hearts to reject the statement of the Mujtahid for the authentic clear Hadith.&#8221;</em> (Tazkirrah al-rashid 1:131)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All the way from Imam Razi to Shaykh Shah Ismail Shahid (InShaAllah), all the scholars have taken the Muqallidin to task and shared their experiences and thoughts about them, which we will gloss over due to its extent. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You will see InshaAllah, in making tawil of authentic Hadith even the companions were not spared. The narrations Umm Sharik Ansariyyah RadiAllahu Anha, the famous female companion were totally abandoned and rejected by declaring her to be unknown! The narrations of Ai&#8217;shah RadiAllahu Anha were overlooked by declaring her to be woman folk! The Hadith of Abdullah ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhuma and Ibn Zubair RadiAllahu Anhu were sidelined by saying they were younger companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the details concerning this are to follow InShaAllah at their respective place. Other people of knowledge have shared their views and thoughts about such oversight dismissive injustice in <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan</em>. Hence the learned author of &#8216;<em>Ruwat al-hadith allazina sakatu alayhim, aimah al-jarh wat tadil bayna al-tawthiq wal tajhil&#8217;</em> Shaykh Adab Mahmud Al-Hamsh said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This book (ie I&#8217;la al-sunan) has been printed in 21 volumes with 3 introductions and it has with it severe errors and shameless accusations&#8221;</em> (See the footnote of Ruwat al-hadith p.27)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise the Muhaddith of Madinah, Shaykh Hamad al-Ansari said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;As for the book (I&#8217;la al-sunan) it is riddled with fabricated narrations and the evidences used are overwhelmed with narrations which are weak and fabricated.&#8221;</em> (Al-majmua fi tarjamah al-allamah al-muhaddith al-ansari 2:726)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This highlights the reality of this book. One must also remember most of the principles and rules applied in <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan</em> are found in its introduction which has been printed separately and it&#8217;s known as <em>Inha al-sakan</em>, which was later republished with the verification of Shaykh Abu Guddah as <em>Qawaid ulum al-hadith</em>. Shaikh al-Arab wal-Ajam Sayyid Badi al-Din al-Rashidi wrote an academic answer and scrutinised this book which is called<em> Innama Al-Zakan</em>, which was later researched and revised by Shaykh Salah al-Din Maqbul as <em>Naqd qawaid ulum al-hadith</em>. Shaykh Salah al-Din Maqbul quite rightly said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is Qawaid and principles of the hanafi principles but to call it Qawaid ulum al-hadith is somewhat far fetched, it should not be called Qawaid ulum al-hadith but rather it should be called Mahazil (a depravity on) ulum al-hadith.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My Shaikh and Ustadh al-Hafiz al-Muhaddith Muhammad Ghondalwi also refuted and highlighted the mistakes in <em>Inha al-sakan</em> in its marginalia and this edition was with Shaikh Fathi Makki. I had also copied the whole of <em>Innama al-zakan</em> to benefit from it along with the intention of publishing it just like I published (Shaykh Badi al-Din) <em>Jala al-Aynayn</em> (<em>bi takhrij riwayat al-bukhari juz raf al-yadain</em>) however Shaykh Salah al-Din Maqbul preceded me in this noble task. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this critique we have also benefited from <em>Naqḍ Qawaid fi ulum al-hadith</em> and our subject is the methodology used and the application of the hanafi principles and rules in dealing with Hadith and narrators. This critique is based on the first 8 volumes of of <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan</em> and if Allah gives us guidance and blessings we shall analyse the remaining volumes. With the will of Allah most of the principles and rules used by Mawlana Uthmani in <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan</em> have been generically mentioned in this book which highlight and elucidate his methodology and therefore one can surmise from this the affair of the rest of the book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>(I&#8217;la al-sunan fil mizan &#8211; a critical analysis of the well known book on hanafi methodology, p.25-34)</em></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #333399;">10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>[2]</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Shaikh Abdul Haq al-Hashimi</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>1302H-1392H </strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(1884c-1972c)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Numerous scholars have been born and served Islam in spreading its message and Calling to the Tawhid of Allah, however, there were very few who were in of themselves a community or the same affect as a group of scholars. From them was the likes of Shaykh Abu Muhammad Abdul Haq al-Hashimi Muhajir Makki. He was instrumental in helping hundreds of people to guidance with the permission of Allah, he was a formidable scholar, an expert, an orator who continued this blessed dawah for decades. He was a scholar, an orator, Khatib, a teacher and a writer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His dawah efforts are spread over 70 years across the subcontinent and Saudi Arabia, where he would deliver lectures from the most basic of subjects to the most complex of discussions ranging from Hadith science’s through to Rijal discussions. His writings and books alone which number many are in themselves a testimony to the depth and veracity of his knowledge. Allah had indeed gifted him with his dawah and constant, consistent and continuous dawah in the best possible manner. </span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Name and Lineage</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is Shaykh, the Allamah, the Muhaddith, al-Musnad al-Ilmi, the destroyer of Shirk and bid’ah, Abu Muhammad Abdul Haq al-Hashimi, his lineage goes back to Umar bin al-Khattab (RadhiAllahu Anhu) in 42 generations and is as follows,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Muhammad Abdul Haq bin Abdul Wahid bin Muhammad bin Hashim bin Ramadan bin Bilal bin Hibatullah bin Ali bin Isma’il bin Jalal bin al-Shams bin al-Amir bin Ja’far bin Abdur Rahman bin Jalal bin Muhammad Kabir bin al-Amir bin Wasil bin Abul Abbas bin Hashim bin Muhammad al-Kabir bin Abdur Rahman bin Jalal bin Mahmud bin Umar bin Jalal bin al-Amir bin Muhammad bin al-Amir bin Najib bin Umar bin Nasir bin Muhammad bin Abid bin Abi Bakr bin Najib bin Zayd bin Abid bin Abi Muslim bin Abdullah bin Abbas bin Muhammad bin Zayd bin Abdullah bin Umar bin al-Khattab (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) (Aqidah Firqatun Najiyyah p.27)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykhs name of al-Hashimi he took from his great grandfather. The Shaykh Rahimahullah dictated his own biography which his son, Shaykh Abu Turab al-Zahiri penned down in 1382H, therefore at times the biography will change from third person to first person. There have been other biographies too but mostly small and short.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Early Education</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I was born in 1302H (1884ce) in Kotla Shaikhan in the state of Bhawalpur, I grew up with my parent’s love as I was the youngest and my brothers who were born before me passed away and as being the only and youngest child I received all the love of my parents. They raised me very well with excellent cultivation.”</em> (Aqidah Firqatun Najiyyah p.19)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some scholars have mentioned the Shaykh was born in 1301H, which is to be taken lightly as the Shaykh had more knowledge when he was born that a third party. (A’dat al-imam bukhari fi sahih p.9)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti in his biography often cites from the dictated biography of Shaykh Abdul Haq which can be referred. (Dabistan Hadith p.312-320)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I read the Quran to my father, I also studied Persian as well as books on Nahw and Sarf ie grammar and syntax. He later sent me to other cities and towns in order to seek knowledge. I learnt various sciences from experts and specialized teachers, syntax, grammar, meanings, orating, balagha, adab-conduct, language and poetry. I further studied books on Aqidah and Usul al-Fiqh, I also learnt and studied fundamental books on tafsir and fiqh with my teachers. I then directed my main focus and study to the sciences of the Quran and Hadith, thereby began reading and looking into the books of the Imams of Ahl al-Sunnah.”</em> (Aqidah Firqatun Najiyyah p.19-20, Dabistan Hadith p.312)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykhs father, Shaykh Abdul Wahid was a scholar and person of knowledge in his own right, he spread Tawhid and Sunnah in his land. He would work during the day and learn at the same time and then teach the young Abdul Haq. Shaykh Abdul Wahid had a longing for his son to seek knowledge and learn the Islamic sciences. So he sent Shaykh Abdul Haq to other cities of learning, where he would further seek knowledge of the sacred sciences. He travelled to Multan, Batala and Delhi at the request of his father, he also travelled to numerous villages and smaller towns. (A’dat al-imam Bukhari fi sahih p.9)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Aqidah and Manhaj</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was as Salafi as they come, radiant, clear and manifest in his beliefs and the principles of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah which is further evident in his books and his teachings. He says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“My Aqidah is the Aqidah of the Salaf us-Saleh, the same Aqidah of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jam’ah, the Fuqaha and the Muhadithin. My Aqidah is to act on the Quran and Sunnah and to take the apparent ie Zahir meaning without ta’wil or tahrif and my madhab is the madhab of Ashabul Hadith in belief and actions.”</em> (Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.5)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said<em>, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is Allahs blessing upon me that I am from the Ummah of the leader of the children of Adam and then he had further blessings on me that he guided me to the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafiyin in Aqidah and actions.”</em> (Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.18)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He opposed taqlid and loved the pure Sunnah, he warned and abandoned taqlid while have respect for the Imams as he says. (Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.5)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He did not restrict himself to a madhab as he had profound knowledge of the hadith likewise his immense knowledge of hanafi fiqh.”</em> (Majmu’a Tarjamah al-Shaykh Hamad al-Ansari 2:613)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Teachers      </strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh had over 60 teachers and his son, Abu Turab al-Zahiri says his father did not mention more than half of them due to their beliefs and manhaj not being in accordance with the Salaf us-Salah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have many teachers and I would like to mention the ones I sought knowledge from and they are those whose beliefs were in accordance with the Salaf us-Salihin with regards to Tawhid, Iman and in issues of the Sifat of Allah ie the ones who had the correct and sound Aqidah. The very same teachers who who rejected and shunned taqlid and lived their life accordance with following and obeying ie Ittiba of the Quran and Sunnah, they gave me their asanid and ijazat. From them are the likes of</em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Life and Efforts</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already mentioned he would travel to various places to study and gained ijazat from various esteemed scholars. After seeking knowledge, he returned to his village and began teaching. He began expounding the call of Tawhid and Sunnah, he would teach on a daily basis with students following whatever he did during the day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also known about the Shaykh that he faced much oppression, injustice and hardship from his fellow classmates and people of his era. Shaikh Badi al-Din Shah al-Rashidi al-Sindhi mentions they tried to kill the Shaykh many times when his dawah was spreading and the people were accepting it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Later he moved to a place called Mahnad and began teaching the Quran and Hadith and this continued for approximately 2 years, he also taught Bulugh al-Maram. He also taught other books for example Kafiyyah, Muwatta Imam Malik and the al-Fiyyah of Ibn Malik as well as the expounding on the knowledge of hadith. (Mawlana Sultan Mahmud p.36-37, of Shaykh Muhammad Rafiq Athari)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh Thereafter moved to his home area of Kotla Shaikhan and taught the six canonical book of hadith as well as other sciences. He remained in his home town for 3 years and many of his students moved to his home town to benefit from him during the time remained there. (Mawlana Sultan Mahmud p.37)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then moved to Ahmadpur Sharqiyyah upon the request of some people and then began teaching there whilst residing in Katra Ahmad Khan. His efforts produced a large number of people who accepted the call of the Ahl al-Hadith and a community progressed. The Shaykh spent approximately over 25 years giving dawah and calling to Allah and and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). He would teach for 14 -18 hours a day at times without resting. (Dabistan Hadith p.313)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the Khatib and also had weekly lessons on Tafsir and hadith. He was the first person to organize an Ahl al-Hadith conference in Ahmadpur Sharkiyyah. He invited pioneer scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith from the likes of Shaykh Thanullah Amritsari, Shaykh Muhammad Junaghadi, Shaykh Abul Qasim Banarisi, Shaykh Muhammad Ibrahim Siyalkoti as well as other major Ahl al-Hadith scholars of the time. (Dabistan Hadith p.313)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was also in Ahmadpur where the Shaykh expounded the understanding of Bukhari where he would teach it in his unique way, he would expand on the deductions and interpretations of Imam Bukhari. He would elaborate on the fiqh of the hadith as well as talk about the narrators and chains while at times delving into the intricacies of the sciences of hadith. (Mawlana Sultan Mahmud p.37)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abu Turab said when Dar al-Hadith was set up the Shaykh would deliver lessons on the sciences of the Quran and Sunnah, he would go all out and shun the people of desires, innovation and shirk in speaking and writing and many people repented from their disbelief. Many repented from Shirk and sacrificing to the people of the grave. He waged war against the grave worshippers, he had debates with them and Allah gave him victory. He set up learning centres and he approximately produced 100 scholars in Pakistan who were considered the major scholars of today like Shaykh Sultan Mahmud. (Ishyakh wa Maqalat p.12)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1948/1949, King Abd al-Aziz bin Sa’ud requested him to come to Saudi Arabia and teach. It is possible that he travelled to Hajj and upon seeing his extensive knowledge of the Quran and Sunnah, King Abd al-Aziz issued a royal decree allowing him to teach in the Haram al-Makki. (Mawlana Sultan Mahmud p.51)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His son Shaikh Abu Turab mentions</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He went to Makkah for Hajj and he performed Hajj while it was under the control of the Sharif of Makkah and Malik Abdul Aziz ibn Sa’ud. during which he had academic discussions and discourses with some of the major scholars of the Mamlika, who were impressed with the depth of his knowledge. They studied the explanation of Musnad Ahmad from him and sat with him in his lessons in Makkah while benefitting from him and they were inclined to his knowledge and personality. So these scholars sought from the King Abdul Aziz ibn Sa’ud to issue a royal decree for him to teach in Makkah. From those who requested this was the chief justice al-Shaykh Abdullah bin Hasan Al-ash-Shaykh. The King obliged and issued a royal decree for the Shaykh to teach in Haram Makki in 1367H. The Shaykh continued doing this until he died.”</em> (Ishyakh wa Maqalat p.13)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh mentions himself,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allah enabled me to migrate to this peaceful land, Makkah and the righteous man, King Abdul Aziz who asked me to teach Masjid al-Haram, May Allah give him a place in Jannatul Firdaws and make his family the guidance and abaility to propagate the Din and its sciences. Amin.” </em>(Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.17)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti mentions Shaykh Abd al-Haq had enmity for the Sharif of Makkah and when King Abd al-Aziz bin Abdur Rahman al-Sa’ud captured Makkah, Shaykh Abd al-Haq his joy as well as other people of the same understanding and hence they travelled to the Hijaz. (Dabistan Hadith p.316-317)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was a formidable orator and he would travel extensively to the various cities and deliver lectures and sermons. He was softly spoken with clear distinct words which would sit very easily and comfortably with people. He would speak in a simple way for the masses for them to understand the message of Tawhid and Sunnah. In this regard he travelled to Multan, Muzaffargardh, Dera Ghazi Khan, Jampur, Jhang, Shawrkot and Bhawalpur. He also travelled to India where he studied and would later also teach and give dawah via lessons and sermons in Amritsar, Batala and Delhi. He would also participate in the India Ahl al-Hadith conferences. (A’dat imam Bukhari fi sahih p.16, Mawlana Sultan Mahmud p.49)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh goes onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This (ie being issued a royal decree) was due to the intervention of the chief Justice Shaykh Abdullah bin Hasan Al-ash-Shaykh, may Allah have mercy on him and give him a plce in Jannah, and the head of the department of Commanding good in Riyadh, Shaykh Umar bin Hasan. These righteous and virtuous people honoured me and may Allah benefit the Muslims through them. I was also honoured by the Grand Mufti Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (Al-ash-Shaykh), the Chief head of commanding the good of Hijaz Shaykh Abdul Malik bin Ibrahim, my noble brother, the great Ustadh Shaykh Abd al-Aziz bin Baz. All of these people were my salafi brothers who aided the Din, the pure Sunnah and were very close to me in the Din, may Allah reward them with good in this world and in the hearafter.” </em>(Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.17)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh goes onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have been in Makkah for a very long time since 1367H and I teach in Dar ul-Hadith and in Haram of Makkah the 6 books of hadith and Musnad Ahmad and the explanation of the Quran, I seek forgiveness from Allah and I ask him to give me guidance to that which he loves and is happy with.”</em> (Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.17)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had a remarkable memory with an unprecedented ability to recall texts. He had memorized hundreds and thousands of hadith and he would often recite the books of hadith from memory when teaching his students who would have their books opened in front of them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He left Pakistan for Saudi Arabia without amassing any wealth, he only left behind his institute of learning, which his grandsons are running in Pakistan. Even when he went to Saudi Arabia, all of the rulers from Abd al-Aziz Ibn Sa’ud to King Faisal had a lot of respect for him and honoured him for his vast knowledge. He never asked for anything, especially money and led a very simple life and just immersed himself in his books and teachings. He spent all of his life in the area of Misfalah in Makkah in a rented house.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would recite the Quran daily and follow it with reciting a portion of Bukhari in that he would complete both the Quran and the whole of Bukhari in 30 days. Allah had blessed him so much that the Shaykh himself said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If Allah was to give me the life of Nuh Alayhis Salam I would still not be bale to thank Allah for his blessings and bounties that he bestowed upon me.”</em> (Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.18)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would warn and reprimand the Imams of the Haram for opposing or abandoning some of the Sunnahs of the prayer. (Ittihaf Ahl al-Rasukh)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already mentioned that he taught for approximately 70 years in the Subcontinent and Makkah. His Son Shaykh Abu Turab mentions that his father taught hadith for approximately 40 in India/Pakistan and 25 years in the Haram and Dar al-Hadith in Makkah. (Ishyakh wa Maqalat p.13)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong> His Dreams</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh had several dreams which he mentions to his son Abu Turab al-Zahiri. He said whilst he was studying hadith he saw the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) in a dream and the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) passed in front of him, he was wearing white clothes and his face was radiant like the moon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another dream The Shaykh saw the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) was wearing beautiful clothes while he descended from the the sky, he sat on a chair and he hugged the Shaykh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another dream he saw the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) holding a dead persons body and another person who was holding the body from the feet. The Shaykh was also holding the body and he was at the front, the Shaykh says I then begin to fall into water and then sensed from this dream that I will revive the unpractised Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another dream the Shaykh found himself in the Prophets (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) apartment and the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) had a large register. I asked the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) the name of a companion, the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said to me to look in the register and he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) showed me the name.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh also said my mother saw the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) in a dream that he was visiting our house. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) called me while I had a writing paper in my hand and he began dictating and I continued to write. My mother approached us and the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) stood up and I also stood up and then we went to another room and he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) continued to dictate to me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I am not narrating these dreams for anything good or bad but rather that this weak person is expressing the bounty and blessing of Allah upon me.”</em>     </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Haq would also practice calligraphy and script, so much so that he wrote over 37,000 ahadith and 3,000 Quran with his own handwriting, as well as the summary of Sahih al-Bukhari.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykhs son, Shaykh Abdul Wakil al-Hashmi has all of the Shaykhs works, he also has the Shaykhs library and his books. The Shaykh would often write notes and points of benefits in his books especially books of hadith. The Shaykh would write detailed intricate notes pertaining to hadith and its sciences</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>What the Scholars Said About him</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abd al-Aziz al-Zahrani said I heard Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al-ash-Shaykh say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is NO ONE from Ahl al-Sunnah who explains Sahih al-Bukhari like the explanation of Abu Muhammad Abd al-Haq al-Hashimi.”</em> (as mentioned by Shaykh Badr al-Utaibi in the introduction of the Thabt of Shaykh abd al-Haqq al-Kabir)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Wakil al-Hashimi mentions that he heard from the Grand Mufti Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al-ash-Shaykh that he would send my father questions on Gharaib Ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abd al-Rahman bin Yahya al-Mu’allami al-Yamani moved to Makkah around at the same time. He was one of the Shaykhs who wrote about the Musnad al-Sahihayn, he wrote<em>, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Shaykh al-Allamah al-Jalil Abu Muhammad Abd al-Haq bin Abd al-Wahid asked me to stop working on his First volume of his Musnad al-Sahihayn, and it indeed I found it was an impressive compilation between the Sahihayn.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Badi al-Din Shah al-Rashidi al-Sindi said while writing about his book Musnad al-Sahihayn,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It was authored by Shaykh al-Muhaddith al-Fazil, the scholar Abu Muhammad Abd al-Haq al-Hashimi, a teacher in Haram al-Makki, clear to the people is his upholding of the Sunnah.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of Shayh Muhaddith Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, Shaykh Abu Khayr Isma’il as-Salafi and numerous other scholars of Hadith from the Subcontinent have written about his works. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn Baz after reading his book Aqidah Firqatun Najiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have looked at the dictated book of al-Shaykh al-Allamah Nasir al-Sunnah, Qame al-Bidah Abu Muhammad Abd al-Haqq al-Hashimi, I found the aqidah he said was in accordance with Tawhid, Imam and names and attributes of Allah upon the way of the companions and Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamah” </em>(Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.3)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abu Turab said that another time Shaykh Ibn Baz said Shaykh Abd al-Haq was from the people of knowledge the people of our era seek knowledge from.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abu Turab further said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>Shaikh Ibn Baz said that there was a strong bond between him and my father and whenever we would meet he would praise him and invoke Allahs mercy upon him and asking Allah to grant him a high place in Jannah, he would praise my father with great reverence. He would clearly say that he was knowledgeable from the scholars of our time. He introduced his treatise on Aqidah and praised it. When he would attend my father lessons he would be amazed at his explanations. Another time Shaykh Abu Turab mentions once Shaykh Ibn Baz attended the Shaykhs Lessons on Tafsir and Shaykh Ibn Baz asked the people which book is the Shaykh reading from, they said he does not have anything except the mushaf. He was overly amazed and impressed with my fathers knowledge and his preservation or memorization of it.”</em> (Madinah newspaper, 24/2/1420, see also al-Injaz fi tarajmah al-Imam Ibn baz pp.588-589)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Umar Abd al-Hadi, the rector of Dar al-Hadith said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “He was an exemplary scholar with virtuous manners, decorum, uprightness, he loved to spread knowledge and had eagerness to benefit the students until Allah benefitted them. Students with great knowledge and esteem graduated at his hands, he had a great status, with truthfulness in serving knowledge and students, May Allah have mercy upon him and give him a lofty place in Jannah.”  </em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Umar Abdul Jabbar said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Shaykh Abd al-Haq had memorized the six canonical books of hadith and their chains, he knew the issues of differences between the Imams and their evidences, what had precedence over the other, he respected the views of the Scholars and he loved the earlier scholars.”</em> (al-Bilad newspaper 10/11/1379)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Umar Abdul Jabbar wrote a short biography of Shaykh Abd al-Haq in the Bilad newspaper and it is from what Shaykh Abd al-Haqq had dictated to him during his life on the 10<sup>th</sup> Dhul Qa’dah 1379 corresponding to 6<sup>th</sup> May 1960.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Rabi bin Hadi al-Madkhali said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He is the Allamah al-Muhaddith Abu (Muhammad) Abdul Haq..”</em> (Tazkir al-Nabihin p.283, Then Shaykh Rabi cites all of the biography from Aqidah firqatun najiyyah) see. p.283-288)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Students</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh had hundreds of students spread over the world, major scholars in their own right, from some of the well known ones are,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Sultan Mahmud – Shaykh ul-Hadith</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shyakh Thanullah Madani and Shaykh Sultan Mahmud’s son informed me that he taught Sahih al-Bukhari 66 times and it was Shaykh Abd al-Haq who sent Shaykh Sultan to Jalalpur to teach.  Allahu Akbar 66 times it would be uncommon for anyone of to have read Bukhari once let alone having studied it once and where is 66 times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To read more about his biography refer to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/shaikh-ul-hadith-muhaddith-sultan-mahmud-jalalpuri-1416h/">HERE</a></strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the heritage of the Salafi’s and Ahl al-Hadith and the service and efforts of the elder scholars of hadith which is their main hallmark and not the one that is often projected of the sociopolitical representation. They continued and strove in spreading the teaching of the Quran and hadith day and night, just teaching, preaching and giving Dawah of the clear meanings and of the Quran and Hadith and thus any fringe minority view of some of the scholars should not be taken as the mainstream way of the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafi’s, it is except a fringe view due to the possible need at the time. More on this later inshaAllah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Hadith Abd al-Razzaq-The Shaykhs eldest son</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Turab al-Zahiri – The Shaykhs son</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Wakil al-Hashimi, also the Shaykhs son.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Badi al-Din Sindhi Shah al-Rashidi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abd al-Karim</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Yamani-the author of Manahil</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Thanullah Madani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Shaykh Abd al-Haqq al-Hashimi, I studied with him near the Ibrahim gate of Majid al-Haram al-Makki.” </em>(al-Majmu’a fi tarjamah al-shaykh hamad al-ansari (1:455)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdullah bin Abd al-Aziz bin Aqil gained ijazah from him in 1381H-1382H, he said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was a scholar, he would explain Musnad Ahmad, he had weak eyesight and he was unable to see except that he would stand and I do not know how but Allah would return his sight and I surely think I was not confused…. He was Salafi in Aqidah and wed id not find a single word agasint the correct Aqidah” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn Aqil also mentions that</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Shaykh Abd al-Haq compiled Bukhari in Musnad form. He also said I visited him for many years and sat in his lessons on the 6 books in our many travels to Makkah, he was a trustworthy scholar and beyond that and I have not heard anything from him or from other Scholars about him except good.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Thanullah Madani was also his student and studied with him in his house and in he Haram in the Summer months. Shaykh Thanullah said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We would study and learn hadith in general and would concentrate on the 6 books more often and he would sit where (Shaykh) Wasiullah currently sits. He says the Shaykhs style was not common but rather academic, his speech would be clear and easy with overwhelming evidences. He would go into refutations sometimes especially the hanafi’s and one of the differences between Shaykh Abd al-Haqq and the other Shaykhs of the Hijaz was that he would explain an issue completely. He would clarify the fiqh of the hadith without restricting himself to a madhab and would adopt the view closest to the Quran and Sunnah. He would teach Sahih al-Bukhari with his own explanation which was in 14 volumes which he would teach after maghrib. We read many books to him for example Bidayah wan-Nihayah. He served the Din and would debate and discuss with the people of Innovations and Shirk whilst detesting the people of opinion. During Hajj some Hanafis would mention issues from the likes of Ashraf Ali Thanwi and so the Shaykh would vigorously refute them from the Quran and Sunnah”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said about him in his Thabt,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Ustadh al-Fazil, the famous Muhaddith and the author of many books.”</em> (Tazkirrah al-Jahabazah al-Darari p.19)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many of the majors of India and Pakistan would visit him when in Makkah from the likes of great scholars and Imams in their own right like Abdul Rawpari, Shaykh Abdul Jalil Samrudi as mentioned by Shaykh Thanullah Madani and Shaykh Abdul Wakil Hashimi.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Name &amp; Lineage:</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Shaykh Hamad bin Muhammad al-Ansaari al-Khazraji as-Sa’adi – in lineage to Sa’ad bin ‘Ubadah al-Ansaari, the noble Companion <em>–</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh left Africa, – the country of Mali- due to the humiliating colonisation over Africa at that time.  This was the French colonialism which was filthy, unrelenting, and terribly violent. It had eaten up everything whether it was green and alive, or dry and dead. It prevented people from becoming religious and seeking knowledge, it demolished the rights of the people of Islaam, in addition to many other problems, difficulties and types of corruption.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘The Shaykh was born in 1344 A.H. in a town called ‘Tadd Makkah’ in West Africa in the country of Mali.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘The Shaykh said: I was born in 1344 A.H. and that was the year King AbdulAziz took over al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah.  I came to know this while preparing for <em>Hijra</em>, I asked my mother when was I born? She replied: ‘In the year Ahl-ul-Najd<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn4">[4]</a> took over al-Madinah.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘The Shaykh’s father passed away when he was eight years old, so he was orphaned and lived in the shelter of his uncle, his mother’s brothers and his mother. Also those around him from amongst his relatives both on his father’s side and his mother’s side were students of knowledge, scholars, Muftis and judges.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So he grew up in a purely knowledge based environment, in an environment where there were nothing of the modern day conveniences whatsoever, such as electricity, cars and planes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He lived in the most beautiful of surroundings, of greenery, forests, pure fresh water, beautiful breezes and clean air.  I heard him say more than once: ‘Indeed no one would wish to leave it due to all the goodness that was there, which was unlimited supplies of food, drink, in addition to recreation and other things.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘The people at the time of the Shaykh would memorise the Qur’aan using slates and boards.  The Shaykh of the scribes would write one or four <em>Ayaat</em> and the students would go away and memorise them, and then recite them to the teacher, then the teacher would wipe it clean and write other <em>Ayaat</em>for the students, and this is how they would memorise the whole Qur’aan.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘We in my country would share one book between a hundred men, and that was due to the absence of books.  We would divide up one book into sections of papers each person would take a section read it and memorize it.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Hijra From Mali to Saudi Arabia</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘The Shaykh used to tell us that he had a book of poetry that he had to leave behind in Africa, he did not bring it with him when he migrated to this blessed land (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia). This was because he left Africa escaping with only a <em>Mus’haf</em> (Qur’aan) fearing the colonialism of the French and the British.  The colonists would not allow anyone from the people of Africa to leave to go to the <em>Haramain</em>(the two major <em>Masajid</em>).  The Shaykh would tell us, that when he prepared to leave with two of his relatives, they had to leave in the night riding an animal, each one of them had a camel and they left, they spent two years on their journey until they reached the port of Jeddah.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘I heard my father saying: ‘My journey from my country until I reached the <em>Haramain</em> (Makkah &amp; Madina) was an adventure.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I heard my father say: ‘When I exited from Mali, there were only two people with me on the journey, Shaykh ‘Amaar and Shaykh Uheed.  We left from the country in the year 1365 A.H. we would walk during the night and sleep during the day – it took us a complete year for the journey.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Nigeria</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘They passed by many countries like: ‘Niger’, ‘Nigeria’ ‘Sudan’ and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My father <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> met with some of the people knowledge in Nigeria, he met the Shaykh, the reviver, the scholar, as-Salafi, Abdullaah bin al-Mahmood ash-Shareef al-Hussni al-Madani, who spread the <em>Dawat-us-Salafeeyah</em> in the deserts of Mali.  Allaah guided nations of people on his hands away from the misguidance of grave worship, <em>Tawwasul</em><a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn12">[12]</a> with the righteous people, superstitions and<em>Bida’</em> which had become widespread at their time in some of the African deserts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdullaah whom my father <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> met in Nigeria had come over from this blessed country (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – may Allaah Ta’ala protect it &amp; honour it). Shaykh Abdullaah had from a young age spent this life in al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah, and he was the Imam of the Masjid an-Nabaweeyah ash-Shareef, and he was also a teacher there.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘When my father met Shaykh Abdullaah al-Mahmood in Nigeria, he took many benefits and advice from him, the most important being when Shaykh Abdullaah said: ‘O my son, when you reach the land of the <em>Haramain</em>, then adhere to the books of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah and Ibn Qayyim.  And it is upon you to disseminate the ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> of the <em>Salaf</em> and spread their books. It is upon you to teach the people ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> and knowledge.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari continues:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘I heard my father say: ‘I was greatly affected by his advice, and I took that advice and it held a great status in my heart, and I decided to act upon that advice.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Indeed Shaykh Abdullaah bin al-Mahmood al-Madani took permission from king AbdulAziz <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> to travel to Africa for <em>Dawa’</em>, and he gave him permission. When the Shaykh arrived in Africa he opened a school for learning Qur’aan, and <em>Tawheed</em> <em>as-Salafi</em>, we the younger ones benefitted from it, but the elders did not benefit from it.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘The Shaykh gave <em>Dawa’</em> there for thirty years and he died in 1373 A.H.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then my father said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘The reason why Shaykh Abdullaah al-Madani left Madina, was because the people of Madina [at that time].  When the Shaykh would go out to lead the prayer [in the Prophet’s Masjid] he would not allow the shops to be left open, he would not lead the people in the Masjid an-Nabawee until they closed their shops. So the people complained to King AbdulAziz about him, when the complaint reached him, the King AbdulAziz <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>wrote to the Shaykh and said: ‘I am certain that the people of Madina are not truthful, however to prevent chaos I hope that you will resign.’ So the Shaykh resigned and wrote to him and after that he went to Mali.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Sudan</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘My father also met Shaykh Tahir as-Sowakinee in the country of Sudan, and took from him the knowledge of hadeeth and on his hands he became familiar with the books of hadeeth.  Shaykh Tahir was a scholar from the scholars of Sudan in hadeeth and other sciences; he had a great concern for the knowledge of hadeeth. Indeed I heard my father saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Indeed I was affected by Shaykh Tahir as-Sowakinee in the knowledge of hadeeth, he advised me to learn it, and to acquire its books and to follow the <em>Manhaj</em> of its people.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Makkah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘My father met with Shaykh Hamid Faqeeh in Makkah, and was greatly affected by him in more than just his knowledge or spreading the ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> of the Salaf, and his love for the books of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah and his student Ibn Qayyim. Also the books of the Imams of <em>Dawa’</em> beginning from its Imam Muhammad bin AbdulWahab at-Tameemi <em>-Rahimullaah</em>.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘I entered Makkah and I saw the gathering of Hamid Faqeeh.  I saw that he was strong in <em>Salafi</em><em>Tawheed</em>, so I sat there until the <em>Adhan</em> of <em>Isha</em>.  Then when I was alone with him I asked him: ‘O Shaykh how did you learn <em>Tawheed</em>?’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said: your question is excellent.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then he narrated the famous story to me.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh also said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘I met with Shaykh Hamid Faqeeh once and I said to him: <em>Salafiyoon</em> are a rarity in Egypt, and you are a<em>Salafi</em>, so how did <em>Salafeeyah</em> come to you?’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said: ‘I had graduated from the university of Cairo or Azhar, and while I was travelling back to my village carrying my university certificate I passed by a farm and I saw an old Shaykh sitting there and I gave him Salam, so he said to me what is that in your hands?’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I said: ‘A graduation certificate.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Next to the Shaykh was the book ‘Kitab al-Tawheed’ with its explanation of ‘Fath al-Majeed’ the Shaykh stood up and walked off to take care of something and he was away for sometime. I picked up the book to read, then later on the Shaykh returned, I asked him about this book, and I told him that I was amazed by it.  He began explaining the ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> of the <em>Salaf</em> to me.  He said: ‘O my son it is upon you to spread <em>Tawheed</em> and the ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> of the <em>Salaf</em>, because indeed you did not learn that in the university from where you graduated.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So from then on I began calling to the ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> of the <em>Salaf</em>, and this Shaykh was a farmer in that farm.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘He also met Shaykh Yahya al-Muallami, the brilliant scholar of hadeeth the scholar of his time in the knowledge of hadeeth, he adhered to him and took from him love for the knowledge of hadeeth and learning it.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hamad al-Ansaari said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘My Shaykh AbdurRahman al-Mu’alami <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> would research a very great deal.  He would research into more than one book at one time.  I would sit with him in the library of the <em>Haramain</em>, and he would give me books and say ‘look for such and such thing.’ But I could not find it, when I would give them back he would say to me: ‘Here it is, where are you?’  This was in the year 1367 A.H. at that time I was not paying attention and being hasty.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘I heard him say: ‘When the order came to launch an Islaamic University, there was a difference of opinion of where it should be.  So I suggested to Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibraheem ‘Ala-Shaykh <em>-Rahimullaah</em>: ‘It would be good if you established it in al-Madina since previously there was an Islaamic University in Madina which was none other than Abu Bakr <em>–</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>–</em> who represented the Arabs, and Bilal who represented al-Habasha etc.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hamad al-Ansaari said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘I searched for the origin of what people say these days of al-Madina ‘al-Munawarah’ and I found that the first people to label it ‘al-Munawarah’ were the ‘Uthmaanyoon’.  As for the Companions and the Successors and those after them, then for many centuries they called it al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari commented:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘I noticed from my father <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> that if he saw a person write ‘al-Munawarah’, he would say to him to wipe out the word ‘al-Munawarah’ and write ‘an-Nabaweeyah.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh also said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Applying the word ‘al-Munawarah’ after the word al-Madina was introduced by the non-Arabs.  What was well known by the Companions and the Successors was the addition ‘an-Nabaweeyah’.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When I came to Madina again in 1385 A.H.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘During my travels I brought five thousand manuscripts for the Islamic University on their account.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Indeed Shaykh al-Albaani made ‘al-Musnad’ easy for us, he made it really easy in an excellent manner by which he compiled lists for the Companions mentioned in ‘al-Musnad’ and before this we would have great difficulty in finding the hadeeth.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh also said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Indeed Shaykh al-Albaani studied knowledge abundantly and sufficiently, and he took the trade of mending watches for livelihood just as the Imams in the beginning used to do so. Indeed each one of them used to have a skill for his livelihood, for example Abu Hanifa was a cloth merchant.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh also said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘When I was in Damascus I used to visit al-Albaani in his house in ‘Safha, Mount Qassiyoon’.  I would stay awake the night with him after Isha until the end of the night, and that was so I could look into his books and his library was a good size.  Indeed Shaam<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn36">[36]</a> has been deprived of the Shaykh Nasir al-Albaani, there is none present like him in Shaam, especially in his field of expertise.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Likewise I also used to phone Shaykh AbdulAziz bin Baz, there is no Muhaddith who exists like him, even though he has many duties which have come between him and being free to specialise in the knowledge of hadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to this, indeed I would refer to Shaykh Albaani regarding some matters, because he posses vast research in to the knowledge of hadeeth.’</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Hamad said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘We met two noble generous brothers in Casablanca (Dar al-Bayda), Shaykh Nasir-uddeen Albaani and brother Muhammad al-Banna on their way to London, dispatched to teach in London.  We really enjoyed their company on Wednesday night, the following morning we were to leave the lands of Morocco.  That night was sociable, pleasant, relaxed, filled with the Prophetic Ahadeeth, and splendid guidance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We also attended, on that Wednesday evening an excellent lecture entitled: ‘Straightening the rows in the prayer is from establishing the prayer’ which was delivered by Shaykh Nasir-Uddeen Al-Albaani in the Masjid al-Muhammadi in Casablanca.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said about him:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘This is along with my awareness and appreciation of his knowledge, his excellence, and his benefitting the students especially in the Islamic University, may Allaah reward him with goodness.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn39">[39]</a></span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>He Used to Love the Sunnah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dr. Waleed al-Firyaanee said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari’s life was not one of play and uselessness or a life of being meek and lethargic, rather it was a living example for a biography of a serious scholar who turned down the enjoyments of this life and its pleasures. He sacrificed his time and effort for knowledge and teaching.  He <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> would exemplify the guidance of the Salaf as-Salih in his look, in his appearance, his character, his manners, his good behaviour, his humility, and him turning away from everything, which may violate and dishonour knowledge and the prestige of the scholars. He had Islaamic awareness, he was a Zahid. He possessed honesty in his tongue, and purity in the heart, and contentment. May Allaah have vast mercy upon the deceased.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Is Shaykh Rabee al-Madkhali from your students?’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh replied: ‘Yes, he is from my students.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Indeed Muqbil al-Wada’iee was my student; I was the one who chose the topic [for his Master’s Degree].<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn42">[42]</a> He would read to me in my house, the days I used to live in Sharqeeyah district.  I used to advise him and say to him O Muqbil, you came from your country to seek knowledge so do not mix with those people<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn43">[43]</a>, leave them and mixing with them, and turn towards that for which you travelled for.  However he was trialled and tested and he fell into that which I warned him against – I used to say to him: ‘I hope that you will be for Yemen in our time as Shawkaani was in his time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muqbil was a student the like of whom I have never seen in energy and seeking knowledge.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad added: ‘When my father said: ‘those people’ he meant those who have something against the Saudi Salafi state.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Also from those who are buried there near that place in that spacious graveyard is the Shaykh, the scholar Umar bin Muhammad al-Falata who used to love and revere my father, and he knew his worth, rank, his knowledge and his extensive research and his love for spreading the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf and the knowledge of hadeeth.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘During these past two weeks al-Madina al-Munnawara has lost two scholars from its senior scholars. Those who were known for research and deriving verdicts, high aspirations in the field of Dawa’ and a large number of the senior scholars of the Kingdom had graduated at their hands. They, who have travelled from our world are the noble Shaykh, Scholar, Muhaddith Hamad bin Muhammad al-Ansaari after suffering from an illness, and likewise the noble Shaykh, the judge, AbdulAziz bin Muhammad ash-Shibal who departed and met his Lord facing Him while he was in Sajda’ in the ‘Rawda ash-Shareef’ in the Masjid an-Nabawee ash-Shareef.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Beginning with the scholar, Muhaddith, Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari, since indeed a number of the senior scholars of the Kingdom have spoken about him, whereby the noble Shaykh Abdullaah al-Bassam, who is a member of the committee for the Senior Scholars, said about Shaykh Hamad:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘I have known Shaykh Hamad due to his strength of his knowledge regarding the knowledge of hadeeth whereby he was strong and sturdy in it, and a reference point for every question.  I have known him to be Salafi in ‘Aqeedah upon the Manhaj of the Salaf.  He made great efforts in education and teaching and researching books.  I ask Allaah to forgive him and compensate the students of knowledge with other than him.’<a style="color: #000000;" title="" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/a-brief-biography-of-shaykh-allaama-al-muhaddith-hamad-al-ansaari/#_ftn51">[51]</a></span></p>
