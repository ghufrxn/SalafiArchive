				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled by </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Abdul Barr<span id="more-1418"></span></strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise is due to Allaah the Most High, the Lord of the Great Arsh.   May the Peace and Blessing of Allaah be upon His Final Slave and Messenger, the Master of all the Prophets, the Seal of Prophethood, Muhammad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> It is from the endless Mercy of Allaah the Most High that He sent down the Quraan from Above the Heavens for the whole of mankind.  Imaam al-Juwaynee, may Allaah have mercy upon him used to say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “And know, without any doubt at all, that he (sallaahu alaiyhi wasalam) used to have present in his noble gatherings the Scholar and the ignorant person, the one with sharp intelligence and the not so sharply intelligent, the Arab and the non-Arab.”</em>  (Risalah Ithbaatul-Istiwaa wal-Fawqiyyah, pp. 176-183, abridged, which is part of Majmoo Rasaa’iI lil-Muneeriyyah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is not conceivable that the Messenger of Allaah (sallaahu alaiyhi wasalam) did not take this fact into account when explaining the Deen of Allaah to the people; we seek refuge in Allaah from such statements.  Rather he (sallaahu alaiyhi wasalam) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “By Him in whose hand is my soul, I have not left anything which brings you closer to Paradise and distances you from the Fire except that I have commanded you with it and have I not left anything which brings you closer to the Fire and distances you from Paradise except that I have prohibited you from it.”</em> (Related by Ahmad and Ibn Khuzaymah). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Abdullaah bin ‘Amr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said that the Messenger of Allaah (sallaahu alaiyhi wasalam) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There was not any Prophet before me except that it was a duty upon him to direct his nation to every good he knew for them and to warn them from every evil he knew for them.”</em> (Reported by Muslim in his Sahih)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we have established that the Messenger of Allaah (sallaahu alaiyhi wasalam) did not leave any leaves unturned except that he explained the entire deen to us, the commandments and the prohibitions, the good and the evil, the benefits and the harm. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sahaabah (May Allaah be Pleased with Them All) spent their lives around the Messenger of Allaah (sallaahu alaiyhi wasalam) from the testing times of the Hijra to Madina, through to the conquest of Makkah.  They lived with him and they ate with him, they shed tears with him and they shed blood with him.  They were firm upon the Book and the Sunnah as ‘Urwah ibn Mas’ood (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said to the Quraysh,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “O people, by Allaah I have visited kings. I went to Caesar, Chosroes and the Negus, but by Allaah I never saw a king whose companions venerated him as much as the companions of Muhammad venerated Muhammad (salallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam). By Allaah, whenever he spat, it never fell on the ground, it fell intothe hand of one his companions, then they wiped their faces and skins with it. If he instructed them to do something, they would hasten to do as he commanded. When he did wudoo’, they would almost fight over his water. When he spoke, they would lower their voices in his presence; and they did not stare at him out of respect for him.”</em> (Reported by Bukhaari in his Sahih, 3/178, no. 2731, 2732; al-Fath, 5/388)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After reflecting upon this narration are we to believe that the rabid Neo Jahmi Asrar Rashid As Soofee practices an affair that was not known or practiced by the best three generations of mankind?  Or is it the case that Allaah swa left the addition of such vital mawlid celebrations to the Asraars and the Saaqibs, the Nabeels and the Shaqeels of the 14th Century as they would have us believe!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are countless narrations which prohibit all innovation that we have bought forward time and time again. However on this occasion I have only bought only one narration which will suffice for seekers of the truth inshah’Allaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Abd Allâh Ibn Mass`ûd (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Follow and do not innovate, because what you have inherited is sufficient for you, and every innovation is an error”</em>  (Reported by Ad-Dârimi in his “Sunan” (hadith 209), At-Tabarâni in “Al-Kabîr” (hadith 8770), Al-Bayhaqi in “Shu`ab Al-Îmân” (hadith 2216). Al-Haythami said in “Majma`Az-Zawâ’id” (1/434): “It is narrated by At-Tabarâni in “Al-Kabîr”, and the men who narrated it are mentioned in the “Sahîh” of Al-Bukhâri and that of Muslim”. It is also reported by Al-Lâlakâ’i in “Sharh Ussûl Al-I`tiqâd” (1/96) and judged authentic by Al-Albâni in his revision for “Islâh Al-Masaajid” (12))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet this self proclaimed rabid dog Asrar Rashid As Soofee Jahmi ceases to stop barking about the false concept of bid’ah hasanah.  When questioned about his evidence he hangs on to his own personal twisted ta’weel of the hadeeth of Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) which the Ulama and those who preceded us in righteousness have clarified time and time again.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us clarify the position of the Scholars in regards to bid’ah again for you, being the rabid dog that you are you have been barking up the wrong tree,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Ibn Katheer (rahimahullah) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “And bidah is of two types. Sometimes it can be a legislative innovation (bid’ah shar’iyyah), such as his saying, “Every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is misguidance” and sometimes it can be a linguistic innovation (bid’ah lughawiyyah), such as the saying of Ameer al-Mu’minin Umar bin al-Khattaab, (radiallaahu ‘anhu) about his bringing them together for the Taraawih prayer and their continuance upon that, “What an excellent innovation this is.”</em>  (Dar Tayyibah, 1422H, 1/398)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Imaam Al-Bayhaqi attests to this when he reports from al-Shafi’ee that he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “Newly-invented matters are of two types: The first of them is what opposes the Book, or the Sunnah, or a narration [from the Companions], or the consensus – this is the misguided innovation. And the second is what has been introduced of goodness and there is not a single scholar who opposes it. This is newly-introduced yet not blameworthy and Umar (radiallaahu anhu) had said about the qiyam (al-layl) in the month of Ramadan, “What an excellent innovation this is,” meaning, that it is newly-introduced and was not previously done.”</em> (Manaaqib al-Shafi’ee 1/469)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We can see that bid’ah lughawiyyah (linguistic bid’ah) is that which has a basis in the Shariah and was initially legislated by the Messenger of Allaah (sallaahu alaiyhi wasalam).   This was the case at the time of Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) when the people started praying the taraweeh in congregation again.  We know that the taraweeh was a Sunnah as the Prophet (sallaahu alaiyhi wasalam),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Led his companions in praying for three nights, and on the third or fourth night he did not lead them, and he said: ‘I am afraid that it may be made obligatory upon you.’”</em> (Reported by Bukhaari in his Sahih, 872)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you use this as an evidence for bid’ah hasanah then where is the newly invented matter that Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) was approving of, as the taraweeh was already legislated before?!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (ra) said, when refuting the view of those who quoted ‘Umar’ (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) words “What a good innovation this is” as meaning that innovation (bid’ah) is permissible:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“With regard to qiyaam in Ramadaan, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) introduced this to his ummah, and he led them in prayer for a number of nights, because at his time they used to pray in congregation and individually. But he did not persist in leading them in one congregation, lest that be made obligatory for them. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, sharee’ah was established (and would not change after that). When ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) became caliph, he united them behind one imam, Ubayy ibn Ka’b, who united the people in one congregation on the orders of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him). ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) was one of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, of whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs after me; cling tightly to it.” So what he did was Sunnah but he said, “What a good innovation this is,” because it was an innovation in the linguistic sense, as they were doing something that they had not done during the life of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), i.e., gathering to do this, but it is Sunnah in the shar’i sense.”</em> (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 22/234, 235)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When you read this with a clear heart you will come to see the truth about the fallacy of bid’ah hasanah but there will be those who will continue to bark and reject the narrations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allaah the Most High says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> “And when it is said to them, “Follow what Allaah has revealed,” they say, “Rather, we will follow that which we found our fathers doing.” Even though their fathers understood nothing, nor were they guided?” (al-Baqarah: 170)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we have established once again that Mawlid is not from the Quran or the Sunnah, nor is it a praiseworthy innovation (as per the correct understanding highlighted above) that has a basis in the shariah.  So let us close the chapter on this act of the people of the fire and silence the barking dog that is Asraar Rasheed the Kulaabi Jahmi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you are wondering why we keep calling him a dog it is because of his saying in his talk “I, as a dog” (refer to his video on you tube).  So Asrar, being the self proclaimed dog of Madina, just remember before you think about entering the Haram,  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allaah’s Apostle said “Five kinds of animals are harmful and could be killed in the Haram (Sanctuary). These are: the crow, the kite, the scorpion, the mouse and the rabid dog.””</em> (Narrated by Aisha (RadhiAllaahu Anha): Sahih al Bukhaari: The Book of Penalty of Hunting While on Pilgrimage: No. 1717)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in regards to ‘Ala Hazrat’ then taking into consideration his genetic predisposition, as the Lion of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah Ehsan Elahi Zaheer (Rahimahullah) writes about Ahmad Ridda in his refutation of the Bareilwiyyah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“His colour was extensively black.  His opponents often used to taunt him because of the blackness of his face.  One of the books written in his opposition was named “The Dirt on The Black Liars Face”</em> (by (Maulana Murtaza Hasan Deobandi)”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even ‘Ala Hazrats’ nephew attested to this,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “In the beginning of his life his colour was dark wheatish.  But the continuous work and toil had removed the brightness and lustre from his colour”</em> (Alaa Hazrat by Bastawi page 20)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then in light of this information we should keep in mind the rights of the black dog as the Prophet (sallaahu alaiyhi wasalam) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “Were dogs not a species of creature I should command that they all be killed; but kill every pure black one”</em> (Narrated Abdullah ibn Mughaffal (RadhiAllaahu Anhu): Sunan Abu-Dawud no.2839)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You have a fascination about dogs and you aspire to be dogs but we the people of the Quran and the Sunnah aspire to become these brothers of the Messenger of Allaah (sallaahu alaiyhi wasalam) insha’Allaah, as per the narration of Anas ibn Malik (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that the Prophet (sallaahu alaiyhi wasalam) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I wish I could meet my brothers. So the Companions of the Prophet (s) said: Are we not your brothers? He (s) said: You are my companions but my brothers will be those who believed in me while they have not seen me.”</em> (Narrated by Imam Ahmad)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In response to your empty challenges, then it is as Imam Shafi’i (Rahimullah) said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “Dont you see that the lion, is quiet but yet it is still feared; whilst the dog barks constantly but is despised.”</em> (Diwan al-Imaam ash-Shafi’i: Beirut: al-Kutub al-‘ilmiya, 1988, p. 47)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Ibn Uthaymin -rahimahullah-:<span id="more-1413"></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The shaikh was asked: What is the difference between what is called “The week of shaikh Muhammad bin Abdel Wahhab” -Rahimahullah, and the celebration of the Prophetic Mawlid, as the second is condemned, while the first isn’t?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So he answered: “The difference between them -according to our knowledge- is from two sides:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first is: the week of shaikh Muhammad bin Abdel Wahhab -Rahimahullah Ta’ala- was not done as a means to get closer to Allah -Azza wa Jal-, it is only meant for removing doubts that are in the hearts of some people towards this man, and to show what Allah has blessed the Muslims through this man.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">إhe second is: the week of shaikh Muhammad bin Abdel Wahhab -Rahimahullah- does not reoccur and return (every year) as is the case with ‘Eids; it is something that has been clarified to the people, things were written in it, and the truth regarding this man, that was not known before, was shown to many people, then it ended.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Source: <em>Majmu’ Fatawa wa Rasael Shaikh Muhammad Saleh al-Uthaimeen, volume 16 – Prayer of the two Eids.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said in “Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftooh” :</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>The Question:</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people of innovation say: You commemorate some individuals or like the week of shaikh Muhammad bin Abdel Wahhab – rahimahullah-, they say: what we do is similar to that, and the Messenger -alayhi assalam- is greater than Imam Muhammad?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah is greater than all human beings, but the commemoration of the Messenger (Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) is not specific to to this night. I have mentioned to you before, that every act of worship includes the commemoration of the Messenger -alayhi assalatu wasSalam-, this is from one point, and from another point: the week of Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab, was it made into a eid that reoccurs? we say: it was not made an eid … and an eid is something that returns and reoccurs, you made this (i.e. mawlid) an eid that reoccurs every year, and this is munkar; that is why if someone, one day, stood up and spoke about the mission of the Messenger – alayhi asSalatu wasSalam- and his visiting, we would not call him an innovator, but to make it into an eid that reoccurs every year like a the religious eids such as Eid al Fitr and Eid Al-Adha, then this is munkar; and if we assume that the week of the Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab was wrong, does that mean we compare a wrong with wrong? we don’t.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Aziz Aal Abdel Latif, The Present Grand Mufti of the Land of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu alayhee Wassalm)<span id="more-1406"></span></span></p>

<h4 dir="ltr" align="left"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Question:</strong> </span></h4>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">Why does Saudi Arabia permit celebrating the commemoration of Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhaab in a conference, paying hundredsof thousands for it, and it is not allowed for us to celebrate the commemoration of the mawlid of the Messenger of Allah -Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam-?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">Who is more deserving of that: the Messenger of Allah -Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam- or Muhammad bin Abdel Wahhab?</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">This is a question that some of the people of knowledge of Damascus ask, please give us an answer.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr" align="left"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></span></h4>
<h4 dir="ltr" align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise be to Allah alone, and Salat and Salam be upon the Messenger of Allah</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">The week of shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhaab was only an academic conference held in 1400 Hijri, under the supervision of the Islamic University of Imam Muhammad bin Sa’ud in Riyadh, it consisted for a number of researches regarding the dawah of Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhaab in terms of its emergence and its affects, and the doubts created surrounding it with its refutation. In addition to that, the works of Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhaab were printed after compiling and organizing it.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">The difference between that conference and the celebration of the Prophetic Mawlid is obvious, as the week of shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhaab was not an act of worship itself, what was meant by it is to inform about this dawah and to do justice to its reviver; also, the week of the shaikh does not reoccur or return as is the case with the ones who celebrate the Prophetic Mawlid, tending it every year; while this week was held about a quarter century ago, and has ended.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled by </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Abdul Barr</strong><span id="more-1398"></span></span></h5>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise is due to Allaah the Most High, the Lord of the Great Arsh.   May the Peace and Blessing of Allaah (swa) be upon His Final slave and Messenger, the Master of all the Prophets, the Seal of Prophethood, Muhammad.</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Assalaam Alaiykum Wa Rahimathullah Wa Barakaathu</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear Brothers, after listening to the ranting of the Neo Jahmi Asharee Asraar Rashid As-Soofee Barelawi, we can see that he has clear hatred for the dawah of the Ahlul Hadeeth, for its beliefs and principles, its methodology and guidelines, for its call and its callers, and for everyone else that promotes the Dawah to Salafiyyah.</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaahs Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) </span><span style="color: #000000;">said</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Indeed, the scholars are the inheritors of the prophets” </em> (Jami at-Tirmidhi, Sunan Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban)</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">so it is our duty to defend the deen of Allaah (swa) and the inheritors of this deen from the slanderous speech of Ahlul-Bid’ah and silence the barking dog that is Asraar Rashid.</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) also said</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If Allaah wants to favour someone, He grants him comprehension (understanding) of this religion.”</em> (Sahih Bukhari vol.1:71, Tirmidhi and Musnad Ahmad)  </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet there are some brothers amongst us that feel that we must withhold our tongues and be gentle to those that ridicule the inheritors of the Prophets (Peace Be Upon Them All).  We need to fear the Wrath of Allaah  that He may take away this blessing from us through the death of our scholars if we do not make Jihad by the pen and by the tongue against those who oppose the Sunnah of RasoolAllaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam)</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee (Rahimahullah) said</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The one who refutes the Ahlul-Bid’ah (people of innovation) is a mujaahid, and there is no doubt about this. Since when Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal was told about a man who fasts, and offers salaah, and gives in charity, and performs the i’tikaaf, and does (other) good deeds, and was (then) told about a man who refutes the innovators – implying which of the two was better? He (Imaam Ahmad) said, “Whoever offers salaah and fasts and gives in charity and performs i’tikaaf, then (all of) this is for himself, and as for he who refutes the innovators, then this is for (the benefit of) the people.” </em> (Al-Fataawa al-Jaliyyah ‘anil-Manaahij ad-Da’wiyyah – Page 24, Question 29)</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymiyyah (Rahimahullah) said:</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The one who refutes the innovators is a mujaahid.”</em></span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Ibn al-Qayyim (Rahimahullah) said:</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The jihaad with decisive proofs (from the Book and the Sunnah) and the tongue takes precedence over the jihaad with the sword and the spear.”</em> (Al-Jawaab as-Saheeh of Ibn Taymiyyah (1/237)</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The illustrious Shaykh Al-Humaidee (Rahimahullah), the Shaikh of al-Bukhaaree (Rahimahullah), said:</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“By Allaah, that I war against those who reject the Hadeeth of the Messenger (salallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) is more beloved to me than that I should war against the same number of Non-Muslims.”</em> ( Al-Harawi in Dhamm ul-Kalaam)</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Ibn ‘Abdullaah Aalush-Shaykh said</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The refutations upon the people of innovation are from Jihaad in the path of Allaah. They are from safeguarding the Sharee’ah from having other than it attached to it. So writing the books, publishing them and spreading them is the truth and it is a call to the truth and Jihaad in the path of Allaah. So whoever claims that publishing and spreading the books that contain refutation upon the innovators is an innovated affair, then he is upon error, because Allaah the Sublime and Exalted said: O Prophet! Strive hard against the hypocrites and be harsh with them. (Sooratut-Tawbah 9:73)”</em> (Taken from: ar-Riyaadus-Sa’oodiyyah Newspaper (issue no. 12674), dated Friday, the 4th of al-Muharram)</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My dear brothers, we are facing this fitnah because we have allowed people like Asraar Rashid to promote the Mushrik aqeedah of Ahmad Ridda Khan and other such deviants, fearing that by naming them or being harsh against them we would repel people from the masjids and the madrassas.  What we have done in actual fact is water down the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and so Allaah swa has punished us with this fitnah where Ahlul-Bid’ah mock us at any available opportunity.  We should not fear criticizing and being harsh with those who oppose the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) as</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When some people said to Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah) that they felt uneasy about criticizing people, he replied, ‘If you remain silent and I remain silent, then who will make the ignorant person aware of the authentic from the defective?&#8217;” </em> (Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa of Ibn Taimiyyah (28/231))</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Qudama Al Maqdisi (Rahimahullah) was a stern defender of the Sunnah and he said</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The innovator whose innovation does not make him a disbeliever, then the affair between himself and Allaah is less severe than the situation of the Kaafir without doubt. But in terms of (him being criticised and) detesting what he does (in terms of his innovation) then this is dealt with more severity than the Kaafir. This is because the evil of the Kaafir does not extend (to the Muslims) as none of the Muslims would pay attention to his speech. And this is different than the innovator who calls toward his innovation because he thinks that what he is calling toward is the truth. He therefore becomes a reason for the misguidance of the creation and his evil extends (to the Muslims). Therefore openly displaying enmity toward him, boycotting him, being an enemy towards him, humiliating him, being harsh upon him because of his innovation and running the people away from him becomes more severe.” </em> (Ibn Qudama Al Maqdisi, Minhaaj Al Qaasideen pg. 123, Maktabah Al Islami Print)</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we must take heed of this lesson and implement this principle so that Allaah swa may bestow His Mercy on us once again, and grant us victory against all those who oppose the dawah to Salafiyyah.</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great Imam of Ahlus Sunnah Al-Hasan Al-Basree (Rahimahullah) once said: </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is no backbiting with regard to (talking about) the innovator or the sinner who openly professes his evil.”</em> ( Al-Laalikaa`ee (1/140, no 279)</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as we are harsh to Ahlul-Bid’ah for the sake of Allaah (swa), and we do not seek fame or status from the people then we are traversing the path of the Prophets (as) as mentioned by Abdus-Salaam as-Suhaymi (hafidhahullaah) who wrote that Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (Rahimahullah) said, as he was explaining the permissibility of backbiting an open innovator, that</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“two conditions should be fulfilled before doing so:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1.Knowledge</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. Sincerity</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Tamiyyah said: <em>A person who takes up the task of backbiting an (open) innovator should be knowledgeable and sincere. If a person takes part in backbiting an (open) innovator, but the cause of him taking part in backbiting is to raise his own status in the eyes of the people, or to cause corruption, it doesn’t matter if he is correct in his criticism. He is like a warrior who goes out to fight in a fit of rage (due to his lack of knowledge), showing off (due to his lack of sincerity). On the other hand, if he is backbiting an (open) innovator, sincerely for the sake of Allaah, he is like the inheritors of the Prophets (the Scholars), the successors of the Messengers, (honorably) fighting in the path of Allaah”</em></span></p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Those who came before us would not give up doing so at any cost, even to the extent that Imam Abu Ismaa’eel al-Ansaari (Rahimahullah) said that</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whilst in Haraah: ‘The sword was put to my neck five times (and each time) it was not said to me, ‘Leave your madhhab’ but it was said to me, ‘Remain silent about those who are in opposition to you’. So I would say, ‘I will not remain silent.&#8217;”</em>(Aadaab us-Sharee’ah (1/207) of Ibn Muflih al-Maqdisi al-Hanbali)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam of the Sunnah Shaykh Barbaharee (Rahimahullah) said</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is no permit for anyone to do anything which has been introduced, which the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahualaihi wa sallam) were not upon, nor for any man to call to anything innovated before him by people of innovation; he would then be just like the one who innovated it. So anyone who claims that, or speaks according to it, has rejected the Sunnah, opposed the truth and the Jamaa’ah and has made innovation lawful. He is more harmful to the Ummah than Iblees”</em> (Kitaab Sharh us-Sunnah by Abu Muhammad Al-Hasan ibn ‘Alee ibn Khalaf Al-Barbahaaree (Rahimahullah)  (p38))</span></p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So I say we have been too lenient as it is by calling them dogs as they have been referred to by those more knowledgeable and pious then us as more harmful then Iblees (may the curse of Allaah be upon him).</span></p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The hatred held by the pious predecessors for these innovators due to their opposition to the Sunnah can be seen by their opinions in regards to them such as Al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad (Rahimahullah) who said that</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whoever sits with a person of innovation, then beware of him and whoever sits with a person of innovation has not been given wisdom. I love that there was a fort of iron between me and a person of innovation. That I eat with a Jew and a Christian is more beloved to me than that I eat with a person of Innovation.”</em> (Reported by al-Laalikaa’ee, no. 1149.)</span></p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Layth ibn Sa’d (d. 175H) said,</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If I saw a person of desires (i.e. innovations) walking upon the water I would not accept from him.”</em></span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee then said,</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘He (al-Layth) has fallen short. If I saw him walking in the air I would not accept from him.” </em> (Reported by as-Suyooti in Al-Amr bil ‘lttibaa wan-Nahee ‘anil-lbtidaa. Refer to Chapter Eight.)</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We have merely responded by then pen to these barking dogs, the Imaams of Ahlus Sunnah were even sterner and physically beat the mubtadis as it is narrated about Abdullaah bin Abee Ja’far ar-Raazee (Rahimahullah) from Saalih bin ad-Darees who said</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abdullaah began beating the head of a relative of his who held the view of Jahm. So I saw him beating him on his head with a sandal whilst saying, “No (I will not stop), (not) until you say Ar-Rahmaan ascended above the Throne, separate and distinct from His creation (ar-Rahmaanu ‘alal-arsh istawaa, baa’inun min khalqihi).”</em> (Mukhtasar al-Uluww of adh-Dhahabee, (p. 172)</span></p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d. 204H) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“My ruling regarding the people of theological rhetoric is that they should be beaten with palm leaves and shoes and be paraded amongst the kinsfolk and the tribes with it being announced, ‘This is the reward of the one who abandons the Book and the Sunnah and turns to theological rhetoric (kalaam).” </em> (Sharh ‘Aqeedatit-Tahaawiyyah of lbn Abil-’Izz, p. 75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If anything, we are doing them a favour as one of the Salaf used to say</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We are more merciful to them (Ahlul-Bid’ah) than their mothers. We are even merciful to them when they are in their graves. We refute them and expose their bid’ah, and by doing so, their sins are lessened”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In conclusion, it is my humble opinion that we, myself first and foremost, are not doing enough to silence these rabid dogs that fight against the Quran and the Sunnah and we must be harsh against those who oppose the dawah to Salafiyyah, and Allaah  knows best.</span></p>

We actually struggled to find any pertinent or relevant evidences, however we did find foul language, mocking of the deen of Allaah and side stepping the foundations of the deen ie the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah in attempting to prove such an innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>“Before you try to extinguish the fire elsewhere take a look and see that the house that that’s burning isn’t in fact yours”.</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The issue concerning the Mawlid Un-Nabee has become like a hot potato in recent times and let there be a warning to all of Ahlul Bidah (they know who they are) who are attempting to promote this innovated celebration with the old arab proverb, that, <em>“if you eat something too hot your tongue shall be burnt”.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Najdee, wahaabee, ghayr muqallid, ghayr madhab amongst other abuse we can tolerate for the sake of Allah but Alhamdullilah the Ahlul Hadeeth, Atharees, Salafees, Ahlus Sunnah Wal-Jamaah are alive and they shall not tolerate any kind of Bidah or shirk in the blessed deen of Al-Islaam. For this, the salafee young, old, man and woman shall give the last drop of their blood to preserve this deen, InshaAllaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What follows is a brief taster and post-mortem of recent talks that have been given by the milaadee opponents and a brief review of the same.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say to our Milaadee Barailwee opponents everything in your Madhab that did not exist as the deen in the time of the prophet seems to be a ‘Bidah Hasanah’. Is there any Bidah that you actually say is blameworthy?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Prophets Era.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed, had you paid heed to the sayings of the Salaf concerning Bidah and its evils then you would have never fallen to such depths. In actual fact the messenger said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) <em>“whoever innovates in our religion that is not from it, will have it rejected”</em> (Bukhaari).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Was Milaad celebrated as “Eid Milaad un Nabee” by the Prophet as part of the deen? </em></strong>Surely Not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Has any scholar from the companions, tabieen and taba taabi’een said that the prophet celebrated his milaad? Surely not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Why not? Did they not know of this alleged tremendous act of worship?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Rightly Guided Khulafaas Era.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) the prophet said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided Khaliphs”</em> (Tirmidhee (no.2676)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Did any of the rightly guided caliphs from amongst the companions themselves celebrate Eid milaad</em></strong>? Surely not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Why not? Did they not know of this alleged tremendous act of worship and its benefits?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Four Imaams – Great Era.  </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) It is ironic that for those who say that the salafees do not revere and respect the four imams then we ask them. O blind follower of Imaam Maalik, Shaafi’ee, Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Abu Haneefah please enlighten us and <strong><em>show us from them a single statement concerning the celebration of Eid milaad un-nabee?</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Please show us what hokum they attached to Eid Milaad un-nabee, mustahab? Waajib? Mandoob?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In actual fact we give you a free reign, please show us where anyone of them called it a ‘bidah hasanah’?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So that which did not exist as an act of worship and Eid celebration in the above eras as described above is being now promoted as an act of worship and something which will bring one closer to Allah. How can this be? How can we go over and above the blessed eras as described above?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Bidah.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) Our Milaadee Barailwee opponents often say that Umar said that taraweeh in jamaat was a ‘good bidah” and therefore we can have good Bidahs in islaam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We reply, you only say taraweeh in jamaat is a good bidah because, as you allege, <strong>only because</strong> <strong>and due to the fact</strong>that Umar informed you of it in a hadeeth. Indeed we are to follow the prophet and his companions. Therefore, the rule as set out by our opponents is that, its a good Bidah because it has a basis in the religion and the companions inform us of it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Therefore, Please show us any text where any companion said ‘Eid Milaad un-Nabee is a good Bidah’?</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>“Every bidah {Kullu Bidatin} is a misguidance”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) when the Salafee mentions the above hadeeth the Milaadee opponent opines that the word “kullu” (every) does not mean every Bidah and that ‘good Bidahs in the deen’ are an exception to this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It’s very simple, we ask our opponents to <strong><em>produce a single hadeeth, even produce a weak hadeeth if you can where the prophet has made an exception by saying that every “bidah is a misguidance except for good bidahs”?</em></strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Date of Birth and Death.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) Recently, one Miladi Barelvi opponent gave a lecture in the st.Saviours mosque in Birmingham saying and quoting over and over again his Miladi imam Ahmad Raza Khan concerning the mawlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said that the najdis have got it wrong when they say that he died around the same time that the people today celebrate his milaad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Irony.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmed Raza Khan is reported to have said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“ The prophets birth was on the 12<sup>th</sup> of Rabbi ul Awwal as was his death”</em> (malfoozaat 2/220).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we request that before any abuse or blame is put at the door of the Salafi&#8217;s then as the arabs say, <strong><em>“before you try to extinguish the fire elsewhere take a look and see that the house that that’s burning isn’t in fact yours”.</em></strong></span></p>
