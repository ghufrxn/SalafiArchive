				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A bomb goes off in a marketplace in Jerusalem. A suicide bomber launches himself into a bus full of women and children in Tel Aviv. Foreign tourists get massacred at a holiday resort in Luxor, Egypt. Villages upon villages get annihilated in Algeria. The list of events worldwide which have come to symbolise the ‘Islamic terror’ are endless. From the times in the 70’s and 80’s when Pan Am and TWA aeroplanes would be highjacked, to the mid 80’s in war torn Lebanon where Americans and Europeans would be held as hostages for years; all such incidents have come to be identified with the religion of Islam. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such incidents from past and present have undoubtedly affected Muslims worldwide and more so in the West. Any Muslim, who wants to practice his/her religion and expresses the pious desire to live under the banner of Islam, is labelled a fundamentalist or extremist. Any Muslim man who walks down a busy street in London or Paris (and Paris moreso) with a beard and a scarf on his head, is looked upon as being a terrorist who’s probably got an AK47 stashed somewhere on his person. Muslim women who are veiled can’t go anywhere in the Western world without being taunted as being oppressed or being mad (for covering up). However, are such beliefs and opinions about Islam really justified?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>Exploding the myth</b></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the many short comings which has arisen in the West, is judging Islam by the conduct of a minority of its people. By doing this, segments of Western society have deliberately played off the desperate actions of many Muslims, and have given it the name of Islam. Such behaviour is clearly not objective and seeks to distort the reality of Islam. For if such a thing was done Judge a religion by the conduct of its people) then we too could say that all Christianity is about is child molesting and homosexuality [1] whilst Hinduism was all about looting and breaking up mosques [2]. Generalising in such a manner is not seen as being objective, yet we find that the Western world is foremost in propagating this outlook on Islam. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So what is the reality of Islam? How does one dispel the myths which have been created and spread so viciously? The only way to examine Islam is to simply examine its belief system. Look at its sources, the Qur’an and Sunna, and see what they have to say. This is the way to find the truth about what Islam says about terror, terrorism and terrorists. One who is sincerely searching for the truth, will do it no other way. The very name Islam comes from the Arabic root word ‘salama’ which means peace. Islam is a religion which is based upon achieving peace through the submission to the will of Allaah. Thus, by this very simple linguistic definition, one can ascertain as to what the nature of this religion is. If such a religion is based on the notion of peace, then how is it that so many acts done by its adherents are contrary to peace? The answer is simple. Such actions, if not sanctioned by the religion, have no place with it. They are not Islamic and should not be thought of as Islamic.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>Jihad</b></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The word jihad sends shivers down the spines of many Westerners. They readily equate this term with violence and oppression. However, it must be said that the meaning of jihad, as a ‘holy war’, is something which is totally foreign and not from Islam. If anything, such a description belongs more so to Christianity and its adherents. It was terms like this which were used to justify the slaughter and pillage of towns and cities during the crusades by the Christians. By simply looking into the sources of Islam, one is able to know that the true meaning of jihad is to <i>strive/make effort in the way of Allaah. </i>Thus striving in the way of Allaah can be both peaceful and physical. The Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>“The best jihad is (by) the one who strives against his own self for Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic” [3].</i>In the Qur’an, Allaah also says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>So obey not the disbelievers, but make a great jihad </b>(effort)<b> against them </b>(by preaching)<b> with it</b> (the Qur’an)” </span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Furqan 25:52).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By controlling and fighting against ones desires, the Muslims can then also physically exert themselves in the path of Allaah. It is this physical or combative jihad which receives so much criticism. Because of the sheer ignorance of this type of jihad Islam is regarded as terror, and Muslims are regarded as terrorists. However, the very purpose of this physical jihad is to raise the word of Allaah uppermost. By doing this, it liberates and emancipates all those who are crying out for freedom all over the world. If the likes of the pacifists of this world had their way, then the world would indeed be full of anarchy and mischief. The combative jihad seeks to correct this as Allaah says in the Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of another, the Earth would be full of mischief. But Allaah is full of bounty to the worlds</b>“ </span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:251).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such would be the corruption on this Earth if there had never been a combative jihad that Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>For had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques, wherein the name of Allaah is mentioned much, would surely have been pulled down. Indeed Allaah will help those who help His</b> (cause). <b>Truly Allaah is All strong, All mighty</b>“ </span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Hajj 22:40).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This combative jihad being both defensive and offensive, is something which is commanded by Allaah upon the Muslims. Through this command the oppressed and weak are rescued from the tyranny of the world:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>And what is the matter with you that you do not fight in the cause of Allaah and for those weak, ill treated and oppressed among men, women and children whose only cry is; ‘Our Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors and raise for us from you one who will protect and raise for us from you one who will help</b>“‘ </span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah An-Nisa 4:75).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Anyone who knows the early history of Islam, will know that all those nations and empires which came under the fold of Islam were indeed previously oppressed. When the companions of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) went out for the offensive jihad against the Egyptians, the Persians and the Romans, we find that the people did not resist against them at all. Rather, they accepted Islam on such a scale, that it is inconceivable that the jihad of Islam could be anything other then a liberation for these people; a liberation from centuries of tyranny. In fact, with the Byzantine Egyptians and the people of Spain, the Muslims were even beckoned to come and liberate these lands from the oppression of their kings. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the glorious track record of the Muslim jihad Compare this with the brutal track record of warfare in the Western world over the centuries. From the crusades against the Muslims to the days of colonial warfare, the Western world has killed, destroyed and plundered everything which has come in its way. Even today this merciless killing goes on by the Western nations. While claiming to be about world peace and security, Western nations are ready to bomb innocent civilians at the drop of a hat. The classic example of this is the recent bombings of Sudan and Afghanistan. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst claiming that Sudan and Afghanistan were havens for Islamic terrorists, the bombings of these two nations could not have come at a better time for the American president Bill Clinton. The destruction of innocent lives which were a result of these bombings clearly seem to have been an attempt by Clinton to avert attention away from his sexual misdemeanours; [4] something which he so often gets caught up in. Without doubt this was the reason for such terror from the American military upon innocent people. This is the same American military which claims to enter the worlds trouble spots under the guise of being peace keepers. But</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>…</b> <b>when it is said to them; ‘Make not mischief on the Earth’, they say; ‘We are only peace makers’. Indeed they are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive it not</b>“</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:11-12)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>The hypocrisy of the West is indeed astounding.</b></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By looking at the rules and regulations of this combative jihad it will be clear to any sincere person that this is indeed the religion of truth. When fighting an unjust enemy, no matter how unjust they are, it is forbidden by Islam that their retreating forces are mutilated, tortured or slaughtered. The treacherous violation of treaties and carrying out assassinations after a cease fire, are also prohibited. Allaah says in the Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you. But do not transgress the limits. Truly Allaah loves not the transgressors</b>“</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:190).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Not transgressing the limits means not to kill women and children, for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) <i>“forbade the killing of women and children</i>” [5]. Not transgressing the limits means that the elderly, the sick, monks, worshippers and hired labourers are not attacked. Not transgressing the limits means not killing animals wantonly, burning crops and vegetation, polluting waters and destroying homes, monasteries, churches and synagogues:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion, nor drove you out of your homes. Indeed, Allaah loves those who deal with equity</b>“</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Mumtahinah 60:8).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After reading such passages from the Qur’an and knowing about what Islam commands and prohibits in jihad, the rules of warfare are given a new meaning; a meaning of justice. How sad it is then, that whilst Islam is condemned for striking terror into the hearts of the people, the likes of the Serbs, the Indian army in Kashmir and the Israeli soldiers in Palestine are left untarnished for the atrocities they have committed in the name of warfare.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So what about suicide bombing, is this too a part of jihad in Allaah’s path? From what has already been stated above, it can be deduced that this is not from the religion. However, unfortunately many Muslims have taken suicide bombing as being a virtuous act by which one receives reward. This could not be further from the truth. The Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>“Those who go to extremes are destroyed” </i>[6]. Suicide bombing is undoubtedly an extremity which has reached the ranks of the Muslims. In the rules of warfare, we find no sanction for such an act from the behaviour and words of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) and his companions. Unfortunately, today (some misguided) Muslims believe that such acts are paving the way for an Islamic revival and a return to the rule of Islam’s glorious law. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, we fail to bear in mind that the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>“Do not be delighted by the action of anyone, until you see how he ends up”</i> [7]. So, for example what is the end of a suicide bomber in Palestine?, a leg here, an arm there. Massive retaliation by the Israeli’s in the West Bank and Gaza. More Muslims killed and persecuted. How can we be delighted with such an end? What really hammers the final nail in the coffin of this act, is that it is suicide; something which is clearly forbidden in Islam. The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>“He who kills himself with anything, Allaah will torment him with that in the fire of Hell” </i>[8]. Some are under the misconception that by killing oneself for an Islamic cause, one commits an act which deserves Paradise. Once when a man killed himself, the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>“He is a dweller of the Fire”. </i>When the people were surprised at this, the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>“A person performs the deeds which to the people appears to be the deeds befitting the dweller of Paradise, but he is in fact one of the dwellers of the Fire” </i>[9]. The taking of ones life which Allaah has given as a trust to the human, is a great sin. Likewise the taking of other lives (which is so often the case with suicide bombing) is also forbidden, as human life is indeed precious:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>…If anyone killed a person not in retaliation for murder or to spread mischief in the land, it would be as if he killed the whole of mankind. And (likewise) if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the whole of mankind</b>“</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Maaida 5:32).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, all other types of extremities such as hostage taking, hijacking and planting bombs in public places, are clearly forbidden in Islam.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>The Media</b></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By going through the teachings of Islam, it is clear that such a religion has only come to benefit mankind -not to destroy it. So why is there so much hatred for this noble religion in the West? The answer is simple, the media. It is the Jewish influenced media of the West which has portrayed Islam to be something that it is not. During the 70’s and 80’s when the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organisation) were carrying out daring highjacks on the worlds airways, the media in the West portrayed it as being Islamic. When the Shi’ite suicide bombers of the 80’s were causing so much havoc in the Lebanon and in the Gulf region, the media in the West portrayed it as a part of Islam. However, it is known by the heads of the media that the likes of the PLO were not an Islamic organisation, and that according to Islam, Shi’ites are outside the fold of Islam [10]. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet such facts are never portrayed by a media which seeks to cover the truth of this religion. A number of years ago, when the Oklahoma City bomb went off, a headline in one of the newspapers, ‘The Today’ [11], summed up this attitude. With a picture of a fire fighter holding a dead child in his arms, the headline read: <b>“In The Name of Islam” </b>Time has of course proven that this bigoted assumption was incorrect, as Timothy McVeigh, a right wing radical now faces the death penalty for the crime [12]. Likewise the bombs which went off in the Paris metro in 1995, were also blamed on Muslim fanatics. It has now emerged that the Algerian secret service who having routinely bribed many European journalists and MPs, were actually behind it. The desire to throw a veil over Islam is immense by these people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>They intend to put out the light of Allaah with their mouths, but Allaah will complete His light even though the disbelievers hate</b> (it)”</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah As-Saff 61:8).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst trying to destroy Islam through this instrument of the media, the Jews clearly try to portray an image of themselves as being the oppressed people. Every year, we are reminded as to how many Jews perished under the Nazis in World War II. We are made to feel sorry for these same people who have gone on to commit so many crimes upon the Palestinian people. Some may say that this is a racist and biased viewpoint. But we say; If this media was not run and orchestrated by the Jews and was truly neutral, then why are Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, two former Israeli prime ministers, not held aloft as being terrorists? Anyone who knows about the history of the Palestinian occupation will tell you that these two men were members of the Stem Gang and Irgun, two notorious Jewish terror groups who killed many innocent people [13]. If this media was truly impartial, then why does it not tell about the extent of the Israeli bombardment and illegal occupation of Southern Lebanon and its people? [14] And if this media really had nothing against the religion of Allaah, then why does it not inform the people that every day hundreds are entering the religion of Islam? Such things will never be highlighted in the Western media, simply because to do so would be against their very interests.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With such immense pressure against it, it is indeed a blessing from Allaah that Islam goes from strength to strength. It continues to grow faster then any other religion in the Western world, conquering the hearts and minds of thousands. All this should not even surprise us though, for Allaah has promised us that this religion will prevail:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, so that He may make it victorious over all other religions, even though the disbelievers detest it</b>“</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah As-Saff 61:9).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a must that humanity comes towards the religion of Islam. Without it, we will continue to slip down the road of inequity and darkness. With it we can establish a society of justice and peace. Religion of terror? … no. The way forward? … yes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>There is no compulsion in religion. The right path has indeed become distinct from the wrong. So whoever rejects false worship and believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing</b>“</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:256)</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Umar Fullatah may Allah have mercy upon him said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: Eesa (Jesus) the son of Maryam; Allah created him from a mother and he does not have a father. Similarly Allah created Adam without a father or a mother. And likewise Allah created Hawwa (Eve) with a father and no mother. Thus the affair is not strange. Allah said in His glorious Book:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">إِ`</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our father Adam—peace be upon him—Allah created him from soil, from sounding clay like the clay of pottery, from an adhesive soil. After that Allah ordered that a soul be blown into him with the statement, ‘Be’. Thus Adam was.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Where is the mother of Adam? Where is the father of Adam? The father of mankind—Adam—does not have a father or a mother. Thus the All-Knowing, the Most Great, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise, the One who does whatever He wants and chooses, created Adam without a mother or a father. And the affair is not like Darwin (upon him is the curse of Allah) says; the theory of Darwin which states the origin of mankind is from monkeys, and they evolved. The theory of evolution, says that monkeys evolved through stages until it became Adam. And that Adam is not from soil but rather he is an animal who evolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah the Exalted said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">إِ<strong>نَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَى عِنْدَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ آدَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِنْ تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Verily, the likeness of Eesa (Jesus) with Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from soil, the He said to him ‘Be’ and he was. (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:59)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Hawwa (Eve); Allah created her from a rib from Adam. She does not have a mother while she has a father. Thus Allah the Exalted wanted to create Eesa (Jesus) so He created him from a mother, and she is the virgin Maryam, the untouched; may the best prayers and peace be upon her and upon our Prophet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">She is Maryam the daughter of Imraan, the one whom Allah described with His statement:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">ا<strong>لَّتِي أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The one who guarded her chastity (Soorh At Tahrim 66:12)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In this is a testimony from the Creator, the Exalted, that she surely guarded her chastity and she was not a lewd woman, peace be upon her.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Her father was a righteous man, a worshipper. Her mother became pregnant with her, meaning with Maryam, so she dedicated her to the service of Allah. (Her intent was) if Allah blessed her with a son, she would dedicate this son to the Masjid, worship and the obedience of Allah. But Allah decreed the mother of Maryam was to give birth to Maryam; a girl and not a boy who would take care of the affairs of the Masjid and worship Allah in the Masjid.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thus when she gave birth to a girl she wanted an excuse with Allah, she said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">فَلَمَّا وَضَعَتْهَا قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَضَعْتُهَا أُنْثَى وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا وَضَعَتْ وَلَيْسَ الذَّكَرُ كَالْأُنْثَى وَإِنِّي سَمَّيْتُهَا مَرْيَمَ وَإِنِّي أُعِيذُهَا بِكَ وَذُرِّيَّتَهَا مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Then when she delivered her [child Maryam], she said: “O my Lord! I have delivered a female child,” – and Allah knew better what she delivered, – “And the male is not like the female, and I have named her Maryam, and I seek refuge with You (Allah) for her and for her offspring from Satan, the outcast.” (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:36)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Exalted said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">فَ<strong>تَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ وَأَنْبَتَهَا نَبَاتًا حَسَنًا وَكَفَّلَهَا زَكَرِيَّا كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا الْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِنْدَهَا رِزْقًا قَالَ يَا مَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هَذَا قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So her Lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of Zakariya. Every time Zakariya entered upon her in the prayer chamber, he found with her provision. He said, “O Maryam, from where is this [coming] to you?” She said, “It is from Allah. Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without account.” (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:37)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maryam—while she was still young—was honored by Allah. The provision that Zakariya found with Maryam—and Zakariya was from her closest guardians—he would come and find the fruits which only grow during the summer months with her during the winter months; and he would find with her the fruits which only grow during the winter months with her during the summer months. She was blessed, righteous, pious, throughout her youth and when she reached womanhood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yusuf the carpenter asked for her hand in marriage, and he was from her relatives. He desired to marry her. And she was righteous; dedicated to her prayer area, dedicated to obedience to Allah and worship. The entire community of that time period testified to her righteousness and piety. And for this reason when she became pregnant (they said to her)</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">يَا أُخْتَ هَارُونَ مَا كَانَ أَبُوكِ امْرَأَ سَوْءٍ وَمَا كَانَتْ أُمُّكِ بَغِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">O sister of Harun, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.”       (Soorah Maryam 19:28)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">How did you get pregnant with this boy? Where did you get this boy from?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Verily this boy was a miracle from Allah the Exalted. Allah wanted for her to have this son, so an angel came to her. The angel informed her that Allah had sent him to her.</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">لِأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلَامًا زَكِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(To announce) to you the gift of a righteous son (Soorah Maryam 19:19)</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَتْ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لِي غُلَامٌ وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِي بَشَرٌ وَلَمْ أَكُ بَغِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">She said: “How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?” (Soorah Maryam 19:20)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">How can I have a son, I do not have a husband and I have not been unchaste nor committed fornication? So how can I have a son?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And it is from the way of Allah the Exalted that the child is not born except by two parents, between a husband and a wife, man and a woman. He (the angel) informed her that this is what Allah wanted.</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَتْ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَنِ مِنْكَ إِنْ كُنْتَ تَقِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">She said: “Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Beneficent (Allah) from you, if you do fear Allah.” (Soorah Maryam 19:18)</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَ إِنَّمَا أَنَا رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لِأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلَامًا زَكِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(The angel) said: “I am only a Messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son.” (Soorah Maryam 19:19)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah commanded him (the angel) to blow into the sleeve of her outer garment. Allah the Exalted commanded the angel Jibreel to blow (into the sleeve of her outer garment) the word ‘Be’. Thus Jibreel came with a command from Allah. Thus Jibreel blew the word ‘Be’ that Allah had sent him with (into the sleeve of her outer garment) and thus Maryam became pregnant with Eesa (Jesus) may the best prayers and peace be upon her and our Prophet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And I remind you and I say to you, this affair is not strange. Because Allah created Adam peace be upon him, without a father or a mother, and we are all offspring of Adam, peace be upon him. This because Adam is the father of all mankind, except for those who follow the Darwin theory of evolution, so if they are not the children of Adam then they are the offspring of monkeys. But as for us, then we are the offspring of Adam; the one who Allah created with His Hands. And Allah breathed a soul into him. And Allah caused him to live in paradise, and Allah created from his rib Hawwa (Eve). After He entered them into paradise He forbade them to eat from the tree. When they ate from the tree He expelled them down to the earth. Thus this has been the linage since Allah created Adam and Hawwa up until this day of ours, and until Allah inherits the earth and all those upon it.</span></p>
