<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>AYĀT FROM THE QURĀN ON THE CREED OF THE SALAF. </strong></span></h4>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Indeed your Lord is Allāh, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty).</strong><strong>[Al-Arāf:54]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Surely, your Lord is Allāh Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty), disposing the affair of all things. </strong><strong>[Yūnas:2]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Allāh is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then, He rose above (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty). [Ar-Rʿad:2]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawa) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty) </strong><strong>[Taha:5]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six Days. Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). The Most Gracious (Allāh)! Ask Him as He is Al-Khabîr (The All-Knower of everything i.e. Allāh). </strong><strong>[Al-Furqān 59]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Allāh it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six Days. Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Walî (protector or helper) or an intercessor. Will you not then remember (or receive admonition)? </strong><strong>[As-Sajdah:4]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, and what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. And Allāh is the All-Seer of what you do. </strong><strong>[Al-Hadīd:4]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ISTIWĀ’ WITH THE MEANING OF ‘IRTIFĀ’ TO BE HIGH AND ABOVE.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is recorded in the Sahīh of Al-Bukhārī in the book of Tawhīd, chapter of ‘His Throne Was Above The Water<em>’</em> from <em>Abū Ālīyah that, “His saying “He rose above the heavens” meaning ‘Irtifā’ [he rose].” Mujāhid said it means “He rose high/above’ his Throne” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Ḥajr says <em>“Abū ʿĀlīyahs report has been cited by Ibn Jarīr in mawsūl via the route of ʿAbdullāh bin Jʿafar’s from his father from Abū ʿĀlīyah and Mujāhids report has been transmitted by al-Faryābī in his Tafsīr in mawsūl via the route of Warqā from Ibn Abī Najīh from Mujāhid.”</em> [Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī [22/427] and Fath al-Bārī of Ibn Ḥajr [17/176]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Imām Ishāq Ibn Rahawaihah states that he he heard from numerous specialist explainers of the Qurān that the meaning of <strong>“</strong><strong>The Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawā) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)”</strong> <em>“is that ‘Irtifā’ he rose/above.”</em>  [Jalāl ud-Dīn al-Qāsmī, Tafsīr Maḥāsin ut-Tā’wīl [7/2703]</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>TO SAY ‘ISTAWĀ’ [HE ROSE ABOVE] MEANS ‘ISTĪLĀ’ [HE CONQUERED] IS TOTALLY INCORRECT. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ismāʿīl al-Harawī narrates in his book <em>‘al-Fārūq’</em> with a chain of transmission from Dawūd bin Khalf that he was with Muḥammad bin Ziyād al-Lughawī when a man asked him about the ayah <strong>“</strong><strong>The</strong><strong> Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawā) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)</strong><strong> [Ta-ḥa 4].” </strong><em>He replied, “We accept it as he has informed us. The man said it means “he overcame and conquered [Istawlā].” al-Harawī replied, “Istawlā would only be correct if head any competitor or challenger to overcome so this cannot be correct.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad bin Aḥmad bin Naḍr al-Azdī transmits that he heard from Muḥammad bin Ziyād Al-Lughawī who said that <em>“Aḥmad Bin Dawūd enquired of me whether I could investigate whether the word “Istawā’ [he rose] has ever been recorded in the Arabic language as “Istawlā [He conquered]? I replied, “I swear by Allāh that I searched for this and could not find it in any place.”</em> [Fath al-Bārī of Ibn Ḥajr [17/177]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, the Hāfiẓ Ibn Qayyīm has recorded in his monumental work <em>‘As-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah’</em> over 42 replies to rebut the fact that ‘Istiwā’ in this verse does not mean ‘He conquered or overcame’. From amongst these are:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The third response is that al-Khattābī mentions in his book ‘Shiʿār ud-Dīn’ that, “Some have considered that Istiwā here means he overpowered basing this on some lines of poetry and these are not such that they can be used an evidential basis. If it meant as they say that he overpowered/conquered then this would render the verse confusing as Allāh’s knowledge and power is all encompassing then why would he need to ‘conquer’ his Throne whilst this is the case? The word ‘istawlā’ he overpowered would only be used for one who was stopped from something and then through struggle he achieved success by overpowering. So what is it that they say was ‘stopping or restricting’ Allāh? So these are the words of Al-Khattābī who was from amongst those who were known as a linguist.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,<em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The fifth response is that to say as they say falls under the forbidden action of explain the Qurān based on one’s own intellect. No Companion OF Muhammad, a successor of theirs or any scholar of the Muslims [mufassirs] have explained as they have. Let them know that Muhammad the prophet said that ‘let him take a seat in the fire of hell who explains the Qurān with his own opinion.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The tenth response is that the words ‘istawā’ and ‘istīlā’ have not been considered interchangeable in use by the scholars of the Arabic language and this is due to the reason that they both have distinct and separate features and meanings. Those who claim other than this are lying. Research the Qurān, Sunnah and Arabic language and syntax and you will never find that the word ‘istawā’ has come in the meaning of or interchangeable with ‘istīlā”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The fifteenth response is that Imam Abūl Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī has recorded a consensus that to take ‘istawā’ with the meaning of ‘istīlā’ is wholly incorrect.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The twenty seventh response is that the one amongst the creation who knows most about his lord is prophet Muhammad who has described in numerous traditions that Allāh is high and above and these traditions are an evidence of the explanation of such ayat”</em> [Mukhtaṣar as-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah, Muhammad al-Mawṣalī [2/321-326]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some have figuratively attempted to explain (Tāwīl) the fourth ayah and said that ʿAla is the action (Fʿil) and ar-Rahman is the one who does the act (Faʿil) and the Faʿil of Istawa is the ʿArsh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zarkashī refutes this (Tāwīl) and says, <em>“This is refuted from two angles the first is that the mu’awil (the one who did the tāwīl) made the attribute into an action and all of the scripts of the Qurān in Shām, ʿIrāq and Ḥijāz have ʿAla as a harf and if this was Fʿil (ie action) it would have been written with a Lām and ālif like for example at another instance it says, “Walʿalā Baḍuhum ʿala Bʿaḍ. The second reasons is the mu’awil rendered ʿArsh as marfū whereas none of the reciters ie Qura recite it like this.” </em>[Zarkashī, al-Burhān Fī ʿUlūm al-Qurān [2/81]  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the third reason is that it will contradict the other ayahs.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THOSE AYAT WHICH MENTION ALLĀH BEING ‘ISTAWĀ’ ABOVE THE HEAVENS. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything. </strong><strong>[Al-Baqarah:29]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2] </strong><strong>Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: &#8220;Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.&#8221; They both said: &#8220;We come, willingly.” [Fuṣilat:11]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already recorded the narration from <em>Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī</em> from Abu ʿĀlīyah that ‘istawā means he rose high above.’ In fact Ibn Qayyīm quotes an Ijmāʿ consensus that <em>“The meaning here is he rose high above.”</em> [Mukhtaṣar as-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah [2/320]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Baghawī explains the above ayat in his <em>‘Tafsīr Muʿālim ut-Tanzīl’</em> notes on Khāzin’ states, <em>“Many explainers of the Qurān from the Salaf and Ibn ʿAbbās explain this ayat to mean he rose above.”</em> [Tafsīr Muʿālim ut-Tanzīl [1/37]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Jarīr whilst explaining the above ayāt in his Tafsīr states in his Tafsīr <em>‘Jāmʿe ul-Bayān’</em> that, <em>‘The true meaning of the verse <strong>‘</strong></em><strong><em>He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything </em></strong><strong><em>[Al-Baqarah 29]</em></strong><em>’ is that he went high and rose above. Allāh showed his wisdom in creating the heavens and the earths. It is very strange that those who oppose this go against what is understood by the language of the Arabs, that is, he rose and was high. They prefer such meanings as they themselves give thinking that they will escape giving the verse a meaning which is not befitting to Allāh according to their own intellects. In fact, if he were to consider carefully his own explanation then in it he will find that which he was trying to avoid, for example, if he says istawā means he ‘turned towards/observed’ the heavens then we reply, was he ‘not observing/turned away’ from the heavens that you say he had to then ‘turn towards’ them? And if he replies, yes to this then we ask what is it that you base this on? In reality, his explanation causes more conflict and confusion and this is the very thing that he aimed to avoid in the first place. Praise be to Allāh I this way we reply to all those who oppose the truth and deviate from the true understanding of the Qurān. Abū Jʿafar said, that if someone were to ask us whether Allāh’s istiwā towards the heavens was before the heavens were created or after? Then we reply, it was after the heavens were created but Allāh said before he created the seven heavens that ‘</em><strong><em>Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: &#8220;Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.&#8221; They both said: &#8220;We come, willingly.’</em></strong><em> [Fussilāt 11]. </em><em>So the istiwā was after the creation of the smoke but before the formation of them into seven heavens. </em><em> </em><em>In regards to the word in the verse ‘Fasawwahunna’ i.e., [he made them] then this means that he created and originated them. He made them as he willed with perfection and suitability.  In Arabic ‘taswiyah’ means to make something correct and suitable, as it is said in the language ‘so and so made such a thing suitable’. So Allāh created the heavens in a most suitable way as he willed and planned and when they close he opens them as per his will.”</em> [Tafsīr at-Ṭabarī [1/192]</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE MENTION OF THE ‘GREAT THRONE’ OF ALLĀH. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] But if they turn away, say (O Muhammad): &#8220;Allāh is sufficient for me. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), in Him I put my trust and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne. </strong><strong>[At-Tawbah:129] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2] </strong><strong>And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. [Hūd:7]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[3] Had there been therein (in the heavens and the earth) âlihah (gods) besides Allāh, then verily both would have been ruined. Glorified is Allāh, the Lord of the Throne, (High is He) above all that they attribute to Him! [Al-Anbiyā:21]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[4]   </strong> <strong>Say: &#8220;Who is (the) Lord of the seven heavens, and (the) Lord of the Great Throne?&#8221; (86) They will say: &#8220;Allāh.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Will you not then fear Allāh (believe in His Oneness, obey Him, believe in the Resurrection and Recompense for every good or bad deed)?&#8221; </strong><strong>[Al-Muminūn:86-87]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[5] So Exalted is Allāh, the True King, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne! [Al-Muminūn:116]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[6] </strong><strong>Allāh, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne! [An-Naml:26] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[7] (He is Allāh) Owner of High Ranks and Degrees, the Owner of the Throne. [Al-Ghāfir:15] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[8] </strong><strong> Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted is He from all that they ascribe (to Him). [Az-Zukhruf:82]</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[9] </strong><strong>Owner of the Throne, the Glorious. </strong><strong>[AL-Burūj:16] </strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE MEANING OF ARSH [THRONE]. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the meaning itself of Throne is the indication of Allāh being high and above as is found in the verses and narrations. Then it should be known that Allāh being above his Throne shows he is above it and ‘bāin ʿanil Khalq’ separate and distinct from his creation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Bakr al-Ājurī said in his book <em>‘ash-Sharīʿah’</em> that, <em>“It is the madhab of the scholars that Allāh is above his Throne above the heavens. His knowledge encompasses all. He knows that which is in the heavens, earth and that which is beneath it. He knows that which is open and hidden. He knows that which is concealed in the chests and the deceitful eyes. He knows the affairs of the hearts and every beat it takes before it occurs. There is not a particle in the heavens or earth except that he is aware of it. He is above his Throne. He raises the deeds of the people up towards himself and he is aware of their deeds even more so than those angels whose duty it is to record such deeds.” </em>[Imām Abū Bakr al-Ājurī, ash-Sharīʿah [pg.288]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the first ayah above, <em>“It shows he is the originator and owner and this is why he is the owner of the great Throne. His Throne is a ceiling for all of creation including all of the heavens, earth and all that is what is between them. His knowledge is encompassing everything. His decree is upon everything and he is the creator of all.” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [2/404]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Tafsīr <em>‘Madārik ut-Tanzīl’</em> of Nasafī’ considers the ayah <em>“The Lord of the mighty Throne’ that the greatest of the creation was his Throne, which is a place of where duʿā is directed by those in the heavens.”</em> [Tafsīr Nasafī [2/152]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the second ayah above, <em>“Ibn Abbās (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhuma) said that the Throne was given this title as it is something which is high/above. Ismāʿīl bin Abī Khālid said he heard Sʿād Ṭā’ī say that the Throne is red/ruby in colour. Muḥammad bin Ishāq said concerning the verse <strong>‘And</strong></em><strong><em> He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds’, </em></strong><em>that, it is as he has described. There is nothing but water, upon this is the great Throne and above this is Allāh, the owner of all majesty and great, the wisest, the ablest and the one who is most merciful, wise all bountiful. He does as he wills and wishes.”</em> [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [2/437]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Nasafī states concerning the second verse, <em>“Meaning that his Throne was above the water, that is, before the creation of the heavens and the earth there was nothing but water beneath his Throne.”</em> [Tafsīr Nasafī [2/13]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is stated in <em>‘Tafsīr al-Futūhat al-Ilāhīyah lil Jamal’</em> that, <em>“He was where he is now, that is, above the seven heavens and the water was where it is now, that is, below his Throne.” </em>[Tafsīr al-Futūhat al-Ilāhīyah lil Jamal [2/382]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the fourth ayah above, <em>“He is the lord of the mighty Throne which is a ceiling for his creation. It is mentioned in the narration transmitted by Abū Dawūd that the prophet said ‘Your Lords status is the greatest and his Throne is above the heavens’. [after recording a few more narrations] Ḍihāk narrates from Ibn Abbās (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) that ‘it is called ʿArsh [Throne] due to it being lofty/high’. Aʿmash narrates from Kʿab al-Ahbār that the heavens and earth in relation to the Throne are as if a small lamp is lit hanging in between the heaven and the earth. Mujāhid states that ‘the heavens and earth in relation to the Throne are like a small ring which are left in a vast plain.” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [3/253]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the fifth ayah above, <em>“The Throne is a ceiling for the entire creation. It is called ‘ʿArshul Karīm’ [supreme Throne] as it is the most beautiful to look at greatest presence.  As Allāh has said ‘</em><em>And We send down water (rain) from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind to grow therein.’ [Luqmān:9]” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [3/259]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Nasafī states, <em>“It is called supreme Throne as all mercy from Allāh descends from there or that the closest most supreme angels surround it.” </em>[Tafsīr Nasafī [3/130]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Khāzin records that, <em>“Karīm, that is beautiful. Others have said it means high. It is recorded as such by Baghawī in his footnotes on Khāzin.”</em> [Tafsīr al-Khāzin [5/38]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shawkāni states in his <em>‘Tafsīr Fath al-Qadīr’ </em>that, <em>“It is called the supreme Throne because Allāh descends his mercy to his creation from it or it is supreme due to the fact that the one who is above it [the Throne] is the most supreme as it is said by the Arabs ‘the noble house’, meaning that the one who resides in it is noble.” </em>[Fath al-Qadīr [3/485]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the ninth ayah above, <em>“Glorious Throne, that is, he is the owner of the great Throne which is above all of creation.”</em> [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [4/496]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nasafī states, <em>“Glorious, that is, the creator of the Throne is the most glorious and greatest. Glorious here also refers to his Throne as well as himself. Meaning, that the one who is the owner of the Throne is even more Glorious than it.” </em>[Nasafī [4/346]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in Jalālayn it says, <em>“Glorious, that is, the owner and creator of the Throne is the most glorious. Glorious, meaning that the one who is completely deserving of the attribute of being highest and it is like this in ‘Jamal’ and ‘Maḥāsin at-Tā’wīl.”</em>  [Jalalayn [12/422], Jamal [4/515] and Maḥāsin at-Tā’wīl [18/6118]  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this article we wish to present the verification of the famous ḥadīth of “Prophetic Khilāfah will be for 30 years” so that the general people are aware of it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Dawūd as-Sijastānī in his Kitāb as-Sunan 2/290 Kitāb as-Sunnah, Bāb Fil-Khulāfa no.4646), Imām Abū Eesā Tirmidhī in Kitāb as-Sunan 2/46, Abwāb al-Fitan Bāb Mā Jā Fil Khilāfah no.2226), Imām Abū ʿAbdur Rahman Nasā’ī in Kitāb as-Sunan al-Kubrā 5/47 no.8155, Kitāb al-Manāqib Bāb 5, Imām Abū Ḥātim bin Ḥibbān Bastī in as-Ṣaḥīḥ (al-Ehsān no.6623, 6904, Mawārid az-Zamān no.1534,1535 and many other scholars of ḥadīth via various chains from Saʿīd bin Jamhān from Safīnah Abū ʿAbdir Rahman the servant of the Messenger of Allāh narrates</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Messenger of Allāh said “The Prophetic khilāfah will remain for 30 years and the Allāh will give power to whom He Wills. Saʿīd said Safīnah said to me “count the years, 2 years of Abū Bakr and 10 years of Umar and 12 years of Uthmān and Alī so on (i.e. 6 years). Saʿīd said “I said to Safīnah these people say that Alee was not a khalīfah to which he replied “The backs of Banū Zarqā and Banū Marwān have lied.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the wording of Abū Dawūd which differs slightly from the others  however the meaning is the same.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Ḥadīth Imām Tirmidhī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth is Ḥasan.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Ḥadīth of Safīnah concerning the Khilāfah is authentic and it is my position regarding the Khulāfa.”</em> [Jāmʿe Bayān al-ʿIlm Wa Faḍilihi [2/225], see also Kitāb as-Sunnah of ʿAbdullāh bin Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal [2/590 no.1400]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Abī ʿĀṣim said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth in terms of being written is </em><em>established. Saʿīd bin Jamhān narrates from Ḥamād bin Salamah, a-ʿĀwām bin Ḥaushab and Ḥashraj (bin Nabātah)”</em> [Kitāb as-Sunnah [2/549-550 no.1181,1185]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Ibn Taymīyyah has also graded this narration to be authentic [as-Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/744] of Shaikh al-Albānī]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ḥākim also graded it authentic [al-Mustadrak [3/71]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The narrator Saʿīd bin Jamhān was declared to be trustworthy Imam Yaḥya bin Maʿīn, Imam Nasā’ī, Imam Ibn Ḥibbān and Imam Aḥmad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abū Dawūd also declared him to be trustworthy</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdīyy said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“According to me there is no harm in him”</em> [Tahdhīb ut-Tahdhīb [1/14]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ḥāfiẓ Dhahabī said</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Truthful from the middle (level of narrator).</em>” [al-Kāshif [1/282].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Truthful individual”</em> [Taqrīb ut-Tahdhīb no.2279]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In contrary to these Imāms, Imām Abū Ḥātim ar-Rāzī said, <em>“Write his ḥadīth but he cannot be used evidence.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This criticism is rejected due to a number of reasons:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] This opposes the praise of the majority</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] Zailaʿī’s Naṣb ur-Rāyah mentions [2/439]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abū Ḥātim’s saying “He is not evidence” is not harmful because he has not mentioned the reason for this criticism, he has used these words for many of the trustworthy and established narrators of the authentic books of ḥadīth without mentioning the reason, e.g. Khālid al-Ḥada and others, and Allāh knows best.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Dhahabī said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When Abū Ḥātim declares someone to be trustworthy, then hold onto it because he only declares someone trustworthy who is in the Ṣaḥīḥ Ḥadīth. Similarly when he declares someone to be weak or if he he says “he cannot be used as evidence” then hold back until you know what others have said. If someone says they were trustworthy then do not take Abū Ḥatīms criticism as he was firm with regards to the narrators. He has said about a group of narrators from the Ṣaḥīḥs they were not evidence and not strong and other similar statements.”</em> [Siyar Āʿlām an-Nabūla [3/260]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence this criticism is rejected.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Some scholars have alleged Imām Abū Ḥātim was harsh hence his statement is rejected compared to Imām Aḥmad bin Ḥanbals statement who was balanced and investigative.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Sājī&#8217;s statement, <em>&#8220;His Ḥadīth have no supports.&#8221;</em> Is also general and it is rejected because it is not detailed neither is it severe jarḥ. When someone’s honesty is established not being supported does not affect him. As it has already been established that Saʿīd bin Jamhān is trustworthy with definitive evidences, him being alone in reporting this Ḥadīth does not affect it it anyway.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Deceit of the Ḥadīth Rejecters.</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The real aim and objective of the Ḥadīth rejecters through their deceitful plots and treachery it to show the authentic Ḥadīth of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) are fabricated. This is to lead the general Muslims away from the fundamentals of the dīn and to create doubts so that the people begin to think the dīn as unreliable and then they eventually stray from the straight path.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With this they then want to express and impose their deficient opinions amongst the people, which will eventually lead to no one acting on the Qurān or Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One person from amongst the rejecters and deniers of Ḥadīth is Tamannā ʿAmādī Phalwārī, he writes in his fabrication of a book, &#8216;Intizār Mahdī Masīh&#8217; [Awaiting The Mahdī Messiah] whilst vilifying and rebuking this very same Hadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;You have seen the name of Ḥashraj bin Nabātah Al-Kūfi with regards to these narrations. He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl, he is not evidence and rejected in Ḥadīth and you do not generally find any supports for his Hadīth.&#8221;</em> [pg.57]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like to say regarding Hashraj bin Nabātah Imām Ahmad said, <em>&#8220;Trustworthy.&#8221;</em> And Ibn Ma&#8217;īn said, <em>&#8220;Good, trustworthy and there is no harm in him.&#8221; </em>Abū Zurʿah said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him and he is grounded in Ḥadīth.&#8221;</em> Ibn ʿAdīyy said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him.&#8221;</em> Tirmidhī graded his Ḥadīth Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the other hand Abū Ḥatīm said, <em>&#8220;Good write his Ḥadīth but he is not used as evidence.&#8221;</em> as-Sājī said, <em>&#8220;Weak.&#8221;</em> Ibn Ḥibbān said, <em>&#8220;He has a few Ḥadīth, his narrations are rejected and it is impermissible to use his reports as evidence when he is alone in reporting them.&#8221;</em> Nasā‘ī said he is not strong and criticised him another time he said there is not harm in him and praised him. [Summarised from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥākim and Dhahabī authenticated one of his Ḥadīth. [Mustadrak [3/606], ʿAlī (I think Ibn Al-Madīnī) also declared him to be trustworthy [Mizān Al-‘Eitidāl [1/551]. Hāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr said, <em>&#8220;Truthful but errs.&#8221;</em> [Taqrīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The conclusion is, this narrator is trustworthy and truthful according to the majority of the scholars of Ḥadīth. Hence, Tamannā ʿAmādī is a liar in his claim that, <em>&#8221; He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are so many lies in Tamannā ʿĀmādī’s book that a collation of them would result in a book. For example in the same book on [pg.54] this individual writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Muʿammar bin Rāshid of Yemen was a freed slave who died in the year 154H. He was active in compiling and collating Ḥadīth, he would narrate from the well known liar Ābān bin ʿAbbās. Whilst narrating from him he would put forward the name of Thābit al-Banānī instead [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101] yet the scholars of Ḥadīth still considered him to be trustworthy.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say let us look at the referenced page from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb and it clearly says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Khalīlī has transmitted in in al-Irshād with an authentic chain from Aḥmad that he said to Yaḥya ibn Maʿīn when he was copying the manuscript of ʿAbdur Razzāq from Muʿammar from Ābān, “You are writing this when you know Ābān is a liar?” He (Ibn Maʿīn) replied, “May Allāh have mercy on you Oh Abū ʿAbdullāh, I am writing it in order to memorise it so that when a liar (like Tamannā ʿĀmādī) narrates on Muʿammar from Thābit from Anas, I will say to them you have lied the chain is via Ābān (and not Thābit).”</em> [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask the readers now, why is Muʿammar to blame here and what is his fault? What he heard he narrated it in the same way, when he heard from Ābān he would say Ābān and when he heard from Thābit he would say Thābit. If he scholar of Ḥadīth do not consider him to be trustworthy what should they consider him (meaning he was honest)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of Tamannā ʿĀmādī are liars whose tongues and pens are free, if they want to, they can try to prove the day as night and night as day but they must remember a day will come when there will most definitely be punishment. On that day one will be taken to account for every deed big or small.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this was the research into the correct position of Ḥashraj bin Nabātah, it must be remembered here that he is not alone in reporting the Ḥadīth, rather the following individuals support him</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] ʿAbd al-Wārith [Abū Dawūd no.4646]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] al-ʿAwām bin Ḥūwshab [Abū Dawūd no.4647]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Ḥamād bin Salamah [Musnad Aḥmad [5/220-221]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus the criticism against Ḥashraj is rejected from every angle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islām Ibn Taymīyyah said concerning this Ḥadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth is well known from the narrations of Ḥamād bin Salamah, ʿAbd al-Wārith bin Saʿīd and al-ʿAwām bin Ḥūwshab and others on the authority of Saʿīd bin Jamhān. Imām Aḥmad relied on this narration for evidence for the Khilāfah of the four Khulāfa ar-Rāshidīn and he also authenticated it. He would also use it as evidence against those people who would remain silent with regards to the Khilāfah of ʿAlī as the people began to differ. To the extent that Aḥmad said, “Whoever does not consider ʿAlī as the fourth Khulāfa is more astray than is domestic donkey.” He also forbade in establishing wedlock with such people. This issue is agreed upon by the jurists, scholars of the Sunnah, the people of knowledge and insight and the righteous people, this is also the position ie madhab of the general people. Some of the people of desires have opposed them in this, from them are the people of theological rhetoric and like them the Rāfidah who rebuke and censure the first three Khalīphs. Likewise, the Khawārij who abuse the Khilāfah of two son in laws ie Uthmān and ʿAlī (of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) or like some of the Nāṣibīs who attack the Khilāfah of ʿAli or like some of the ignorant ones upon the Sunnah who remain silent of the Khilāfah (of ʿAlī)”</em> [Majmūʿa Fatāwa [35/18-19]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The following scholars graded the Ḥadīth to be authentic and strong,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] at-Tirmidhī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Ibn Jarīr at-Ṭabarī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4] Ibn Abī ʿĀsim</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5] Ibn Ḥibbān</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6] al-Ḥākim</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7] Ibn Taymīyyah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8] ad-Dhahabī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9] Ibn Ḥajr al-ʿAsqalānī (Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/745 no.459] All praise be to Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some scholars have mentioned two supporting narrations for this Ḥadīth</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[1] On the authority of Abī Bakra (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) as transmitted by Baihaqī in Dalail an-Nabūwwah [6/342] the chain is weak due to ʿAlī bin Zaid bin Jadʿān</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[2] On the authority of Jābir bin ʿAbdullāh (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) [al-Wāhidī in al-Wasīṭ cited from as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/745] and its chain is weak.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the later people claim this Ḥadīth of Safīnah opposes the Ḥadīth of Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim which Jābir bin Samurah (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) narrates from the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This affair will not cease until there are 12 Khalīphs…. And all of them will be from the Quraish.”</em> [Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, Kitāb al-Imārah, Bāb an-Nās Tabʿa Li-Quraish Wa Khilāfah Fil Quraish [no.1821] and its origin is in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī [no.7222-7223]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is lack of knowledge on the part of the claimants because both authentic Ḥadīth can be reconciled. The Ḥadīth of Safīnah refers to the Khilāfah of the Khulāfa Rāshidīn and the Khilāfah on the Prophetic Manhaj and the Ḥadīth of Jābir refers to the unrestricted Khilāfah. Thus the first Ḥadīth restricts and negates any more years than the 30 years of the Khilāfah of the Khulāfa ar-Rāshidīn and the second Ḥadīth establishes the Khilāfah of the non Rāshidīn hence there is contradiction between the two Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr has alluded to this reconciliation in Fath al-Bārī [13/212 under Ḥadīth no.7223] as well as Hāfiẓ Ibn Taymīyyah in Majmūʿa Fatāwa. This is what is correct and for further details refer to Shaikh Muḥammad Nāṣir ud Dīn al-Albānī’s book Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/742-749 no.459] as he has discussed this issue in great detail.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already mentioned the authentic narration of Ibrāhīm bin Maisarah that the narration was regarding Muʿawīyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥafiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-Asqalānī cites from ʿUmar bin ʿAbdul ʿAzīz that when the name of Yazīd would be mentioned he would seek Allāhs mercy on him ie meaning he would say Rahimahullāh [Lisān al-Mīzān [6/294]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah has denied the report of 20 lashes which has already been mentioned in the previous paper. [Refer to Sārim al-Maslūl ʿAla Shātim ar-Rasūl [pg.574].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ignorant people like Aquilani Ahmed and others like him object as to why is Rahimahullāh said after his name and how can he be the Amīr al-Muʿminīn. The answer is quite simple as some Companions were alive at the time as well as senior Tabiʿeen and no doubt they were believers so how does can this title be denied for him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, some of the following illustrious and noble individuals referred to him as Amīr al-Muʿminīn just to name a few</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Nuʿmān bin Bashīr RadhiAllahu Anhu [64H]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">(2) Alī bin Ḥussain [93-100H]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Imām Laith bin Ṣaʿd [175H]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Imām Ibn Ḥazm [456H]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Qaḍi Abū Bakr bin ʿArabī [543H]</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All sorts of lies and fabrications are levied against Yazīd in order to discredit him. They also lie based on a deep rooted sentiment that Yazīd must be blamed for the death of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu. These slanderous and treacherous accusations were concocted by none other than the Rāfiḍah Shīʿa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The undercover Ḥanafī Aquilani (Aqeel Ahmed) cited a few reports which elucidated that Yazīd was responsible for the death of companions, we will inshaAllāh address this point later. Just a basic rebound for this is there were numerous companions who were with Yazīd at the time and supported him, so will the same be levied against them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also alleged against that he killed hundreds of people and desecrated the Prophets Masjid and his resting place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah refutes this claim and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“10,000 people were not killed and nor was blood spilled at the Prophets Masjid and grave and neither was there any fighting in the Prophets Masjid.”</em> [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/253]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah went on to say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“None of the Muslims rulers from amongst Banī Umayyah or Banī </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Abbās travelled to the K</em><em>ʿ</em><em>abah with the intention of desecrating it. The representative of Yazīd nor Hajjāj bin Yūsuf the representative of Abdul Mālik did this, in fact all of the Muslims respected the K</em><em>ʿ</em><em>abah.”</em> [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/254]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Aquilani Ahmed the deceptive undercover Ḥanafī boldly threw a hideous accusation of, “you cannot digest the criticism against Yazīd” and this individual based his foolish accusation on a number of narrations. From among the narrations he presented was that a person mentioned Yazīds bin Muʿawīyyahs name and said Amīr al-Muʿminīn whereupon Umar bin ʿAbdul ʿAzīz [101H] ordered for the man to be lashed 20 times. [Siyār ʿAlām an-Nabulā 4/35-40] as Aquilani Ahmed quoted</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, the authentic narration is as transmitted by Ibrāhīm bin Maisarah where he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have never seen Umar bin </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Abdul </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Azīz hit anyone except the man who cursed and abused Mu</em><em>ʿ</em><em>awīyyah and he (Umar bin </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Abdul </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Aziz) lashed him.”</em> [Sārim al-Maslūl ʿAla Shātim ar-Rasūl [pg.574], al-Bidāyah Wan-Nihāyah [8/139], Ṣawāʿiq Mehrqah [pg.221] and Nibrās [pg.551] of ʿAllāmah ʿAbdul ʿAziz Farhārwī [d.1239H], see also Nāhīyah ʿAnn Dham Muʿawīyyah [pg.20]</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: justify;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After cursing and hurling abuse at Yazīd, the Shīʿa Rāfiḍah then begin to abuse the governor of Kūfah, Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād who died in the year 64H. They allege that when he came to Kūfah at the behest of Yazīd he was ordered to capture Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu and to kill him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A few days ago it was relayed to us by the admin of <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.Salafiri.com">www.Salafiri.com</a> Facebook account that an undercover Ḥanafī and neo-Jahmī whilst posing as an Ahle Ḥadīth was vehemently arguing in declaring Yazīd a fāsiq and a drunkard and thus someone to be shunned etc etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This undercover person is known to troll and give the false idea that he is an Ahle Ḥadīth when in actual fact from this language as well as other reasons that he is as an ardent Ḥanafī. The readers may know him as Aquilani Ahmed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After seeing the screen shots of his conversation with the admin he ignorantly claims after retracting his initial position that although Yazīd may have been free of the murder of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu he is still responsible and accountable for not bringing the culprits to justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What this mischief maker and ignorant person Aquilani Ahmed (an alias for Aqeel Ahmed) failed to realise is that he did take account of the culprits who were none other than the Rāfiḍah Shīʿa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Secondly we find from the books of Ahlus Sunnah and the Shīʿa that Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād was clearly instructed on the contrary ie to only secure Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ṭabarī and Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Kathīr mention that Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu does not intend to come to us then we do not have any concern.” </em>(meaning coming to Kūfah to see the treacherous and deceptive Rāfiḍah Shīʿa) [Tārīkh al-Umam Wal Malūk [4/282], Al-Bidāyah Wan Nihayah [8/157]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shīʿa authors Mullā Bāqir Majlīsī, Muḥsin Amīn Āmālī and Shaikh Mufīd all mention,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“As for </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu does not intend to come to us then we also will not have any concern.”</em> [Kitāb al-Irshād [pg.251], Lūwaʿij al-Ashjān [pg.57] and Jalā al-ʿAyūn [pg.366]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the instructions and guidance which Yazīd sent to Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād was clear and specific and both the books of Ahlus Sunnah and the Shīʿa mention this, which was,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I (meaning Yazīd) have been informed that </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu has left for </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Irāq therefore place watchers at the frontiers. Keep a watch over the people you suspect (ie those who sent letters to </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu inviting him to Kūfah) and arrest those who have been blamed and have allegations levied against them. However, do not fight anyone that does not fight you and continue updating me with whatever happens. Wasalam.”</em> [al-Umam Wal Malūk [4/286],  Al-Bidāyah Wan Nihayah [8/165], Akhbār at-Tawāl [pg.242] and Maqtil Ḥussain [1/214] of Akhtab Khawārazimī  Shīʿa]</span></p>
