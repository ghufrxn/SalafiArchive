<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi </strong>an anonymous twitter user discharged a tirade of false allegations against al-Albani and Ibn Baz accusing them and Salafis of theological tashih and tad’if. The foul-mouthed individual by sharing unwarranted book scans tried to fool muslim twitter while incorrectly authenticating several reports which support his deviant creed. With the horrendous blunders, deliberate distortions, and beguiled manipulations <strong>Aqua@D1mashqi </strong>thought it was acceptable to refute Salafis, wishfully thinking of getting away with it and hoping we would not respond. This individual quite often displays a vile and abhorrent attitude towards Salafis. He boasts his tough attitude with an anonymous name all the while behind his little screen. What follows is a reply to his feeble twitter thread and his substandard attempt in authenticating the narration under discussion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At one point to increase his twitter credentials for his thread, his approach to prove the narration is authentic he says, “al-Qadi Iyad mentioned the narration…”. How does a scholar “mentioning” a narration make it authentic! Many scholars quoted and cited this narration in their respective books; he should have included all the references then. Already you can see how poor this point was.<strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi </strong>used the research and theological approach of the likes of Saqqaf, Mahmud Sa’id Mamduh, al-Ghumari, al-Kawthari, G.F. Haddad and others. Furthermore, the likes of Ahmad Zaini Dahlan and Sayyid Muhammad ibn Alawi al-Maliki also used this report to further their deviant creed and tried to authenticate it. There are many Sufi Ash’ari’s whether Deobandi or Barelwi who attempted to authenticate this narration and they also cite these narrations in support of their misguided beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It&#8217;s hypocritical for <strong>Aqua@D1mashqi </strong>to slanderously accuse Ibn Baz and al-Albani of theological tashih. Even though this libellous claim is mere desperation and a display of utter frustration at the knowledge and expertise of these two Shaykhs in Aqidah and Hadith, when he should know the clear deviation in aqidah of his own scholars. Saqqaf, Mamduh and some of the Ba Alawi clan have been criticised by the Sufi Ash’ari clergy for cursing and vilifying Mu’awiyyah RadhiAllahu Anhu, being Nasibis and questioning the position of Abu Bakr RadhiAllahu Anhu. Mamduh is also on record for attacking al-Ghazzali for being a Nasibi and having enmity for Ahlul Bayt. This is just the tip of the iceberg of these pro-Alid scholars who spared no early Sunni authority to push their rawafidh tendencies. How much theological tashih they used is already on record and acknowledged by their own scholars and clergy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi</strong> attacks al-Albani and Ibn Baz but in his thread, he uses later scholars to authenticate the narration without any recourse to the major scholars of hadith or their criticism of the narrator in the hadith. He argued foolishly, the authentication and weakening of hadith is different to the criticism and praise of a narrator! The readers can judge the ignorance of this statement themselves. These ideas are not unfamiliar from people who label themselves blind followers and lack independent reasoning yet discuss intricate details of hadith sciences and rijal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi</strong> quotes al-Ghumari from his <em>Nihayatul Amal</em> saying the narration is authentic without doubt. However, you will see the overwhelming criticism on Abdul Majid and the view of most of the scholars of hadith and al-Jarh wa’t Ta’dil and learn he is weak without doubt which in turn renders this narration weak without doubt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi </strong>attacks al-Albani since he exposed their failed attempt in trying to authenticate this narration. Despite this he still cannot formulate his argument properly and makes blunders himself. Al-Albani said no one narrated the second part of the hadith from Sufyan except Abdul Majid and at least 16 other narrators reported this hadith from Sufyan without the second part. Instead of attacking al-Albani due to personal desires and innate hate for him and his creed, his basic task was to prove him wrong by simply bringing at least one other chain to Sufyan with the complete wording, but he failed and unable to even fulfill this task.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi</strong> claims thre are two different mutun with the same isnad. So, that makes it two different hadith, right? If this is the case, why do over 16 narrators narrate only the first matn and not the second matn? He argues the scholars of hadith generally do this. So according to you al-Bazzar was the only one who used two mutun as one hadith with one isnad. Furthermore, this proves the weakness of Abul Majid b. Abi Rawwad who is still in both chains since you claim its two hadith. So, not only is there a weakness, but you also have a narrator who is criticized for making mistakes and adding words to a hadith that no one else narrated, and all those he opposed were stronger than him in narrating hadith, in fact some were Imams of hadith. Yet you still want to latch onto this theory and in the process attack al-Albani who beautifully explained this to you. The scholars of hadith who mention the second part of the hadith as a separate hadith do so because there are other chains of transmission for that matn and therefore there is corroborative evidence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi </strong>distorts reality and claims Abdul Majid made a few mistakes. This is incorrect and a huge error in comprehension. He fails to understand the criticism levied against Abdul Majid and further attempts to dismiss it as a few mistakes, this is a huge deliberate blunder and outright deception.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi </strong>exposes his muqallid ignorance of rijal and mustalah and embarrasses himself when he says adh-Dhahabi mentioned <strong>his name</strong> and said his irja does not affect his narrations. Wherein adh-Dhahabi was talking about Abdul Majid’s father, Abdul Aziz and not Abdul Majid. Our detractor even produces the scan and for our convenience highlights and underlines the relevant words, but for his own convenience it was a totally different narrator!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi </strong>claims Abdul Majid made a mistake once and made a mistake from Malik. This is another lie; he is on record for even fabricating reports and the scholars criticised him for many narrations. He then uses adh-Dhahabi’s <em>Man Takallam Fihi </em>but he also said he was a caller to irja and the scholars of hadith weaken narrators who called towards their bid’ah. Furthermore, the muhaqqiq of <em>Man Takallam Fihi</em> said in the footnote regarding adh-Dhahabi declaring him thiqah that he does not grade him thiqah in his other works like <em>al-Mughni</em>, <em>al-Kashif</em> and in <em>al-Mizan </em>where he says, <em>truthful murji like his father. </em>Similarly, and likewise, he brings an entry for him in his book of weak and abandoned narrators, which therefore nulls this view.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Hadith of Abdullah b. Mas’ud</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>From al-Bazzar, narrated to us, Yusuf b. Musa narrated to us Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad from (Aan) Sufyan from Abdullah b. as-Sa’ib from Zazan from Abdullah (b. Mas’ud) from the Prophet; Verily </strong><strong>Allah has Angels that roam [the earth] conveying the salam of my ummah to me. He said and he said Allah’s Messenger said, my living is good for you and my death is good for you, your actions are presented to me, whatever I see of good I thank Allah for, and whatever I see of bad I pray for you</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Note:</strong> “He said and he said” are the exact words of the narration</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first thing to note is that this narration is different to the wording of Bakr b. Abdullah al-Muzani and that of Anas since this has the additional wordings in the first part of the hadith that the other two do not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad is in the chain who is very weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abdul Majid b. Abi Rawwad</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ibn Ma’in’s View on Abdul Majid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdul Ghani al-Maqdisi said, <strong><em>Yahya b. Ma’in said thiqah, he transmitted from a group of weak narrators, he was the most knowledgeable about the hadith of Ibn Jurayj and he would openly declare his Irja</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. Al-Fasi repeats this statement of Ibn Ma’in<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ad-Duri said I heard Yahya [ibn Ma’in] say Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad said, <strong><em>thiqah</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ad-Duri also transmits that Ibn Ma’in said <em>Abdul Majid was the better transmitter of the reports of Ibn Ulayyah from Ibn Jurayj. It was said to Yahya [b. Ma’in], do you think Abdul Majid is really like that? He replied he was the <strong>most knowledgeable</strong> of people concerning the hadith of Ibn Jurayj, however <strong>he did not exert effort on hadith himself</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><em>.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Fadhal al-Abbas b. Mus’ab transmits something very similar to ad-Duri in that he mentions Abdul Majid had the most accurate book of the reports of al-Ulayyah from Ibn Jurayj and when asked Ibn Ma’in replied, he was the <strong>most knowledgeable person regarding the books of Ibn Jurayj</strong> except that <strong>he did not exert effort in hadith himself</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Adh-Dhahabi quotes Abbas b. Mus’ab from his <em>Tarikh Marwa</em> that Abdul Majid heard the books of Ibn Jurayj from his teachers<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Junayd heard <em>Ibn Ma’in mention Abdul Majid and then mentioned his <strong>nobility and stature</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><strong>[8]</strong></a>. Ibn Ma’in said <em>Ali b. al-Madini said to me what <strong>innovation</strong> did Abdul Majid have that al-Humaydi noticed? <strong>Al-Humaydi just warned against him</strong></em>. Ibn Ma’in said <em>he was truthful</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Junayd transmits from Yahya, he said <em>Abdul Majid was truthful</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Junayd transmits that <em>Ibn al-Ghalabi said something to Ibn Ma’in, to which he replied, it was al-Humaydi and others who fell into this, their intent was for him to <strong>exert effort [in hadith].</strong> He is himself <strong>thiqah</strong>. </em><strong><em>He adopted the view of Irja</em></strong><em>. He transmitted from a group of <strong>large number</strong> of <strong>weak narrators </strong>but he himself is thiqah</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ad-Darimi said <em>I said to Ibn Ma’in how is Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad? He said <strong>thiqah</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Muhriz said <em>I heard Yahya b. Ma’in say Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad I swear by Allah I do not know of a man truthful and who speaks little. If he is asked about something he transmitted, he is silent. He is from the most knowledgeable of people on [the hadith of] Ibn Jurayj</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abi Khaythamah transmits from Ibn Ma’in who said, <em>he was from the <strong>worshippers</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah b. Ahmad b. Hanbal asked Ibn Ma’in about him and he said <strong><em>thiqah there is no harm in him</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>. On another occasion Ibn Ma’in said Abdul Majid essentially transmitted from Ibn Jurayj’s books<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Adiyy quotes Ahmad b. Sa’d b. Abi Maryam from Ibn Ma’in saying Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad is <strong><em>thiqah</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></strong>, <em>he transmits from a <strong>group of weak [narrators</strong>], he is most knowledgeable concerning the <strong>hadith</strong> of Ibn Jurayj, <strong>and he was open about his Irja</strong>,<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><strong>[18]</strong></a> he heard from Ma’mar</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>. Ibn Adiyy transmits from Muhammad b. Ali from Uthman <em>I said to Ibn Ma’in how is Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad, he said, <strong>thiqah</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Mughlata’i al-Hanafi said, <em>Yahya b. Ma’in in the riwayah of Abdul Khaliq b. Mansur said, <strong>He is thiqah when he transmits from the thiqah</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Most of these statements have been compiled in the compilation of the various statements of Yahya b. Ma’in on narrators, although I have quoted them from each individual book, the reader who wishes to save time may refer to the mawsu’at<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Khalfun mention him in his book of thiqah narrators<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Khalili’s View on Abdul Majid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khalili said<strong><em>, thiqah but makes mistakes in hadith</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khalili then quotes the example of the mistake of Abdul Majid, the hadith of actions are by intentions which Abdul Majid made a mistake in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the introduction of the same book al-Khalili shows examples of thiqah narrators who made mistakes, he lists Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad and quotes a hadith in which Abdul Majid narrates from Ibn Jurayj and he from Ibn Abi Zubayr…., Abdul Majid made a mistake in this hadith because other thiqah narrators transmit differently from Ibn Abi Zubayr (Ibn Jurayj is thiqah). Abdul Majid is a good muhaddith the son of a muhaddith, he did not see the likes of himself, but he made mistakes, and he was not transmitted [used as a narrator] in the Sahihs [al-Bukhari and Muslim]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khalili continues and gives another example and said, he made a mistake in the hadith transmitted from Malik and many people from Yahya b. Sa’id al-Qattan, the Judge of Madinah, from Muhammad b. Ibrahim at-Taymi from Alqamah b. Waqas from Umar b. al-Khattab from the Nabi Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam that actions are based on intentions. This is a fundamental from the principles of the religion and it revolves around Yahya b. Sa’id who said Abdul Majid made a mistake in this hadith from Malik from Zayd b. Aslam from A’ta b. Yasar from Abu Sa’id al-Khudri Radhiallahu Anhu from the Nabi Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who said actions are based on intentions<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>. Nuh b. Habib and Ibrahim b. Atiq transmitted it from him, and it is not preserved (ie inauthentic) from the hadith of Zayd b. Aslam through this transmission, <em>and <strong>it is a mistake or error while a thiqah narrates from a thiqah</strong></em> <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>An-Nasa’i’s Position </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An-Nasa’i said <strong><em>there is no harm in him</em></strong> another time he said <strong><em>thiqah</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ahmad b. Hanbal on Abdul Majid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad <em>said <strong>there is no harm in him</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>. Al-Maqdisi and Al-Mizzi both said, <strong><em>thiqah</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><em><strong>[30]</strong></em></a><em> and <strong>he was extreme in his Irja<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></strong>, they say </em>[i.e. the murjiyyah say about the people of Sunnah]<em> they are<strong> the doubters [about iman] </strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>.Some reports mention, <strong><em>they are those who have ishkal [problems in iman]</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Adh-Dhahabi takes time to explain this statement, <em>they are the doubters refers to the statement of the scholars [i.e. Ahlus Sunnah], I am a believer inshaAllah</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to note, none of the direct students of Ahmad narrated thiqah from him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yusuf b. Hasan b. Abdul Hadi brings an entry for in his book and says, Ahmad b. Abi Yahya transmits from Ahmad b. Hanbal that he said, thiqah, he is associated with al-Irja and they say, he is from the people who had problems. Al-Marudhi said, <em>I asked Ahmad how he was. He said, <strong>he was a murji and I wrote from him</strong>. The people said <strong>he ruined his father [with Irja]</strong> and <strong>Ibn Uyaynah was contentious with him</strong>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34"><strong>[34]</strong></a> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Dawud’d View on Abdul Majid </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-A’jurri said <em>I asked Abu Dawud about him, and he said he was <strong>thiqah</strong>, Ahmad and Ibn Ma’in transmitted from him. Ibn Ma’in said he was the most knowledgeable regarding Ibn Jurayj</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Adh-Dhahabi mentions Abu Dawud said <em>he was <strong>thiqah, a caller to irja</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Shahin has an entry for him in book of thiqah narrators, he says, <em>thiqah, Yahya said thiqah</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ibn Hajr’s View</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr quotes the various criticisms and then says, I say: and then proceeds to quoter further statements of critical disparagement, indicating his inclination of the weakness of Abdul Majid despite being thiqah<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr gives him an entry in his summarised view and says, <strong>truthful but makes mistakes, he was a murji</strong>. Ibn Hibban was excessive[ly harsh] and said he was matruk – rejected<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bashar A’wad al-Ma’ruf and Shu’ayb al-Arna’ut contest Ibn Hajr’s grading and assessment and say, <em>rather he is thiqah, he made mistakes in hadith as men do make mistakes, and he was the strongest of people while transmitting from Ibn Jurayj. There was hostility towards him due to his Irja and some [scholars of hadith] weakened him due to this reason. However, Ahmad, Ibn Ma’in, Abu Dawud, an-Nasa’i and al-Khalili said he was thiqah, ibn Adiyy said, most of those who abandoned him was due to his Irja</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the edition of the <em>Taqrib</em> with the marginal notes of Abdullah b. Salim al-Basri, Muhammad Amin Mirghani and introduction of Muhammad Awwamah, they add in the notes, <em>the author categorized him from the <strong>third level of mudallis narrators</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The View of Muslim on Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The 5 main authors of hadith books transmit from him. Muslim used him in one narration in Kitab ul-Hajj but this was linked or supported by <strong>Hisham b. Muslim al-Makhzumi</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a>. This hadith in Muslim is from Ibn Jurayj, so both Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad and <strong>Hisham b. Sulayman al-Makhzumi</strong> transmit from Ibn Jurayj. This shows Muslim also held him to be weak or that he at least had mistakes and needed support.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Maqdisi said, <strong><em>Muslim transmits from him while corroborating with Hisham b. Sulayman al-Makki<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a>.</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Mizzi further alludes to this and says, <em>“Muslim transmitted from him while corroborating with others [narrators] and others [i.e. the four books of Sunan] transmitted from him except al-Bukhari”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Taqi ud-Din Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Hasani al-Fasi also said, <em>Muslim transmitted from him while corroborating with Hisham b. Sulayman al-Makki and the four Sunans</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muslim adopts a cautionary measure and still doubles up and uses Hisham in line with Abdul Majid to alleviate any shortcomings in him. This shows Muslim did not use him as his main source of evidence and he only uses him in a chain wherein he transmits from Ibn Jurayj. Furthermore, we also know Abdul Majid b. Abi Rawwad was the most knowledgeable regarding the hadith of Ibn Jurayj as Ahmad<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a>, Ibn Ma’in<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a>, ad-Daraqutni<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a>, Ibn Adiyy<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a>, al-Mizzi<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a> and others have said. This also shows Abdul Majid made mistakes in the hadith from Ibn Jurayj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muslim brings an entry for him in his book on Kunna and Asma and says, <em>Abu Abdul Hamid Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad. He transmits from Ibn Jurayj, he was from Makkah and believed in Irja</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Criticism of Abdul Majid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Zurah ar-Razi has an entry for him in his book on <strong>weak narrators</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a>. He also declared him to be a murji<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ya’qub b. Sufyan al-Fasawi said, <em>“<strong>a stubborn innovator and a caller [to innovation].<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></strong> I heard Hammad b. Hafs say, I heard Yahya b. Sa’id al-Qattan say, <strong>Kazzab </strong>– <strong>Liar</strong> – meaning Abdul Majid”.</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The criticism of being declared a liar by Yahya b. Sa’id al-Qattan holds value and is of great importance because Abu Abdullah b. Bakir al-Baghdadi asked ad-Daraqutni about the stronger and grounded transmitters and companions of Ibn Jurayj. Ad-Daraqutni quotes Ibn Ma’in listing Abdul Majid and Yahya b. Sa’id al-Qattan. This shows al-Qattan was more familiar with the affair of Abdul Majid<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad b. Yahya b. Abi Umar [adh-Dhuhali] was asked about Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad? He said, <strong><em>he is weak</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Sa’d said, <em>he has numerous hadith, but <strong>he is weak</strong> and a <strong>murji</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">in <em>Mukhtasar Ibn Sa’d</em> it mentions, <em>Ahmad <strong>said thiqah, but was extreme in his irja</strong>, Ibn Ma’in <strong>said thiqah there is no harm in him</strong>, he <strong>narrates from a large group of weak narrators</strong>, and he was the <strong>most knowledgeable concerning the hadith of Ibn Jurayj</strong>, he <strong>would be open and declare his irja</strong>, but <strong>he did not focus or exert himself in hadith</strong>. Abu Dawud said <strong>thiqah</strong>, al-Khalili said <strong>thiqah but made mistakes in hadith</strong>. Ad-Daraqutni said he <strong>cannot be used as evidence, but he is relied upon</strong>. Ibn Hajr said<strong>, truthful a murji</strong>, Ibn Hibban was excessive <strong>when said he was matruk</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad b. Shabbuwiyyah said, <em>I saw <strong>Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad </strong>and<strong> Salm b. Salim al-Khurasani both were callers to al-Irja</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[60]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Marudhi said <em>I asked Ahmad about Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad, he said, <strong>he was a murji and I wrote from him</strong>. The people said <strong>he ruined his father [with Irja]</strong> and <strong>Ibn Uyaynah had a dispute with him</strong>. Al-Marudhi said, Abu Abdullah [Ahmad] would transmit from a murji if he was not a caller or someone who defended [or debated this view]</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61">[61]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Ahmad al-Hakim said, <strong><em>he is not strong according to them</em></strong><em> [i.e. the scholars of hadith]</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Dawud said, <em>I heard Ahmad when he was asked about Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz, he said he was the most knowledgeable concerning [the hadith of] Ibn Jurayj, <strong>however he did not exert himself in what he narrated, and the people of Makkah accused him of [having aqidah issues related to] qadr. It was said to Ahmad, do his narrations have credibility? </strong></em>[Are his narrations taken] <strong><em>Ahmad replied, I don’t know.  I heard Ahmad say he transmits from him</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63">[63]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Dawud said<strong> <em>a caller to irja</em></strong><em> and Abdul Aziz was <strong>affected [with Irja]</strong> by his son and the people of Khurasan did not narrate from him</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64">[64]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another time Abu Dawud said, <strong><em>Abdul Majid was the head or leader [of the people of] Irja</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65">[65]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>al-Bukhari’s View on Abdul Majid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Bukhari said<em>, <strong>he had Irja</strong>, he transmitted from his father and <strong>al-Humaydi spoke about him </strong>[i.e. criticised him]</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66">[66]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Bukhari further brings an entry for him in his smaller <strong>book of weak narrators</strong> and repeats the criticism, <strong><em>he had al-Irja</em></strong><em>, he transmitted from his father and <strong>al-Humaydi criticised him</strong></em>. One manuscript mentions, he [al-Humaydi] transmitted from him<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67">[67]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zubayr Ali Za’i in his checking of <em>Kitab adh-Dhu’afa</em> under Abdul Majids entry he says, <em>he is weak due to his memory and the majjority [of the scholars of hadith] weakened him. Al-Uqayli 3:96 brings an entry for him. Muslim transmitted from while corroborating with others [i.e. another narrator] he was used in the four sunans ….. and he is also a mudallis (refer to Tabaqat al-Mudallisin with my checking 82:3)</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68">[68]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The muhaqqiq of the Markaz Ihsan edition Dr. Salim b. Saleh al-Ammari said the words, [al-Humaydi] “and he transmitted from him” were not in at least 4 manuscripts and in the transmission of Musabbih b. Sa’id.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69">[69]</a> Another edition also does not mention these words.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70">[70]</a> al-Mizzi does mention this in Abdul Majid’s entry but in the section about those who transmitted from Abdul Majid<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71">[71]</a>, two pages later al-Mizzi brings this statement of al-Bukhari but he does not mention these words<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72">[72]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Adiyy says <em>I heard Ibn Hammad say al-Bukhari said Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad Abu Abdul Hamid <strong>he had Irja </strong>with him and <strong>al-Humaydi criticised him</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73">[73]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Adh-Dhahabi and Ibn Hajr quote al-Bukhari saying <em>there are some <strong>contradictions in his hadith,</strong> and I do know except <strong>only 5 hadith</strong> that <strong>are authentic</strong> from him</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74">[74]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Mughlata&#8217;i al-Hanafi also quotes al-Bukhari saying <em>there are some <strong>contradictions in his hadith,</strong> and I do know except <strong>only 5 hadith</strong> that <strong>are authentic</strong> from him</em> <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75">[75]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, this statement cannot be found in the printed works of al-Bukhari. This does not lead to the notion al-Bukhari did not say this. Al-Mizzi, Ibn Hajr and Mughlatai, have followed up on this and continued to quote it and so the possibility that al-Bukhari said this is at the very least questionable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The View of ad-Daraqutni</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ad-Daraqutni said <em>Ibrahim b Ahmad said Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad <strong>transmitted munkar [rejected] hadith from Malik</strong></em>. Then he gives 2 examples<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76">[76]</a>. Although in this report under discussion he does not transmit from Malik, it shows ad-Daraqutni’s view on Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ad-Daraqutni quotes the chain transmitted by Abdul Majid b. Abi Rawwad concerning the hadith actions are based on intentions which he transmits via Malik and then singles out Abdul Majid and said, <strong><em>no one supported him in</em></strong> this [in this chain] and as for companions of Malik they were preservers of hadith (and they did not transmit it through this chain)<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77">[77]</a>. This shows ad-Daraqutni wanted to show Abdul Majid opposed the strong preservers of hadith and in this specific case the companions and stronger students of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is further supported by ad-Daraqutni’s overall position concerning him when al-Barqani asked him, he said, <strong><em>he cannot be used as evidence however he can be relied upon</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78">[78]</a>, <strong><em>his father [Abdul Aziz] is also weak and his son is better</em></strong><em>, it was said <strong>he was a murji and his father is not relied upon</strong>, <strong>he is abandoned,</strong> and both were Makkan narrators</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79">[79]</a>.The notion that ad-Daraqutni says, <strong><em>his father is also weak</em></strong>, proves he was weak with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Regarding the hadith actions are by intentions, al-Bulqini said, <em>ad-Daraqutni transmits Malik’s hadith which are not in his al-Muwatta, the wording of the hadith, actions are by intentions for whatever is intended. Ad-Daraqutni continued and said, <strong>this is a solitary or lone report of Abdul Majid from Malik</strong>. We don’t know anyone else who transmitted this from Abdul Majid besides Nuh b. Habib and Ibrahim b. Muhammad al-Atiq<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80"><strong>[80]</strong></a></em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr quotes ad-Daraqutni who transmits with his own chain of transmission in <em>al-Ifrad</em> a narration from Abdul Majid from Ibn Jurayj from A’ta from Ibn Abbas, he said, <em>the speech of the Qadariyyah is kufr, the speech of the Haruriyyah [khawarij] is misguidance, the speech of the Shi’a is tarnished with sins and infallibility is from Allah and know that everything is with Allah’s decree.</em> Ad-Daraqutni said, <strong><em>Abdul Majid is alone in reporting this</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81">[81]</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr after this report said, <strong><em>the rest of the narrators are thiqah</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82">[82]</a>. Meaning, Abdul Majid was <strong>not thiqah</strong> according to Ibn Hajr!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hatim ar-Razi’s Position</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hatim ar-Razi said, <strong><em>He is not strong</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83">[83]</a><em>, his hadith are to be written [noted]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84"><strong>[84]</strong></a> and al-Humaydi criticised him</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85">[85]</a>. Ibn Hajr in <em>Tahdhib ut-Tahdhib</em> quotes the criticism of Abu Hatim twice, only the part when he said, <strong><em>he is not strong</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86">[86]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The View of Ibn Hibban</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Hibban said<em>, <strong>severely rejected in hadith [munkar al-hadith jiddan], </strong>he <strong>confused</strong> and <strong>mixed narrations</strong> while <strong>narrating rejected narrations</strong> on the authority of famous transmitters and therefore <strong>he deserves to be abandoned</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87">[87]</a><em>. His forefathers were engrossed in Irja</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88">[88]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hibban then gives an example of a narration he narrates via Ibn Jurayj from A’ta from Ibn Abbas that the Qadariyyah are upon kufr, the Shi’a are destroyed, the Haruriyyah [Khawarij] are upon innovation and we do not know the truth except for it to be with the Murjiyyah. Isam b. Yusuf al-Balkhi transmitted this incident from him, and this is fabricated, Ibn Abbas did not say this, nor A’ta nor Ibn Jurayj<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89">[89]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ibn Adiyy’s Position</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Adiyy cites some of hadith of Abdul Majid and then concludes his position on him by saying<em>, <strong>all of these hadith are not preserved</strong> [i.e. authentic], <strong>he was stronger in the hadith of ibn Jurayj</strong> while he has other hadith transmitted from other than him and <strong>most of what is rejected from him was due to his Irja</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90">[90]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Adiyy and other scholars have subsequently quoted from him, a very important incident where Abdul Majid issued a legal edict for the killing of Waki [an Imam from the Imams of Ahlus Sunnah].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Uqayli Rendering Abdul Majid Weak</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Uqayli brings an entry for him in his <em>Kitab</em> <em>ad-Dhu’afa</em> and quotes al-Bukhari’s criticism with his own chain of transmission to al-Bukhari, that he said <strong>al-Humaydi criticised him</strong> and that <strong>he had Irja<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn91" name="_ftnref91">[91]</a></strong>. He then quotes Muhammad b. Yahya b. Abi Umar [adh-Dhuhali] who declared Abdul Majid <strong>weak</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn92" name="_ftnref92">[92]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, it is evident al-Uqayli including an entry for him in his <em>Kitab ad-Dhu’afa</em> alone and then transmitting the statements above proves he considered him to be weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Juzjani’s View</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Juzjani said, <em>Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad was a <strong>worshipper</strong> and <strong>extreme in Irja</strong> <strong>and his son, Abdul Majid was also like him</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93">[93]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ibn al-Jawzi on Abdul Majid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Jawzi brings an entry for him in his book of weak and abandoned narrators and says, <em>he narrates from Malik<strong>, </strong>Yahya said<strong> thiqah, </strong>ar-Razi said, <strong>he is not strong and al-Humaydi criticised him. </strong>Ibn Hibban said<strong> he confused and mixed reports and narrated abandoned reports from well -known transmitters and thus deserves to be rejected</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94">[94]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Jawzi repeats these charges in <em>al-I’llal al-Mutanahiyyah</em>. For one report he says, <em>the author says this hadith is <strong>not authentic</strong> and <strong>al-Humaydi criticised Abdul Majid </strong></em>and then quotes Ibn Hibban’s criticism<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn95" name="_ftnref95">[95]</a>. Ibn al-Jawzi repeats the same criticism for another report which Abdul Majid transmits<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn96" name="_ftnref96">[96]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Hakim said, <strong>he is from those who you remain silent about [ie criticised]</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97">[97]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As-Saji said, <strong><em>he would narrate abandoned narrations from Malik</em></strong><em> from, Zayd b. Aslam from A’ta b. Yassar from Abu Sa’id [al-Khudri], Actions are by intentions. <strong>The hadith he would narrate from Ibn Jurayj would not be supported</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn98" name="_ftnref98">[98]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abdul Barr said, <em>this Ibn Abi Rawwad would transmit hadith from Malik and <strong>make mistakes in them</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn99" name="_ftnref99"><strong>[99]</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr quotes Ibn Abdul Barr in the following way, <em>he would transmit <strong>wrong or erroneous hadith from Malik</strong>, his <strong>well-known error</strong> or mistake was transmitting the hadith of actions are by intentions</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn100" name="_ftnref100">[100]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr also said after citing this hadith, <em>this hadith is Gharib through this chain of transmission, ad-Daraqutni transmitted it in Ghara’ib Malik from Muhammad b. Makhlad from Ibrahim b. Muhammad b. Marwan b. Hisham. He erred here instead of something correct. Ad-Daraqutni continued and said, <strong>this is a solitary or lone report of Abdul Majid from Malik</strong>. We don’t know anyone else who transmitted this from Abdul Majid besides Ibrahim b. Muhammad al-Atiq and Nuh b. Habib…..he erred due to a third reason too, al-Hakim transmitted in his Tarikh Nisabur from the report of Ali b. al-Hasan adh-Dhuhali from Abdul Majid. As for Abdul Majid Ahmad and Ibn Ma’in, an-Nasa’i declared him thiqah while Abu Hatim and ad-Daraqutni criticised him. It is said or they say there is a mistake in this from Malik, while the chain from Yahya b. Sa’id from Malik is what is preserved<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn101" name="_ftnref101"><strong>[101]</strong></a></em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Bulqini cites this report [of Abu Sa’id al-Khudri] with the chain mentioned above. He declared Abdul Majid to be <strong><em>thiqah</em></strong> but also says <strong>he erred in preserving this hadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn102" name="_ftnref102">[102]</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Nu’aym said, <em>this is a Gharib of the hadith of Malik from Zayd, it is a lone report of Abdul Majid, what is well-known and authentic is the chain of transmission in the Muwatta from Yahya b. Sa’id</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn103" name="_ftnref103">[103]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abi Hatim transmits from his father Abu Hatim that he said, <strong><em>it is batil and has no basis…. </em></strong>[Then he quotes the authentic chain]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn104" name="_ftnref104">[104]</a> ad-Daraqutni also mentioned this hidden defect in his book<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn105" name="_ftnref105">[105]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Nu’aym al-Hafiz said in his book under the name of Abdul Majid, <strong><em>he had Irja with him, he was Mudhtarib in hadith</em></strong>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn106" name="_ftnref106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Salamah b. Shabib said, <em>I was with Abdur Razzaq and the news of the death of Abdul Majid came to us in the year 206H, so Abdur Razzaq said All praise be to Allah, the Ummah of Muhammad is relieved of Abdul Majid</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn107" name="_ftnref107">[107]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Mughlata’i mentions, <em>in the book of al-Lalaka’i Ibn Abi Umar al-Adani said,</em> <strong><em>he is weak</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn108" name="_ftnref108">[108]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Makula further supports what the early scholars of hadith mention that Abdul Majid’s father was attributed with good until his son affected him with irja, Ibn Makula continue to say, his son Abdul Majid was a caller to Irja and he affected his father with it and then some people also attributed it to him [ie. Irja]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn109" name="_ftnref109">[109]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Fasi mentions Ibn Abi Umar al-Adani was Muhammad b. Abi Umar al-Adani and he was from those who transmitted from Abdul Majid b. Abi Rawwad<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn110" name="_ftnref110">[110]</a>. This shows despite narrating from him, al-Adani declared him to be a liar. So, the notion of some ignorant people that just by narrating from someone does not make them thiqah. Al-Mizzi also mentions al-Adani from those who transmitted from Abdul Majid<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn111" name="_ftnref111">[111]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zayn ud-Din al-I’raqi said, <em>although Muslim transmits from Abdul Majid in his Sahih and Ibn Ma’in and an-Nasa’i declared him <strong>thiqah, yet many [scholars of hadith] declared him to be weak</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn112" name="_ftnref112">[112]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Adh-Dhahabi</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Adh-Dhahabi brings an entry in his two books of weak narrators, <em>Mughni Fidh-Dhu’afa</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn113" name="_ftnref113">[113]</a> and in his <em>Diwan adh-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn114" name="_ftnref114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Adh-Dhahabi has an entry for him in his <em>Mizan</em> and summarises his view in the following way, <em>truthful, a murji like his father, Imam Yahya b. Ma’in and others said he was thiqah, Abu Dawud said thiqah a caller to al-Irja, Ibn Hibban said, he deserves to be abandoned and severely rejected in hadith since he would mix and confuse reports and would transmit rejected narrations from well-known narrators</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn115" name="_ftnref115">[115]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Adh-Dhahabi another time said<strong><em>, thiqah murji</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn116" name="_ftnref116">[116]</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another work on the narrators in the 6 books of hadith he says after bringing Abdul Majid&#8217;s entry, <em>Ahmad said he was <strong>thiqah</strong> and <strong>extreme in his Irja</strong>, Abu Hatim said <strong>he is not strong</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn117" name="_ftnref117">[117]</a>. The researcher of <em>al-Kashif</em> made a mistake when he said Ibn Hajr said he was matruk in <em>at-Taqrib</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn118" name="_ftnref118">[118]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Adh-Dhahabi further displays his disapproval and condemnation for Abdul Majid based on the view of Harun b. Abdullah al-Hammal who said<em>, I have not seen anyone fear Allah like Waki and Abdul Majid was more fearful [of Allah] than him</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn119" name="_ftnref119">[119]</a>. Adh-Dhahabi targets Abdul Majid and censures him and says, <strong><em>I say: the fear of Allah of Waki while also being an Imam of the Sunnah and at the forefront in opposition the fear of this murji, may Allah forgive him and may Allah forbit us from opposing the Sunnah</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn120" name="_ftnref120">[120]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Khazraji brings his entry and says, <em>Ahmad and Yahya said he was thiqah <strong>but extreme in his Irja</strong>, ad-Daraqutni said he is reliable but not used as evidence</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn121" name="_ftnref121">[121]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ali b. Salah ud-Din al-Kawkabani as-San’ani on the marginal notes of <em>Khulasah Tadhhib Tahdhib</em> titled, <em>Ittihafu al-Khasah Bi-Tashih al-Khulasah</em> quotes the statement of Abdur Razzaq upon the death of Abdul Majid [as has preceded]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn122" name="_ftnref122">[122]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Rajab in his <em>Sharh I’llal</em> includes an entry for Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad among narrators <strong>who although are thiqah, there is weakness in hadith from some of their teachers as opposed to their narrations from other teachers</strong>. Then he mentions Abdul Majid and says, <em>from them is Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad. Ibn Adiyy singled him out to be the strongest in the narrations of Ibn Jurayj, <strong>meaning he is not strong [when narration] from others and others decisively declared him weak</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn123" name="_ftnref123">[123]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even Nur ud-Din Itr express his dismay and is forced to say after quoting Ibn Hajr from his <em>Taqrib, rather what is preferred is that he is thiqah but made mistakes in hadith, most of them declared him thiqah and used him as evidence refer to al-Kamil</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn124" name="_ftnref124">[124]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Qanun adh-Dhu’afa</em> mentions, <strong><em>Matruk [rejected]</em></strong><em> Ibn Hibban said he deserves to be abandoned severely rejected. Abu Hatim said he is not strong write his hadith as ad-Daraqutni said something similar. Ahmad, Ibn Ma’in, Abu Dawud and others said he was thiqah</em>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn125" name="_ftnref125">[125]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Digressive and New Method to Praise a Narrator</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One twitter user, <strong>Aqua@D1mashqi</strong> attempts to bypass the standard practice of praise and criticism of a narrator and attempts to show some illustrious scholars transmitted or narrated from Abdul Majid, hence that shows his integrity, trustworthiness and for him taken as an acceptable and reliable narrator. In one tweet he highlights the names of Ahmad, al-Humaydi and ash-Shafi’i from al-Mizzi’s <em>Tahdhib ul-Kamal</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn126" name="_ftnref126">[126]</a> who transmitted and narrated from Abdul Majid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is nothing hidden, rather it is well known, in fact Abdul Ghani al-Maqdisi only mentions al-Humaydi and ash-Shafi’i of those who transmitted from him, and he fails to mention Ahmad<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn127" name="_ftnref127">[127]</a>, while we also know <em>al-Kamal</em> was original work al-Mizzi took from.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, if we use the same principle or this primitive approach it poses several serious problems, the two main ones are, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Problem</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the report of al-Bazzar<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn128" name="_ftnref128">[128]</a> Abdul Majid b. Abi Rawwad narrates from Sufyan, and this must be ath-Thawri, as Abdul Majid had a contention and conflict with Sufyan b. Uyaynah, even for arguments sake it is Ibn Uyaynah it is still a problem. The same al-Mizzi does not mention either Sufyan from those who Abdul Majid narrated from<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn129" name="_ftnref129">[129]</a>. So, using this principle the narration should be considered weak and furthermore, with the criticism of tadlis on Abdul Majid it further supports our view of the weakness of Abdul Majid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Problem</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the same report Yusuf b. Musa transmits from Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad however the same al-Mizzi does not mention Yusuf b. Musa from those who transmitted from Abdul Majid, we only find Yusuf b. Abi Mutta’id<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn130" name="_ftnref130">[130]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Those who considered him weak</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Bukhari has an entry for him in his <em>ad-Dhu’afa as-Saghir</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn131" name="_ftnref131">[131]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Adiyy brings and entry for him <em>Al-Kamil Fidh-Dhu’afa ir-Rijal</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn132" name="_ftnref132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Uqayli brings entry in his <em>Kitab adh-Dhu’afa</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn133" name="_ftnref133">[133]</a> – so he considered him to be weak</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Adh-Dhahabi brings an entry in his two books of weak narrators, <em>Mughni Fidh-Dhu’afa</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134">[134]</a> and in his <em>Diwan ad-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn135" name="_ftnref135">[135]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Zurah ar-Razi has an entry for him in his book on <strong>weak narrators</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn136" name="_ftnref136">[136]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hibban brings an entry in his book of weak, abandoned, and criticised narrators<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn137" name="_ftnref137">[137]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Jawzi brings an entry for him in his book of weak and abandoned narrators<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn138" name="_ftnref138">[138]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abdul Majid’s Tadlis</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khallal transmits from Muhanna who said<em>, I said to Ahmad and Yahya, do you transmit from Abdul Majid b. Abi Rawwad from Ubaydullah b. Umar from Naf’i from Ibn Umar who said Allah’s Messenger said, very nation has a firawn and the firawn of this ummah is Mu’awiyyah b. Abi Sufyan. Both replied and said, <strong>this is not authentic, this hadith is not known to be from the ahadith of Ubaydullah.</strong> Abdul Majid b. Abi Rawwad did not hear anything from Ubaydullah, <strong>it is possible Abdul Majid did tadlis</strong>, <strong>he would hear men and transmit from them</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn139" name="_ftnref139"><strong>[139]</strong></a><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Jawzi after mentioning this report quotes al-Khallal’s statement from Muhanna and then repeats the criticism of al-Humaydi and Ibn Hibban which have preceded<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn140" name="_ftnref140">[140]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Salah ud-Din al-I’la’i included and mentioned him to be from the mudallisin narrators<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn141" name="_ftnref141">[141]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wali ud-Din Abi Zur’ah al-I’raqi also declared him to be from the mudallisin, in his entry he mentions his name and then quotes Ahmad saying <em>Abdul Majid did tadlis in the report of from Ubaydullah b. Umar, he would take from men and narrate on them as al-Khallal mentioned in Kitab al-I’llal</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn142" name="_ftnref142">[142]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr categorized Abdul Majid from the third level of mudallis narrators. In his entry he said, <em>Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad al-Makki. <strong>Truthful</strong>, <strong>attributed with Irja</strong>, his <strong>memory had some weakness,</strong> and <strong>he is attributed with tadlis</strong>, <strong>he is from those who al-I’la’i mentioned [to have tadlis]</strong></em> <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn143" name="_ftnref143">[143]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr in the introduction of his book of mudallis narrators said,<em> The Third Level: Those who had <strong>a lot of tadlis</strong> and the <strong>scholars of hadith did not use them as evidence except when they clarified and affirmed they heard hadith directly<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn144" name="_ftnref144">[144]</a></strong></em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr further classified Abdul Majid as a narrator who either committed little tadlis but transmitted numerous hadith or did not commit tadlis except from thiqah narrators and he lists Abdul Majid as such a narrator<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn145" name="_ftnref145">[145]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As-Suyuti also declared Abdul Majid to be a mudallis<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn146" name="_ftnref146">[146]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad b. Ta&#8217;lat includes an entry for Abdul Majid in his book on mudallis narrators and devout almost 2 pages to him<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn147" name="_ftnref147">[147]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Misfar b. Gharmallah ad-Damini also declares him to be a mudallis<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn148" name="_ftnref148">[148]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abdul Majid b. Abi Rawwad and his Weak Memory</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the statements of disparagement quoted above, we can also deduce and say with certainty despite several scholars declaring him to be thiqah we know he had weak or poor memory. This is supported by the statement of ad-Daraqutni, Ibn Adiyy, al-Khalili and what Ibn Hajr summarized in his <em>Taqrib ut-Tahdhib</em>. It is therefore conclusive to say based on the statements of the scholars of hadith, that Abdul Majid is a weak narrator, when he narrates from Ibn Jurayj from memory the statements above apply i.e. he makes mistakes due to his weak or poor memory. However, when he transmits from Ibn Jurayj from his book, he is the strongest compared to all other narrators. This is the summary of the statements of Ibn Ma’in. Ibn Adiyy, ad-Daraqutni and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad Was a Caller to Irja</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We learnt from the previous statements, Abdul Majid was extreme and excessive in his Irja, he would openly declare and express his murji aqidah, he would also call to and propagate it and he would transmit reports spreading his innovated belief. Therefore, he was disparaged, and his narrations were rendered weak. It is also the reason why numerous hadith authorities also declared him to be weak on account of his Irja.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The twitter user, <strong>Aqua@D1mashqi </strong>quotes Ahmad declaring Abdul Majid to be thiqah thereby attempting to show Abdul Majid is an acceptable and worthy transmitter and therefore, ultimately his narrations are to be accepted and taken to be authentic. This is incorrect, just as Ahmad declared him to be thiqah, he does not transmit any narration from him, despite Abdul Majid being from those who Ahmad narrated from! Furthermore, Ahmad is on record for not transmitting any report from narrators who called to and propagated the belief of Irja.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Marudhi said <em>I asked Ahmad about Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad, he said, <strong>he was a murji and I wrote from him</strong>. The people said <strong>he ruined his father [with Irja]</strong> and <strong>Ibn Uyaynah was contentious with him</strong>. Al-Marudhi said, Abu Abdullah [Ahmad] would transmit from a murji <strong>if</strong> <strong>he was not a caller or someone who defended</strong> [or debated this view]</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn149" name="_ftnref149">[149]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hasan b. Wahb said, <strong><em>Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad came to us when he was young around 20 and he stayed with us for around 40-50 years and he had nothing of Irja with him up until his son (Abdul Majid) was born and affected him with Irja. He was the worst son born into Islam</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn150" name="_ftnref150">[150]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Muhammad b. Ali narrates Abdul Majid was mentioned in the presence of Malik and he said, <strong><em>he affected his father with Irja</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn151" name="_ftnref151">[151]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Adh-Dhahabi in his biographical work, <em>Siyar A’lam an-Nabula</em> says about Abdul Majid, <strong><em>he was from the murjiyyah</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn152" name="_ftnref152">[152]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Transmitting From Callers to Innovations</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A large group of scholars made a distinction between a caller and a non-caller to innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Hakim said, <strong><em>do not write hadith from a caller to bid’ah</em></strong><em> or respects him, <strong>there is ijma</strong> on this from a group of the Imams of the Muslims to <strong>abandon</strong> <strong>such</strong> <strong>people</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn153" name="_ftnref153">[153]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr mentions, <em>as for the narrations of the innovators who were truthful in the Sahihayn, there is a large group of such narrators, <strong>but they were not extreme or callers [to their innovations]</strong>. Most of the narrations used of such narrators of such a category are <strong>not related to legal rulings</strong>. Yes, it is true that narrators who were callers to innovations and extreme [in their innovation] were utilized in the Sahihayn like Imran b. Hittan and Abd b. Ya’qub and others, <strong>however not a single one was used except that a supporting or corroborating narration was used to support them</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn154" name="_ftnref154">[154]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr also mentions the narrations of an innovator that support his innovation are rejected and this is the chosen view<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn155" name="_ftnref155">[155]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah b. Mubarak, Abdur Rahman b. Mahdi, Ahmad b. Hanbal and Ibn Ma’in were all the view to abandon the narrations of such people, narrators who supported their innovations through transmission<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn156" name="_ftnref156">[156]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Jama’ah also shares one view that a narrator who is a caller to his belief and religious group, his narrations are not to be accepted and this is the view of the majority [of scholars]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn157" name="_ftnref157">[157]</a>.<strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Bazzar’s View – The Transmitter of This Report</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith in al-Bazzar can be clearly seen to comprise of two hadith, in the middle of the narration we can clearly see, <strong><em>Qala wa Qala Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam.</em></strong> So, this hadith can be seen to be two hadith combined as one. The contention is with the second hadith which has only been transmitted through this route of transmission. Al-Bazzar affirms this by directly saying after transmitting it, <em>the last hadith, we do not know it being transmitted from Abdullah except through this route with this chain of transmission</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn158" name="_ftnref158">[158]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Haythami after transmitting it in <em>Majma’ az-Zawa’id</em> said, <em>al-Bazzar transmitted it and its rijal are the rijal of the sahih’s</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn159" name="_ftnref159">[159]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, after al-Haythami transmitting it in <em>Kashf ul-Astar</em> he brings al-Bazzar’s statement that he said, <strong><em>we do not know its transmission from Abdullah (b. Mas’ud) except through this chain of transmission</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn160" name="_ftnref160">[160]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We can clearly see a difference in al-Haythami’s position on this narration, where it seems he was not convinced of the authenticity of this narration. <strong>Aqua@D1mashqi </strong>failed to make recourse to both statements and was hasty in using al-Haythami’s words and merely claiming he authenticated. It is also shows <strong>Aqua@D1mashqi’s</strong> limited knowledge and comprehension of these matters, yet our detractor has become an expert in screenshotting!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Albani classed this narration weak<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn161" name="_ftnref161">[161]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Those who Narrated it From Sufyan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Bazzar’s statement in of itself indicates the weakness of this report due to this narration being a solitary or lone report from Abdullah from Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Albani quotes Ibn Kathir saying, <em>the first part of the hadith [in al-Bazzar] is the statement of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, </em><em>Verily </em><em>Allah has Angels that roam [the earth] conveying the salam of my ummah to me, then al-Nasa’i transmitted this through numerous routes from Sufyan and from A’mash, both on the authority of Abdullah b. as-Sa’ib</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn162" name="_ftnref162">[162]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is Ibn Kathir alluding to the fact this hadith are really two hadith, with the first one being authentic and well known and that there are numerous routes from Sufyan. Ibn Kathir also alludes to the fact that none of the transmission mention the second part of the hadith, which again indicate the weak transmission from Abdul Majid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi</strong> poorly attempts to show it is one hadith, but this is not the case and this is nothing but sheer desperation and despondency to authenticate the second part of the hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A total of 14 transmitters, some who are highly trustworthy narrators transmit this hadith from Sufyan from Abdullah b. as-Sa’ib, and none of them transmitted the second part, which clearly shows Abdul Majid being weak, make errors and not strong in hadith transmission led to this major error. Including Abdul Majid, it is 15 people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Mizzi<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn163" name="_ftnref163">[163]</a> and Ibn Hajr<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn164" name="_ftnref164">[164]</a> trace this hadith and its various routes of transmission and it can be found in their respective books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, a group of trustworthy hadith narrators, some of whom are major scholars in hadith, rijal, ilm ul-hadith, Jarh wa’t- Ta’dil and all of them were either students and transmitters from Sufyan or known as Ashab Sufyan ath-Thawri, all narrated this hadith from him and he in turn narrated it from Abdullah b. as-Sa’ib from Zazan from Ibn Mas’ud, so they all narrated the same hadith. They all narrated this hadith in marfu form and all of them except Abdul Majid narrated only the first part of the hadith and not even one transmitted the second part!</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">15 – <strong>Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz b. Abi Rawwad</strong> narrated from Sufyan with both the first and second part of the hadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn179" name="_ftnref179">[179]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All 14 narrate from Sufyan ath-Thawri from Abdullah b. as-Sa’ib from Zazan from Abdullah ibn Mas’ud in marfu form with the only the first part of the hadith and not the second part, <strong><em>“My living…”</em></strong> Abdullah b. al-Mubarak, Abdur Razzaq, Waki b. al-Jarrah, Abdur Rahman b. Mahdi, Yahya b. Sa’id al-Qattan, Fudhayl b. Ayadh, Mu’adh b. Mu’adh al-Ambari, Muhammad b. Yusuf al-Faryabi, Abdullah b. Numayr, Zayd b. al-Hubab, Abu Nu’aym Fadhal b. Dakin, Muhammad b. Kathir, Abu Ishaq al-Fazari, Ubaydullah b. Musa, these 14 transmitters from Sufyan do not mention the words, <strong><em>“My living…”.</em></strong> Abdul Majid opposed these 14 transmitters while narrating from Sufyan with this chain and only he mentioned these words. So, we learn this hadith is weak and munkar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This coupled with the fact that numerous scholars of hadith criticized Abdul Majid in general and specifically for his weak memory, lack or precision and accuracy all allude to his weakness in narrating and that this hadith from his weak. Furthermore, Sufyan himself and all those who transmitted from him are supported in their transmission by al-A’mash.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>al-A’mash</strong> also transmitted from <strong>Abdullah b. as-Sa’ib</strong> from <strong>Zazan</strong> from Abdullah ibn Mas’ud in marfu form as well and he also just transmits the first part.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Ishaq al-Fazari</strong> from <strong>al-A’mash</strong> and <strong>Sufyan</strong> from <strong>Abdullah b. as-Sa’ib</strong> from <strong>Zazan</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn180" name="_ftnref180">[180]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, <strong>al-Hussayn al-Khalqani</strong> also transmits from <strong>Abdullah b. as-Sa’ib</strong> with the same chain and the same hadith, meaning only the first part of the hadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn181" name="_ftnref181">[181]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Albani said, <em>a group of trustworthy narrators were unified in transmitting this hadith from Sufyan without [the second part of] “My living…” and A’mash transmissions further support this, this therefore proves the irregularity [and or inconsistency] of the additional [words] due to the isolated and lone reporting of Abdul Majid b. Abdul Aziz of this hadith. This is more so specifically that he was criticized for his memory despite being a narrator in Muslim and a group of scholars said he was thiqah and another weakened him. Some of them clarified the reason [for his weakening], al-Khalilil said thiqah but makes mistakes in hadith, an-Nasa’i said he is not strong write his hadith, Ibn Abdul Barr said he narrates from hadith from Malik and there are mistakes in them, Ibn Hibban said in al-Majruhin (2:152), severely abandoned in hadith, he confused the reports, and transmitted abandoned narrations on famous narrators and therefore worthy to be abandoned. I say this is the reason why al-Hafiz said in at-Taqrib, truthful but makes mistakes.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>When you have come to know what has been mentioned, al-Hafiz al-Haythami said in al-Majma’ (6:24), transmitted by al-Bazzar and its narrators are the narrators of the sahih. He errs here, alluding there is no one [in the chain] who has been criticized. Perhaps this is the reason as-Suyuti was deceived by this and said in al-Khasa’is al-Kubra (2:281) its chains is authentic.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>This is why I say, al-Hafiz al-I’raqi – the Shaykh of al-Haythami was more precise [and accurate] in addressing the reality of the chain of al-Bazzar for he said in Takhrij al-Ihya (4:128), the narrators are the narrators of the sahih, except Abdul Majid b. Abi Rawwad, who Muslim has used for transmission, Ibn Ma’in and an-Nasa’i said he was thiqah and others declared him weak.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>I say: as for his statement of his sons in Tarh at-Tathrib Fi Sharh at-Taqrib (3:297), the chain is good, however is this it is not good according to me, this would have been the case if Abdul Majid had not opposed trustworthy narrators as mentioned before and this is the defect in the hadith</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn182" name="_ftnref182">[182]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> As-Suyuti coded only the first part of the hadith Sahih and does not mention the second part of the hadith with the first<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn183" name="_ftnref183">[183]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi </strong>also tried to use the words of <em>Tarh Tathrib</em> to show both al-I’raqis authenticated it. However, as I mentioned they might have understood both parts of the hadith of al-Bazzar to be one and thus claimed the Isnad was good. This claim is true for the first part of the report since Abdul Majid b. Abi Rawwad was weak in his reports, at least 16 other narrators supported the first part of the wording and perhaps this is the reason they both declared it to be good. This would therefore make sense if they considered both parts of the hadith to be a single hadith, but this is clearly not the case as has bene proven in this paper.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, even if this authentication of al-I’raqi was taken, he himself expresses and shows criticism levied against Abdul Majid, and as al-Albani said, al-I’raqi was precise and more accurate in his words compared to al-Haythami.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi </strong>uses as-Suyuti’s authentication from his <em>Manahil as-Safa</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn184" name="_ftnref184">[184]</a> and his al-<em>Khasa’is al-Kubra</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn185" name="_ftnref185">[185]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Munawi<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn186" name="_ftnref186">[186]</a> questions as-Suyuti’s authentication of it in his <em>Takhrij ash-Shifa</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn187" name="_ftnref187">[187]</a>and al-Albani presents a potential reason why as-Suyuti might have authenticated it. <strong>Aqua@D1mashqi </strong>in his futile endeavour of “theological tashih” totally missed the comments of the the verifier of the <em>Khasa’is</em>, Muhammad Khalil Harras, when he showed the screenshots of the <em>Khasa’is</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Khalil Harras said in the footnote to this narration, <em>I have added an annotative note to this hadith in my explanation of Sharh Qasidah Nuniyyah of Allamah Ibnul Qayyim that these words [as this report] are batil and mawdhu – fabricated. The Ashab as-Sihah did not transmit it rather the author of al-Firdaws did with a disconnected chain and some reports are mawquf from Anas</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn188" name="_ftnref188">[188]</a>.</span></p>

Amir al-Mu’minin Fi’l Hadith Al-Bukhari said he is nothing<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn203" name="_ftnref203">[203]</a>, Abu Zurah said weak<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn204" name="_ftnref204">[204]</a>, an-Nasa’i said weak<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn205" name="_ftnref205">[205]</a> Ibn Ma’in said he is nothing<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn206" name="_ftnref206">[206]</a> another time he said he is not thiqah<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn207" name="_ftnref207">[207]</a>, Abu Hatim said he was a pious man but not strong<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn208" name="_ftnref208">[208]</a> al-Saji said truthful but weak in hadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn209" name="_ftnref209">[209]</a> al-Uqayli weakened him<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn210" name="_ftnref210">[210]</a> Ibn Adiyy repeats this criticism and adds, is hadith generally are not preserved [ie authentic]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn211" name="_ftnref211">[211]</a>, Ibn Hibban weakened him<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn212" name="_ftnref212">[212]</a> and Ibn Hajr quotes him saying he was weak<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn213" name="_ftnref213">[213]</a> ad-Daraqutni weakened him<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn214" name="_ftnref214">[214]</a> and said he is matruk<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn215" name="_ftnref215">[215]</a> Ibn al-Jawzi weakened him<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn216" name="_ftnref216">[216]</a> adh-Dhahabi weakened him<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn217" name="_ftnref217">[217]</a> Ibn Hajr repeats this criticism in <em>Mizan</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn218" name="_ftnref218">[218]</a> both him and his son were abandoned and the latter was a Qadari<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn219" name="_ftnref219">[219]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, there are 3 reports from Bakr b. Abdullah al-Muzani and all of them are mursal. Therefore al-Busayri is on record saying, <em>al-Harith transmitted this in <strong>mursal form</strong> with this chain and <strong>Jasr b, Farqad who is in the chain is weak</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn220" name="_ftnref220">[220]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Busayri also said after transmitting it in his <em>Ittihaf</em>, <strong><em>this is mursal [and] weak, Jasr – everyone is united on his weakness, and I don’t know anyone who said he was thiqah</em></strong>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn221" name="_ftnref221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As-Suyuti coded it mursal<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn222" name="_ftnref222">[222]</a> and al-Munawi also classed it mursal in explanation said, <em>it is apparent the author (i.e. as-Suyuti) did not hold it to be Mawsul (i.e. connected back to the Nabi Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). Al-Bazzar transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn Mas’ud, al-Haythami said its narrators are the narrators of the sahih</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn223" name="_ftnref223">[223]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, al-Munawi clarifies that he and as-Suyuti both held the report to be mursal and he further explains as-Suyuti did not see the report to be mawsul and therefore not connected to the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam which leads al-Munawi to bring the hadith of Ibn Mas’ud from al-Bazzar to show a continuous connected chain. Al-Munawi had a need to do this to correct the disconnection in the chain, therefore he was aware of its weakness</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi</strong> mentions al-Munawi authenticated the chain, which is incorrect and possibly a lie or ignorance on <strong>Aqua@D1mashqi’s</strong> part since we see al-Munawi merely repeating al-Haythami’s words. This is <strong>Aqua@D1mashqi’s </strong>affair even after presenting the screenshot of the book and hence passage himself!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abdul Hadi alludes to its weakness by saying it is mursal, <strong><em>I say this report is mursal Qadi Isma’il transmitted it</em></strong> … <strong><em>this chain is authentic up to Bakr b. Abdullah al-Muzani</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn224" name="_ftnref224">[224]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi</strong> tried manipulating Ibn Abdul Hadi’s words to show he authenticated is another desperate attempt because he starts by saying I say this report is mursal, thereby indicating it is a category of a weak narration, but the chain is authentic up to Bakr b. Abdullah al-Muzani, and this is very clear from the words of Ibn Abdul Hadi and even the beginner student knows this!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And al-Sehsawani emphasises this further after quoting the words of Ibn Abdul Hadi and saying, <strong><em>al-mursal is a category of weak hadith and therefore grading this report authentic is not correct</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn225" name="_ftnref225">[225]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Albani also clarifies and acknowledges the chain is authentic but only for a mursal report, he said, <em>yes, the chain</em><em> for this hadith is authentic to Bakr b. Abdullah al-Muzani in mursal form [only] and it has three chains of transmission. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The first</em></strong><em>: From Ghalib al-Qattan narrating from him [i.e. Bakr b. Abdullah al-Muzani] transmitted by Isma’il Qadi in Fadhal as-SalahAlan Nabi (no.25 with my checking) and Ibn Sa’d in at-Tabaqat (2/2/2) and all the narrators in the chain are thiqah and from the narrators of the two Shaykhs [i.e. al-Bukhari and Muslim]. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The second:</em></strong><em>  From Kathir Abi Fadhal reporting transmitting from him as also transmitted by Isma’il (no.26) and the narrators are thiqah and are the narrators of Muslim except Kathir. And his father’s name was Yasar and he is well-known as Hafiz clarified in al-Lisan and he refutes Ibn al-Qattan’s statement that his affair was not well-known.<br />
</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The Third:</em></strong><em> From Jasr b. Farqad reporting from him and al-Harith b. Abi Usamah transmitted it in his Musnad (no.230 of Bughyah al-Bahith Aan Zawa’id Musnad al-Harith) and Jasr is weak</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn226" name="_ftnref226">[226]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Albani continues and says, <em>perhaps this is the reason Abdul Majid transmitted this hadith in mawsul form from Ibn Mas’ud whereas in reality it is mursal from Bakr. Abdul Majid erred and transmitted it in mawsul from and added it to the first hadith of Ibn Mas’ud and Allah knows best<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn227" name="_ftnref227"><strong>[227]</strong></a></em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-I’la’i classed Bakr b. Abdullah al-Muzani as someone who committed irsal and therefore adds an entry for him in his book of narrators who committed irsal<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn228" name="_ftnref228">[228]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Zur’ah Wali ud-Din b. al-I’raqi himself declared Bakr b. Abdullah al-Muzani as a narrator who transmitted mursal reports<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn229" name="_ftnref229">[229]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ruling on Hadith Mursal</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At-Tirmidhi said, <em>and the hadith if it is <strong>mursal</strong> then<strong> it is not authentic according to the majority of Ahlul Hadith</strong> [scholars of hadith] and a number of them declared them weak</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn230" name="_ftnref230">[230]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi</strong> says it is the opinion of the four madhaheb to accept this mursal of Bakr as he is thiqa of the Tabi’in narrating from the Prophet Sallalahu alayhi Wasallam and then proceeds to highlight only two opinions from al-Bayquniyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What immediately refutes this is that ash-Shafi’i is on record for rejecting mursal narrations and this has been relayed from him through many narrations. Abu Dawud said <strong><em>ash-Shafi’i came and he criticised the practice [of taking mursal narrations]</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn231" name="_ftnref231">[231]</a>. There are two views from Ahmad, the first that he used mursal as evidence<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn232" name="_ftnref232">[232]</a>. The second view was he did not totally declare them weak nor authentic, rather he considered the mursal reports of narrators to be weak who would do irsal from non thiqah narrators<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn233" name="_ftnref233">[233]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If he had read the second position of the scan he shared, he would have learnt there is also a valid view that, <em>mursal reports are weak which cannot be used as evidence and this is the view of the majority of the scholars of hadith and numerous jurists and Ashab [scholars] of al-usul as Imam Muslim mentioned in the introduction to his Sahih that a mursal narration according to our foundational principles and the statement of the people of knowledge who are experts in narrations that they [mursal narrations] do not constitute evidence</em>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn234" name="_ftnref234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muslim mentions his view in the muqaddimah to his <em>Sahih</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn235" name="_ftnref235">[235]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn as-Salah <em>said there is no khilaf that a mursal [report] is a hadith of a major Tabi’i who met a group of Companions and sat with them like Ubaydullah b. Adiyy b. al-Khiyar and Sa’id b. al-Musayyab</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn236" name="_ftnref236">[236]</a>. He further goes on to say, <strong><em>and as for what we have mentioned in abstaining from using a mursal report as evidence and grading it weak is the madhhab adopted and the view of the majority Huffaz of Hadith and critical analysts [Nuqqad] of the reports and they have recourse this in their books</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn237" name="_ftnref237">[237]</a>.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr said a mursal report is a narration from a major Successor (Kibar Tabi’i)<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn238" name="_ftnref238">[238]</a>. Al-I’la’i said, <em>some have specified accepting the mursal of a major Successor but not minor Successors.</em> He further mentions this is the view of the Hanafiyyah and some Malikiyyah<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn239" name="_ftnref239">[239]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr further said regarding one report, <em>[even if accepted] it is mursal and they [mursal reports] cannot be used as evidence</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn240" name="_ftnref240">[240]</a>. Another time he said about a narration, <em>whoever uses this as evidence he knows very well it does not actually constitute or be used as evidence because it is mursal</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn241" name="_ftnref241">[241]</a>. He said after another narration, <em>it is mursal or mu’adhal and it cannot be used as evidence</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn242" name="_ftnref242">[242]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Munawi explained <em>the criteria of a major Successor is whose narrations are mostly from Companions while a minor Successors narrations are mostly from other Successors. As for the view that a minor Successor is the one who met one or two Companions – then this is not a compatible explanation</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn243" name="_ftnref243">[243]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is upon <strong>Aqu@D1mashqi</strong> to prove Bakr b. Abdullah al-Muzani was from the major Successors based on what Ibn Hajr, al-Munawi and al-I’la’i said. Hanafis in general have an open view on this and accept the mursal of anyone even after the era of the Tabi’in<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn244" name="_ftnref244">[244]</a>, so its open season I guess and <strong>Aqua@D1mashqi</strong> was too busy ranting about the theological outlook of al-Albani whereas the Hanafis have open season and everything is lawful and authentic!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Narration of Anas b. Malik RadhiAllahu Anhu</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are two chains for this narration</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] Report in<em> al-Mukhallisiyat</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Informed me Muhammad narrated to us Yahya narrated to us Yahya b. Khidam in the grand mosque of Basrah in 250H narrated to us Muhammad b. Abdullah b. Ziyad Abu Salamah al-Ansari narrated to us Malik b. Dinar from Anas b. Malik<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn245" name="_ftnref245">[245]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was declared fabricated by al-Albani<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn246" name="_ftnref246">[246]</a> and he quoted criticism levied against al-Ansari and the detractors like <strong>Aqua@D1mashqi</strong> also affirm this, where he says the chain has a weak narrator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] Report in</strong><strong><em> Al-Kamil Fi Dhu’afa ir-Rijal</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From al-Hasan narrated to us Khirash (b. Abdullah) narrated to us Anas b. Malik<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn247" name="_ftnref247">[247]</a>. Ibn Adiyy classed this as a weak narration and hence included it in his biographical entry. Adh-Dhahabi<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn248" name="_ftnref248">[248]</a> and Ibn Hajr<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn249" name="_ftnref249">[249]</a> also classed this narration from Khirash to be weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Khirash b. Abdullah was accused of lying and Ibn Adiyy said he was majhul<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn250" name="_ftnref250">[250]</a>. Ibn Hibban said he narrated fabricated narration; it is not lawful to use him as evidence nor write his hadith except for I’tibar<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn251" name="_ftnref251">[251]</a>. None narrated from him except Abu Sa’id al-Adawi who was a kazzab – liar<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn252" name="_ftnref252">[252]</a>. Burhan ud-Din al-Halabi has an entry for him in his book of those who were accused or fabricated hadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn253" name="_ftnref253">[253]</a> and therefore al-Albani declared it a fabrication<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn254" name="_ftnref254">[254]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-I’raqi also declared the report of Anas to be weak but he incorrectly references it to al-Harith’s Musnad<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn255" name="_ftnref255">[255]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As-Suyuti also has an entry for the hadith of Anas and he classed it weak<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn256" name="_ftnref256">[256]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, both reports from Anas b. Malik RadhiAllahu Anhu are severely weak and fabricated. The poor understanding and sheer desperation of <strong>Aqua@D1mashqi</strong> is evident when he says about the weakness of these narrations that they do not hurt the main, it strengthens it further, is disgraceful since liars and fabricators can never be used to support other weak narrations. This is basic science of hadith, and it shows the dubious and devious ways of these Sufi Ash’ari detractors!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Albani brings both reports and references them to some unique rare and other well-known books that are in manuscript form. He brings the statements of the scholars of hadith of criticism on al-Ansari who is Muhammad b. Abdul Malik b. Ziyad Abu Salamah al-Ansari. He concludes and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>In conclusion, this hadith is weak through all routes of transmission, the best of which is the hadith of Bakr b. Abdullah al-Muzani which is mursal and this is a category of weak hadith according to the scholars of hadith. Then we have the hadith of Ibn Mas’ud which is based on an error or mistake and the worst </em></strong><em>[weakest]<strong> of reports is that of Anas</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn257" name="_ftnref257">[257]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the reality of the 6 reports and its various chains of transmission,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are many numerous other ahadith that dispel and contradict the wording of this report, which further alludes to its weakness. Perhaps at a later stage I can expand on this paper and bring further clarification. The discussion regarding the chains and narrators should be sufficient to prove to the honest reader to the weakness of this report and other supporting reports. This also shows the desperation and false attempt of the Sufi Ash’aris in deceiving the readers in trying to prove its authenticity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for as-Suyuti coding them as two different reports is in support of our view, if it was actually one narration Suyuti would have only had one entry in his <em>Jami’ as-Saghir</em>, but we learn he has 2 separate entries therefore he also was of the view that they were 2 separation narrations.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn258" name="_ftnref258">[258]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqua@D1mashqi</strong> in his poor understanding admits this but this is a proof against him because it shows they are 2 separate narrations. If the scholars of hadith classed them as 2 different narrations, how is it that you can use both wordings and the chain and then claim the chain is authentic, either the chain is for the first hadith or the second hadith. This game playing has only but landed you further in your ignorance and lack of understanding of hadith and its sciences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let this be a lesson for <strong>Aqua@D1mashqi</strong> to humble himself and learn from his embarrassing research and major blunders while attacking the Salafi scholars. He should pay more attention to his own Sufi Ash’ari house.</span></p>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">DECEMBER 26, 2020 / SUNNI HANAFI</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Refuting http://www.salafiri.com/pinned-ebook-dismantling-the-proofs-for-tawassul-and-istigatha-with-conclusive-evidences-part-2-the-%e1%b8%a5adith-of-fatimah-bint-asad-radiallahu-anha-and-the-tawassul-of-me/</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Some pseudo-Salafis have began to make allegations of weakness on the hadith of Sayyida Fatima bint Asad رضى الله عنه .</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">For example they say that</span> “Imām Dhahabī in his summary of the al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Fīʾl Aḥadīth al-Wahiyyah of Ḥāfiẓ Ibn al-Jawzī again grades Rawhū weak thus showing his consistency. (Talkhīs Kitāb al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Li-Ibn al-Jawzī (p.91 no. 218), Riyadh: Maktabah al-Rushd, 1419H/1998)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Irshād ul-Ḥaq al-Atharī said in his notes to al-ʿEllal after mention the statements of Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy, Imām al-Dāraquṭnī, Imām Ibn Mākūlā, Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Yūnus, the authentication of Imām al-Ḥākim and the entry of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān in his al-Thiqāt as mentioned in Lisān (2:465),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I say their leniency (tasāhul ie of al-Ḥākim and Ibn Ḥibbān) is well known and al-Shaikh al-Albānī has mentioned in Silsilah al-Daʿīfaʾ no.23 so refer to it.” (al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Fīʾl Aḥadīth al-Wahiyyah (1:269 footnote no.5), Edn, Khalīl Mayyis (1:270 footnote no.8)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They do ta’wil of Imam al-Hakim and Imam Ibn Hibban’s tasHih yet they consider us “deviant and people of innovation” for doing tawasul/istighatha. If the followers of the pseudo-Salafi/Wahabi movement have any intellectual honesty, they will tell me why they have not considered Imam al-Hakim or Imam Ibn Hibban a deviant for doing tasHih of a narration on tawassul.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Barelwi in order to bulk the size of so called reply reproduced large chunks of my paper, whereas his response is a few paragraphs if that. In his response he the unnamed one] fails to make any recourse to the books related to the science of hadith, rijal and or without reference to any classical books other than emotive polemics, so nothing usual here for typical Barelwis so far.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Unnamed begins with the accusation of ta&#8217;wil, meaning explaining the authentication of Imams al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban. The unnamed author hid behind a generality, that this attribution to al-Hakim, that he authenticated it came from al-Haythami in his (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid (9:256-257), Cairo: Maktabah al-Quddūsī, 1414H:1994) and Majma&#8217;a al-Zawaid, 18:736 under no.15388)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">So, the accusation levied against me should be put first and foremost to al-Haythami, who despite citing Ibn Hibban&#8217;s and al-Hakim&#8217;s authentication continued to class it weak!!! I wonder why the unnamed author forgot this very little but important information? I guess, al-Haythami is also a pseudo Salafi? I reproduce the words of al-Haythami and what I wrote in the paper,</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;He, al-Haythamī also said after transmitting it in his Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid said,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Transmitted by Ṭabarānī in al-Kabīr and in al-Awsaṭ and Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ is in the chain who was declared trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim, however he has weakness with him and the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ.” (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid (9:256-257), Cairo: Maktabah al-Quddūsī, 1414H:1994)&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>al-Haythami himself organised the Thiqat of Ibn Hibban, so he was fully aware of Ibn Hibban&#8217;s entry for Rawhu, yet despite this he still graded him weak. (Tartib Thiqat Ibn Hibban,5:393 no.3979. 1st edn (Mansura: Dar Ibn Abbas, 1440H/2019).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Hamdi answered the very point made by this brother and i quoted this, and it is well known amonsgt the circles of hadith, that Ibn Hibba and al-Hakim were mutasahil, if someone does not even know the basic, they should refrain from discussing things way over their head. Shaykh Hamdi said,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Ḥamdi ʿAbd al-Majīd al-Salafī answers the authentication of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and says,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“As for Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who has been declared to be trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and Hakim, then it is well known about both of them that they are mutasāhil ie lenient. He was declared to be weak by Ibn ʿAdiyy and Ibn Yūnus said he would narrate rejected narrations. Darāquṭnī said he is weak in Ḥadīth and Ibn Mākūlā weakened him and Ibn ʿAdiyy said after transmitting two of this ḥadīth he has many āḥadīth and some of them are abandoned.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thus, this is detailed criticism from the specialist critical analysts, furthermore, his narrations are rejected and this is the case with this narration and when he is alone in reporting such ḥadīth they are rejected and cannot be used as evidence therefore, the ḥadīth is is weak.” (Muʿajam al-Kabīr (24:351-352), Cairo: Maktabah Ibn Taymiyyah, 1415H/1994)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, I also quoted the Sufi Shaykh ʿAbd Allah bin Ṣiddīq al-Ghumārī he also acknowledged the weakness of Rawhū. He said,</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Rawhū, his weakness is light.” (Ittihāf al-Azkiyaʾ Bijawāj al-Tawassul bil-Anbiyāʾ waʾl Awliyāʾ (p.11) (?: ʾAlī Raḥmī, p.11) and (p.20) cited from Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ (p.146)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">So, this charge should be levied against these personalities too, especially Hafiz al-Haythami. In reality this is nothing but pure desperation and a feeble attempt to answer what I wrote. The unnamed author failed to even cite one reference and he called its a refutation!</span></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Leniency of Imam al-Hakim</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr in this introduction to his <em>Lisan ul-Mizan</em> indicates and alludes to the leniency of Imam Ibn Hibban by discussing some of his principles. (Lisan ul-Mizan 1:208-209, ed Abu Guddah Abdul Fattah (Beirut: Dar al-Basha&#8217;ir, 1423H / 2002CE).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">And the Imam as-Salah, in his reference work for hadith, <em>Ulum al-Hadith</em> also grades Imam al-Hakim as lenient. (Ulum al-Hadith, 22 (24th edition (Damascus/Beirut: Dar al-Fikr /Dar al-Fikr al-Ma&#8217;asir, 1440H / 2019CE) ed. Nur ud-Din al-&#8216;Itr</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imams al-Nawawi and al-Suyuti in his <em>Taqrib and Tadrib al-Rawi Fi Sharh Taqrib al-Nawawi</em> both held the view that Imam al-Hakim was lenient. al-Suyuti even went onto say that Imam al-Dhahabi rendered many of al-Hakims hadith in his al-Mustadrak weak and even compiled a treatise of around 100 fabricated narrations. This all indicates towards th leniency of Imam al-Hakim (Tadrib al-Raw 1:112. (Riyadh: Dar al-Taybah, 1422H) 5th edition ed. Abu Qutaybah Nazar Muhammad al-Faryabi).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi himsef alludes to the lenenicy of al-Hakim and says himself that he collated the fabricated and weak ahadith in al-Hakims al-Mustadrak (Siyar al-A&#8217;lam al-Nubala, 17:175)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi very clearly declares Imam al-Hakim to be Mutassahil, he says, &#8220;Like the the type that is referred to as Mutasaahil like al-Hakim (Ma&#8217;rifah ur-Ruwat al-Mutakkalm Fihim Bima Yujad ar-Radd, 15. (Dar al-Ma&#8217;rifah)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi said another time. &#8220;The mutasahil (lenient ones) are like at-Tirmidhi, al-Hakim and ad-Daraqutni sometimes&#8221; (al-Muqizah Fi Ilm Mustalah al-Hadith, 83. ed. Abdul Fattab abu guddah. (Beirut: Maktabah Matbuat al-Islamiyyah, 1425H) 8th edition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Shaykh Salim al-Hilali brings a long passage from al-Lucknowi&#8217;s <em>al-Rafa&#8217; wa&#8217;t-Takmil</em>, 282-308, who in turn quotes Hafiz al-Sakhawi saying the same in his <em>Fath ul-Mughith</em> (Kifayah ul-Hifzah Sharh a-Muqaddimah al-Muqizah, 323. (UAE: Maktabah al-Furqan, 1422H / 2001CE) 2nd edition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Ibn al-Mulaqqin also attributed Tasahul to Imam al-Hakim (al-Muqn&#8217;i Fi Ulum al-Hadith, 67. (KSA: Dar al-Fawaz)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr does the same in his <em>al-Nukt Ala Ibn as-Salah</em>, 314.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">IMAM IBN HIBBAN</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000080;">The author of this below standard reply wont be able to grasp the finer details and Imam Ibn Hibban&#8217;s methodology in his <em>ath-Thiqat</em>, which is the core theme of his contention, namely Rawhu&#8217;s inclusion in the Thiqat. The Imam outlines he is likely to include narrators who have also been criticised and Rawhu is one of them (Kitab ath-Thiqat, 1:11. 1st edition. (Beirut: DKI, 1419H/1998CE)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">al-Lucknowi outlines Ibn Hibban&#8217;s methodology in his <em>Thiqat</em> and concludes, Ibn Hibban was lenient in his Tawthiq. (ar-Rafa&#8217; Wat-Takmil Fi Jarh wa&#8217;t-Ta&#8217;dil, 332-339. 4th edition (Pakistan: Maktaba Maroofia, 1433/2013), edited Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Ghuddah Abdul Fattah endorses this view and also says the view of the Hanafi Zafar Ahmad Thanwi in his </span><em style="color: #000080;">Qawaid Fi Ulum al-Hadith</em><span style="color: #000080;">, 180. He further said numerous scholars have attributed Tasahul to Imam Ibn Hibban from the classical and contemporary scholars. He goes onto say that even al-Kawthari, who undoubtedly is probably highly respected by the author of this reply, also indicates tasahul of al-Hibban this in several places in his <em>Maqalat</em>, 69, 185, 303. (ar-Rafa&#8217; Wat-Takmil Fi Jarh wa&#8217;t-Ta&#8217;dil, 335, footnote 2).</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">This then makes the argument of the detractor redundant as instead of applying Sunni sciences, he applies the usual emotion and this is not how we scrutinise reports. Therefore, in conclusion the TasHih of Imam al-Hakim and the grading of Imam Ibn Hibban is problematic. The Sufi authors have also acknowledged this as I presented in the paper.</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Furthermore they say:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">“Shaikh Zubair ʿAlī Zaʾī graded the report to weak on account of the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ according to the scholars of Ḥadīth. He also argued, even if he was authentic the second problem is the tadlīs of Sufyān al-Thawrī. Shaikh Zubair said seven scholars of Ḥadīth classed Rawhū to be weak,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān, al-Ḥākim authenticated him and Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī narrated from him. These three authentications are rejected based on the criticism of the majority of the scholars of ḥadīth. (al-Ḥadīth no.76, Ramaḍḥān 1431H/September 2010, p.9-12).Shaikh Zubair ʿAlī Zaʾī graded the report to weak on account of the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ according to the scholars of Ḥadīth.

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Let’s assume this is true- for sake of argument. There is a big question – what is the similarity between the tad`if of, Imam al-Daraqutni or Ibn al-Jawzi or Ibn Adiyy or Allamah al-Dhahabi and those of today, like Zubair Alizai? One main difference – the former `ulama never had the manhaj of denying tawassul. Check Siyar al-Alam al-Nubala 12:469 for Imam al-Dhahabi narrating about wasilah through Imam al-Bukhari رضى الله عنه and 16:400, ed. Arna`ut for wasilah through the Messenger ﷺ .</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong><br />
<strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">This is purely clutching at straws and saving oneself after they have sunk neck deep. The unnamed detractor provides no Hadith based answer except another digressive point which is the usual tactic of Barelwis. What exactly does the narration under discussion and the scrutiny of its chain and narrators have to do with someone allegedly making tawassul through the grave of Imam al-Bukhari? Precisely, nothing. The  unnamed chap seems to forget the Imams of the Salaf who declared Rawhu weak while Shaykh Zubair Ali Za&#8217;i relayed this information. Honestly at times there is a serious level of disingenuous by Barelwis, who instead of presenting a direct answer, tend to skirt around digressive points. At this point the detractors is literally making things up to support his view. Nonetheless since he has presented this point lets scrutinise it briefly.</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">1. The unnamed detractor quotes a report from a book of biographies of Imam al-Dhahabi, claiming then that he believed in Tawassul is an outright lie since the task of a biographer is to quote incidences related to the entry. If this was the case, we have to attribute to Imam al-Dhahabi as a belief system everything he quotes in his 30 volume of the Siyar, and of course this is absurd but for sure a Barelwi would bring such a silly point to fool the readers.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">The detractor surprisingly did manage to quote the correct reference for this report, namely Siyar al-A&#8217;lam an-Nabula, 12:469 (Beirut: ar-Risalah al-A&#8217;lamiah, 1438H/2017CE) and the chain Imam al-Dhahabi quotes it from through Abu Ali al-Ghassani who died in 498H (Siyar 19:150).</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi died 748H and therefore there is a gap of 250 years in the chain. In conclusion this chain is disconnected and hence weak with all scholars of hadith, the early and later ones. It is therefore upon the unnamed Barelwi detractor to first bring the chain, then prove its connected and continuous chain and only then proceed to authenticate and use it as evidence. It is unsurprising to learn this since this is a hallmark of Barelwi Sufis who claim link and chain connections to knowledge but terribly bring chainless report to prove their Aqidah. Barelwism has no hope if this is the best they come with him as a reply as their Tanbih al-Ghafilin, it seems more appropriate for the detractor to apply this to himself due to his dire negligence of hadith and Aqidah sciences.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">As for this claim :</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Muḥammad ibn ʿAlawī al-Malikī quotes it in his book and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“There is a difference of opinion regarding one of the narrators, Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ, however Ibn Ḥibbān mentions him in his al-Thiqāt and al-Ḥākim said he was safe and trustworthy. So both of them, the two Ḥāfiẓs authenticated the ḥadīth. Likewise al-Haythamī followed up on this in (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid) and said Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is in the chain, Ibn Ḥibbān declared him to be trustworthy as did al-Ḥākim, however, he has some weakness and the remaining narrators are the narrator of the Ṣaḥīḥs.” (Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ (p.146), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1430H/2009)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamdūḥ does the same and claims the narration is Ḥasan. He also quotes the statements of the scholars as we have mentioned above. He says the scholars have differed over Rawhū, some have said he is weak and others have declared him trustworthy. (Rafʿ ul-Minārah Li-Takhrīj Aḥadīth al-Tawassul wal-Ziyārah (p.147-148), Cairo, Maktabah al-Azhariyyah Lit-Turāth, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʿIsā Himyarī jubilantly went on to assert the Ḥadīth is Ṣaḥīḥ ie authentic according to the conditions of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim and Ḥasan according to the conditions of others. (al-Tāʾmul Fī Ḥaqīqah al-Tawassul, p.214-215)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a little imaginative of Himyarī to say the ḥadīth is authentic according to the condition of both Imām Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">G.F. Ḥaddād has also attempted to authenticate this report while relying on the works of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ and Muḥammad bin ʿAlawī al-Malikī. He pushes the line of argument of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ that the criticism is undetailed which is laughable as we have shown in this discourse. The Sūfī Aḥmad Daḥlān has also attempted to authenticate this report as does al-Ḥabīb al-Jifrī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The central argument of the detractors is that Rawhū is differed over and that the criticism levied against him is not detailed but rather general and therefore we take the general praise and authentication of him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and accepted by the detractors themselves that Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim are both mutāsahil ie lenient with their gradings and authentication. It does not make sense for them to accept this and leave the criticism. They couple this argument with the fact the criticism and discrediting is undetailed and vague, therefore one retorts to the position of praise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This has been answered by Shaikh al-Albānī and the scholars before him wherein he mentions the reasons Rawhū is weak. The main reason being he would narrate rejected narrations and that his narrations were rejected themselves. At times he would be a lone reporter of narration without any support.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAmr bin ʿAbd al-Munʿim explains that Imāms al-Ṭabarānī, Abū Nuʿaym and Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythamī have all declared this to be a lone report of Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and none of the other students and companions of Sufyān narrates this from except Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and these other students of Sufyān were memorisers and trustworthy narrators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Imām Ibn Ḥibbān citing Rawhū in his al-Thiqat, it is not tantamount to trustworthiness as he is known to be lenient ie Mutasāhil. Whatever he mentions under his entry in his al-Thiqāt does not clarify the affair of Rawhū except that it is information as we have shown under his entry, which has preceded. Rather we find this entry alludes to all of his narrations being of the rejected type.”</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is responded to here:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Abu Nuaym chains contain Rawh ibn Salàh al-Hàkim asserted was trustworthy and highly dependable (thiqa ma’mun) –as mentioned by Ibn Hajar in Lisàn al-Mïzàn (2:465 #1876), Ibn Hibbàn included him in al-Thiqàt (8:244), and al-Fasawï considered him trustworthy (cf. Mamdoh, Raf‘ [p. 148]).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Al-Haythamï (9:257) said: “Al-Tabarànï narrated it in al-Kabïr and al-Awsat and its chain contains Rawh ibn Salàh whom Ibn Hibbàn and al-Hàkim declared trustworthy although there is some weakness in him, and the rest of its sub-narrators are the men of sound hadïth.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I was unable to find Abu Hàtim’s declaration of Rawh as trustworthy reported by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Alawï in his Mafàhïm (10th ed. p. 145 n. 1). Nor does Shaykh Mahmod Mamdoh in his discussion of this hadïth in Raf‘ al-Minàra (p. 147-155) mention such a grading on the part of Abu Hàtim although he considers Rawh “truthful” (sadaq) and not “weak” (da‘ïf), according to the rules of hadïth science when no reason is given with regard to a narrator’s purported discreditation (jarhmubham ghayr mufassar).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mamdoh (p. 149-150) noted that although Albànï in his Silsila Da‘ïfa (1:32-33) claims it is a case of explicated discreditation (jarh mufassar) yet he himself declares identically-formulated discreditation cases as unexplicated and therefore unacceptable in two different contexts! Ibn ‘Alawï adds that the hadïth is also narrated from Ibn ‘Abbàs by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr –without specifying where –and from Jàbir by Ibn Abï Shayba, but without the du‘à.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Imàm al-Kawtharï said of this hadïth in his Maqàlàt (p. 410): “It provides textual evidence whereby there is no difference between the living and the dead in the context of using a means (tawassul), and this is explicit tawassul through the Prophets, while the hadïth of the Prophet from Abu Sa‘ïd al-Khudrï ‘O Allàh, I ask You by the right of [the promise made to] those who ask You (bihaqqi al-sà’ilïna ‘alayk)’* constitutes tawassul through the generality of Muslims, both the living and the dead.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Furthermore, the hadith of Hadrat Fatima bint Asad رضى الله عنه is proving the istihbab or fadail of tawasul and daif ahadith are accepted in fada`il.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong><br />
<span><strong><span style="color: #000080;">There is no answer from the detractor except that I had already mentioned it on my article. We already know some scholars of hadith praised Rawhu but he was criticised by numerous others and the criticism takes precedence and the author even knows this yet the Barelwi sect will try anything to slip falsehood through. Interesting to Ibn Alawi used Abu Hatim when that does not even exist while our detractors is concerned with Tasahul. It does not matter how many other chains there are if they cannot be substantiated as the detractors acknowledges. al-Kawtharis statement is redundant as it it is another attempt to mix the issues up, in order to seek tawassul from the dead you need clear authentic evidences which you have not provided, and as Shaykh al-Albani has done in his book besides many others proved permissible tawassul from authentic texts.</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><strong><span style="color: #000080;">If the claim was Istihbab then the detractor and his Sufi Barelwi elders would not have had a problem with those who did not make tawassul with the dead, so its not a case of Istihbab with you. The unnamed guy then admits the narration could be weak and then changes his line of argument by saying weak narrations can be used in Fadhail? So, you admit the narration is weak? What the detractor should be more concerned with is, if Tawassul is matter of creed and not a matter of fiqh with them, they need to bring mutawatir ahadith and not Ahad ahadith for them to be taken in Aqidah, since this is the core principle of Sufi Barelwi Ash&#8217;arim. What is the point of responding if you don&#8217;t follow your own theological principles.</span></strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the 15 point in response to the piteous video of the hanafi fiqh channel left a sour taste in your mouths, this will not be any easier. Therefore, no long discourses, polemics or semantics, we will show you the reality of these people i.e. the Hanafi fiqh channel and their cohorts, their dire and embarrassing double standards through their criteria of bigoted hanafi partisanship and madhhabist spirit. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The hanafi fiqh channel ran with a youtube video of Shaikh al-Albani allegedly weakening a hadith is Bukhari, but did they develop amnesiac delirium when their own scholars and arch proponents of the Asharite Maturidi Hanafi Madhhab, the defender of the Hanafi Madhab, the Majnun Abi Hanifah, Muhammad Zahid bin Hussain al-Kawthari weakened hadith in Bukhari and Muslim. What happened? You turned a blind eye to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As mentioned before, if you had any fairness and justice you would make a youtube video against Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, but obviously you don&#8217;t have the guts to do that right?

Shaikh al-Albani asks Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah a rhetorical question regarding his Shaikh, al-Kawthari who weakened hadith in the Sahihayn or either in Bukhari or Muslim, and as such they are ahadith which are well established according to the Ahl al-Hadith. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I was brought al-Buraq Who is an animal white and long, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule, who would place his hoof a distance equal to the range of version. I mounted it and came to the Temple (Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem), then tethered it to the ring used by the prophets. I entered the mosque and prayed two rak&#8217;ahs in it, and then came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriel said: You have chosen the natural thing. Then he took me to heaven. Gabriel then asked the (gate of heaven) to be opened and he was asked who he was. He replied: Gabriel. He was again asked: Who is with you? He (Gabriel) said: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? Gabriel replied: He has indeed been sent for. And (the door of the heaven) was opened for us and lo! we saw Adam. He welcomed me and prayed for my good. Then we ascended to the second heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) (asked the door of heaven to be opened), and he was asked who he was. He answered: Gabriel; and was again asked: Who is with you? He replied: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. The gate was opened. When I entered &#8216;Isa b. Maryam and Yahya b. Zakariya (peace be upon both of them), cousins from the maternal side. welcomed me and prayed for my good Then I was taken to the third heaven and Gabriel asked for the opening (of the door). He was asked: Who are you? He replied: Gabriel. He was (again) asked: Who is with you? He replied Muhammad (ﷺ). It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and I saw Yusuf (peace of Allah be upon him) who had been given half of (world) beauty. He welcomed me prayed for my well-being. Then he ascended with us to the fourth heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) asked for the (gate) to be opened, and it was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was (again) said: Who is with you? He said: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. The (gate) was opened for us, and lo! Idris was there. He welcomed me and prayed for my well-being (About him) Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious, has said:&#8221; We elevated him (Idris) to the exalted position&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an xix. 57). Then he ascended with us to the fifth heaven and Gabriel asked for the (gate) to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He replied Gabriel. It was (again) said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad. It was said Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and then I was with Harun (Aaron-peace of Allah be upon him). He welcomed me prayed for my well-being. Then I was taken to the sixth heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) asked for the door to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and there I was with Musa (Moses peace be upon him) He welcomed me and prayed for my well-being. Then I was taken up to the seventh heaven. Gabriel asked the (gate) to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He said: Gabriel It was said. Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad (may peace be upon him.) It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and there I found Ibrahim (Abraham peace be upon him) reclining against the Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur and there enter into it seventy thousand angels every day, never to visit (this place) again. Then I was taken to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha whose leaves were like elephant ears and its fruit like big earthenware vessels. And when it was covered by the Command of Allah, it underwent such a change that none amongst the creation has the power to praise its beauty. Then Allah revealed to me a revelation and He made obligatory for me fifty prayers every day and night. Then I went down to Moses (peace be upon him) and he said: What has your Lord enjoined upon your Ummah? I said: Fifty prayers. He said: Return to thy Lord and beg for reduction (in the number of prayers), for your community shallnot be able to bear this burden. as I have put to test the children of Isra&#8217;il and tried them (and found them too weak to bear such a heavy burden). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I went back to my Lord and said: My Lord, make things lighter for my Ummah. (The Lord) reduced five prayers for me. I went down to Moses and said. (The Lord) reduced five (prayers) for me, He said: Verily thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden; return to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. I then kept going back and forth between my Lord Blessed and Exalted and Moses, till He said: There are five prayers every day and night. O Muhammad, each being credited as ten, so that makes fifty prayers. He who intends to do a good deed and does not do it will have a good deed recorded for him; and if he does it, it will be recorded for him as ten; whereas he who intends to do an evil deed and does not do, it will not be recorded for him; and if he does it, only one evil deed will be recorded. I then came down and when I came to Moses and informed him, he said: Go back to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: I returned to my Lord until I felt ashamed before Him.&#8221;</em> (Bukhari no.13, 478, 479, Muslim no.162)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Abu Huraira reported: The people said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): Messenger of Allah, shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the moon on the night when it is full? They said: Messenger of Allah, no. He (the Messenger) further said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the sun, when there is no cloud over it? They said: Messenger of Allah. no. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Verily you would see Him like this (as you see the sun and the moon). God will gather people on the Day of Resurrection and say: Let every people follow what they worshipped. Those who worshipped the sun would follow the sun, and those who worshipped the moon would follow the moon, and those who worshipped the devils would follow the devils. This Ummah (of Islam) alone would be left behind and there would be hypocrites too amongst it. Allah would then come to them in a form other than His own Form, recognisable to them, and would say: I am your Lord. They would say: We take refuge with Allah from thee. We will stay here till our Lord comes to us. and when our Lord would come we would recognise Him. Subsequently Allah would come to them in His own Form, recognisable to them, and say: I am your Lord. They would say: Thou art our Lord. And they would follow Him, and a bridge would be set over the Hell; and I (the Holy Prophet) and my Ummah would be the first to pass over it; and none but the messengers would speak on that day, and the prayer of the messengers on that day would be: O Allah! grant safety, grant safety. In Hell, there would be long spits like the thorns of Sa&#8217;dan He (the Holy Prophet) said: Have you seen Sa&#8217;dan? They replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah. He said: Verily those (hooks) would be like the thorns of Sa&#8217;dan, but no one knows their size except Allah. These would seize people for their misdeeds. Some of them would escape for their (good) deeds, and some would be rewarded for their deeds till they get salvation. When Allah would finish judging His bondsmen and because of His mercy decide to take out of Hell such people as He pleases. He would command the angels to bring out those who had not associated anything with Allah; to whom Allah decided to show mercy. those who would say: There is no god but Allah. They (the angels) would recognise them in the Fire by the marks of prostration, for Hell-fire will devour everything (limb) of the sons of Adam except the marks of prostration. Allah has forbidden the fire to consume the marks of prostration. They will be taken out of the Fire having been burnt, and the water of life would be poured over them, and they will sprout as seed does In the silt carried by flood. Then Allah would finish judging amongst His bondsmen; but a man who will be the last to enter Paradise will remain facing Hell and will say: O my Lord I turn my face away from Hell, for its air has poisoned me ard its blaze has burnt me. He will then call to Allah as long as Allah would wish that he should call to Him. Then Allah, Blessed and Exalted, would say: If I did that, perhaps you would ask for more than that. He would say: I would not ask You more than this, and he would give his Lord covenants and agreements as Allah wished, and so He would turn his face away from the Fire When he turns towards the Paradise and sees it, he will remain silent as long as Allah wishes him to remain so. He will then say: O my Lord I bring me forward to the gate of the Paradise. Allah would say to him: Did you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything besides what I had given you. Woe to thee! O son of Adam, how treacherous you are! He would say: O my Lord! and would continue calling to Allah till He would say to him: If I grant you that, perhaps you will ask for more. He will reply: No, by Thy greatness, and he will give His Lord promises and covenants as Allah had wished. He would then bring him to the gate of the Paradise, and when he would stand at the gate of the Paradise, it would lay open before him. and he would see the bounty and the joy that there is in it. He would remain quiet as long as Allah would desire him to remain silent. He would then say: O my Lord, admit me to Paradise. Allah. Blessed and Exalted, would say: Did you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything more than what I had granted you? Woe to you! son of Adam, how treacherous you are! And he would say: O my Lord, I do not wish to be the most miserable of Thy creatures. He would continue calling upon Allah till Allah, Blessed and Exalted, would laugh. When Allah would laugh at him, He would say: Enter the Paradise. When he would enter, Allah would say: State your wish. He would express his wishes till Allah would remind him (the desire of) such and such (things). When his desires would be exhausted Allah would say: That is for thee and, besides it, the like of it also. &#8216;Ata&#8217; b. Yazid said: Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri was with Abu Huraira and be did not reject anything from the hadith narrated by him, but when Abu Huraira narrated:&#8221; Allah said to that man; ind its like along with it,&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said:&#8221; Ten like it along with it,&#8221; O Abu Huraira. Abu Huraira said: I do not remember except the words:&#8221; That is for you and a similar one along with it.&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said: I bear witness to the fact that I remembered from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) his words:&#8221; That is for thee and ten like it.&#8221; Abu Huraira said: That man was the last of those deserving of Paradise to enter Paradise.&#8221; </em>(Bukhari 11:444, 446, 13:319-320), Muslim no.182)</span></p>

Those people will come out (of the River of Life) like pearls, and they will have (golden) necklaces, and then they will enter Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say, &#8216;These are the people emancipated by the Beneficent. He has admitted them into Paradise without them having done any good deeds and without sending forth any good (for themselves).&#8217; Then it will be said to them, &#8216;For you is what you have seen and its equivalent as well.&#8221;</em> (Bukhari 8:663, 664, 13:420, 422, Muslim no.183)</span></p>

<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(<em>Ta&#8217;nib al-Khatib</em> p.185)</span></strong></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;All of the aforementioned ahadith are in the al-Sahihayn or in either one of them, which al-Kawthari weakened all of them and if a person of knowledge was to scrutinise and analyse his (al-Kawthari&#8217;s) books and the books he annotated, they would collate a voluminous book.&#8221; </em>(Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah 39-40)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">End of the words of Shaikh al-Albani.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Kawthari also weakens the hadith where Ali sends Abu al-Hayya al-Asadi to destroy images and high graves. The text of the hadith is,</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Abu&#8217;l-Hayyaj al-Asadi said that Ali (b. Abu Talib) said to him: &#8220;Should I not send you on the same mission as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) sent me? Do not leave an image without obliterating it, or a high grave without levelling It. This hadith has been reported by Habib with the same chain of transmitters and he said: (Do not leave) a picture without obliterating it.&#8221;</em> (Muslim no.969)</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Kawthari weakens this hadith in his <em>Maqalat al-Kawthari</em> (p.159)</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not need to introduce al-Kawthari to you, dear readers, as his reality and affair is clear and manifest. However, we would like to present just one example in how the Hanafi Deobandi Ash&#8217;ari Maturidi&#8217;s are part of this trinitarian nexus of Hanafi Ash&#8217;ari/Maturidi, Deobandi Sufi and Barelwi Sufi and how they are all interlinked and intrinsically connected.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The well known Hanafi Deobandi Ash&#8217;ari Maturidi Ustadh, Mawlana Muhammad Yusuf Binnouri, who was the student of Mawlana Anwar Shah Kashmiri, who in turn was a student of Mawlana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, Mawlana Mahmud al-Hasan and Mawlana Abdul Qadir Raipuri. This is the link.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Muhammad Yusuf Binnouri lauds, extols and praises the likes of this, al-Kawthari, whose popularity is unique due to his appalling and reprehensible views and doctrines. In this era he championed the ideas of the Jahmiyyah, Murji&#8217;ah and the Mu&#8217;tazilies all under the defence of the hanafi madhhab.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even the likes of Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmad and his Dar ul-taqlid have association with him, they venerate him and are secret admirers without having plucked the courage to openly promote him as of yet, except use him when they need without giving the game away.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Yusuf Binnouri introduced the compilation of articles of Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, titled Maqalat al-Kawthari, which is spread over 10 pages. Over the 10 pages he praises him, that he refutes the detractors etc, in one place he says,</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;(he was) a pure upright hanafi who destroyed all big and small idols.&#8221;</em> (Introduction to Maqalat al-Kawthari p.6)</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">he also he was,</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was a shining sword, an unsheathed famous Indian sword.&#8221;</em> (Introduction to Maqalat al-Kawthari p.7)</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the reality of the Deobandi Hanafi&#8217;s who are Ash&#8217;arites Maturidi&#8217;s. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;">There are a number of posts which are circulating on social media, all in all of which attempt to criticise, defame and undermine the continuous efforts and struggles of,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani (1420H)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some of these people, and I say this politely, have demonstrated dire comprehension of intricate issues while others have manifested their innate hatred and animosity for this Allamah Rabbani, based on nothing but tassub, tahazzub and their ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The life and efforts of Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani are well known and comprehensively documented, and no one can deny this even if they tried. In reality we do not need to mention his virtues, his efforts and works. The words &#8220;authenticated or graded xyz by al-Albani&#8221; in almost every other Islamic book by friends and foes alike, is unprecedented virtue by any account.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, sometimes a general reminder to ourselves and to our mutual friends, puts things into perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Oh insignificant one&#8217;s, Let us remind you of who al-Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Imam Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani is.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He was the man who was born in a european country, which was and still is virtually unknown, he was responsible for putting that country on the map for Muslims, academics as well orientalists. Who knew Albania except through our Allamah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He was forced to move from his country at a young age due to communism. He moved to Syria with his family who were strict practising Hanafis. They made fun of him in the classroom while he excelled beyond degree in his Arabic language, syntax and morphology compared to his fellow classmates. They would say what does this Ajami know.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He was ostracised, shunned and thrown out of his family home by his strict hanafi family due to his firmness in sticking to the Quran and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Poor and destitute, worked as an honest watchmaker, who would look for scraps of pieces of paper to write prophetic Hadith on, to the extent he would write complete volumes of books in this way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would travel the city to the library and the locals would make fun of him due to him riding a bike, they ridiculed him nationally in their newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He was imprisoned in syria by the mulhid bathists Alawite shias, numerous times for teaching the Quran and Sunnah as well propagating Salafi Dawah. He was put in prison repeatedly and tested with their evil plots time and time again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He was forced to move to Jordan, than UAE, then Syria again and then to Jordan, due to the hatred of the innovator heretics.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He single handedly rebuked and took charge of chief innovators and clear deviants a like. These deviants were the heads of misguidance who misguided thousands to innovations and corrupt beliefs and heresies, from the likes of</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The heretical Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, the chief innovator who reviled everyone from the Sahabah to the Great Salaf us-Salihin</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">His student, Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah the Asharite Hanafi apologist and proponent of the Deobandis</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Syrian Sufi Asharite, Muhammad Said Ramadhan Buti.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Then he dealt with, not 1, not 2 but three of the Ghumari brothers of Morocco, Ahmad, Abdullah and Abd al-Aziz.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He took charge and held at Bay the evil heresies and ideas of Abdullah al-Harari ie the founder of the al-Ahbash and his cult beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He answered and dealt with the rafidi arch liar, Hassan Saqqaf.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Also the Deobandi and dubious Habib ur Rehman al-Azmi, who did not have the guts use his real name, he was also answered and subdued. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And the list, by the permission and assistance of Allah alone, is continuous.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The man who checked over 30,000 ahadith and wrote over 200 books, some of which run into volumes!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The man who single handedly organised the whole of Maktabah Zahiriyyah library, which was one of the most important libraries of the Islamic world.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The man who produced some of the most prolific students and formidable scholars this century has seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And then&#8230;&#8230;you have the audacity to attack this man with your childish and immature remarks!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We do not go beyond bounds in praise of our Ulama and neither do we make open blind taqlid of them,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However after praising Allah, we thank him for sending us this mujaddid. May Allah have mercy on him, forgive him and accept his efforts and servitude. Amin</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Oh ignorant ones, whoever you are, know your maqam and manzilah when you talk about</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the main aims of Salafi Research Institute is to uphold the views of Ahl al-Sunnah wa Ahl al-Ḥadīth with regards to the matters of creed and manhaj as established by the pious predecessors namely the Salaf us-Ṣāleḥ.  In serving this aim we within SRI continuously strive to rebut and clarify the doubts posed by deviant ideologies based on authentic clear and pristine teachings of the Qurʾān and Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In line with the above; we present to you the second part in a series answering the false arguments presented for the impermissible forms of Tawassul and Istighātha.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This and other research papers, we hope In-Shāʾ-Allāh, will aid the Sunnī Muslim to protect himself from the misinterpretations, distortions and alterations of the people of deviation and innovation. With the aid and assistance of Allāh, The Most Merciful; these articles and research papers will be released and shared on a periodic basis. May Allāh have Mercy on us and grant us the understanding of the correct ʿAqīdah of Ahl al-Sunnah waʾl Jamaʿah and the Salaf us-Ṣāleḥ.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sūfī’s, including the likes of the Barewlī’s and Deobandī sects use this ḥadīth of Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha as proof for making Tawassul through the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Prophets. They claim the wording of the ḥadīth is proof for the permissibility of wasīlah through the Prophets. The proceeding discourse investigates this ḥadīth by looking at its authenticity and a brief overview of the text.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the end, we have touched on the ridiculously despicable claim made by some desperate abhorrent people, who tried to allege our beloved and beautiful Prophet, Muḥammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) committed necrophilia. When such people have no share of any academic discourse they always resort to such despicable lies and weak arguments to defame Islām. This then is an answer to the Ḥadīth of Fātimah bin Asad; The mother of ʿAlī RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnhumā</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Ḥadīth</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">عن أنس بن مالك قال‏:‏ لما ماتت فاطمة بنت أسد بن هاشم أم علي رضي الله عنهما دخل عليها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فجلس عند رأسها فقال‏:‏ ‏&#8221;‏رحمك الله يا أمي، كنت أمي بعد أمي، تجوعين وتشبعيني، وتعرين وتكسيني، وتمنعين نفسك طيباً وتطعميني، تريدين بذلك وجه الله والدار الآخرة‏&#8221;‏‏.‏ ثم أمر أن تغسل ثلاثاً فلما بلغ الماء الذي فيه الكافور سكبه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بيده، ثم خلع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قميصه فألبسها إياه، وكفنها ببرد فوقه، ثم دعا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أسامة بن زيد وأبا أيوب الأنصاري وعمر بن الخطاب وغلاماً أسود يحفرون، فحفروا قبرها، فلما بلغوا اللحد حفره رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بيده وأخرج ترابه بيده، فلما فرغ دخل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فاضطجع فيه فقال‏:‏ ‏&#8221;‏الله الذي يحيي ويميت، وهو حي لا يموت، اغفر لأمي فاطمة بنت أسد، ولقنها حجتها، ووسِّع عليها مدخلها بحق نبيك والأنبياء الذين من قبلي فإنك أرحم الراحمين‏&#8221;‏‏.‏ وكبر عليها أربعاً، وأدخلوها اللحد هو والعباس وأبو بكر الصديق رضي الله عنهم‏</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>It is narrated by Anas bin Mālik. He said: When the mother of ʿAlī bin Abū Ṭālib — Fātimah bint Asad bin Hāshim (RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnhumā— died, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) called on her and sat down by the head of the bed and said, “O dear mother, may Allāh have mercy on you. After my mother, you were the one I regarded as my mother. When I was hungry you fed me to the point of saturation while you yourself remained hungry. Then you helped me put on clothes and instead of eating yourself, you gave me nice things to eat. You did all this for Allāh’s pleasure and for a good reward in the Hereafter.” Then he (the Prophet) commanded to bathe her three times. When camphor water was brought, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) poured some water into his hands. Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) took off his shirt and clothed her with it and used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin. Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) sent for Ūsāmah bin Zayd, Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī and ʿUmar bin al-Khaṭṭāb and the Abyssinian slave to dig up the grave. So they dug her grave. When they reached near the laḥd, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) dug it up and drew the soil out with his own hands. When he finished, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) entered and lay down in (the grave), and said, “It is Allāh Who controls life and death, and He is Ever living and will never die. (O Allāh,) forgive my mother—Fātimah bint Asad— and help her answer properly at the time of questioning and through the mediation/right of Your Prophet (Muḥammad) and the former Prophets, Surely You are infinitely Merciful.” Then he repeated, “Allāh is Great” four times (i.e. led the funeral prayer). Then he, ʿAbbās and Abū Bakr as-Ṣiddīq lowered her into the grave.</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abū Nuʿaym al-Aṣfahānī said after transmitting the report,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is Gharīb from the Ḥadīth of ʿĀṣim and al-Thawrī and we do not write it except it being the lone report of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ.” </em>(<em>al-Ḥilyah ul-Awliyāʾ wa Ṭabaqāt al-Aṣfiyā</em> (3:121, under the entry of ʿĀṣim bin Suleimān al-Aḥwal no.226), Beirut: Maktabah Khanjī/Dār al-Fikr, 1416H/1996)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also transmits it with the same chain in <em>Maʿrifah al-Ṣahābah</em> and he cites the same chain as the Ḥilyah. (<em>Maʿrifah al-Sahābah</em> (6:3408, tarjamah no. 3970 no.7783), Riyadh, Dār al-Waṭan, 1419H/1998)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Nūr al-Dīn al-Haythamī said after transmitting it,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“No one narrates it from ʿĀṣim except Sufyān and it is a lone report of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ.”</em> (<em>Majmaʿa al-Baḥrayn</em> (6:362), Riyadh: Maktabah Ibn Rushd, 1413H/1992)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He, al-Haythamī also said after transmitting it in his <em>Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid</em> said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Transmitted by Ṭabarānī in al-Kabīr and in al-Awsaṭ and Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ is in the chain who was declared trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim, however he has weakness with him and the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ.”</em> (<em>Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid</em> (9:256-257), Cairo: Maktabah al-Quddūsī, 1414H:1994)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī narrates from Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ (<em>Kitāb al-Maʿrifah wal-Tārīkh</em> (3:513), Madīnah: Maktabah al-Dār, 1410H), <em>Mawḍeḥ al-Awhām al-Jamʿa waʿl Tafrīq</em> (2:96-97)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said he wrote narrations from 1,000 teachers and all of them were trustworthy as stated by Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr in his <em>Tahdhīb al-Tahdhīb</em> under the entry of Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān (<em>Tahdhīb al-Tahdhīb</em> 11:337 no.8138), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1415H/1994).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, this renders Rawhū to be trustworthy according to Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Aḥmad al-Ḥākim al-Kabīr brings his entry in his book of names and kunyahs, without any praise or criticism. (<em>Kitāb al-Asāmī wal-Kuna</em> (3:419 no.1637), Madīnah: Maktabah al-Ghurabāʿ al-Athariyyah, 1414H/1994)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy brings under Rawhū bin Ṣalāh’s entry says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Weak…. he does not have many ḥadīth narrated from (names of narrators) and some of them are rejected.” He also cites a few other reports under Rawhū’s biographical entry and says these two aḥadīth are unpreserved.”</em> (<em>al-Kāmil Fiʾl Duʿafaʾ al-Rijāl</em> (4:553-554 no.668), Riyādh: Maktabah al-Rushd, Edn. Māzin al-Sarsāwī)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy thus further indicates the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ by mentioning two unpreserved chains.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dāraquṭnī brings his entry in his book and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ bin Sayābah, he narrates from Ibn Lahiyyʿah and from al-Thawrī and others, he was weak in ḥadīth and he resided in Miṣr.”</em> (<em>al-Muʿtalif waʾl Mukhtalif </em>(3:1377), Beirut: Dār al-Gharb al-Islāmī, 1406H/1986)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Ḥāfiẓ al-Burqānī’s question to Imām al-Dāraquṭnī he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abuʾl Ḥasan (ie Imām Dāraquṭnī) said to me, I heard Abū Ṭālib say, the brother of Maymūn, his name was Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī, he was a resident of Miṣr, he said to me, “We are in agreement (ie the people of ḥadīth) that we do not write the ḥadīth of three people of Miṣr, (1) ʿAlī bin al-Ḥasan al-Sāmī (2) Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and (3) ʿAbd al-Munʿim bin Bashīr.”</em> (<em>Suwālāt Abī Bakr al-Burqānī lil-Dāraquṭnī Fī al-Jarḥ waʾl Taʿdīl</em> (p.56-57 no.18), Cairo: Maktabah al-Qurʿān, ?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Burqānī further said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“And then Abuʾl Ḥasan (ie Imām Dāraquṭnī) said to me, Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, he is also referred to as Rawhū bin Sayābah Miṣrī, likewise ʿAbd al-Munʿim Miṣrī and ʿAlī bin al-Ḥasan al-Sāmī Miṣrī.”</em> (<em>Suwālāt Abī Bakr al-Burqānī lil-Dāraquṭnī Fī al-Jarḥ waʾl Taʿdīl</em> (p.57)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people of a country know its people better, especially when it comes to praise and criticism and this is a general principle. Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī was given the title of al-Ḥāfiẓ and he was also a resident of Miṣr, the likes of Imām al-Ṭabarānī narrated from him. He died in the year 296H. (<em>Tārīkh Baghdād</em> (5:8).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is why Imām al-Dāraquṭnī specifically mentions Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī as a resident of Miṣr and he further emphasises this by mentioning the names of the three narrators and refers to them as al-Miṣrī. The affair of the other two narrators is very disparaging which gives us an indication of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ. (refer to the general books of Rijāl)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī brings his entry in his book on making distinctions between narrators without mentioning any praise or criticism and clarifies Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, is also Rawhū bin Sayābah al-Ḥarithī and then brings the statement of Imām al-Dāraquṭnī, where he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ bin Sayābah.”</em> (<em>Mawḍeḥ al-Awhām al-Jamʿa waʾl Tafrīq</em> (2:96-97) Beirut: Dār al-Fikr al-Islāmī, 1405H/1985)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Ḥibbān added his biographical note in his book of trustworthy narrators, he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, from the people of Miṣr, he narrates from Yaḥyā bin Ayūb and his countrymen and Muḥammad bin Ibrāhīm al-Bawshanjī narrates from him, he was from the people of Miṣr.”</em> (<em>Kitāb al-Thiqāt</em> (8:244), Hyderabād: Daʾirah al-Maʿārif al-Uthmāniyyah, 1393H/1973)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Sijzī asked Imām al-Ḥākim about him and he replied,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāh, trustworthy and safe, he was from the people of Shām.”</em> (<em>Suwālāt Masʿud bin ʿAlī al-Sijzī Maʿa Asilah al-Baghdadiyīn ʿAnn Aḥwāl al-Rūwāt Lil Ḥākim</em> (p.98 no.68), Beirut, Dār al-Gharb al-Islāmī, 1408H/1988)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Mākūlā after mentioning him says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ bin Sayābah, who narrates from Ibn Lahiyyʿah, al-Thawrī and others, he was declared weak in ḥadīth and was a resident of Miṣr.”</em> (<em>al-Ikmāl Fī Rafʿa al-Irtiyāb ʿAnn Muʿtalif Fī al-Asmā wal-Kunā waʾl-Ansāb</em> (5:15), Hyderabād: Daʾirah al-Maʿārif al-Uthmāniyyah, 1383H/1963)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The words of Imām Ibn Mākūlā, <em>“He was declared weak ie Ḍaʿfūhu.”</em> Indicates a number of scholars of Ḥadīth declared him to be weak and hence indicates a general agreement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-ʿAsqalānī said under his entry,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ibn ʿAdiyy weakened him, Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned him in his al-Thiqāt, al-Ḥākim said he was trustworthy and safe, Ibn Yūnus mentioned in Tārīkh al-Ghurabāʿ he was from the people of Moṣul and resided in Miṣr and they narrate from him, and narrations which are rejected have been transmitted from him (ie he would narrate rejected narrations). al-Dāraquṭnī said he was weak in ḥadīth. Ibn Mākūlā said they have declared him to be weak and Ibn ʿAdiyy said after transmitting two of his ḥadīth, he has many aḥadīth and some of them are rejected.”</em> (<em>Lisān al-Mizān</em> (2:539-540 no.3433), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1416H/1996)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We looked at the <em>Tārīkh al-Ghurabāʿ</em> of Ibn Yūnus and were unable to find his statement on Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, this does not indicate in any form that Ibn Ḥajr erred but rather that we were unable to find it, therefore, if anyone does find Ibn Yūnus’s statement please do inform us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī said in his biographical note on Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In his reference work on the history of Islām, Imām al-Dhahabī includes an entry for him, after mentioning the people he narrated from as well as those who narrated from him, he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He has reprehensive (Manākīr-narrations), Ibn ʿAdiyy said he is weak, Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned him in his al-Thiqāt, he died in Ramaḍhān in Miṣr in (2)33H, he was from the last people who narrated from Musā, Yaḥyā and Saʿīd. al-Ḥākim said he was trustworthy and safe and a Shāmī.”</em> (<em>Tārīkh al-Islām wa Wafyāt al-Mashāhīr al-ʿAlām</em> (17:160-161 no.138), Beirut: Dār al-Kitāb al-ʿArabī, 1411H/1991)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr, Imām al-Dhahabī and others have taken al-Ḥākims view from al-Sijzī and mentioned it in their respective books. Likewise, it is possible that Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr also quoted the view of Ibn Yūnus from his <em>Tārīkh al-Ghurabāʿ.</em> The intent here is to show Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr in his <em>Lisān</em> takes the statement from the books of the earlier scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī further brings his entry in his book of weak and abandoned narrators.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn al-Jawzī has also classed him as a weak and abandoned narrator, he mentions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, or they say Rawhū bin Shibābah (it should be Sayābah), his kunyah is Abaʾl Ḥārith, he narrates from Ibn Lahiyyʿah, Ibn ʿAdiyy said he is weak.” </em>(<em>Kitāb al-Ḍuʿafāʾ wal-Matrūkīn </em>(1:287 no.1643), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah,?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Ḥāfiẓ Ibn al-Jawzī cites this report in his book of fabricated and weak narrations under the chapter of the virtues of Fātimah bint Asad, and then transmits it with his chain through to al-Ṭabarānī and thereafter says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>The author (ie referring to himself) says this is a lone report of Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ who is from the unknown narrators and furthermore, Ibn ʿAdiyy has declared him to be weak.”</em> (<em>al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Fīʾl Aḥadīth al-Wahiyyah</em> (1:268-269 no.433), Faiṣalabād: Idārah ʿUlūm al-Atharīyyah, 1399H/1979), Cf.

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ṭabāranī transmits in in his al-Awsaṭ p.356-357 part of the Majmaʿa al-Baḥrayn and he said, “no one has transmitted this from ʿĀṣim except Sufyān and it’s the lone report of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and it is mentioned in Majmaʿa 9:257 that Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is in the chain, who was declared trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim, however he has weakness in him and the rest of the narrators are the narrator of the Ṣaḥīḥ and Abū Nuʿaym also transmitted it from the author in al-Ḥilyah 3:121.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>My Shaykh (ie Shaykh al-Albānī) has challenged the statement of Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythami in his Silsilah Āḥadith al-Ḍaʿīfahʾ no.23, where he says in Majmaʿa the rest of the narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ, that Aḥmad bin Ḥamād (bin Zughbah), who although is in himself trustworthy the authors of the Ṣaḥīḥs have not transmitted from him as only al-Nasāʿī transmits from him.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ḥamdi ʿAbd al-Majīd al-Salafī answers the authentication of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“As for Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who has been declared to be trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and Hakim, then it is well known about both of them that they are mutasāhil ie lenient. He was declared to be weak by Ibn ʿAdiyy and Ibn Yūnus said he would narrate rejected narrations. Darāquṭnī said he is weak in Ḥadīth and Ibn Mākūlā weakened him and Ibn ʿAdiyy said after transmitting two of this ḥadīth he has many āḥadīth and some of them are abandoned.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Thus, this is detailed criticism from the specialist critical analysts, furthermore, his narrations are rejected and this is the case with this narration and when he is alone in reporting such ḥadīth they are rejected and cannot be used as evidence therefore, the ḥadīth is is weak.” </em>(<em>Muʿajam al-Kabīr</em> (24:351-352), Cairo: Maktabah Ibn Taymiyyah, 1415H/1994)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The verifier of <em>Majmaʿa al-Baḥrayn Fi Zawāʿid al-Muʿajamayn</em>, ʿAbd al-Quddus bin Muḥammad Naẓīr also declared the chain to be weak as well as the narrator Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ. (<em>Majmaʿa al-Baḥrayn</em> (6:361)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAbd Allah bin Ṣiddīq al-Ghumārī also acknowledges that Rawhū has some weakness with him and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū, his weakness is light.”</em> (<em>Ittihāf al-Azkiyaʾ Bijawāj al-Tawassul bil-Anbiyāʾ waʾl Awliyāʾ (p.11)</em> (?: ʾAlī Raḥmī, p.11) and (p.20) cited from <em>Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ</em> (p.146)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albānī also categorically grades it to be weak. He quotes the references first and then the chain followed by the words of Imām al-Ṭabarānī and Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythamī and then proceeds to answer al-Haythamī’s claim. We have quoted the words of Shaikh al-Albānī via the words of Shaikh Ḥamdī ʿAbd al-Majīd al-Salafī that only al-Nasāʿī transmits from Aḥmad bin Ḥamād bin Zughbah. Shaikh al-Albānī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“and his statement “the rest of the narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ” is highly disputable as Zugbah is not from the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ’s, rather they did not transmit from him except al-Nasāʿī, I say we know from this that he is in of himself trustworthy. What therefore remains is the affair of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, and he is a lone reporter as al-Ṭabarānī said and also what al-Haythamī mentions the authentication of Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim but his weakening (by al-Ṭabarānī) has precedence over their statements due to two issues. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The First:</em></strong><em> He is criticised and criticism takes precedence over praise with conditions. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The Second:</em></strong><em> Ibn Ḥibbān is lenient in his authentication of narrators and he has authenticated many narrators who are unknown to the extent that at times he clarifies he does not know who they are nor their fathers as Ibn ʿAbd al-Hādī has mentioned in al-Ṣārim al-Munkī. </em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albānī adds a footnote at this point and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have mentioned some examples (of Imām Ibn Ḥibbāns leniency) in ‘al-Radd ʿAla al-Taʿqub al-Ḥathīth (p.18-21) and then in the introduction of my book, ‘Taysīr Intifāʿ al-Khalān Bikitāb Thiqāt Ibn Ḥibbān’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albāni continues and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The affair is the same with al-Ḥākim and his lapses which are not hidden from the one who is well acquainted with biographies and narrators. Therefore, their statements do not hold weight when there are contradictions even when there is undetailed criticism and the reasons for the criticism is not mentioned but then how about the affair with Ibn Ṣalāḥ when the details are mentioned…”</em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then Shaikh al-Albānī then mentions the criticism and disparaging remarks of the scholars of ḥadīth which have preceded. He continues and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“You have seen how the Imams of criticism (Aiʿmah al-Jarḥ) are in agreement in their words in the weakening of this narrator and they clarify the reason for his weakness due to him narrating rejected reports. The same applies to this report in which he is alone in reporting and thus he is rejected and not used as evidence and therefore, no one is deceived by this praise and authentication except the ignorant or the one with other agenda’s.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>After what has preceded it is apparent to a fair minded person that when Shaikh Zāhid al-Kawtharī spoke about this ḥadīth he was not just with the knowledge of this science. He attempts to strengthen this ḥadīth and he only mentioned the praise and authentication of Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and totally failed to mention the criticism and disaparaging remarks which were greater than those who authenticated him. (Refer to (p.379) Maqalāt al-Kawtharī)</em> (<em>Silsilah Āḥadīth al-Ḍaʿīfahʾ</em> (1:79-82 no.23), Riyadh, Maktabah al-Māʿrif, 1412H/1992)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albāni continues and shows the contradictions of al-Kawtharī and his principles and takes charge of the claims, showing his double standards on the authentications of Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim. He also answers the claim the reason for the criticism is not mentioned and proceeds to mention the reasons. Shaikh Mamḥūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ despite his valiant digressive efforts fails to answer the reason for the criticism as he gracefully glosses over it in his <em>Rafʿ al-Minārah</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It must be noted Shaikh Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ’s response to Shaikh al-Albānī’s answer to this report are significantly inadequate and falls short of being even remotely convincing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albānī further answered some of their retorts and replied directly back to them in his book on Tawassul and went onto to say some of their points were laughable, he said after quoting the text of the ḥadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;al-Haythamī said in Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid (9:257) &#8220;al-Ṭabarānī reports it in al-Kabīr and Awsaṭ and it contains Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who is declared reliable by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim, but is somewhat weak. Then the rest of its narrators are those of the Ṣaḥīḥs.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>I say: by the way of Ṭabarānī it is reported in Abū Nuʿaym in Ḥilyahtul Awliyāʾ (3:121) and their chain of narration is weak since Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who is one its narrators is alone in narrating it as Abū Nuʿaym himself said. Then Rawhū is declared to be weak by Ibn ʿAdiyy, and Ibn Yūnus said, &#8220;Weak and reprehensible things are reported from him.&#8221;al-Dāraquṭnī said, &#8220;He is Ḍaʿīf (weak) in ḥadīth.&#8221; Ibn Mākūlā said, &#8220;They declare him weak.&#8221; Ibn ʿAdiyy said after quoting two of his ḥadīth, &#8220;He reports many Āḥadith and some of them are reprehensible.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So they agree upon his weakness, so the ḥadīth is weak ie munkar since he is alone in reporting it. There are some people who try to strengthen this ḥadīth based upon the declaration of Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim that Rawhū is reliable. However, this will not benefit them due to what is known with regard to their leniency in declaration of reliability.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So this saying of theirs when opposed by sayings of other scholars does not carry any weight even if the declaration of weakness by the other scholars is not explained, so how about when the reason for weakness is made clear as is the case here? I have also fully explained the weakness of this Ḥadīth in al-Ḍaʿīfah no.23 and so I will not repeat that here.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The antagonists whom we have indicated quote that which can only cause laughter, saying, &#8220;Shaikh Nāṣir judged it to be weak, so we ask that he tell us who from the scholars of ḥadīth has declared this ḥadīth to be weak.&#8221; We quoted those who declare its narrator Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ to be weak, and he is alone in reporting it. This automatically means weakness of the ḥadīth unless someone is found to report it along with him, and Abū Nuʿaym had denied that there is anyone supporting this narration, unless another narration of it is found, and that is not the case!</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Then they say, &#8220;Even if we accept that it is weak, then it is only slightly weak which would not prevent action upon it, since it is a case of acting on a ḥadīth whose weakness is not severe in that which relates to mere encouragement and warnings, which is allowed by the scholars of Ḥadīth and Fiqh.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>I say: there is no encouragement in this ḥadīth, nor does it explain some excellent for an action which is already established as being practised in the sharīʿah. Rather it is speaking about something which may be permissible or may not be permissible, therefore it is being used to establish a sharīʿah ruling, if it were authentic. Furthermore, these people are quoting it as a proof for this form of Tawassul about which there is disagreement. So when you accept its weakness then it is not permissible to use it as proof. I do not think any intelligent person would agree that it pertains tore encouragement and warnings. Rather this is the way of those who flee away from submission to the truth, they say things which no intelligent person would say.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tawassul: It&#8217;s Types and Its Rulings</em> (p.101-102) Eng.

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>INTERESTING BENEFIT &#8211; Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is Weak According to the Principles of Shaikh Ẓafar Aḥmad Thānwī</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to the principle of Shaikh Ẓafar Aḥmad Thānwī any narrator not mentioned in The <em>Līsan al-Mizān</em> of Ḥāfiẓ and in the <em>Mizān al-ʿEitidāl</em> of Imām Dhahabī is considered to be trustworthy. Then we say the opposite must also be true by natural default according to Shaikh Ẓafar Aḥmad Thānwī, meaning that any narrator mentioned in the <em>Lisān</em> and <em>Mizān</em> is rendered to be untrustworthy. (<em>Iʿla al-Sunan</em> (7:256)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Understanding Hāfiz al-Haithami&#8217;s Words <em>Rijāluhu Rijāl al-Ṣaḥīḥ</em></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ie and <em>&#8220;the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ&#8221;</em> sometimes when the words of Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythamī are quoted like this after a ḥadīth has been mentioned, a reader’s natural inclination is that the remaining narrators are trustworthy and in turn the narration is authentic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafī scholar, Ḥāfiẓ Zaylaʿī has explained this is not the case and says in very clear words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;If a narrator has been utilised as evidence in the Ṣaḥīḥ, it does not necessitate that every ḥadīth he is in (as a narrator) will fulfil the conditions of an authentic ḥadīth.&#8221;</em> (<em>Naṣb al-Rāyah</em> (1:342)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr also said the same with almost identical words in <em>his al-Nukt ʿAla Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ</em> (1:275) as does Imām Ibn ʿAbd al-Hādī in his <em>Ṣārim al-Munkī</em> (p.256, 259)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Those Who Authenticated Rawhū in Ṣalāḥ and the Chain</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From those who have authenticated the chain are,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-Haythamī wherein he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>Narrated by al-Ṭabarānī with a good chain…”</em> (<em>Ḥāshiyyah al-ʿAllāmah Ibn Ḥajr al-Haythamī ʿAla Sharḥ al-Ayḍaḥ Fi Manāsik al-Ḥajj Lil Imām al-Nawawī</em> (p.500), Beirut: Dar al-Ḥadīth, ?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said the same in his <em>al-Jawhar al-Munaẓẓam Fī Ziyārah al-Qabr al-Sharīf al-Nabawī al-Mukarram</em> (p.110-111), Cairo: Maktabah Madbūlī, 2000)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An infamous writer Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed has alleged, <em>‘Imām al-Samhūdī in his Khulaṣatul Wafāʾ bi-Akhbār Dār al-Muṣtafā has apparently mentioned that this Ḥadīth has a Jayyid Sanad.’ </em>However, al-Samhūdī said the opposite, wherein he asserts and acknowledges weakness in the chain as is evident from his words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Samhūdī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Transmitted in al-Kabīr and Awsaṭ with a chain containing Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who was declared trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim however he has weakness whereas the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ.”</em> (<em>Wafāʾ al-Wafā Biakhbār Dār al-Muṣtafā</em> (3:898-899), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1404H/1984), Cf. <em>Khulāṣah al-Wafā Biakhbār Dār al-Muṣtafā</em> (p.421), Madīnah: al-Maktabah al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1392H/1972), another edition (2:369), Dr. Muḥammad al-Āmīn)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">None of the earlier scholars authenticated the chain except the later ones as mentioned above and they were from the 8th-9th century. This authentication of the later scholars has to be scrutinised and investigated before it is taken as accepted. Even this in the current state only leaves the view of Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-Haythamī to be investigated as Ḥāfiẓ Samhūdī pointed to its weakness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Naturally al-Kawtharī cites the significant words of this report and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The narrators of this ḥadīth are trustworthy except Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and al-Ḥākim said he was trustworthy and safe and Ibn Ḥibbān brings his entry in his al-Thiqāt.” </em>(<em>Maḥqū al-Taqawwūl Fī Masalāḥ al-Tawassūl</em> (p.4), Cairo: al-Maktabah al-Azhariyyah lit-Turāth, 2006), also from <em>Maqalāt al-Kawtharī</em> (p.340), Cairo: Maktabah al-Tawfiqia, ?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, al-Kawtharī himself acknowledges the leniency of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim in the same book <em>al-Maqalāt</em> as mentioned by Imām al-Albānī in <em>Silsilah al-Ḍaʿīfahʾ</em> (1:81), yet here they take and accept the same leniency as evidence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad ibn ʿAlawī al-Malikī quotes it in his book and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is a difference of opinion regarding one of the narrators, Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ, however Ibn Ḥibbān mentions him in his al-Thiqāt and al-Ḥākim said he was safe and trustworthy. So both of them, the two Ḥāfiẓs authenticated the ḥadīth. Likewise al-Haythamī followed up on this in (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid) and said Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is in the chain, Ibn Ḥibbān declared him to be trustworthy as did al-Ḥākim, however, he has some weakness and the remaining narrators are the narrator of the Ṣaḥīḥs.”</em> (<em>Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ</em> (p.146), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1430H/2009)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamdūḥ does the same and claims the narration is Ḥasan. He also quotes the statements of the scholars as we have mentioned above. He says the scholars have differed over Rawhū, some have said he is weak and others have declared him trustworthy. (<em>Rafʿ ul-Minārah Li-Takhrīj Aḥadīth al-Tawassul wal-Ziyārah</em> (p.147-148), Cairo, Maktabah al-Azhariyyah Lit-Turāth, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʿIsā Himyarī jubilantly went on to assert the Ḥadīth is Ṣaḥīḥ ie authentic according to the conditions of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim and Ḥasan according to the conditions of others. (<em>al-Tāʾmul Fī Ḥaqīqah al-Tawassul</em>, p.214-215)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a little imaginative of Himyarī to say the ḥadīth is authentic according to the condition of both Imām Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">G.F. Ḥaddād has also attempted to authenticate this report while relying on the works of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ and Muḥammad bin ʿAlawī al-Malikī. He pushes the line of argument of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ that the criticism is undetailed which is laughable as we have shown in this discourse. The Sūfī Aḥmad Daḥlān has also attempted to authenticate this report as does al-Ḥabīb al-Jifrī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The central argument of the detractors is that Rawhū is differed over and that the criticism levied against him is not detailed but rather general and therefore we take the general praise and authentication of him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and accepted by the detractors themselves that Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim are both mutāsahil ie lenient with their gradings and authentication. It does not make sense for them to accept this and leave the criticism. They couple this argument with the fact the criticism and discrediting is undetailed and vague, therefore one retorts to the position of praise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This has been answered by Shaikh al-Albānī and the scholars before him wherein he mentions the reasons Rawhū is weak. The main reason being he would narrate rejected narrations and that his narrations were rejected themselves. At times he would be a lone reporter of narration without any support.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAmr bin ʿAbd al-Munʿim explains that Imāms al-Ṭabarānī, Abū Nuʿaym and Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythamī have all declared this to be a lone report of Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and none of the other students and companions of Sufyān narrates this from except Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and these other students of Sufyān were memorisers and trustworthy narrators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Imām Ibn Ḥibbān citing Rawhū in his <em>al-Thiqat</em>, it is not tantamount to trustworthiness as he is known to be lenient ie Mutasāhil. Whatever he mentions under his entry in his <em>al-Thiqāt</em> does not clarify the affair of Rawhū except that it is information as we have shown under his entry, which has preceded. Rather we find this entry alludes to all of his narrations being of the rejected type.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is because Imām Ibn Ḥibbān in his entry states he narrates from the people of Misr and the people of Miṣr narrate from him, however in this report Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ narrates from Sufyān al-Thawrī, who was not from the people of Miṣr, therefore this alludes to it being strange and odd as Abū Nuʿaym has highlighted with his words when he said, <em>“It is Gharīb from the ḥadīth of ʿĀṣim and al-Thawrī and we do not write it except it being the lone report of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Ḥākim is even more lenient than Imām Ibn Ḥibbān, ie more mutasāhil, as al-Suyūṭī has quoted from Ḥāfiẓ al-ʿIrāqī who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Ḥākim is more lenient than him (ie Ibn Ḥibbān</em>)” (<em>al-Tadrīb al-Rāwī</em> (1:108)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAmr bin ʿAbd al-Munʿim goes into detail answering the authentication of Imām al-Ḥākim and answers Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ’s discussion on the validity of al-Ḥākim’s statement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān’s authentication. This is also inaccurate and needs investigation, in fact such a point is rejected. Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr quotes the statement of Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī that he wrote narrations from 1,000 teachers from Ḥāfiẓ al-Mizzī’s <em>Tahdhīb al-Kamāl </em>(23:324).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Dhahabī rejects this assertion and claims and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I say he does not have that many teachers except roughly about 300, so where are the remainder? And the ones which are mentioned a group (of scholars) have weakened them.”</em> (<em>Siyar ʿAlām al-Nabulāʾ</em> (13:181)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Summarised from ʿAmr ʿAbd al-Munʿim Salīm’s, <em>Hadmul Minārah Liman Ṣaḥḥaḥa Āḥadīth al-Tawassul wal-Ziyārah</em> (p.126-134), Ṭanṭā: Dār ul-Dhiyāʿ, 1422H/2001)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Fawzān bin Sābiq bin Fawzān al-Fawzān (d.1373H) also weakened Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and this report. (<em>al-Bayān waʾl Ishār Likashf Zaig al-Mulḥid al-Hāj Mukhtār</em> (p.363), Beirut, Dār al-Gharb al-Islāmī, 1422H/2001)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muqbil also alludes to Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ being weak in his checking of the narrators in <em>Sunan al-Dāraquṭnī</em>. (<em>Tarājim Rijāl al-Dāraquṭnī Fi Sunan</em> (1:225 no.550), Ṣanʿa, Dār al-Athār, 1420H/1999)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair ʿAlī Zaʾī graded the report to weak on account of the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ according to the scholars of Ḥadīth. He also argued, even if he was authentic the second problem is the tadlīs of Sufyān al-Thawrī. Shaikh Zubair said seven scholars of Ḥadīth classed Rawhū to be weak,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Ibn ʿAdiyy, (2) Ibn Yūnus, (3) al-Dāraquṭnī, (4) Ibn Mākūlā, (5) al-Dhahabī, (6) Ibn al-Jawzī, (7) Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah al-Baghdādī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān, al-Ḥākim authenticated him and Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī narrated from him. These three authentications are rejected based on the criticism of the majority of the scholars of ḥadīth. (<em>al-Ḥadīth no.76, Ramaḍḥān 1431H/September 2010, p.9-12).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, rather it is argued there is only actually one scholar who praised him and that is Imām al-Ḥākim with two words of <em>Thiqah al-Māmūn</em> and therefore holding onto just the words of al-Ḥākim, whose authentication is known to be unreliable.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imām Ibn Ḥibbān&#8217;s Authentication of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The detractors rely on the alleged authentication of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān, that he entered Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ in his <em>al-Thiqāt</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Firstly:</strong> We have shown and mentioned from the words of the scholars it is generally well known that Imām Ibn Ḥibbān was lenient in his gradings, and even the detractors have admitted and accepted this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> Imām Ibn Ḥibbān renders this report to be weak on account of saying Rawhū only narrated from the people of Miṣr, where as in this narration he narrates from Sufyān, who was a Kūfan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> Imām Ibn Ḥibbān entering Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ in his <em>al-Thiqat</em> does not necessitate he did not have reprehensive weak and or rejected narrations. This is because Imām Ibn Ḥibbān includes other narrators who have reprehensible and rejected narrations in the same book. For example, he includes Muḥammad bin ʿAbd Allāh bin ʿAmr in his <em>al-Thiqāt</em> and says about him that some of his Āḥadīth are manākīr ie of the reprehensible rejected type. (<em>al-Thiqāt</em> (7:417)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Leniency &#8211; Tasāhul of Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The statement of Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭī quoting Ḥāfiẓ al-ʿIrāqī has preceded where both Imams Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim were declared to be lenient as quoted by Shaikh ʿAmr bin ʿAbd al-Munʿim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Dhahabī is also of the view that Imām al-Ḥākim was lenient. (<em>Zikr Man Yuʿtamad Qawlihi Fiʾl Jarḥ wat Taʿdīl</em> (p.159) Cf. <em>al-Muwaʿqizah</em> (p.83)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Sakhawī also categorises Imām al-Hākim to be lenient. (<em>al-ʿAlān Bil-Tawbih Liman Zam al-Tārīkh</em> (p.168), <em>al-Mutakallimūn Fiʾl Rijāl</em> (p.137)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAbd al-Rahman Yahyā al-Muʿallamī al-Yamānī outlined the methodology of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and his categorisation of trustworthy narrators and those who he includes in his book, amongst them are those who are unknown ie majhul, because they do not fit the other categories. (<em>al-Tankīl Bimā Fī Ṭanīb al-Kawtharī Min al-Abāṭīl</em> (1:437-438 no.199)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The detractors have again themselves admitted and clearly acknowledged in their various writings that both Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim are lenient and mutasāhil. For example, Muḥammad Zāhid al-Kawtharī has admitted this himself in his <em>Maqalāt </em>(p.185) as mentioned by Shaikh al-Albānī in his <em>Silsilah aḤadīth al-Ḍaʿīfahʾ</em> (1:81).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Regarding another ḥadīth and the narrator contained, Shaikh al-Albānī quotes Muḥammad Zāhid al-Kawtharī as saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Yes Imām Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned him in his al-Thiqāt however his method in al-Thiqāt is that he mentions narrators in it when he is unaware of any criticism against them but this does not take them out of the condition in being unknown according to the other scholars and thus Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr has refuted Imām Ibn Ḥibbān&#8217;s inconsistencies in his Lisān al-Mizān.”</em> (<em>Maqalāt</em> (p.309)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>I say: we find the madhab from the words of al-Kawtharī, which is, that he does not rely on the authentication of Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim because both of them are lenient ie mutasāhil. Therefore, how is that he can declare the ḥadith under discussion to be authentic and he does this just on the basis of them authenticating Rawhū ibn Ṣalāh, especially since others who are more knowledgable than them in terms of narrators declare him weak.”</em> (<em>Silsilah Āḥadīth al-Daʿīfahʾ</em> (1:82)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ẓafar Aḥmad Uthmānī has also categorised Imām al-Ḥākim as being lenient in two of his works. (<em>Iʿla al-Sunan</em> (2:107), <em>Qawaʾid ʿUlūm al-Ḥadīth</em> (p.189)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So they apply the rule when it suits their needs and desires while rejecting and overlooking it when it does not serve their intent and purposes in promoting the incorrect type of Tawassul and Wasīlah. Shaikh al-Albānī has yet again highlighted their inconsistencies and discrepancies while they play non the wiser card.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muḥibullāh Shāh al-Rāshidī al-Sindhī has also indicated the leniency of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/imam-ibn-hibban-was-he-strict-or-lenient-in-grading-narrators-shaikh-muhibullah-shah-rashidi-al-sindhi-1415h/"><strong>SEE HERE</strong></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muḥammad Bashīr Sehaswānī also discusses the narration and we conclude with his words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We find that Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is in the chain who is weak. He was declared to be weak by Ibn ʿAdiyy and according to Sakhawī he was of the intermediate level of criticised narrators. There is no reliance on Ibn Ḥibbān mentioning him in his al-Thiqāt because he is well known to authenticate unknown narrators which we have already mentioned from Mizān al-ʿEitidāl. Likewise, al-Ḥākim’s lone authentication is also unworthy to be relied upon as he is from the lenient ones.”</em> (<em>Ṣiyānatul Insān ʿAnn Waswasah al-Shaikh Daḥlān </em>(p.132)</span></p>

<li>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> The Report has a Broken or Disconnected Chain ie inqitʿa.</strong></span></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ hearing this report from Sufyān al-Thawrī is suspect and questionable from two separate indicative factors, both of which allude to Rawhū not hearing or even meeting Sufyān al-Thawrī let alone reporting this narration.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Indicative Factor &#8211; Timeline</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The time difference between Sufyān’s death and Rawhū’s is contentious. Sufyān died according to most reports in 161H and Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ died in 233H (<em>Lisān al-Mizān</em> (2:540), <em>Mizān al-ʿEitidāl </em>(3:87), <em>Tārīkh al-Islām</em> (17:161 no.138)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, there is a difference of approximately 72-73 years between their deaths and if Rawhū heard this report from Sufyān, he would have least been 16-20 years old making his birth date approximately 141-145H, taking Rawhū’s age to the late 80’s and early 90’s. It would also lead to the idea of Rawhū hearing from Sufyān al-Thawri during his later life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This should also be coupled with the fact that Sufyān al-Thawrī was a Mudallis. It is known that Imām, ʿAmīr al-Muʿminin Fil-Ḥadīth, al-Hujjah, al-ʿAbid, Sufyān al-Thawrī was an Imām of Ahl al-Sunnah and a preserver of ḥadīth of the highest level yet still he was a mudallis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Sufyān would to tadlīs from weak narrators.”</em> (<em>Mizān ul-ʿEitidal</em> (2:169), <em>Siyar ʿAlām an-Nabulāʾ </em>(7:242, 7:274).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr also said he was a mudallis. (<em>Ṭabaqāt al-Mudallisīn</em> (p.32 no.51) and <em>Taqrīb ut-Tahdhīb</em> (no.2458 pg.394) in another ed. (p.197), <em>an-Nukt</em> (2/621), <em>Irshād al-Sārī</em> (1:286)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām ʿAbdullāh ibn al-Mubārak also said Sufyān al-Thawrī would do tadlīs. (<em>Tahdhīb ut-Tahdhīb</em> (4/102)</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Indicative Factor – Country</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rawhū could not have heard from Sufyān al-Thawrī because Rawhū only narrated from the people Miṣr and only they narrated from him, whereas Imām Sufyān was from Kūfah! Remember Imām Ibn Ḥibbān said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, from the people of Miṣr, he narrates from Yaḥyā bin Ayūb and his countrymen and Muḥammad bin Ibrāhīm al-Bawshanjī narrates from him, he was from the people of Miṣr.”</em> (<em>al-Thiqāt</em> (8:244)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the other scholars have also alluded to Rawhū only narrating from the people of Miṣr, like Ibn Yūnus, Ibn Mākūlā and al-Dāraquṭnī. These two important factors further indicate the weakness of this report based on the chain and the narrator. Furthermore, Ḥāfiẓ al-Mizzī brings a detailed entry of Sufyān al-Thawrī and lists all the people who narrated from him without mentioning Rawhū as his student or from the people who narrated from Sufyān. (<em>Tahdhīb al-Kamāl Fī Asmāʿ al-Rijāl</em> (11:161-164 no.2407), Beirut, Muassisah al-Risālah, 1408H/1987)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It can be argued with regards to the first point, that the meeting between Rawhū and Sufyān is still possible, however based on general norms it seems highly unlikely, norms like lifespans, travelling to different lands, possible meetings etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If someone says the Imāms have mentioned Rawhū narrates from Sufyān, then we say they have mentioned this based on the chains of narration or transmission of reports where Rawhū reports on Sufyān’s authority, it does not however make this a reality or fact.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>BENEFIT &#8211; Revisiting Imām Ibn Ḥibbān’s Authentication</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is highly pertinent to mention according to Imām Ibn Ḥibbān’s own statement in his <em>al-Thiqāt,</em> he himself renders this report to be weak due to Rawhū narrating from Sufyān, who was from Kūfa, so how can they present his authentication.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Matters of belief are not accepted if they are lone reports according to the principles of the detractors. The Ḥanafī madhab, the Ashʿarī’s and Maturidī’s.</strong></span></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no other option but to accept that this report is a single lone narration of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ based on the clarifications and elucidations of the scholars of Ḥadīth from the likes of Imām al-Ṭabarānī, Ḥāfiẓ Abū Nuʿaym and Ḥāfiẓ Nūr al-Dīn al-Haythamī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The principle of the detractors whether Ḥanafī, Ashʿarī or Matūridī is that lone reports ie Khabar al-Ahād are not aceepted in matters of creed and Imān because for them matters of belief must be based on certainty and therefore issues that are in relation to belief and disbelief cannot be established by Aḥād or single lone reports. One can refer to <em>Usūl Sarkhasī</em> (p.116), <em>Fawātih al-Rahmūt</em> (2:136) and other general book on Ḥanafi ʿUsūl.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The antagonists present this report as an evidence for Tawassul and since it is related to matters of belief and Imān, it is imperative that it must be mutawatir and not Khabr al-Aḥād in order for them to accept it.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Other Chains for this report</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad ʿAlawī al-Malikī and others have mentioned other reports which differ in the wording, whilst some of them do not even mention the the words the detractors attempt to prove their belief system from. All of these other narrations are either weak, with weak and unknown narrators or the chains are unconnected and are mursal. G.F. Haddād has also admitted some of these reports do not contain the contentious words.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ignorant people of other faiths, in their emotionally filled rants and outbursts against Islām allege the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) slept with the body of Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha based on the wording of this ḥadīth. Such horrible claims are often regurgitated by people who follow and believe in Christianity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an outright lie and a desperate attempt to discredit Islām, such claims are often raised by people who have not read anything about Islām and rather just take some information from websites, who extend most of their efforts to concoct fallacious allegations against Islām.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treacherous claim rests on the words  فاضطجع  They claim the word means to sleep, lay down ie he lay down with Fātimah bint Asad to have sex with her and this Arabic word is often used to denote to lie down and sleep with someone. We seek refuge in Allāh from such lies and aspersions. Āmīn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Firstly:</strong>  we have shown this ḥadīth is weak in the preceding discourse, but let’s assume for arguments sake that it was authentic, then;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> The word اضطجع means to lie, lie down, recline, repose and sleep according to the well known Arabic dictionaries. It does not mean to sleep or to lay down for sex. This is also the word the Christians use in their Arabic translation of the Bible. Hence, they say وَدَخَلَ أَلِيشَعُ الْبَيْتَ وَإِذَا بِالصَّبِيِّ مَيْتٌ وَمُضْطَجعٌ عَلَى سَرِيرِهِ. [<em>And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed</em>. (2Kings 4:32) Kings James Version).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So one asks, does the word laid here also mean, ‘lay to have sex?’ Of course it does not! Then why is this meaning specified and restricted to the ḥadīth only.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> the wording of the ḥadīth clearly mentions the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) entered the grave after it was dug and the body of Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha had not been lowered into the grave. The Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) lay in the grave after it was dug by his companions. The grave had a Laḥd, which is a horizontal opening in the vertically dug grave. The Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) also dug the grave and the Laḥd after which he lay in it. Thereafter, he stood up and eventually the body was lowered into the grave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should therefore be noted; the body was lowered into the grave after he stood up &#8211; the body was not even in the grave when he was lying down in it! What kind of necrophilia was this? We presume the claimants can further shed some light on this matter, for the claimants are likely to know the reality and details of necrophilia the best, perhaps from experience in the modern Christian atheistic world, because surely one only accuses others of things they have experience, practice and knowledge about.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask again? How is the alleged incident even possible when the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) did not even lie next to the body, unless the detractors have developed other forms of sex!!! Again, this would not be surprising because this is what happens when you abandon your scriptures by distorting the divine message they contained.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The wording of the report further shows the great care and love the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) had for Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha, the alleged wording says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>When camphor water was brought, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) poured some water into his hands. Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) took off his shirt and clothed her with it and used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This showed the love and care the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) had for her due to her status. The detractors show more affection and care for animals and dogs and regularly bathe them, how about Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha, who was his paternal aunt and looked after him just like his mother! At what expense is the human mind and intelligence being carelessly wasted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fourthly:</strong> another indication which shows the futility of this repulsive allegation is the fact that the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) used his shirt and wrapped it around her and then used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin, the words are,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>“Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) took off his shirt and clothed her with it and used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again, a sane, upright and normal human being asks, why would a person use their own shirt to wrap the corpse of his paternal aunt &#8211; a mother like figure, then use his own sheets as her coffin, then dig her grave with his own hands, then lie in her grave and supplicate to the creator to forgive and have mercy on her (allegedly as the ḥadīth is weak), then to have her lowered in the grave, then unfasten the coffin sheets and shirt and then indulge in necrophilia? Absolutely preposterous!   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like to exercise our common sense by using our brains and minds, given to us by our creator and ask, what were the other companions doing during this incident of necrophilia? Why do this in the grave and not on the ground if they were looking?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people have no idea about the stature, uprightness and credibility of the illustrious companions, that they would allow someone to do such a heinous act in front of them. The companions were powerful, they were Ūsāmah bin Zayd, Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī, ʿUmar bin al-Khaṭṭāb and the Abyssinian companion, May Allāh be pleased with all of them. Who does not know the lofty credentials of ʿUmar bin al-Khaṭṭāb, that even satan was forced to change paths when he would see him due to his, principles, morals, standards, character and firm belief. That the likes of these companions just stood there and watched this evil incident to unfold.       </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fifthly:</strong> the detractors should know in Islām purification and cleanliness play a pivotal role in the daily life of Muslims. For example, Muslims are instructed to hold their private parts with their left hand because they have been instructed to eat with their right. They are instructed to sit down while relieving themselves, they are instructed to protect themselves and their clothes from urine and faeces, they are instructed to clean themselves with water, they are instructed to wash their hands everytime they relieve themselves, they are instructed to conceal their private parts from others and much more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muslims were given these instructions by the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam), whose words in the Religion are taken as divine texts, ie from the Prophetic Ḥadīth. This said, the rules, regulations and etiquettes for sexual intercourse between legally married partners in Islām require a greater level of purification and cleanliness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being, on another occasion the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) asked his companions to help lower a body into a grave, and he asked them if any of them were in a state of sexual impurity, ie if they had spent the night with their lawful wives. One of the companion who was in a state of sexual impurity was asked not to help in lowering the body (Bukhārī).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This honours the deceased, ie the people who help lower the deceaseds body are in a state of ritual purity and clean. So when a person is in a state of sexual impurity and he is not allowed to partake in lowering the deceased, then how about the act of sexual intercourse with a corpse! Let alone the rules and regulations Muslims have when it comes to intimacy and intercourse.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We mentioned examples of how Muslims uphold purification and cleanliness while relieving themselves and at the same token the clever people who regurgitate these treacherous lies about the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallm), are the same people who do not even wash their hands when they go to the toilet, they have cascades of urine droplets on their clothes and toilet seats. They are the same people who would not bathe for weeks, just less than 100 years and when they would bathe, the whole family would use the water, whereas our glorious Prophetic Divine teachings go back 1400 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is absolutely absurd and a despicable aspersion to even suggest this notion of necrophilia, which is an outright treacherous lie.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have shown this ḥadīth is weak and to use it to prove and argue impermissible tawassul is incorrect, contrary to the authentic evidences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By the two weak slaves of Allāh,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ḥibbān Malak</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Khuzaimah Imran Masoom Anṣārī</span></p>
