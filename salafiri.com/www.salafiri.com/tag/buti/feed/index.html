				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;">There are a number of posts which are circulating on social media, all in all of which attempt to criticise, defame and undermine the continuous efforts and struggles of,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani (1420H)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some of these people, and I say this politely, have demonstrated dire comprehension of intricate issues while others have manifested their innate hatred and animosity for this Allamah Rabbani, based on nothing but tassub, tahazzub and their ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The life and efforts of Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani are well known and comprehensively documented, and no one can deny this even if they tried. In reality we do not need to mention his virtues, his efforts and works. The words &#8220;authenticated or graded xyz by al-Albani&#8221; in almost every other Islamic book by friends and foes alike, is unprecedented virtue by any account.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, sometimes a general reminder to ourselves and to our mutual friends, puts things into perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Oh insignificant one&#8217;s, Let us remind you of who al-Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Imam Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani is.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He was the man who was born in a european country, which was and still is virtually unknown, he was responsible for putting that country on the map for Muslims, academics as well orientalists. Who knew Albania except through our Allamah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He was forced to move from his country at a young age due to communism. He moved to Syria with his family who were strict practising Hanafis. They made fun of him in the classroom while he excelled beyond degree in his Arabic language, syntax and morphology compared to his fellow classmates. They would say what does this Ajami know.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He was ostracised, shunned and thrown out of his family home by his strict hanafi family due to his firmness in sticking to the Quran and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Poor and destitute, worked as an honest watchmaker, who would look for scraps of pieces of paper to write prophetic Hadith on, to the extent he would write complete volumes of books in this way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would travel the city to the library and the locals would make fun of him due to him riding a bike, they ridiculed him nationally in their newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He was imprisoned in syria by the mulhid bathists Alawite shias, numerous times for teaching the Quran and Sunnah as well propagating Salafi Dawah. He was put in prison repeatedly and tested with their evil plots time and time again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He was forced to move to Jordan, than UAE, then Syria again and then to Jordan, due to the hatred of the innovator heretics.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He single handedly rebuked and took charge of chief innovators and clear deviants a like. These deviants were the heads of misguidance who misguided thousands to innovations and corrupt beliefs and heresies, from the likes of</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The heretical Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, the chief innovator who reviled everyone from the Sahabah to the Great Salaf us-Salihin</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">His student, Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah the Asharite Hanafi apologist and proponent of the Deobandis</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Syrian Sufi Asharite, Muhammad Said Ramadhan Buti.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Then he dealt with, not 1, not 2 but three of the Ghumari brothers of Morocco, Ahmad, Abdullah and Abd al-Aziz.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He took charge and held at Bay the evil heresies and ideas of Abdullah al-Harari ie the founder of the al-Ahbash and his cult beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He answered and dealt with the rafidi arch liar, Hassan Saqqaf.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Also the Deobandi and dubious Habib ur Rehman al-Azmi, who did not have the guts use his real name, he was also answered and subdued.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And the list, by the permission and assistance of Allah alone, is continuous.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The man who checked over 30,000 ahadith and wrote over 200 books, some of which run into volumes!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The man who single handedly organised the whole of Maktabah Zahiriyyah library, which was one of the most important libraries of the Islamic world.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The man who produced some of the most prolific students and formidable scholars this century has seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And then&#8230;&#8230;you have the audacity to attack this man with your childish and immature remarks!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We do not go beyond bounds in praise of our Ulama and neither do we make open blind taqlid of them,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However after praising Allah, we thank him for sending us this mujaddid. May Allah have mercy on him, forgive him and accept his efforts and servitude. Amin</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Oh ignorant ones, whoever you are, know your maqam and manzilah when you talk about</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani</span></p>
