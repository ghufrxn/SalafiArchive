				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muqallidin argue, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong><em>&#8220;These people read a few books here and there and they think they have become Mujtahids of the era.&#8221;</em></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Jalil Samrudi (d.1393H) <em>Rahimahullah,</em> answers and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an old sickness of the muqallidin which they employ due to their desires, in order to declare the scholars of Ahl Al-Hadith ignorant and also a trick to deceive the ignorant people. They do not sense an accomplishment unless they say these words. It is stated in  &#8216;<em>Din al-Khalis&#8217;</em> (2:138) (Of Shaykh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;These people are extremely harsh with someone who issues a verdict according to the Quran and Sunnah, they declare him to be an ignorant person while ignoring his verdict due it to being contrary to the verdicts of their leaders whom they consider to be upon the truth.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;<small class="english">And those who have wronged are going to know to what [kind of] return they will be returned.&#8221; (al-Shu&#8217;ra:227)</small></span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is just idle speech and had they proven the Ahl al-Hadith were ignorant from the statements of scholars it would have been considered and looked into, is it not be the case and the opposite that the scholars have declared the muqallidin ignoramuses. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Qayyim said in <em>al-A&#8217;lam al-Muwaqi&#8217;een</em> (1:7)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Abu Amr (Ie ibn Ibn Abdul Barr) and other scholars said the people are agreed and have a consensus (Irma) that the muqallid is not considered to be from the people of knowledge.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Bakhtari said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;It is known the scholars are blessed with knowledge and the Ignorant people of taqlid said to the people of knowledge they were enemies.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Juwayni well known as Imam al-Haramayn said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The ruling on the muqallid is that he is a lay person (i.e. jahil)&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, no scholar has expressed taqlid to be knowledge and therefore one cannot ascertain points and views just by uttering them. Knowledge is what Allah and his Messenger ﷺ said and what the companions said and not anything contrary to this. Mulla Ai Qari said in<em> Sharh Fiqh al-Akbar,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Anything which does not have Akhbarana or Hadathana (i.e. he informed us or narrated a hadith to) are satanic whisperings.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And whoever wants to benefit further from such issues then let him refer to my treaties, <em>&#8216;al-Ba&#8217;ith al-hathith fi fadhal ilm al-hadith wa ahlila al-dahith&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;Irsal al-barid liqat&#8217;e lifa ahl al-taqlid wal-tardid liman as ahl  al-hadith ill awl al-jadid&#8217; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Taken from Hasan al-ta&#8217;dil bard man snafu al-jarh al-jamil p.409-410 from Majmu&#8217;a rasa&#8217;l vol.3)</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Calling Ahlul Hadith La Madhab, Rejecting The Statements of Scholars that contradict the Quran and Sunnah</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Compiled and Translated</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></h3>
<h3>For a while now the hanafis have been rebuking the Ahlul Hadith merely because they reject people’s statements and the opinion of men, that they give precedence to the authentic reports and narrations from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and they obey and follow him In everything.</h3>
<h3>I swear by him in whose hand my soul is in, they (The Ahlul Hadith) have no fault except that they have rejected the statements of the mujtahids over the texts of the shariah. The muqallidin found this very unfavourable and hence embarked on a relentless campaign of hurling abuse. It is such that they started calling them despicable names such as La-Madhab (those without a madhab), Ghair Muqallid, Wahabi and those who abandon the Imams.</h3>
<h3>This behaviour and temperament is manifest from them and most of the people know this and have witnessed it from them. Furthermore, they claim that this way (the way of Ahlul Hadith) is a new way and does not conform to the others. Therefore in this regard I authored this treatise and I have only quoted hanafi books in order to silence those who abuse, calls us names and to establish the proofs on them.</h3>
<h3>……</h3>
<h3>For instance Asaam Ibn Yusuf would raise his bands whilst going into ruku and whilst rising from it and likewise and similarly other scholars would do certain actions (not legislated in the Hanafi madhab) but yet they were still considered to be from the Hanafi school of thought and they would not be expelled from it. We find that they were not bigoted or staunch but rather just and fair. However the hanafis of this day and age lack any justice and fairness not like the hanafis of the past. This is the reason why they are very forthcoming with their name calling and the abuse they hurl with their tongues.</h3>
<h3>…..</h3>
<h3>And what profound words are of those Shaikh Shah Waliullah Muhadith Dehlawi who said in his Wasayah that all issues of Fiqh should always be relegated to the Quran and Sunnah, “so issues of fiqh should be referred back to the Quran and the Sunnah and only those that conform and concur should be accepted. The Ummah has no choice in this (if their opinions or statements differ with the Quran and Sunnah). Similarly it is impermissible to listen to the Mujtahid who is stringent in the taqlid of his imam, his opinion and position which contradicts the Quran and Sunnah. With the aim of getting closer to Allah, it can only be achieved by staying away from such people.”</h3>
<h3>Zahra Riyadh al-Abrar Ma Yugna an-Nas An Hamal al-Asfar Ena al-I’tilaf limaja Rawayat Muhaqiqi al-Ahnaf Wa Raf’a al-Ikhtilaf (Pg.25-31) First Edn. 1964ce</h3>
