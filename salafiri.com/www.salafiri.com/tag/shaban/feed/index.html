				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Fazilatush Shaikh Abdullah Nasir Rehmani</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Amir Jamiyyah Ahlul Hadith Sindh</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>[1] When Fasting Is Obligated</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The obligation of fasting the month of Ramadhan commences when the month begins. The commencing or beginning of the month is determined in three ways,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The First Way</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Through observing the moon. Allah says <strong>“…So whoever of you sights (the crescent) the month (of Ramadhan) he must observe the fasts…” (Surah al-Baqarah:185)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <strong>“Fasting by observing (the moon crescent).”</strong> (<em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> (1909), <em>Sahih Muslim</em> (1081/19).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Therefore, fasting becomes obligatory upon the who observes the moon.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The Second Way</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">An individual does not see the moon himself but reports of observation are conveyed to him. If the one who saw or the one relaying the news is trustworthy, honest and obligated of the commands of Allah, their reports will be accepted. This is supported by the narration of Abdullah bin Amr RadhiAllahu Anhu who said<strong>, “Once people were in doubt regarding the observation of the moon and so I informed Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam that I had seen the moon. He Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam then fasted himself and ordered others to also fast.”</strong> (<em>Abu Dawud </em>(2342), <em>Ibn Hibban</em> (3447), <em>Hakim</em> (1541), <em>ad-Daraqutni</em> (2127)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The Third Way</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">By completing 30 days of the month of Sha’ban If on the 29<sup>th</sup> the moon is not observed. Whether this is due to clouds, poor visibility or other environmental factors. The evidence for this is the statement of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, <strong>“A month can be 29 days so do not (begin [the month]) fast until you see (the moon) and break the fast (ie end the month) until you see (the moon) and if its overcast then complete the month (ie. 30 days).</strong>” (<em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> (1907), <em>Sahih Muslim</em> (2499) and its Muslims wording)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">We have specified the meaning of the words <strong>“then complete the month”</strong> to mean 30 days by using the hadith of Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu which mentions, <strong>“If it is overcast, complete 30 days (of Sha’ban)”</strong> (<em>Sahih al-Bukhari </em>(1909), <em>Sahih Muslim</em> (2516) and its Muslims wording).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Remember, it is impermissible to fast on the day one has doubts about it. Ammar bin Yasir RadhiAllahu Anhu said, <strong>“Whoever fasted on the day they doubted have disobeyed Abul Qasim Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.”</strong> (<em>Imam al-Bukhari</em> transmitted this in Kitab as-Sawm, Chapter: Fast when you see the crescent, in ta’liq form)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Similarly, fasting a day or two before Ramadhan is also impermissible. Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <strong>“</strong><strong>None of you should fast a day or two before the month of Ramadhan unless he has the habit of fasting </strong>(eg Modays or Thursday)<strong> then he may fast that day.&#8221;</strong> (<em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> (1914), <em>Sahih Muslim</em> (1082),<em> Musnad Ahmad</em> (7722).</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><em><strong>Muhadith Zubair Ali Zai</strong></em></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Translated Abu Ubaydah</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: justify"></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">15th Night Of Sha&#8217;ban And Special Acts Of Worship</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">There are some ahadith that are mentioned which talk about the virtue of the 15th night of Sha’ban. The meaning of those ahadith are that, Allah descends to the lowest heaven and forgives the sins of people in such a great amount that it is more in number than the hair&#8217;s of the goats from the Kalb tribe. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Due to these ahadith many people carry out extra amounts of worship during this night. An overview of these narrations are as follows: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>&#8220;On the 15th night of Sha’ban Allah specifically looks at the creation and forgives the sins of all the Muslim creation, except for the Mushriks and those Muslims who keep grudges of their Muslim brethren.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">(As-Silsilah as-Sahiha 3/135 Hadith no.1144) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">An overview of the Takhrij for the narrations which Shaikh mentioned are below:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>1. Hadith of Mu&#8217;adh Ibn Jabal (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imam Makhul narrated it through the chain of:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>from Malik ibn Yukhamir from Mu’adh Ibn Jabal (Radi Allahu Anhu)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES] </span></span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">This hadith is present with the same above chain of narration in the following books:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Kitab as-Sunnah of Ibn Abi Asim (hadith no.512, other manuscript no.524), Sahih Ibn Hibban (Mawarid adh-Dhaman no.1980, al-Ihsan no.5636), Amali of Abil Hasan al-Qazuni (4/2), al-Majlis as-Sabi’ of Abi Muhamad al-Jawhari (3/2), Juz min hadith Muhamad Ibn Sulaiman ar-Rabi’i (217/1 and 218/1), al-Amali of Abil Qasim al-Husaini (Qaf 12/1), Shu’bul Iman of al-Bayhaqi (3/382 hadith no.3833,5 / hadith no.6628), Tarikh Dimishq of Ibn Asakir (40/172, 57/75), ath-Thalith Watis’in of al-Hafidh Abdil Ghani al-Maqdisi (Qaf 44/2), Sifat Rabul ‘Alamin of Ibn A’jab, 7/2, 129/2), al-Mu’jam al-Kabir of at-Tabarani (20/108,109 hadit no.215), and al-Awsat of at-Tabarani (7/397 hadith no.6772), Hilyatul Awliya of Abi Nu’aim al-Isbahani (5/191)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Dhahabi said, “Makhul did not meet Malik Ibn Yukhamir” (as-Sahihah 135/3) meaning this narration is <em>[Munqati’]</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Outcome: This chain is <em>[Da’if]</em> weak. It is mentioned in the book of Usul ul-Hadith &#8216;Taysir Mustalah al-Hadith&#8217; that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>“The Scholars (Muhadithin) are in unanimous agreement that the [Munqati’] (narration) is weak. This is because the omitted narrator is classed as being unknown (for us).”</em> (pg no.78)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>2. Hadith of Abi Tha’labah (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> Ahwas Ibn Hakim narrated it through the chain of:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>from Muhasir Ibn Habib from Abi Tha’labah (Radi Allahu Anhu)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Kitab as-Sunnah of Ibn Abi Asim (hadith no.511, other manuscript hadith no.523), Kitab ul-Arsh of Muhamad Ibn Uthman Ibn Abi Shaybah (hadith no.87 and in it: Bishr ibn Omarah from al-Ahwas Ibn Hakim from al-Mahasir ibn Habib from Makhul from Abi Tha’labah to the end of the hadith), Hadith Abil Qasim al-Azji (67/1), Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah book of al-Lalika’i (3/445 hadith no.760), al-Mu’jam al-Kabir of at-Tabarani (22/224 hadith no.593)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The main narrator Ahwas Ibn Hakim is <em>[Da’if]</em> weak according to the majority of the Muhadithin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Hajr said, <em>“Weak memory [Da’if ul-Hifdh]”</em> (Taqrib no.290)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It is not established that Muhasir (Muhajir) Ibn Habib met Abu Tha’labah (Radi Allahu Anhu).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Note:</strong> In Kitab ul-Arsh the chain contains Makhul in between Muhasir and Abu Tha’labah. In this chain there is Bishr Ibn Omarah who is <em>[Da’if]</em> weak. (Taqrib no.897)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In al-Mu’jam al-Kabir of at-Tabarani (22/223 hadith no.590) al-Maharabi does <em>[Mutabi’]</em> of him. However two narrators from this chain, Ahmad Ibn an-Nadr al-Askari and Muhamad Ibn Adam al-Masisi are unknown. Abdurahman Ibn Muhamad al-Maharabi is a Mudalis. (Tabaqat al-Mudalisin 80/3)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Bayhaqi narrated it through a different chain of narration:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>al-Maharabi from al-Ahwas Ibn Hakim from al-Muhajir Ibn Habib from Makhul from Abi Tha’labah al-Khushani</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> (Shu’bul Iman no.3832)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>3. Hadith of Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-‘As (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> Hasan Ibn Musa narrated it through the chain of:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>Ibn Lahi’a narrated to us, Huyay Ibn Abdullah narrated to us, from Abi Abdirahman al-Habali from Abdullah Ibn Amr</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> (Musnad Ahmad 2/176 hadith no.6642)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This hadith is <em>[Da’if]</em> weak due to the <em>[Ikhtilat]</em> of Abdullah Ibn Lahi’a. To see the <em>[Ikhtilat]</em> of Ibn Lahi’a see Taqrib at-Tahdhib. (no.3563)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">There is no evidence to establish that Hasan Ibn Musa heard this hadith from Ibn Lahi’a before he committed <em>[Ikhtilat]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Mundhiri said,</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"><em>&#8220;Ahmad narrated it from a [Layin] weak chain.&#8221;</em> (at-Targhib wa at-Tarhib 3/460 hadith no.4080, also see 2/119 hadith no.1519)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Albani said,</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"><em>&#8220;Rashdayn Ibn Sa’d did mutaba’at of Ibn Lahi’a.&#8221;</em> (Hadith Ibn Haywiyah 3/10/1 and Silsilah as-Sahihah 3/136)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> Also Rashdayn Ibn Sa’d Ibn Muflih al-Mihri himself is <em>[Da’if]</em> weak. See Taqrib at-Tahdhib (no.1942)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Therefore this narration is <em>[Da’if]</em> weak from two angles, it is not Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>4. Abu Musa (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> Ibn Lahi’a narrated it through the chain of:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>From az-Zubair Ibn Salim from adh-Dhahak Ibn Abdurahman from his father he said, I heard Abu Musa – till the end of the hadith.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Ibn Majah (1390/2), as-Sunnah of Ibn Abi Asim (no.510, other manuscript no.522), as-Sunnah of al-Lalika’i (3/447 hadith no.763)In this chain there is Abdurahman Ibn Arzab who is [Majhul] unknown. (Taqrib no.3950). Similarly Zubair Ibn Salim is also [Majhul] unknown. (Taqrib no.1996)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> In some books it has mistakenly been published with the name Rabi’ Ibn Sulaiman and in others it is Zubair Ibn Sulaiman.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Outcome:</strong> This chain is <em>[Da’if]</em> weak</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> <strong>Note:</strong> In the other chain of Ibn Majah (1390/1) instead of Ibn Lahi’a there is Walid Ibn Muslim, who is a Mudalis and Dhahak Ibn Ayman, who is <em>[Majhul]</em> unknown. (Taqrib no.2965). This chain is also <em>[Munqati’]</em>, therefore this chain is also <em>[Da’if]</em> weak.</span></p>

It is not correct to raise the saying of Makhul to the level of a <em>[Marfu’]</em> hadith and even if that is done then it is <em>[Da’if]</em> weak because it becomes <em>[Mursal]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>A Summary Of The Tahqiq</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> The narration about the 15th night of Sha’ban is not established from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) or any of the noble companions (Radi Allahu Anhum)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>The Decision Of The Muhaqiq</strong></span><br />

<span style="color: #000000"><em>&#8220;There are no reliable or credible hadith about the virtues of the 15th night of Sha’ban at all. There are also no reliable or credible hadith about the decision on people’s deaths (i.e. the time of an individual’s death) being abrogated on this night. Therefore do not pay any attention at all to these unreliable ahadith.&#8221;</em> (Ahkam ul-Qur’an 4/1690)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn ul-Qayim wrote that,</span><br />

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn ul-Qayim also goes on to say that,</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"><em>&#8220;It is enormously strange that a person who has the understanding of the Sunnah performs an absolutely bizarre type of salah after listening to these fictions. (i.e. performing 100 rak’at by reciting surah ikhlas 1000 times).&#8221;</em> (al-Munar al-Munif pg no.99)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Hasan Li-Ghayrihi!?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> The great muhadith Shaikh Albani declared the narration about the 15th of Sha’ban as being <em>[Sahih]</em> due to it having many routes of transmission. However this narration does not reach the level of <em>[Sahih Li-ghayrihi]</em>. Not one chain is <em>[Sahih]</em> or <em>[Hasan Li-Thatihi]</em> so how has it reached to the level of <em>[Sahih Li-Ghayrihi]</em>? Some people have said that this narration is <em>[Hasan Li-Ghayrihi]</em>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">There are two types of <em>[Hasan Li-Ghayrihi]</em>:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> 1. A narration with a <em>[Da’if]</em> weak chain which is in and of itself <em>[Da’if]</em> weak, whilst another narration is <em>[Hasan Li-Thatihi]</em>. This (<em>[Da’if]</em> weak) chain becomes <em>[Hasan]</em> when it is placed with the <em>[Hasan Li-Thatihi]</em> (narration).</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> 2. A narration with a <em>[Da’if]</em> weak chain which is in and of itself <em>[Da’if]</em> weak and there are other <em>[Da’if]</em> weak and rejected narrations present with the same meaning. Some scholars understand these to be <em>[Hasan Li-Ghayrihi]</em> whilst this is a type of <em>[Da’if]</em> weak hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Evidence No.1</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> It is absolutely not established from the Qur’an, hadith and Ijma’ that <em>[Da’if]</em> weak + <em>[Da’if]</em> weak + <em>[Da’if]</em> weak = <em>[Hasan Li-Ghayrihi]</em> is established as being a proof.</span></p>

<span style="color: #000000"> Apart from Imam Tirmidhi, <em>[Hasan Li-Ghayrihi]</em> narrations like this are not established as being proof by the general Muhadithin. For e.g.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> Muhamad Ibn Abi Layla (<em>[Da’if]</em>) narrated a hadith with the chain of:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>From his brother Isa from al-Hakam from Abdurahman Ibn Abi Layla from al-Bara Ibn Azib</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">which negates Rafyul Yadayn (Sunan Abi Dawud no.752). It’s chain is <em>[Da’if]</em> weak.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> There are numerous <em>[Da’if]</em> witnessing reports of this. For e.g. See Sunan Abi Dawud (no.749, no.748). Despite all these witnessing reports Imam Abu Dawud said, <em>&#8220;This hadith is not [Sahih].&#8221;</em> (Abu Dawud no.752)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">There are several narrations about performing the salah in one direction during a general salah. See as-Sahihah of Shaikh al-Albani (1/564-566 hadith no.316). Not one of these are <em>[Sahih]</em> or <em>[Hasan Li-Thatihi]</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Abdul Bar says about these narrations that, <em>&#8220;However all these narrations are [Ma’lul] weak. The scholars of hadith do not declare them to be [Sahih].&#8221;</em> (Zadul Ma’ad vol no.1 pg no.259)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn ul-Qayim also says that, <em>&#8220;However it is not established from a [Sahih] chain from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam).&#8221;</em> (Zadul Ma’ad vol no.1 pg no.259)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Evidence No. 6</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> Ibn Kathir wrote that, <em>&#8220;It is enough (to succeed) in a debate that one establishes the opposition’s chain to be [Da’if]. This will make him unable to answer because the foundation is that all the other narrations are [Ma’dum] void (and false) except and until another (authentic) chain is established. And Allah knows best.&#8221;</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> (Ikhtisar Ulum ul-Hadith pg no.85, subject no.22, other manuscript 1/274, 275, and as-Sakhawi narrated it from him in Fathul Mugith 1/287 in knowing to accept his narration and of those who respond)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Evidence No.7</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> Ibn ul-Qatan al-Fasi clarified about<em> [Hasan Li-Ghayrihi]</em> that, <em>&#8220;This does not constitute to being an evidence rather this is acted upon in the [Fadha’il A’mal] virtuous actions.&#8221;</em> (an-Nukt ala Kitab ibn us-Salah 1/402)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Evidence No.8</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> Ibn Hajr has declared the saying of Ibn ul-Qatan as being <em>[Hasan Quwi]</em>. (an-Nukt 1/402)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Evidence No.9</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> When the Hanafis and Shafi’is and other than them refute each other they do not use <em>[Hasan Li-ghayrihi]</em> type of narrations as a proof. For e.g. a (weak) narration which has the same meaning of another narration that has several <em>[Da’if]</em> weak chains has been declared as being <em>[Da’if]</em> weak by Imam Nawawi. (Khilasatul Ahkam vol no.1 pg no.377 hadith no.1173, chapter of weak)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The narration about the Fatiha Khalf ul-Imam which has many chains of narration has been declared as being <em>[Ma’lul]</em> etc. by Naymawi Hanafi. See Athar as-Sunan (hadith no.353, 354, 355, 356)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Evidence No.10</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> In the modern day era there are a lot of scholars who perform <em>[Jarh]</em> criticise and declare narrations which have numerous chains, and do not have an excessive weakness, as being <em>[Da’if]</em> weak and rejected. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">For e.g the narration of:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> <em>Muhamad Ibn Ishaq from Makhul from Mahmud Ibn ar-Rabi’ from Ubadah Ibn Samit</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">which contains evidence about the Fatiha Khalf ul-Imam, has been said to be <em>[Da’if]</em> weak by the Muhadith al-Albani. (Tahqiq Sunan Abi Dawud no.823, published by Maktabutul Ma’arif, ar-Riyadh)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">However there are many witnessing reports for this narration. See Kitab ul-Qira’at of al-Bayhaqi and al-Kawakib ad-Duriyah fi Wujub al-Fatiha Khalf ul-Imam fil Jahriyah of the author. Shaikh al-Albani does not recognise it to be <em>[Hasan Li-Ghayrihi]</em> even though it has numerous chains and witnessing reports. (Whilst the narration of Fatiha Khalf ul-Imam is <em>[Hasan Lithatihi</em>] and <em>[Sahih Li-Ghayrihi]</em> wal-hamdullilah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In summary the narration about the 15th of Sha’ban is <em>[Da’if]</em> weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Acting On <em>[Da’if]</em> Weak Hadith In Matters Pertaining To [Fadha&#8217;il] Virtues </strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> Some people recognise the <em>[Da’if]</em> weak narrations, which mention <em>[Fadha&#8217;il]</em> virtues, as proof (when it coincides with their desires) and they call towards acting upon them. However there is a group of Muhaqiqin who say that an invidual cannot act upon <em>[Da’if]</em> weak hadith <em>[Mutlaqan]</em>. Meaning according to them one cannot act upon <em>[Da’if]</em> weak hadith which are to do with Ahkam and <em>[Fadha&#8217;il]</em> virtues. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Jamaludin Qasimi (Shami) mentioned about this methodology on <em>[Da’if]</em> weak hadith that, <em>&#8220;Whether it is Ahkam or [Fadha&#8217;il] virtues, one should not act upon them. Ibn Sayid un-Nas mentioned it from Ibn Ma’in in Uyun al-Athar. Sakhawi attributed it to Abu Bakr Ibn ul-Arabi in Fath ul-Mugith. And it is apparent that this is the methodology of Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim, the conditions of Sahih Bukhari bear witness to it. Imam Muslim has severely criticised the narrators of [Da’if] weak hadith, as I mentioned previously. Both the Imams did not narrate a single [Da’if] weak narration to do with [Fadha&#8217;il] virtues in their respective books.&#8221;</em> (Qawaid ut-Tahdith pg no.113, al-Hadith Hazro no.4 pg no.7) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Abdullah Ibn Abbas (Radi Allahu Anhuma) was not of the view to listen to <em>[Mursal]</em> narrations. (See Muqadimah Sahih Muslim hadith no.21, and Nukt ala Kitab ibn us-Salah 2/553)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It is known from this that Ibn Abbas (Radi Allahu Anhuma) did not recognise <em>[Da’if]</em> weak hadith about [Fadha&#8217;il] virtues as being a proof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Hibban said,<em> &#8220;Therefore whatever hadith the [Da’if] weak individual narrates, and the narration which does not exist, both have the same ruling.&#8221;</em> (Kitab al-Majruhin 1/328 biography of Sa’id Ibn Ziyad Ibn Qa’id)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Marwan (Ibn Muhamad at-Tatari) said that, <em>&#8220;I said to Imam Layth Ibn Sa’d al-Misri:</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>Why do you sleep after Asr whilst Ibn Lahi’a narrated a hadith through the chain of</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>From Aqil from Makhul from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) that</em></span><br />

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>Layth Ibn Sa’d responded:</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"><em> I cannot leave that thing which gives me benefit because of a hadith by Ibn Lahi’a from Aqil.</em> (al-Kamil of Ibn Adi 4/1463 and it’s chain is <em>[Sahih]</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It is known from this that Imam Layth Ibn Sa’d also did not act upon <em>[Da’if]</em> weak hadith which were to do with [Fadha’il] virtues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Note:</strong> Ibn Lahi’a is <em>[Da’if] </em>weak and did <em>[Ikhtilat]</em> later, and is a <em>[Mudalis]</em>. And this chain is <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">[Mursal]</span></em> therefore it is <em>[Da’if]</em> weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani said that, <em>&#8220;There is no difference on acting upon [Da’if] weak hadith which are Ahkam or Fadha’il because these are all actions to do with the Shar’iah.&#8221;</em> (Tabayin ul-Ajab bima ward fi fadha’il rajab pg no.73)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Lastly, I would like to mention that there is not even a <em>[Da’if]</em> weak narration about performing a special salah that has 100 rak’at with reciting surah ikhlas 1000 times specifically on the 15th of Sha’ban. These type of narrations are all <em>[Mawdu’]</em> fabricated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Note:</strong> Allah the Most High descends to the lowest heaven in the last part of every night just as it is established from mutawatir ahadith in the Sahihayn (Bukhari no.1145 and no.7494, and Muslim no.758) etc. We believe in this and entrust how it happens to Allah, He knows best.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Middle of Sha’ban.</strong></span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The message is in red and our answer is in black</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">Can anyone verify the following or get clarifications…</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">we were able to compile this brief response, which is by no means exhaustive and in actual fact this topic needs a more detailed researched paper due to the discussions it contains with regards to the principles of Hadeeth and Fiqh</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Allaamah Ibn Al-Arabee (not the Soofee Ibn arabi who was kafir) Said there is no reliable Hadeeth regarding the middle of Shabaan with regards to its virtue or with regards to the writing of people’s ages on this night therefore do not pay attention to it. Ahkaam al-Quraan vol.4 page.169</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Haafidh Ibn Qayyim said there is nothing authentic with regards to the middle of Shabaan. Al-Manaar al-Muneef pages. 98-99.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">These narrations also contradict the authentic Hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) where he said, “When the middle of Shabaan comes do not fast after it in case Ramadhan comes. SAHEEH Abu Dawood no.2049, Tirmidhee with Tuhfa vol.3 page.467, Ibn Maajah no.1651, Musannaf Abdur Razzaaq vol.4 page.161 no.7325 and Saheeh al-Jaam’e vol.1 page.68 of Shaikh al-Albaanee.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Haafidh Abul-Khataab bin Dahiyyah said, according to the scholars of jarh Wat tadeel there is no authentic Hadeeth with regards to the virtue of the night of mid Shabaan. Al-Baa’ith Ala Inkaar al-Bidah Wal-Hawaadith pg.52 of Imaam Abee Shaamah al-Maqdisee.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Imaam Uqailee said, All the ahadeeth that mention Allaah descending on the 15th of Shabaan are weak. Refer to his ad-Dhu’afa Vol.3 pg.29.</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Night of Bara’ah (Laylatul Bara’ah) istonight in the UK (Sunday 23rd of June)The Hadith regarding the night of Bara’ah:There are many Ahaadith that have been narrated on the virtue of the 15th of Sha’baan.</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">One of them is the narration of Sayyiduna Mu’aadh ibn Jabal (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, ‘Allah Ta’ala turns to his entire creation on the fifteenth night of Sha’baan and forgives all of them except one who ascribes partners to Him and one who harbours enmity in his heart.’ (This Hadith has been recorded by Imaam Tabrani in his Mu’jamul Awsat Hadith6776 and Mu’jamul Kabeer vol.20 pg.108-109)</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">This narration has been cited by others also like Imaam Ibn Hibbaan in his saheeh, Imaam Baihaqee in his Shu’bah Eemaan and Ibn Abee Aasim in his as-Sunnah. This narration is weak. Imaam Dhahabee said makhool did not meet Maalik bin Yakhaamir. Refer to Silsilah as-Saheehah no.1144 of Imaam al-Albaanee, there is a disconnection in the chain which renders it to be weak.</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sahaba, Tabi’een, Tabi tabi’een &amp; great scholars of the past &amp; present on the Night of Bara’ah:</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">1. Ibn Taymiyya was asked about the prayer of mid-Sha`ban [i.e. the night of]. He answered: If a person prays that night alone, or in a select congregation, as many groups (tawaif) of the Early Muslims used to do, it is very good.As for gathering in the mosque for a particular fixed prayer, such as gather for 100 rakats in which 1,000 QulhuwaAllahuAhad are read every time, this is a reprehensible innovation, which none of the imams have allowed. [Ibn Taymiyya, al-Fatawa al-Kubra, 2; 222-138]</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He also said regarding this night:The excellency regarding the 15th of Shabaan is an area of dispute between the Scholars, some of them say that there is no significance of this night, but Imam Ahmed recognises the excellency of this night, our other Hanbli Scholars also agree with Imam Ahmed. There are Ahadith on this night being significant, some of them are from Sunnan (Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah) and the other Ahdeeth books as well [Iqtidah Siratul Mustaqeem page 203 by Hafidhh Ibn Taymiyah] </span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ibn Taymiyyah also said:‘As for the middle night of Sha’baan, there are various narrations that have been narrated regarding its significance and it has been reported from a group of the Salaf (predecessors) that they performed Salaat in it individually, hence, such a deed cannot be disputed.’ (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa ibn Taymiyah vol.23 pg.132)</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He also said: “So many Ahaadith and reports exist regarding the excellence of the fifteenth night of Shabaan that one is compelled to accept that this night possesses some virtue”. Some of the pious predecessors used to specially devote this night for Salaat. [Faydhul-Qadeer. vol 2., pg 317].</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The exacts words of Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah are, From this chapter is the middle of shabaan</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">“As there are marfoo ahadeeth and Athar with regards to the virtue of this night and some of the Salaf would specifically pray on this night (Referring to the taabieen I have mentioned further on in this response). There are However authentic ahadeeth with regards to fasting in the month of Shabaan. The scholars from the Salaf From Madeenah And some of the laters scholars have rejected the virtue of this night and have criticised the narrations regarding its virtue… However numerous people of knowledge and those from our companions have acknowledged its virtue as Imaam Ahmad has indicated with texts as a number of hadeeth and reports have been transmitted Some of the virtues have been transmitted in the masaneed and sunans. HOWEVER JUST FASTING ON THE 15TH OF SHABAAN ALONE HAS NO BASIS (in Islaam ie is its baseless and made up) AND IT IS PROHIBITIVELY DISLIKED, SIMILARLY ORGANISING FOOD AND DRESSING UP SMARTLY ARE FROM THE NEW INNOVATIONS AND THEY HAVE NO BASIS IN ISLAM.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Shaikh ul-Islaam goes onto say the gathering of the people on this night and praying Salatul al-Fiyyah in the large central mosque Is also an innovation, not allowed in the Sharee’ah And prohibitively disliked because the ahadeeth narrated concerning praying this Salah collectively are all from fabricated narrations…. (Iqtida Siratal Mustaqeem Li-Mukhalafati Ashaabul Jaheem vol.2 page. 631-632 ed.dr Naasir bin Abdul Kareem al-Aql Maktabah ar-Rushd, Riyadh KSA)</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The last reference is not even Ibn Taymiyyahs book, it is the Tafseer of Imaam Shawkaanee titled Fath ul-Qadeer.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">So the scholars of Madeenah rejected the virtue of this night as did the people of Hijaaz, the people of shaam gave it some credibility. Some of the scholars may have believed some of the narrations pertaining to the virtue of this night were authentic or knew they were weak but collectively they were Hasan. However all of the narrations are weak and this is why some scholars may have given this night some credibility with regards to its virtue as this was the way of the people of knowledge, they would give a weak Hadeeth precedence over their opinions.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The narrations that mention the collective praying have been declared to be fabricated, Refer to al-Laalee al-Masnooa fee ahadeeth mawdooah vol.2 pages 58-59, Fawaa’id al-Majmoo’a pages.50-51 and Tabayan al-Ajab page 25-26 of Haafidh Ibn Hajr.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Another reason for this is because some of the Salaf thought the night of power ie laylatul Qadr was on the middle of Shabaan and this is why they would pray and do other acts of Ibadah. This is however a minority opinion of the scholars of the past as the vast majority of them considered the night of power to be in Ramadhan.</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">2. Imam Ibn Majah states:It is narrated by Ali (Ra) that the Prophet Mohammed (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) stated; “When it is the 15th night of Shabaan, do Qiyaam in the night, and fast in the morning, and ask for forgiveness. Because on that night Allah calls: ‘Is there anyone who is asking for forgiveness so that I can forgive them, who is in distress that I may relieve his distress, is there anyone who needs (rizq) food that I may give it to him.’ And this continues till the morning.” [Ibn Majah chapter Salaah]</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Firstly a big lie and major deception in Not translating all of the report correctly, the report clearly mentions, Allaah descends to the Heaven of this World when the sunsets and says, Who is there that seeks forgiveness so that I may forgive…..</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">So if you believe this narration is authentic do you also believe Allaah descends.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Ok this report is in Ibn Maajah no.1388, then this narration is FABRICATED. Imaam Nawawee said this report is weak refer to his Khulasatul Ahkaam vol.1 page.617. The narrator in the chain is Abu Bakr bin Abdullaah bin Muhammad, commonly known as Ibn Abee Sabrah, he was declared to be arch liar ie a kadhab and a fabricator of Hadeeth. Imaam Ahmad said he would fabricate Hadeeth. Refer to al-Jarh Wat-Ta’deel Vol.7 page.306. Imaam Ibn Ma’een also criticised him.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee said this narration is weak and fabricated. Refer to his Da’eef al-Jaam’e no.752, Tahqeeq Mishkaat vol.1 page.410, Daeef Ibn Maahaj no.294.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Haafidh Mundhiri used the context of Ruwiya it has been narrated Ie in the context of it being weak in his Targreeb Wat-Tarheeb</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Allaamah Bausaree said in his Misbaah az-Zujaajaj Fee Zawaa’id Ibn Maajah the chain of this narration is weak due to a narrator in the chain, Ibn Abee Sabrah is weak.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Allamah Abdur Rahmaan Mubarakpooree Also said he was weak and a fabricator of hadeeth and stated what Ibn Hajr said in his Taqreeb that the scholars of Hadeeth labelled him as a fabricator and the hanafee scholar Amee Alee mentioned ijmaa on him Being weak in his Taqeeb ut-Taqreeb. Refer to Tuhfatul-Ahwadhee vol.3 page.442.</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">3. Hafidh Rawpari &amp; Thana’ullah Amritsari on the Night of Bara’ah:Two great followers of Ibn Taymiyah and Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab Al Najdi, are Hafidh Abdullah Rawpari and Thanaa’ullah Amritsari, both state that to worship on the 15th night of Shabaan is not Bid’ah and the person who does Ibada (Worship) on this night will obtain reward for it. The narrations concerning this night are weak but this does not matter since weak Ahadith are acceptable for virtuous actions. [Fatawa Ahl-e-Hadith by Hafidhh Rawpari and Fatawa Thanaa’iya by Thana’ullah Amritsari, chapter on fasting]</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Yes in Fataawa Thanayyah vol.1 page 656 Shaikh Thanaullah said there are weak narrations pertaining to this night but doing anything good Will earn Reward. However we will inshaAllaah receive reward if we did Ibadah on any day and so Shaikh Thanaullah Said Ibadah even on this night will inshaAllaah he worthy of reward, Besides there is nothing wrong with doing ibadah on this Night or any other Night, the point of contention is singling this day Or night out alone and specific for Ibadah with the intention of receiving reward or something specific, Or ie to receive forgiveness. So where is the contradiction.</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">4. Sheikh Al-Albani also confirmed the significance of this night. Below is the hadith which he declares it Sahih:Hadith: Allah turns towards his creation in the Night of “MID-SHABAN” and He forgives all of them except for a Mushrik and one who hates other people (Albani calls it); “A SAHIH HADITH” narrated by group of Sahaba with different routes (Turuq) such as from Muadh bin Jabal (Ra), Abu Thalbah (Ra) Abdullah bin Umar (Ra), Abu Musa al Ashari (Ra), Abu Hurraira (Ra), Abu Bakr as Saddiq (ra), Awf bin Malik (ra) and Aisha (ra).The Hadith of Muadh bin Jabal (ra) comes through Makhul from Malik bin Yakhamir and It is “MARFU” narrated by Ibn Abi Asim in his As-Sunnah Hadith #512 [Nasir ud din Albani in Silsilat ul-Ahadith-as Sahiha, Volume No. 3, Page No. 135 #1144] </span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sheikh Al Albani also said: As for what is authentic regarding the night of the 15th of Sha’baan, [The Prophet, sallallaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam, said,] “Allaah, the Blessed and Exalted, comes to His Creation on Laylatun-Nisf (the 15th night) of Sha’baan, and He forgives all of His Creation, except for the polytheist and the mushaahin .” It is an authentic narration narrated by a number of Companions with a number or different chains that strengthen each other, by way of Mu’aath ibn Jabal, Aboo Tha’labah Al-Khushanee, ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr, Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash’aree, Aboo Hurayrah, Aboo Bakr As-Siddeeq, ‘Awf ibn Maalik, and ‘Aa’ishah…Sheikh Al Albani concludes: …So in summary, the narration is authentic without a doubt, as authenticity could be established for it even if there were not so many routes, so long as they are free of any severe weaknesses, as is the case with this narration. </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee only graded this Hadeeth authentic based on his ijtihad not the others, he has categorically declared them to be weak And the only reason he declared it to be authentic was due to other supporting chains, answering this point is way to lengthy as one would need to look at the various types of Hasan and if Hasan Li-Ghayrihi Can be used as evidence. Shaikh al-Albaanee himself said after citing Imaam Dhahabee about Maalik Ibn Yakhaamir not hearing from makhool, that if he did hear from him, the chain of this narration would be Hasan.</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Source: NEWS \ INNOVATION ALERT – Shabbee Baraat (15th Sha’baan)</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">5. Imam Nawawi (Ra) mentioned in his Majmu`, where he also quoted Imam al-Shafi`i from the latters al-Umm that it has reached him that there are 5 nights when dua is answered, one of them being the night of the 15th of Sha`ban.</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">6. Imaam ibn Hibbaan (RA) has classified this narration as Sahih (authentic) and has included it in his book – al-Saheeh. (see Sahih ibn Hibbaan vol.12 pg.482; Hadith5665).</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">7. Hafiz al-Haythami (RA) has mentioned that all the narrators of this Hadith arereliable. (Majma-uz-zawaaid vol.8 pg.65)</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">8. It is also classified as sound by Haafiz al-Mundhiri(RA) in his (Al-Targheeb (vol.3 pg.459)).</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">points no. 5-8 are all related to the Hadeeth of Mu’adh Ibn Jabal which is weak Due to inqita ie disconnection in the chain how can it be authentic.</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">9. This narration is of Sayyiduna Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) and is recorded by Imaam Bazzaar (RA) in his Musnad.</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</p>
<p>This report is also weak. A narrator in the chain Abdul Maalik bin Abdul Maalik is weak according to the majority of the scholars. Imaam Daarqutnee said he is matron ie abandoned.(suwaalaat Al-Burqaanee no.304) Imaam BUKHAARI said look into him which means he was criticised according to Imaam bukhaari a terminology. Taareekh al-Kabeer vol.5. Page. 424.Imaam Ibn Hibbaan said severely rejected in Hadeeth, Kitaab al-Majrooheen vol.2 page.136. Another narrator in the chain Musab bin Abee Dhib was declared to be abandoned by Imaam Daarqutnee. Refer to suwaalaat al-Burqaanee no.508)</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">10. In fact, Hafiz ibn Hajar (RA) has also classified one of its chains as Hasan (sound).(al-Amaalil mutlaqah pgs.119-120)Besides the above, there are many other Sahaaba (Radhiallaahu Anhum) that narrated Ahaadith regarding the merit of this night, such as: </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">a chain can be Hasan that does not necessitate the main ie text is authentic.</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">11. Abu Hurayra (Musnad al-Bazzaar),</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">This is also a weak narration as the narrator Hishaam bin Abdur Rahmaan is unknown. Haafidh Haithamee said I do not know him refer to Majma’a az-Zawaa’id vol.8 page.65. If the narrator is unknown how can the narration be authentic. Imaam Ibn al-Mundhir said it is not permissible to use the narration of an unknown narrator to be evidence because it is disconnected. Refer to al-Awsth vol.2 page.223 of Ibn al-Mundhir. Imaam Daarqutnee and Imaam Tabaree said the same. Refer to Sunan Daarqutnee Vol.1 page.141 no.498) and for TabareeS statement refer to Haafidh Ibn Hajrs Fath ul-Baaree vol.10 page.195)</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">12. Abu Tha’labah (Shu’ubul Imaan), </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">This is also weak a narrator in the chain, Ahwas bin Hakeem was weak with regards to his memory refer to Ibn Hajrs Taqreeb no.290. Haithamee said the majority of the scholars declared him to be weak.Majma’a az-Zawaa’id vol.3 page.42</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">13. Awf ibn Maalik (Musnad al-Bazzaar),</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The chain of this narrationis weak. Abdur Rahman bin Ziyaad al-Ifriqi is In the chain Who is considered to be weak according to the majority of the scholars of Hadeeth and he was also a mudalis. Imaam Nawawee said about him, he is weak with agreement. Khulasatul Ahkaam Vol.1 page.449. Imaam Ibn Hibbaan brings him in his Book about abandoned and crit incised narrators. Refer to his al-Majrooheen vol.2 page.50. Imaam Bazzaar himself said its chain is weak refer to Kashful-Astaar Ni-Zawaa’id Musnad al-Bazzaar vol.1 pg.245.</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">14. Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-Aas (Musnad Ahmad Hadith6642), </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Narration is weak it contains Ibn Laheeyah who is weak, a mudalis and also forgetful ie mukhtalam. He was declared weak by Imaam Abdur Rahmaan Mubarakpooree, Imaam Mundhiri said Imaam Ahmad transmitted this with a weak chain refer to Targheeb Wat-Tarheeb vol.3 page.460. Shaikh al-Albaanee said Ibn Laheeyah is supported by rishdeen bin saad, but rishdeen Ibn saad is also weak. Refer to Taqreeb no.1943 of Haafidh Ibn Hajr. hHaithamee said about him the majority declared him to be weak. Majma’a az-Zawaa’id vol.1 page.160 And vol.5 page.66 therefore the support is useless.</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">15. Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari (ibn Majah Hadith1390; Shu’ubul Imaan Hadith3833) and others. The collective strength of these narrations cannot be refuted.</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The chain of this report is also weak As it contains Ibn Laheeyah who is weak and a mudalis and he also became forgetful. zubair bin Salem in the chain is majhool ie unknown. Taqreeb ut-Tahdheeb no.1996, also in the chain is Abdur Rahman bin Arzab who is also majhool refer to Taqreeb no.3950, Another narrator in another chain of a report in Ibn Majaah is dhihaak bin A’yaan who is also majhool Taqreeb no.2965 and also Waleed Ibn Muslim in the chain used to do tadlees taswiyyah but was a great scholar.</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">The general virtue of this night has been accepted by many great Ulama of the past. From among many great scholars which have agreed to the virtue of this night are: </span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">16. Umar ibn Abdul-Aziz, </span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">17. Imaam al-Shaafi’ee,</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">18. Imaam al-Awdhaa’ie, </span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">19. Attaa ibn Yassaar,</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">20. Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">what a deception Haafidh Ibn Rajab said some of the people of shaam like Khaalid bin ma’dam, makhool, luqmaan bin Aamir and others would do Ibadah on this night and some of the people of Basrah followed them in this. However the the great majority of the scholars of Hijaaz like A’taa, Ibn Abee Mulaikah, And the Fuqahah of Madeenah And the companions of Imaam Maalik rejected this and said it was an innovation. Refer to Lataa’if al-Ma’arif page 142.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">So most of the Ibadah that is done on this was due to some taabieen regarding this night to be virtuous and they would worship on this night and the people of shaam began to follow them.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Haafidh Ibn Rajab also said numerous reports have been transmitted with regards to the virtue of this night, there is difference of opinion if they are authentic or not But most of the scholars of Hadeeth have said They are weak. Ibn Hibbaan said some are authentic and the best of them is that of Aishah (RadhiAllaahu Anha). Lataa’if al-Ma’arif page.144.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Imaam Ibn Hibbaan was lenient in his grading and therefore his grading on its own is not weighty as the scholars of Hadeeth have elucidated.</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">21. Hafidh Zaynu-deen al-Iraaqiy (Rahmatullaahi alayhim) – refer Lataiful Ma’aarif of Hafiz ibn Rajab pgs.263-264 and Faydhul Qadeer vol.2 pg.317 </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Haafidh al-Araaqee said the Hadeeth about the prayer on the 15th of Shabaan is Baatil in his takhreej Hayaan Uloom ud deen refer To al-Mughnee Ann Hamal al-Asfaar vol.1 page.182</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Moulana Abdur Rahman Mubarakpuri writes in his commentary of Tirmidhi, “The sheer number of Ahaadith regarding this night serve as proof against those people who refute the excellence of this night”.

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In conclusion:</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">So if the above Sahaba, Salaf, Tabi’een, Tabi Tabi’een and great scholars of the past and present accept and declare this night as</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">having some significance then who are we as lay people to say otherwise without any proof or evidence but just parroting what certain scholars have said instead of respecting it as a valid difference of opinion. Therefore to declare such night as a bida’a is declaring the above scholars as those who promote bida’a and also being ignorant to valid differences of opinion. So if one wants to worship this night then let him and if one does not then that is also fine, but the least one can do is to accept valid differences of opinion.</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sheikh Mufti Taqi Uthmani concludes regarding the night of Bara’ah:Although the chain of narrators of some of these traditions regarding this night suffers with some minor technical defects, yet when all these traditions are combined together, it becomes clear that this night has some well founded merits, and observing this night as a sacred night is not a baseless concoction as envisaged by some modern scholars who, on the basis of these minor defects, have totally rejected to give any special importance to this night. In fact, some of these traditions have been held by some scholars of hadith as authentic and the defects in the chain of some others have been treated by them as minor technical defects which, according to the science of hadith, are curable by the variety of their ways of narration. That is why the elders of the Ummah have constantly been observing this night as a night of special merits and have been spending it in worship and prayers.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ANSWER</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Salafis are not obliged to answer on behalf of the Hanafee deobandees who promote shirk.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">And Allah knows best in all matters</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">LASTLY</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">if some of the taabieen did Ibadah on this night, this may have been their own ijtihad, what is obligated upon is to follow the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and his companions and we find nothing authentically established from him that he offered prayers specifically for this night for the various benefits nor has this been authentically reported from the noble companions.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Those who intend to promote the virtue of this night based on the research presented above, we put to them do they agree with everything that is done on this night ie the 100 rakahs and the 1000 Soorah ikhlas. Do they light fireworks and candles, do they clean their houses believing the souls return so on and so forth. Some of them even go and offer their Salah in the grave yard, they make sweet dishes and distribute them, I thought not. So why is their selective practise of certain things only when the same principle should be applied.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Because their numerous reports with regards the virtue of this night some of the scholars held the opinion this night maybe virtuous and it is due to these texts that Imaam Ahmad held this opinion as Ibn Taymiyyah has mentioned. We have also mentioned Imaam Ahmad manhaj was that he accepted weak Hadeeth over opinion and Qiyaas.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Imaam Abu Shaamah wrote an amazing book on innovations and he talks about this in great detail in his book titled, Al-Baaith Ala Inkaar al-Bidah Wal-Hawaadith.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">They pray a prayer on this night called the al-Fiyyah ie thousand and what they do is pray 100 rakah and in each rakah they recite Soorah ikhlas 10 times making the recitation of Soorah ikhlas 1000 times hence the al-fiyyah. Refer to al-Baa’ith.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Another early work on Bidah was by Imaam Muhammad bin Waddah al-Qurtubee who was from the third century Titled al-Bidah Wa Nahya Anhu. He brings 2 reports from his own chain pertaining to the 15th of Shabaan and says, our jurists and scholars never used to pay any attention to The night of the middle of Shabaan, nor would they do such things or offer such prayers.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">He brings another report that Ibn Abee Mulaikah was told that Ziyad an-Numairee says that the reward of the night of the middle of Shabaan is similar to the reward of laylatul Qadr, so Ibn Abee Mulaikah said, if I had heard this from him and I had a stick in my hand I would have hit him with it and this Ziyaad was the time was the Qaadhee of his era. Refer to Bidah Wa Nahya Anhu page.46.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">This said, this article by no means or serves justice to this topic and contention issue and more research should be done it and likewise and similarly people should not be hung about ibadah on this day. It is safe to use the Scholars differ over this issue some use the principle of Fadhail al-A’mal for ibadah on this day and night but without designation. Therefore all the scholars of Ahlul Hadith who are quoted in this regard ie the virtue of this day and night are from the perspective that any ibadah will be rewarded. The late indian hadith master Shaikh Shams ul-Haq Azimabadi has followed this line as per his fatwa and Defender of Ahlul Hadith Shaikh Abul Qasim Saif Banarasi has concurred with Shaikh Azimabadi as well as the ones cited above in nothing being authenically narrated with regards to fasting on this day.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">We pray that the brothers are able to produce some detailed papers making jamm between the adillah for and against and reconcile the various statements of the scholars.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Allahu Ta’ala A’lam</h3>
