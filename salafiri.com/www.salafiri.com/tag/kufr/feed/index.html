				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated Abu Ubaydah</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Checked &amp; Additional Notes</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: center;" align="center"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;" align="center"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;" align="center"></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“and to say about Allah what you do not know.” [Surah al-Baqarah Ayah 169]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a serious crime to attribute something to Allah which he did not say. It is very severe as it is unlawful. This is why it is considered as the 4th thing in the Quran which is forbidden and all the Shariahs and religions agree in this being forbidden. Such an action cannot be allowed in any circumstance and it can only be declared as being </span><span style="color: #000000;">haram.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are 2 types of things which are forbidden:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. That which is forbidden itself (inherently) [haram dhati], which is forbidden and cannot be allowed [halal] in any condition. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. That which is temporarily forbidden [haram aridhi], that which can be forbidden at any given time and not forbidden at any other time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Most High says in regards to those things which are forbidden itself (haram dhati):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Say, &#8220;My Rab has only forbidden immoralities &#8211; what is apparent of them and what is concealed” [Surah A’raf Ayah 33]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After this He informed us about forbidden things which are more dangerous than immoralities, meaning:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“and sin, and oppression without right” [Surah A’raf Ayah 33]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then He mentioned something severely forbidden:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down authority,” [Surah A’raf Ayah 33]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After this He explained an action which is more forbidden (which is mentioned above):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“and that you say about Allah that which you do not know.” [Surah A’raf Ayah 33]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The higher the level of a forbidden thing the the greater the amount of sin it has. This is not just one sin rather it is a collection of sins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. Attributing a lie to Allah and attributing such a saying to Him which does not beautify Him. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. Changing His religion (Din)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. Negating what He established, and establishing what He negated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4. Declaring something false as true and truth as false. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5. Having enmity for His friends and having friendship with His enemies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6. Loving what He does not like, and hating what He loves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7. Talking about things in which are  inferior to His statements, actions attributes and essence</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What can be more severe in being forbidden than this, this is the origin of kufr and shirk. All of the foundations of misguidance and innovations in the religion are based on this. The basis of misguided acts of worship all emanate from talking about Allah without knowledge. That is why the Salaf severely and strictly prohibited this. And this is why Allah said it is forbidden to make something halal or haram without any proof or evidence:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And do not say about what your tongues assert of untruth, &#8220;This is lawful and this is unlawful,&#8221; to invent falsehood about Allah” [Surah an-Nahl Ayah 116]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Talking without knowledge is a branch of shirk and kufr. Every mushrik and kafir will be guilty of talking without knowledge. However it is not necessary that every person who speaks without knowledge (talking about Allah without knowledge) is also a mushrik and kafir, as sometimes talking without knowledge reaches the level of innovation in the religion and Ta’til (rejection) of the attributes (of Allah). So talking without knowledge is a part of shirk and kufr.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and an established fact, from the time of Ādam Alayhis Salām to the time of Nūh Alayhis Salām for ten generations all the people were upon Tawḥīd, the Millah Waḥidah i.e the one nation i.e the one Dīn of Islām. Then the people became trapped in the deception of shayṭān, and slowly by slowly, they deviated from Tawḥīd and began to commit Shirk. A prophetic ḥadīth as narrated by Ayādh bin Humar Majashī that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said that Allāh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I created all of my servants upon Hunafā i.e clear and pure Dīn of Tawḥīd. Then shayṭān came to them and beguiled them, made them change their Dīn. They made ḥarām what I made ḥalāl for them and he made them equal to me in affairs for which I did not reveal any evidence for.”</em> [Reported in Muslim, Mishkāt al-Masābīḥ [2/460].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Ḥadtīh Qudsī indicates from the time of Ādam Alayhis Salām, all the people were upon Tawḥīd for a long time, until the time just before the time of Nūh Alayhis Salām. Some people became trapped in the plots of shayṭān and the people deviated from the creed of Tawḥīd and began to associate entities (ie partners) with Allāh (the most high), for which Allāh, the most high, did not legislate any proof or evidence. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Allāh, the Most High, sent his Prophets and Messengers to these people who deviated from Tawḥīd in order to rectify their affairs. When Nūh Alayhis Salām went to these mushriks, he informed them of many issues. From them one such point was:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“I do no say to you that I have treasures from Allāh nor do I have knowledge of the unseen.” [Sūrah Hūd: 31]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This clearly shows that Nūh being a great Messenger of Allāh, the most high, and His Prophet, He did not have any such share in the specific attribute of Allāh i.e knowledge of the unseen. Then, How is it possible that someone other than a Messenger can have such a share in this specific attribute of which only belongs to Allāh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nonetheless, it is a reality that from the beliefs of the mushrikīn is that they believed other than Allāh also had knowledge of the unseen, from this attribute of Allāh. Nūh very clearly advised such people who deviated from Tawḥīd that he did not have knowledge of the unseen and that no Messenger or Prophet was equal to Allāh in this attribute.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When our Prophet Muḥammed ﷺ the final messenger, prophecised that his Ummah will follow in the footsteps of the previous nations, in their misguidance and deviation, then at the same instance, He ﷺ also very clearly informed us that people from his Ummah will also worship idols and commit shirk and kufr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence, Thawbān (RaḍiAllāhu Anhu) narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The hour (of Judgement) will not be established up until tribes (groups of people) from my Ummah do not join the mushrikīn to the extent that tribes from my Ummah will worship idols”</em> [Narrated Abū Dawūd, Tirmidhī, Mishkāt [2/465]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ḥurairah (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) narrated the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“At the time of Jahilīyyah, people from my Ummah will also worship idols before the Day of Judgement”</em> [Agreed Upon, Mishkāt [2/481]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similar such reports have been transmitted from ʿĀishah (RaḍiAllāhu Anha) and other companions via numerous chains. Ziyād bin Lūbaid (RaḍiAllāhu Anhu) narrated that</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Messenger of Allāh </em>ﷺ<em> while mentioning that something of fear will occur, He said it will happen when knowledge will be taken away. So, Ziyād Bin Lūbaid (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) asked How will knowledge be taken away when we read the Qurān and teach our children and so on, and this will remain until the Day of Judgement? He </em>ﷺ<em> replied “I thought of you as a person with most understanding in the city of Madīnah, However, you did not understand my point. You see the Jews and Christians reading the Torah and the Injīl but they do not act upon them, and thus the same thing will happen to my Ummah” </em>[Aḥmad, Ibn Majāh, Ḥākim in mursal form, Tirmidhī from Abū Dawūd, Dārimī from Abu Umamāh, Mirʿāh al-Mafātih Sharḥ Mishkāt al-Masābih 1/362]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Taken from Tashih al-ʿAqā’id)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">JazakāAllāhu Khair to Abū Maryam for his help.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated, Compiled and Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h5>
<h6 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">[This was a very moving introduction of a book by Shaikh Abdur Razzaq which he wrote over 100 years ago with regards to the afflicted state of affairs of the Muslims. The benefit of this article is that it shows the the affair and reality of the Muslims 100 years ago and that things have worsened with regards to implementing Tawhid and eradicating Shirk]</span></strong></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Anas bin Malik RadhiAllahu Anhu would cry during the era of Banu Umayyah because the deen that was revealed had been changed by the people, so what would they have said if they encountered the people from our times? Would they not have labelled us Mushriks and would we not have used bad words against them. This is because if there is anything that remains intact in our Islam today which was present before, then that is only the word Islam and some daily rituals of worship and even they are not free from innovations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The book of Allah as it was revealed from the heavens it is still preserved in exactly the same way. Even the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi wasallam is collated and preserved by the Muslims. However what a great pity and calamity that both are abandoned and neglected and are locked away in cabinets or just being being used as talismans and amulets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muslims are totally free and independent of them in their practical lives and are in fact traversing a path in opposition to obeying the command of the Quran and Sunnah. Who can say and claim after seeing the commemoration of Ajmer that they are Muslims who act and follow the Quran or are the flag bearers of Tawhid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Hindu leader of Oudh said after witnessing the events of Ajmer said <em>&#8220;Up untill now I was in doubt that Muslims and Hindus could unite, however today I am certain that today if there are any differences between us and the religion of the Muslims, then it is only in name because both in reality are the same.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He spoke the truth because if there are any difference between the shirk of the Muslims and the Hindus then it is only of name and methods. The Hindu bows to the idols and Muslims bow to the graves, the Hindu worships ram and Krishna and Muslims worship and venerate Jilani and Ajmer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For them (ie the Muslims) to say that they do not worship them or we do not consider them to be gods, is some thing that is pointless and carries no meaning whatsoever and is thus worthless because the the Hindu claims he worships one deity as well. Whereas we know they have hundreds of idols that they worship. Similarly the mushrikin of Arabia did not worship the idols thinking they were gods and deities besides Allah. However these people say that their worship is not worship like that of the idols nor do they give them different names, however changing names and differences between them does not change the true reality of the actual affairs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a great calamity for an individual to find out the thoughts, affairs and mindset of a Muslim mushrik as this group of people or sect are deficient and incapable of intelligence from following texts. On one hand they accept that Allah is the knower of the unseen, the all hearing and all seeing and not a single atom of the heavens and earth is without his knowledge and neither can it move without his permission, he is not far from us but rather close and near to us, he is the most beneficent and merciful, the most giving and forgiving and he gives without numeration. He is just and not Injust that he does not allow us to ask him he is always there and always giving with his hands outstretched and his sustenance is continuous. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people accept more of him and but yet after this, their intelligence and brains dies and the death of humanity and morality occurs because after accepting all of this these people prostrate and bow to graves, they offer vows to the deceased and it is normal for them to seek intercession and intermediateries  from those who do not even have the right. They go to the grave of Gauth Al-A&#8217;zam who is apparently still the Ghaus after his death and can steal souls from the angel of death, he is mehbub subhani, Ashiq Jan Nithar who can change the ways of stubborn people, they are gharib nawab who give sweets even after dying. These claimants of Islam and humanity emphatically go to graves and rub their foreheads on them and rub their noses and they do everything a pious human and upright individual would never be able to do in front of any of the creation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the greatest assets a human has is his own humanity whereas the others sacrifice their on the bricks and mortars of graves without any shame. If it is said to them look at what you are doing the shariah has forbidden such actions and such acts are shirk which will be punished and be in the fire of hell. They would answer with rejection and denial, distortion and false explanation. They will say it is a discussion of the shariah and what it is permissible, it is whether the inner self or outer self is evidence or the difference between the Wahhabi and hanafi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise they will present their statements and discourses Hasan Al-Basri, Shibli, Jilani and Chisti in opposition to the ayah of the Quran and the Hadith if the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi wasallam. Whereas none of the aforementioned people held any form of shirk to be permissible but who is there that can be told of this reality, who is there that listens, eyes which see and a heart that understands. As Allah said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless.&#8221; (Surah al-A&#8217;raf:179)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Unfortunately this is not only the state of affairs of the masses who can be possibly excused due to ignorance. This is also the affair of those who openly and repeatedly refer to themselves and scholars of the ummah and their inheritors of the prophecy or the prophets of Bani Israil. On one hand they say ask us questions about the shariah and yet on the other hand they claim they know the secrets of the realities and Sufi orders. The truth is that it is these people who are a trial and fitnah and the main cause for all the destruction and loss. These evil scholars are the harut and marut of this ummah and the leaders of the shayatin and they are the ones who distorted the shariah and closed the doors of the Quran and Sunnah for the Muslims. They are the ones who spread the darkness, innovation and Sufi tariqahs. They are the ones who ripped Islam away from the people under the name of Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">13 centuries of Islam have passed us and what calamity has befallen us that has not come from them, which misguidance is there which they have not shouldered the blame for. Abdullah bin Mubarak said, <em>&#8220;did anyone other than the rulers, religious scholars and priest change the din.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The words are indeed strong and inflictions on the heart and mind are serious and deep and what more than them could force someone to lament that all of these Muslims falling into destruction but yet remain silent. No Muslim will see this sad state of affairs and remain silent. How can a Muslim remain silent when things are clearly being changed and the truth is being called falsehood and the falsehood as truth. A Muslim can not see Tawhid being labelled as shirk and shirk being labelled as Tawhid and see the shariah as something that misguides and the Sunnah to be an innovation and Iman to be kufr and the coffer as Iman. It is said to a Muslim it is impossible to understand the Quran and Sunnah therefore stay away from them and rather do taqlid of people which is obligatory, therefore follow us without asking why. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So by following us build your graves higher, make tombs, ask the auliya for your needs and make the creation a wasilah for Allah, in fact do whatever you wish and you will still be forgiven because you are from the Ummah who will be interceded for therefore this is the deen, this is the shariah and this is the Sunnah. So do we not hear all of these things and remain silent or has the time not come for the reformers to arise and put a stop to the treachery of these evil scholars so that the people are able to see for themselves what Devils lie beneath their huge turbans and what darkness of kufr is entwined between their beards.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to mention of one of their respected and revered scholars who is a Sufi and is probably even a peer, during the Khilafah movement he made a suggestion that a group of scholars should go to Ajmer and tell Khawaja Sahib every single problem of the Ummah and ask for assistance. This was not only am suggestion but I have come to know this Moulvi actually went with his fellow associates and cried a lot at the shrine. However what a great shame that there was no answer and they returned. Is this the Tawhid the Quran established which these people claim they are the scholars of the din and the false pride they present in obeying and adhering to the Sunnah. If Khawaja could save the Ummah of Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi wasallam from these difficulties and calamities why do the Muslims frown on Ram and Krishna being deities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This so call visit to Ajmer was not a private affair but rather a newspaper column has publicly announced this but no scholar came forward and said this was Shirk in fact and rather most Moulvis wrote in support of the visit as the newspaper article testifies. Is this the protection of the din these so called scholars have taken the liberty upon themselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Oh and what a shame if only the scholars who promote misguidance and innovations were restricted and limited to this group only who are innovators and they were not from amongst those who claim to be reformers or alleged revivers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say these words with great sorrow and sadness and would like to present these tragic affairs to the Muslims and it has only been a few days that a great scholar (as they call him) of an educational institute of this group as well as other scholars who clearly refused to issue edicts of shirk for the Shia mourning and lamenting publicly in masses and they said such a fatwa is contrary to the greater benefit and the Khilafah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So is this the method to preserve and protect the shariah, is this the inheritance the prophets left for the scholars and their obligation and is this how our scholars fulfil their roles? Has the time still not come for the Muslims to open their eyes and and find out the reality of their religious leaders and push themselves forward in preserving the din and removing and obliterating shirk and bidah? There is no papacy in Islam or religious spiritual leaders so this the time has come to demolish these self appointed religious leaders so that Allahs servants create a strong direct link and connection with Allah.</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Publishers Introduction</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All Praise be to Allaah the Most High and Majestic and may there be abundant salutations upon the Messenger of Allaah (r) and his family.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the second treatise of Shaikh Taalib ur Rehman which Maktabah Ashaabul Hadeeth have translated. This books gives an insight into the real creed and beliefs of the destructive deobandee sect and their fellow ­madhabees, the bareilwees. The deceptive deobandees hide behind a cloak of innocence when in reality they also hold the same ill-beliefs as the bareilwees.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If a ­deobandee or bareilwee says something, which generally conforms to the Quraan and Hadeeth, it does not make their core beliefs and doctrines conform to the Aqeedah of Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jama’ah and neither does it make them innocent of the beliefs contained in their books. That is unless and until they warn againt these anti islamic beliefs</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of GF Haddad, Yaqoobee, Riyadh ul-Haq, Zaheer Mahmood, Asraar the Soofee Bareilwee Rasheed, Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed, Tahir ul-Qadiree, Hisham Kabbani, Nuh Haa Meem Keller, Hamza Yusuf, Zaid Shaakir (not forgetting the South African acadamies) and all of the adherents of the Soofee ideology are the proponets of such beliefs, if not openly then certainly secretly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Using polemics and rethoric is something the people of innovation and misguidance use often and it is no childs play to them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If these individuals or other than them, from the people we meet on a daily basis say, <em>“Well these beliefs are clear shirk and Kufr and we have no association with them, rather we believe in tawheed.”</em> Then we advise them to warn from these clear statements of shirk and misguidance and warn against the people who uttered these statements. Warning against Shirk and calling to Tawheed is the duty of every Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many innocent Muslims who call themselves bareilwees and deobandees, or sympathise with such ideologies are in essence totally unaware of the real beliefs of the founders of these 2 sub continent sects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book serves to highlight the beliefs of both sects and hence show to the reader that things are ­really not that black and white as these 2 sects have been claiming. Shaikh ­Taalib ur Rehmaan (Hafidahullaah) has brought statements from both sects ­of a corrupt belief side by side, showing the manifest similarities between these 2 sects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In his last conversation with the brothers just before Ramadhaan 1432H, Shaikh Taalib ur Rehmaan strongly advised them to print the book knowing they had translated the book 10 years peviously with his full support and encouragment. The Shaikh also encouraged them to translate other beneficial works and praised them for their extended efforts against the people of innovation and misguidance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly we hope this publication serves to aid the people in ­understanding the correct and clear meaning of Islaam, believing in the Oneness of Allaah and purifying themselves from Shirk and Kufr. Furthermore believing in ­Muhammad (r) as the final Messenger and following him in every way and abandoning abhorent taqleed. Ameen</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an E-Book publication, it can be downloaded in PDF format or alternatively read online.</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Authors introduction</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After writing <em>al-Deobandiyyah</em> I thought it would be beneficial to summarise it, making it easily readible for the average person. I also wanted to further mention some of the beliefs of the Deobandees that I was not able to mention in al-Deobandiyyah. This is the reason that led to me ­write the book, ‘Aqaa’id Ulama Deoband.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However after writing <em>‘Aqaa’id Ulama Deoband’ </em>I thought why not compare the beliefs of the scholars of Deoband with the scholars of Bareilee. So the reader does not have any difficulty in understanding, that the very reason verdicts of shirk and kufr are uttered at the bareilwees for adopting such beliefs, are infact also the beliefs of the scholars of Deoband.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In other words it is totally unfair and synonymously unjust in saying one sect is mushrik (associating deities in the worship of Allaah) whilst the other is muwahhid (believes in the Oneness of Allaah) when both sects uphold the same beliefs and doctrines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore in this book I have only mentioned the beliefs of both sects which are the same. Infact at certain times even the wording and incidences are similar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So if on the basis of these beliefs it is impemissible to pray behind the bareilwees and incorrect to maintain family ties, then what kind of justice is it to pray behind the deobandees and maintain family ties with them? Please think before you do certain actions as they can take you towards the Hellfire instead of Paradise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Usaamah Sayyid Taalib ur Rehmaan</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Aqeedah of Wahdatul Wajood (ie Allaah is incarnate in everything) that Allaah Came To This Earth as Muhammad (r)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan wrote, <em>“lift the veils and show us your might, as the Noor of Allaah is veiled”</em> (Hadaaiq Bakhshish 1/80)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Muhammad Yaar Gharhee wrote, <em>“The one who used blow the flute all the time and say I am the slave, will come out on Gods throne and say ana inallaah (for I am Allaah)</em> (Deewaan Muhammadi pg.149)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Khawaja Ghulaam Fareed wrote, <em>“Ahmad (a name of the Messenger of ­Allaah) </em>(r)<em> to Ahad (ie the one Allaah) there is no difference as there is no ­attribute of oneness.”</em> (Kaafee no.99 pg.90)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah (the famous author of Fadhail Amaal) said whilst ­presenting the poetry of Qaasim Nanautwee, <em>“Remained the veil of being a man on your grandeur, we do not know who is what in the part of the veil”</em> (Tableegi Nisaab pg.810)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Zakariyyah writes about the very famous proponent of ­wahdatul ­wajood, Mansoor Hallaaj, <em>“And mansoor was hanged just on the basis of leaving ­etiquettes, his saying of annal-Haqq (I am the truth) was the Haqq (ie the truth) but one word too blasphemous.”</em> (Walee Kaamil pg.279)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> The close Soofee disciple of Zakariyyah, Soofee Iqbal writes <em>“Love, the loved and the lover say it as one, and so the oneness was explained.” </em>(Muhabbat pg.70)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Attributes Of Allaah Are Exclusive For Him And Even Messenger of Allaah (r) Cannot Have Them.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan writes, <em>“The enlightened one and the leader of the Helpers (ie Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee) is the complete inheritor, representative and a reflection of the essence of the Messenger of Allaah </em>(r)<em> in terms of all of his ­attributes, his grandeur, his might and his virtues, in the same ­manner Allaah is with all of his attributes and might that he reflected himself in ­Muhammad </em>(r)<em>” </em>(Fatwaa Ifreeqiyyah pg.101)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah writes, <em>“Allaah, the truth who is an encompassment of every grandeur and goodness then in reality there is none other than his ­grandeur.” </em>(Tableegi Nisaab pg.300)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Maulana Rasheed Ahmad Gangohee said, <em>“Sayyid Sahib had the attributes of the almighty incarnated in him.”</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.185)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Ashraf Alee Thanwee writes, <em>“The one who is complete has a position called Abul-Waqt and when he wishes to have Allaahs attributes to be incarnated in him he can do so. it is not strange that Shaah Sahib may have had attribute of al-Jabbar incarnated in him at that time and from his position of mazhariyyat he may have resolved it by this attention.”</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.68)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[3]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Mankind Can Only Claim to be the Worshipper of Allaah and Nothing Else As This Is Shirk.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan named himself as Abdul Mustafa (ie the worshipping slave of the Messenger Of Allaah (r) (Man Huwa Ahmad Raza pg.16 of Shujaat ­Qadiree)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haajee Imdaadullah Muhaajar Makkee writes, <em>“As the Messenger of Allaah </em>(r) <em>is the truth you can call the worshipping slave of Allaah the ­worshipping slave of the Messenger.” </em>(Shamaa’im Imdaadiyyah 2/71)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Manzoor Numaanee said about Shah Abdur Rasool that he was from the well known Auliyaas of Muhammad Mian.(Monthly ­al-Furqaan Shaikh ul Hadeeth no pg.66)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> </strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [4]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Only Allaah Alone Can Help And No Prophet Or Holy Person Can Help.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan writes, <em>“Seeking help and assistance from the prophets, Auliyaa and righteous scholars is permissible even after their deaths as the Auliyaa even after their deaths, have power and rights to help in this world.” </em>(Risaalah Hayaatal-Mawaat of Ahmad Raza Khan, from Fataawa Ridhwiyyah 4/300)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Another Bareilwee scholar said, <em>“The power and rights to help of the Auliyaa increase after their deaths”</em> (Fataawa Naeemiyyah pg.249)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maulana Ahsan Gheelanee writes, <em>“We do not deny or reject seeking help from the souls of the Auliyaa, hence so if a believer ­inflicted with troubles seeks help from good souls then what verse of the Quraan or Hadeeth refutes this.”</em> (Haashiyah Suwaaneh Qaasimee 1/332)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> The deobandee author Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah writes, <em>“The scholars of Deoband never say that no one other than Allaah can have knowledge of the unseen and similarly they also do not believe and accept that a man during his life or even after his death has no power to help.”</em> (Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah pg.101)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> In another place he writes, <em>“Every man whether in this world or in the state or barzakh needs the permission of Allaah and his spirituality. Up until there is permission some souls who are in the state of barzakh help the people, who are from this world and tell them some things.”</em> (Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah pg.152)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> the Deobandee author of Inkishaaf writes, <em>“The friendship of Allah and the miracles of the Auliyaa remain after their deaths with the permission of Allah and so with regards to this just understand that souls of the auliya can also come to this world with the permission of Allaah and can help the people with the command of Allaah.”</em> (Inkishaaf pg.67).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ayoob Ridhwi writes about Ahmad Raza Khan,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The remover of the  problems of the creation Ahmad Raza,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>He is my helper of calamities Ahmad Raza</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>in both abodes it is your protection</em></span></p>

A young boy used to live with us and it was well known that he had the power of Kashf (ie he could see apparitions) of both Paradise and Hell but I had reservations about this. One day we were eating and all of a sudden he started to scream and began to breath erratically and said my mother is being burnt in the Hellfire, I can see her.” Qurtubee said I was seeing his anxiety and thought I should transfer a set of 70,000 kalimahs to his mother and at the same time see if he is telling the truth about having the ability to see apparitions. So I transferred the kalimah to his mother and I did this inherently in my heart so no one knew of this except Allaah. The boy said, “Oh uncle my mother ie being removed from the Hellfire.” So I benefitted from this incident in 2 ways, firstly the benefit of the recitation of the kalimah 70,000 times as I saw an incident myself first hand and secondly the truth about the boy having the ability to see apparitions”</em> (Fadhail Tableegi Nisaab pg.576)</span></p>

During this time whilst I was standing I began to tremble and my body began to move as if I was in a fit. I fell down and screamed loudly, I felt powerless. At this instance I woke up but I was still very weak. Even after I woke up I was still thinking of the Shaikh (ie Ashraf Alee) and when I remembered my mistake regarding the kalimah I intended to remove this thought so that I don’t make such a mistake again. So I sat up and turned and lay on my other side and began to send salutations upon the Prophet but still I kept on saying, Allaahuma Sallee Ala Sayyidana Wa Nabiyina Maulana Ashraf Alee, whereas now I was awake and was not dreaming and yet again it was uncontrollable and as if I was forced and had no control over my tongue. Similar thoughts remained in my mind the same day. The next day my body kept on moving uncontrollably as if I was in a fit and I cried a lot. Even now there are many reasons why I love the Shaikh so much, how can I mention everything.”</em> (Risaalah al-Imdaad pg.35)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Ashraf Alee Thanwee instead of saying to his disciple to remove this thought from his mind and repent to Allaah he gives the following encouraging answer, <em>“Answer: This incident contain reassurance that the one who you refer to is by Allaah a follower of the Sunnah”</em> (24<sup>th</sup> Shawwaal 1335H, Risaalah al-Imdaad pg.35)</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[18]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Prophet Was Created From Noor</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan mentions a self formulated narration, <em>“The Messenger of Allaah </em>(r)<em> said to Jaabir </em>(t)<em>, Without doubt and with certainty Allaah created the noor of your Prophet from his own noor before he created any of the creation. Then that noor remained in oblivion and at that time, the Lauh (the tablet) the Pen, Paradise, Hell, Angels, the Heavens, the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the Jinn and mankind were not created. When Allaah wished to create the creation he divided that noor into 4 parts. He created the Pen with the first, the Lauh with the second, the Arsh with the third and divided the 4th part into further 4 parts.”</em> (Risaalah Salah as-Safaa pg.23)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A bareilwee scholar Ahmad Yaar wrote, <em>“The Messenger </em>(r) <em>was created from the Noor of Allaah and all of the creation was created with the Messengers Noor.”</em> (Muwaa’iz Na’aeemiyyah pg.14)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ashraf Alee Thanwee brings the following narration of Jaabir (t) concerning the creation of the Messenger of Allaah (r), <em>“Oh Jaabir before Allaah created anything he created your Prophets Noor from his own Noor and not in terms of meaning but his essence itself. He created him with the blessings of his Noor and then that Divine Noor roamed wherever Allaah wished. At that time there was no Lauh, Pen, Paradise, Hell, Angels, Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon, Jinn nor mankind. Then when Allaah wished to create his creation and he divided that noor into 4 parts. With one part he created the Pen, the Lauh with the second part, the Throne with the third part. This hadeeth therefore proves the Noor of Muhammad </em>(r) <em>was the first thing that was created. Similarly Alee </em>(t)<em> narrates the Prophet said, “14,000 years before the creation I (the Messenger of Allaah) was a noor with Allaah.</em>” (Nashr at-Tayyib pg.5-6)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[19]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shirk in the Characteristics Of the Prophet (r)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan wrote, <em>“Headache and fever are those gifted illnesses that the Prophets used to suffer with. (he further goes onto say) Alhamdulillah I also suffer from regular headaches.”</em> (Malfoozaat 1/64)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Qaasim Nanautwee complained to Haajee Imdaadullah that whenever he intends to use rosary beads a trouble befalls him in that when he moves them they feel like very heavy stones and his tongue and heart constrict and feel heavy. To this Haajee Imdaadullah answered and said, <em>“This is the blessings of prophecy on your heart and this heavy constricting feeling you feel is when something is being revealed. Allaah wants from you the dawah efforts which the Prophets did for him.”</em> (Suwaaneh Qaasimee 1/258)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[20]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Who is Infallible</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdul Hakeem Qaadiree writes, <em>“A’la hazrats (ie Ahmad Raza Khan) pen and tongue were preserved from mistakes and although scholars sometimes do make some mistake however A’la hazrat did not even make a mistake of a single dot.”</em> (Yaad A’la Hazrat of Abdul Hakeem Ashraf Qadiree pg.32, <em>‘Rememberance Of A’la Haazrat’ (ie Ahmad Raza Khan)</em>)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Another bareilwee boldly said in Anwaar Raza, <em>“Allaah had purified (ie Ahmad Razas) his pen and tongue from any mistakes.”</em> (Anwaar Raza pg.271)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> The author further said, <em>“Ahmad Raza was pure from mistakes from his childhood and following the straight path was instilled into him.”</em> (Anwaar Raza pg.223)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Soofee Iqbaal writes, <em>“Whatever comes in his heart (ie Zakariyyahs) inshallaah comes from from Allaah, hence have patience.”</em> (Hadhrat Shaikh Kaa Ittibaa Sunnat aur Ishk-e-Rasool pg.111 <em>‘The Respected Shaikhs Following Of The Sunnah and Loving the Messenger’</em>)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Aashiq Ilaahee Meerthy writes, <em>“I have heard him say many a time upon his blessed tongue, “Listen the truth is that which is uttered from ­Rasheed Ahmad (Gangohees) tongue and I swear I am nothing but in this day and age guidance and salvation is lies in following me.”</em> (Tadhkiratur Rasheed 2/17)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [21]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is The Word Of Someone Other Than The Prophets Evidence</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A follower of Ahmad Raza Khan attributed prophethood to him in the following way, <em>“A’la Hazrat (ie Ahmad Raza) was Allaah’s evidence and proof on this earth.”</em>  (Anwaar Raza pg.33)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah said that Ilyaas said to me, <em>“Thanwees sayings are evidences and proofs for you and me.”</em> (Mahboob al-A’arifeen pg.30)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> In one place Mr Zakariyyah answers a question posed by a person by saying, <em>“You wrote the evidence should only be from the Quraan, Hadeeth or fiqh, as the statements of scholars will not be accepted. I say concerning this, an ­Al­laamah like yourself has the right not to take the statements of the scholars but for someone like me with little knowledge all the statements of the people of the truth and those who are trustworthy are evidence.</em>” (The Problems with the Books of Fadhail and their Answers pg.128)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [22]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Who Is The One Who is Really Disrespectful (Gustaakh) To The Prophet?</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bastawee writes, <em>“After the death of Ahmad Raza an Arab man came and said, “On the 25th of Safar in the year 1340H my destiny changed and I saw the Messenger of Allaah </em>(r)<em> in a dream. The Messenger of Allaah </em>(r)<em> has come and his companions are also waiting with him but there is a silence in the gathering and from the indicators I find out that they are waiting for someone. So I said to the Prophet </em>(r)<em>, “May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, who are you waiting for? He (the Prophet </em>(r)<em> replied, “Ahmad Raza.” I asked, “Who is Ahmad Raza.” The Prophet </em>(r) <em>replied, “A resident of bareilee in India.” After my dream I longed to meet Ahmad Raza so I went to India, Bareilee and found that Ahmad Raza was dead. It was the very same day of the 25th when I travelled and it was also the day of his death.”</em> (Bastawee pg.121, Fataawa Ridhwiyyah vol 2 Muqaddimah pg.13)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah said, <em>“I saw my dads sister when she was nearing death she shouted and said, “Hurry and make me sit up and the Prophet </em>(r)<em> is coming, then her soul left her. When my paternal grandfather Maulana Ismaa’eel died there was a crowd for 3 and a half miles from Nizaam ud Deen to Delhi. A man who had the ability to see apparitions saw that Maulana Ismaa’eel said, “Bury me quickly as I am very embarassed because the prophet is waiting for me with his companions.”</em> (Maulana Ilyaas and his Religious Dawah pg.48)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000080;"> [23]</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Who Disrespects The Companions?</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The one who disrespected the companions by saying the following about Ahmad Raza Khaan, <em>“Seeing A’la hazrat decreased my yearning to see the companions.”</em> (Wasayaa Shareef pg.24)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Munshee Muhammad Eesaa mentions the statement of Mr Thanwee concerning Mr Zakariyyah and his group, “(then Mr Thanwee) addressed the gathering and said, <em>“If anyone wants to see how the prophets companions were, then look at these people.”</em> (Tablighi Tahreek Kee Ibtidaa Aur Iske Bunyaadee Usool pg.51 <em>‘The Beginning Of the Tableeghi Movement &amp; Its Fundamental Principles’</em>)</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You often hear the Rafidhah Shee’ah, Soofees and Bareilwis saying Yaa Alee Madat ie Oh Alee help <span id="more-1231"></span>at the times of need or help and this is clear shirk, and Ahlul Bidah, ie the people of innovation and misguidance believe in this and this is what they promote. What is interesting the soofee bareilwis believe in saying yaa alee madat so much that it is rampant amongst them and its link and strong association with the Rafidhah Shee’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once Shaikh Badee ud deen Shaah ar-Raashidee as-Sindhee was delivering a lecture and a man came and started staring at Shaikh Badee ud deen and he continued to stare for a while and then he shouted the following words to Shaikh Badee ud deen</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Yaa Alee Madat (Oh ALee Help)”</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The man was expecting some sort of nice reaction or some level of defence from Shaikh Badee ud deen however the shaikh quickly unhesitantly answered,</span></p>
