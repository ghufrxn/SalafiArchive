				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated And Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>First Published 2004</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is the Shaikh al-Imaam al-Haafidh al-Hujjah Abul A’la Muhammad Abdur- Rahmaan ibn Allaamah al-Haafidh al-Haaj ash-Shaikh Abdur-Raheem ibn al-Haaj ash-Shaikh Bahaadur al-Mubaarakpooree.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the Aalim and the jurist, an ocean of knowledge and the Imaam in the sciences of hadeeth and Ilmul-Rijaal. He was an expert in narrations and extracting and interpolating from them as well as being one of a kind in mastering the other sciences. He had a strong memory and his preservation of hadeeth was of a remarkable standard. His research and investigation concerning hadeeth and its related sciences was deep and unique.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had great expertise and was a specialist in the knowledge of hadeeth, Asmaa ur- Rijaal, Jarh Wat-Ta’deel, the tabaqaat of the narrators and scholars of hadeeth, the referencing of hadeeth and their various chains of transmissions. He achieved a great status in the Illal of hadeeth and became known for it. His deep constant and continuous research gave him the status of the possessor of amazing attributes in Ilmul-Hadeeth. He was a Hadeeth Master, He was one of a kind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had exemplary manners with desirable characteristics and all the scholars of his time remember him with these attributes. He was soft hearted and compassionate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Imaam of Ahlul-Hadeeth was born in 1283H (1867ce) in Mubaarakpoor, the district of A’dhamgardh and A’dhamgardh is a city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradessh.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Teachers. </strong></span></h4>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Abdur-Raheem Mubaarakpooree (His father)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Khudaa Baksh A’dhamgardhee</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Saleem Faraahee</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Faidhullaah Mu’ee</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Salamatullaah Jaeraajpooree</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Farooq Charyakautee</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Haafidh Abdullaah Ghaazeepooree</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdur-Rahmaan Jaeraajpooree</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Qaadhee Muhammad bin Abdul-Azeez Machleeshehree</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Mian Muhammad Nazeer Dehlawee</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin al-Ansaari al-Yamaanee.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And others. All of them were Imaams and hadeeth master in their own rights</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After completing his studies with his various teachers he started to teach and lecture and he started in his area of Mubaarakpoor where he established a small institute, Daar ut-Ta’leem. After teaching in Mubaarakpoor for a number of years he went to Balraampoor and set up another institute ‘Madrassah Arabiyyah’, where he taught for some time, delivering lectures and more importantly started to explain and teach the Prophetic Ahadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter he traveled to Allaahnagar and taught there for a short while and then moved onto to Ghaundah and taught in the institute, Siraaj al-Uloom where he spent a fair amount of time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After this Muhaddith Mubaarakpooree’s teacher, Haafidh Abdullaah Muhaddith Ghaazeepooree (d.1337H) invited the Muhaddith to teach in the well-known and established Madrassah, Madarassah Ahmadiyyah Araah. The Muhaddith spent a long time under his Shaikh in teaching at this institute.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst teaching the Prophets ahadeeth, explaining them, writing concerning them, delivery lectures on specialist fields and sciences of hadeeth he became known and Allaah Jallo Wa A’la raised his status and he became known to the world as Muhaddith Mubaarakpooree.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst teaching at Madrassah Ahmadiyyah he was invited to teach ahadeeth in Calcutta at the institute of Daar ul-Qur’aan Was-Sunnah, so upon seeking permission from his Shaikh Haafidh Abdullaah Ghaazeepooree, he traveled to Calcutta.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Traveling to Calcutta was the Muhaddith’s last journey to teach at an institute and after this he did not teach at any institute. After this the Muhaddith occupied himself with research and writing.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Students. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Most of the Shaikhs life was spent in teaching ahadeeth and spreading the Sunnah to hundreds of students whom he taught at the various institutions he taught at. So the list of the number of his students runs into hundreds but from them those who shone and became well known due to their ilm and spreading the Ahadeeth Was-</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sunnah were,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh al-Imaam Abdus-Salaam Mubaarakpooree. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous teacher of hadeeth and the author of the great and manifest work on the life and works of Imaam Muhammad bin Ismaa’eel al-Bukhaari titled Seerah al- Bukhaari. The Shaikh left behind 3 sons, all Shaikhs and Scholars of hadeeth in their own right, from them, Shaikh Ubaid ur-Rehmaan Taalib Rehmaanee and the Imaam Shaikh Ubaidullaah Rehmaanee Mubaarakpooree. (see next)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Shaikh, the Allaamah, the Imaam Shaikh ul-Hadeeth Ubaidullaah Rehmaanee bin Abdus-Salaam Mubaarakpooree</span>.<br />
</strong>The Imaam of Hadeeth of his time and from the Ahlul-Hadeeth scholars of his time. He had a special relationship with Imaam al-Muhaddith Abdur-Rahmaan al- Mubaarakpooree as will be mentioned later. The Shaikh taught hadeeth all his life in Jaami’a Rehmaaniyyah and in Mubaarakpoor. The Shaikh also authored the renowned explanation of Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh titled ‘Mir’ah al-Mafaateeh Sharh Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh.’ The Shaikh Rahimahullah started his explanation in 1950 and completed it in 10 large volumes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Hakeem Muhammad Asghar Mubaarakpooree. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the nephew of the Shaikh. He would stay in the company of his uncle and constantly learn from him and after completing his studies he taught in the first institution Muhaddith Mubaarakpooree set up in Mubaarakpoor, Daar ut-Ta’leem. Shaikh Asghar Mubaarakpooree taught at this institute all his life up until he died.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Abdus-Samad Hussainabaadee. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdus-Samad received his primary education from Shaikh Asghar Mubaarakpooree and went onto learn from Muhaddith Mubaarakpooree. He went on to teach at some of the well-known Ahlul-Hadeeth institutes. Shaikh Abdus- Samad was a scholar of hadeeth in his own right and was a strong author and authored many works related to Hadeeth and its intricate sciences. He also had a special relationship with the Muhaddith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Abdul-Jabbaar Khandailwee </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul-Jabbaar was also from the well-known and famous Ahlul-Hadeeth scholars. He spent all his life teaching and educating the people. He spent almost half a century teaching hadeeth, tafseer and fiqh. The Shaikh left many students who were also major scholars. The Shaikh also authored a number of books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Doctor Shaikh Taqee ud deen al-Hilaalee al-Marakeshee. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Taqee ud deen Hilaalee was the Professor of Arabic in Nadwatul-Ulama. He also learnt from the Muhaddith, he learnt and studied hadeeth and Fiqhul-Hadeeth from him. He died in 1983 in Morocco.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And many many more.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Works and Books. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Without doubt the Shaikh was a prolific writer. His manner of writing and his extraction of the evidences and then presenting them in the way he did, is such that the reader is astonished at his strength and power of deduction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a mujtahid and a master of hadeeth. His mastery over hadeeth and its sciences is evident from his works and one also comes to know his expertise and specialty in this field.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muhaddith helped the Allaamah the Muhaddith Shams ul-Haqq Dhiyaanwee A’dheemabaadee in authoring ‘Au’n al-Ma’bood Sharh Sunan Abee Dawood’ for a period of approximately 4 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh wrote a number of books but from all of them the one most famous and accepted with all people and Scholars is,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Tuhfatul-Ahwadhee Sharh Jaam’e at-Tirmidhee. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muhaddith completed an explanation of Imaam Tirmidhee’s Jaam’e at- Tirmidhee in 4 volumes. This Sharh is one of is kind and has without doubt superiority over all other explanations of Sunan Tirmidhee. Imaam Ubaidullaah Mubaarakpooree mentions the reasons for this and wrtes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Shaikh Abul-A’la Allaamah Abdur-Rahmaan Mubaarakpooree, the important and necessary issues he has included and mentioned in this illustrious explanation, then all of them will not be found in any other explanation. This is not the place for its details but we will mentions some of them in brevity,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The biography of every narrator of Jaam’e at-Tirmidhee has been included due to the need and in the Muqaddimah an alphabetical index has also been included. The biography of any narrator, on whatever page it is on in the explanation has been indicated with a sign.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">All the ahadeeth in Jaam’e at-Tirmidhee have been referenced. Ie the other scholars of hadeeth who have also transmitted the ahadeeth that are in Tirmidhee, in their books have also been referenced to those books.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Ahadeeth that Imaam Tirmidhee has indicated under the statement “In this Chapter&#8230;” have been referenced in detail and in most places their wording has also been mentioned as well as the referencing of other ahadeeth.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Tasaahil of Imaam Tirmidhee in declaring Ahadeeth to be Saheeh or Hasan is well known and that is why the statements of other Scholars of Hadeeth have also been mentioned and the ahadeeth in which Imaam Tirmidhee has illustrated his Tasaahil, have been clarified.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A special attention has been given to problematic texts and chains and resolving and clarifying them</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Much work is done in explaining and clarifying points from the ahadeeth. The bigoted muqallideen and the people of desires who have figuratively explained and distorted the ahadeeth to make their madhab stronger have also been refuted and their false interpretations exposed. With this the correct meanings of the ahadeeth and the issues from them which were established and understood by the Salaf us-Saaliheen, the scholars of hadeeth and the jurists have been mentioned.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">In mentioning the differences between madhab’s their evidences have also been mentioned and after this the correct and the position with precedence has been mentioned and then further supported with evidence aswell as thoroughly answering the evidences of the other madhabs.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The work Aathaar as-Sunan (of Shauq Nimawee) has also been thoroughly answered.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">un-necessary discussions have been left out in Tuhfah and the main text of the book has been concentrated on in terms of explanation and clarification.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All the scholars from around the world, from the time Tuhfah was published up until today have praised Tuhfah and said it is one of a kind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ubaidullaah Mubaarakpooree said, “This is the best explanation of Jaam’e at- Tirmidhee up until this time of the face of this earth and there is none similar to it.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As mentioned earlier Tuhfah was originally printed in 4 volumes and upon completing two volumes, Imaams Mubaarakpooree’s eyesight became weak. So to help him complete this monumental work he enlisted the help of Shaikh ul-Hadeeth Ubaidullaah Mubaarakpooree Rehmaanee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Muqaddimah Tuhfatul-Ahwadhee </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muhaddith also wrote a 2 volume Muqaddimah to Tuhfah. In it he included discussions on the sciences of hadeeth, the books of hadeeth and statements and opinions regarding the Imaams of Hadeeth as well as other important issues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the second volume he mentioned issues concerning Imaam Tirmidhee, his biography, sciences related to his book that are very important for the one studying Jaam’e at-Tirmidhee. Also throughout the 2 volumes the Muhaddith included the biographies of approximately 155 Scholars and Imaams of Hadeeth, Tafaseer, Fiqh and Lughah as well as having a detailed index.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muhaddith whilst writing this remarkable Muqaddimah passed away and therefore leaving it incomplete, and so one of the illustrious students of the Muhaddith, Shaikh Abdus-Samad Hussainabaadee completed it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Tahqeeq al-Kalaam Fee Wajoob al-Qiraa’h Khalf al-Imaam </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book again is unique and one of its kind. In it the Muhaddith answered all the evidences of the ahnaaf comprehensively. It is 2 volumes. Recently Shaikh Waseeullaah Abbaasee translated this book into Arabic, which is now available from Saudia.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abkaar al-Manan Fee Tanqeed Aathaar as-Sunan. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treatise was a direct answer to Shaikh Zaheer Ahsan Shauq an-Nimawee’s book Aathaar as-Sunan. Nimawee wrote his Aathaar as-Sunan based upon the method of Haafidh Ibn Hajr, which he used to write Buloogh al-Maraam and Nimawee in doing so attempted to answer Buloogh al-Maraam and have a counterpart for it for the Hanafee’s. So Muhaddith Mubaarakpooree answered this aswell as the follow ups of Nimawee which he wrote to his Aathaar as-Sunan in Abkaar and in Tuhfah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His other books include,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shifaa al-Ghillal Fee Sharh Kitaab al-Illal. This is printed with Tuhfah and his an explanation of Imaam Tirmidhee’s Kitaab al-Illal</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Noor al-Absaar and its 2 follow ups Tanweer al-Absaar and Dhiyaa al-Absaar.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Kitaab ul-Janaa’iz.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Khair al-Ma’aoon Fee Man’a al-Faraar Minat-Taa’oon and a follow up to this.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Maqaalah al-Husnaa Fee Suniyyah al-Musaafahah Bal-Yad al-Yumnaa and a follow up to this.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">and this book in your hands, al-Qaul as-Sadeed Feemaa Yata’alaq Bi- Takbeeraat al-Eed.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And others</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muhaddith died on the 16 of Shawwaal in 1353H (1925) in Mubaarakpoor. The historians wrote there were so many people at his funeral that all the train stations leading into Mubaarakpoor were all filled with people wanting to pray his funeral prayer. The historians also wrote individuals from the other sects and groups also came to pray his funeral prayer. May Allaah grant him Jannatul-Firdaus. Ameen.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This slave a follower of the hanafi deobandis, after graduating from Dar al-Uloom Deoband remained upon this methodology for a very long time and after some lengthy research adopted the methodology of the people of Hadeeth in 1966 and I also announced this in the newspapers, so a lot of people have asked why I did this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In answer to this question I have written the following and I have mentioned the various stages in my life I went through in order to reach this conclusion and deem it necessary to mention that as far as methodologies are concerned then the methodology of the people of Hadeeth is infact the correct methodology.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The methodology of the people of Hadeeth is not to accept anything unless it does not conform to the Quraan and Hadeeth and even if the statement of a major scholar contradicts the Quraan or Hadeeth it is not to be accepted. We do not consider any scholar as evidence in comparison to Allaah and his Messenger nor do we consider any scholars personal opinion to be part of the Islamic Law. Even the statements of the companions are to be accepted which are in accordance with the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of of the Messenger of Allaah, so this is my methodology.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The First Period Of My Life</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">I was born into a farmers family and when I was of a responsible age I learnt the following 3 points of belief from my father and from the environment around me that 1 Allaah is the creator and no one is equal to him. 2 Muhammad sallalhu alayhi wasallam  is our messenger and we are from his nation. 3 Allaah will resurrect us again after death and take account of our deeds and either send us to Heaven or Hell.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly I also upheld the belief that we are Hanafis and our methodology is the hanafi school of thought ie we were the followers of Imaam Abu Hanifa. At that time and age one does not possess the the capability of criticism nor does any person like criticism on their inherited beliefs. So similarly I also adopted these beliefs as I had inherited them and accepted them and developed a likeness for them in my heart and it is these beliefs that one has which he accepts that make him a Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We tend to recite the wording of the first kalimah as a means of seeking blessing or for reward but we do not understand the meaning of the words at all, so similarly I also would as norm recite the kalimah for seeking reward without paying any attention to the meaning. After a short period I left home to seek knowledge and learnt numerous sciences and principles from many teachers, i learn subjects such as grammar, syntax, logical reasoning, philosophy, jurisprudence, the principles of jurisprudence andso on.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst learning these various subjects I would ask my teachers the purpose of learning these various sciences and they would always say to me so that a person can understand the Quraan and Hadeeth so in essence these sciences were being learnt and acquired to understand the Quraan and Hadeeth. I would always say to my teachers why don’t you teach us the Quraan and Hadeeth along with these other sciences and every time they would say we will teach you Hadeeth in the last year after you have finished learning all of these sciences and in this way you will also learn the Quraan and Hadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was the first incidence that jolted my heart but this was temporary which came in my heart and went and my teachers were not to blame in this as this was the system that was thought throughout that era for a number of centuries which was formulated by Mulla Nizaam ud deen and hence it was was called Dars Nizaami. Apart from the Ahlul Hadeeth, the Sunnis, Shia, Bareilwi, Deobandis have always been learning and teaching this curriculum so my teachers did the same they just learnt and taught this curriculum.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of my teachers were of great calibre and were well known and from their teachings Allaah granted me the wealth of knowledge and I will always pray for them and they taught me the knowledge they educated me with the mindset that the knowledge I had gained was a trust and I should in turn teach the people. So after spending 10 years seeking knowledge in the first part of my life I spend the following 20 teaching and educating the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Second Period</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">When the last year of my study was upon me and I had to learn Hadeeth and in order to seek this I went to India and learnt Hadeeth from the major Deobandi scholars, which included Shaikh Shabeer Ahmad Uthmani who had attained the title of Shaikh of Islam in Pakistan. These scholars had undoubtedly unquestionable knowledge but their method of teaching and providing knowledge was exactly the same as the customary and inherited manner in which the Hanafis had been doing this for centuries. Whilst seeking knowledge of Hadeeth I encountered 2 very heart affecting points, first that the Hadeeth we were taught were from the 6 books of Hadeeth ie Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Saheeh Muslim, Sunan Abu Dawood, Sunan Tirmidhee, Sunan Nasaee and Sunan Ibn Majah but none of the authors of these books were the followers (Muqallid) of any Imaam or Hanafi. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This point was very heavy on my heart that none of these scholars of Hadeeth who were the collectors of Hadeeth were hanafi and no book of any hanafi scholar was in our curriculum in reference to Hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah sallalhu alayhi wasallam. The second point that really affected my heart was that our teachers would spend year in year out figuratively explaining away the Hadeeth which contradicted the hanafi school of thought, so much so their lectures and talks would last days and or months in reference to particular Hadeeth and the students would learn this and take notes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However for a student who had studied and learnt all the sciences by understanding them this was nothing but mere wrong explanations. I remember we used to a have a Shaafiee student who was from the island of Malabaar and he would say our teachers are trying to prove their issues and points with fists and punches rather than evidences. This was true as some of our teachers would do this and whilst teaching us they would frenzy in punches in anger, I could not resist but get affected by this. Over this period I would question issues of jurisprudence and the hanafi scholars would detest this but any truth seeking or educated individual liked this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Third Period</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">During my 20 years of teaching the meaning of the Quraan and Hadeeth I taught the book Hadeeth titled mishkaat, because both of these topics were not part of the curriculum and students were very sincere they would appreciate what I used to do for them. After the partition the students became very upset and they would go up and down the country bad mouthing me saying that I was of a strong character and would speak bad about me. They would say that I teach them the meaning of the Quraan and Hadeeth forcefully when I started to hear such accusations about me I became very withdrawn thinking that these people read and like to learn the sciences of men more than the word of Allaah and his messenger and they would be very disillusioned with this what were worse or would be no point in teaching these people to be scholars and what would I get in turn by teaching these people because I would not be teaching for the worldly goods only for the sake of seeking the pleasure of Allaah. So when this was the affair by teaching these people the word of Allaah and his messengers Hadeeth in order to make these people in Scholars then it would be more better not to teach these people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Fourth Period</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">The fourth issue that occurred was that the general teaching in institutes was made into a business and the people teaching also desired seeking the world. So with this a controversial issue occurred in the city of the Faisalabaad in 1923 related to the issue of the Taraweeh prayer I remember very clearly there was a lecture in the Ahlul Hadeeth mosque situated in Montgomery bazaar and the esteemed Shaikh and leader of the debators Ahmad Deen Ghakarwee and the head of the debators Hafidh Abdul Qaadir Rauporee issued a challenge that if any hanafi scholar wants to prove the issue of 20 rakah Taraweeh and then we are ready for a debate 2 students from my institute wrote a letter to them saying we are ready for a debate and then they came to me and said to me that you need to debate and I said issues are not established with debates rather I would be writing a short treatise on the issue of the Taraweeh prayer. Then I decided to write the treatise and because like the hanafee teachers of the other institutes I was an expert on the other sciences I lacked in the science of Hadeeth as I was not taught it and hence had no expertise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In order to get the material for the treatise I went to Shaikh Sarfraz Khan in Ghakar as he had already authored number of books on differing issues with the Ahlul Hadeeth. He presented me with 2 narrations relating to 20 rakahs, the first the narration from Muwatta Imaam Maalik in which the people would pray 20 rakahs during the time of Umar and as it was a narration from Muwatta it was established. The second narration he presented was from Sunan Baihaqee that the 3 nights in which the Messenger of Allaah led the people in the prayer of the Taraweeh was 20 rakahs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sarfraz himself said this narration contains a person by the name of Abu Shaybah and the Ahlul Hadeeth say he is weak but in the book of the narrators, Meezaan ul-Eitidaal Imaam Bukhaari did not declare this narrator to be weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then he took out the statement from Meezaan ul-Eitidaal and showed me and made me write it. The statement was that the author wrote after talking about Abu Shaybah wrote “Bukhaari remained silent upon him” and so Shaikh Sarfraz said that so this means Bukhaari did not criticise this narrator and when Imaam Bukhaari did criticise any narrator then the criticisms of other Scholars are not as weighty as his statement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So I returned and wrote and published the treatise and also added the above statement from Meezaan ul-Eitidaal then a poster was published by an Ahlul Hadeeth Scholar in response that if Abdur Rahman (ie me) can prove that Imaam Bukhaari did not declare Abu Shaybah to be weak then I will reward him with 1000 rupees.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When I received this poster I was dumb founded and extremely amazed because I had seen the statement of Imaam Bukhaari myself in Meezaan ul-Eitidaal then why the need for this challenge so I thought maybe when I copied the statement I might have made a mistake or omitted something. In the state of having a fast I travelled to Lahore and bought Meezaan ul-Eitidaal for 200 rupees.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When I examined the statement in the book it was correct and I had also copied it correctly nor were there any additional notes that I had forgot to add. My amazement and astonishment increased further so I returned to Faisalabaad and began to read the introduction of Meezaan ul-Eitidaal and I found a principle as it was stated that when the wording “Bukhaari remained silent upon him” comes in relation to a chain of Hadeeth then it means that Imaam Bukhaari and other scholars of Hadeeth declare the narrator to be very weak and do not consider him to be even worthy that something be discussed about him nor the need to mention the criticism concerning him as he is so weak. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the meaning of the statement of Imaam Bukhaari that he never even wanted to talk about such a narrator. When I came to realise the reality of this point I wrote to Shaikh Sarfraz telling him it is not the sign of a learned person to abandon honesty for the sake of bigotry for ones madhab but he never wrote a reply back. After a long period of time we met and he said to me in such issues of difference the reality is the Hadeeth contradict the hanafi madhab and hence we need to use the support of such weak points.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This affected my mentally very severely and it saddened me that we had succumbed to such methods in the issue for the religion as these methods and actions are exactly like the jewish scholars. Based on these circumstances I decided to abstain from teaching and withdraw myself and abandoned the blind following mentality and started to read around other Madhabs aswell as the various Islamic sects. I also started to read more around general history and especially Islamic history and made my mind up to understand the Quraan and Hadeeth without any narrow mindedness. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After a number of years of research I came to the conclusion that the issues in which the Muslims differ in the truth and correct way is that which is found in the Quraan and Hadeeth and whatever we find of it is to be accepted and anything other than that from the way of the statements of mankind should be reconciled with the Quraan and Hadeeth. Whatever is found to be in accordance with the Quraan and Hadeeth that should be accepted and whatever is contradictory should be rejected as no one is infallible other than the messenger of Allaah and so then why should be follow those who are fallible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Finally I Became Ahlul Hadeeth</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Now I only had two choices the first was to adopt a madhab of Taqleed which I would have to  follow and agree with the hanafi fiqh points and then consider and understand them to be the command of Allaah. The second choice I had was that of researching madhab meaning that I would learn to accept the Quraan and Hadeeth as the word of Allaah and then act upon them. So based on honesty and decent I adopted the second choice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The second way is the way of the people of Hadeeth who do not believe in following a small group of scholars but rather follow the Quraan and Hadeeth. So I openly announced to the people that I had become an Ahlul Hadeeth and in due course I authored several treatises on various issues so that Allaah guides others too. I would like to add the purposes of this treatise is also for the sake of Allaah and so that the Muslims follow the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah sallalhu alayhi wasallam. All a praise be to Allaah many people have accepted the correct methodology due to my dawah efforts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I request all readers to abandon any form of bigotry and prejudices and research the methodology of the people of Hadeeth which is based just on the Quraan and Hadeeth. May Allaah aid us in understanding the religion and correctly acting upon it. Ameen.</span></p>
