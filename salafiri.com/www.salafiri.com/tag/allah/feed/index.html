<h3><span style="color: #000080">An Introduction to the Treatise</span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify">Origin<strong><br />
</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">This treatise is found in Kitab Al-Kawakib Ad-Darari of Imam Ibn &#8216;Urwah, Volume 39 across six pages in Darul Kutub Adh-Dhahariyyah, and in Markaz Makhtutat w&#8217;at-Turath Kuwait #5/12811, and its chain of narration to the author is authentic, every narrator is a trustworthy Imam.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify">Narrators</h4>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify">&#8216;Ali bin Husayn bin &#8216;Urwah Abu&#8217;l Hasan Ad-Dimashqi, he was born in the year 760H, Ibn Muflih said regarding him, &#8220;The Shaykh, the &#8216;Aalim, the Pious, the Role-Model &#8211; he arranged the Musnad (of Imam Ahmad) in accordance to the chapters of Al-Bukhari, and he named it Al-Kawakib Ad-Darari Fi Tartib Musnad Al-Imam Ahmad &#8216;Ala Abwab Al-Bukhari, and he explained it in 120 volumes.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Yahya bin Yusuf bin Ya&#8217;qub Ar-Rahbi Ad-Dimashqi, he was born in the year 714H, and Ibn Hajar said regarding him, &#8220;He took from many of the companions of Ibn Taymiyyah, and he passed away in the year 894H.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Al-Imam Al-Hafidh Abu &#8216;Abdillah Muhammad bin Ahmad bin &#8216;Uthman Adh-Dhahabi, the author of this treatise, he was born in the year 673H, and his father was a goldsmith, hence he was known as Adh-Dhahabi. He was the great Hafidh and scholar of Hadith, author of the famous &#8216;Siyar A&#8217;lam An-Nubala&#8217; and &#8216;Tarikh Al-Islam&#8217; &#8211; well versed in the various sciences such as Aqidah, Fiqh, Hadith, History, and his Shaykhs were many, the most famous of which being Al-Hafidh Ibn Kathir, author of the famous Tafsir, may Allah have mercy on them all.</li>
</ol>
<h4>The Topic of this Treatise</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">This treatise pertains to affirming and establishing the attribute of Al-Yadayn (The Two Hands) of Allah, Exalted is He, and the author establishes these Lofty Attributes by using evidences from the Ayat of the Qur&#8217;an, Ahadith, and Athar of the Salaf As-Salih. The methodology of the Ahlul-Hadith, Ahlus-Sunnah, is to affirm these attributes without Tahrif (distortion), or Takyif (ascribing a modality to these attributes), or Tamthil or Tashbih (likening these attributes to the creation) &#8211;  The early Imams of this Ummah discussed these Lofty Attributes in their works, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">Imam At-Tirmidhi, &#8220;They (the Jahmiyyah) say: &#8216;Allah did not create Adam with His Hand&#8217;, and they say: &#8216;Verily Hand here only means power.'&#8221; <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">&#8216;Abdullah bin Zubayr Abi Bakr Imam Al-Humaydi (Student of Sufyan bin &#8216;Uyaynah), &#8220;The Sunnah with us is [&#8230;] belief in the Ru&#8217;yah (seeing Allah) after death, and what has been mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and Hadith, such as: {&#8230;and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand&#8230;} [Az-Zumar, 39:67].&#8221; <em>(Usul As-Sunnah, Musnad of Al-Humaydi)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">Imam Al-Muzani (Student of Imam Ash-Shafi&#8217;i), &#8220;&#8230;Then He created Adam with His Hand.&#8221; <em>(Sharh As-Sunnah of Imam Al-Muzani</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">Imam Harb Al-Kirmani (Student of Imam Ahmad and Ishaq bin Rahuyah), &#8220;and He (Allah) created Adam with His Hand, in His Image.&#8221; <em>(Ijma&#8217; Al-Salaf fil I&#8217;tiqad)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">Imam Ibn Abi Dawud, &#8220;and the Jahmiyyah certainly reject His Right Hand.&#8221; <em>(Al-Ha&#8217;iyyah)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">Imam Ibn Abi Zayd Al-Qayrawani, &#8220;And verily He is [able to be] heard and seen, and He Grips and Opens [His Hand], and both of His Hands are outstretched.&#8221; <em>(Al-Jami&#8217; fi&#8217;l Sunan w&#8217;al-Adab w&#8217;al-Maghazi w&#8217;at-Tarikh)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">Imam As-Sabuni said, &#8220;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">They (Ashab Al-Hadith) do not distort the Words from their proper places (meanings) by claiming the Two </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Hands</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> are only His Blessings, or His Power, [like] the distortions of the Mu&#8217;tazila Jahmiyyah, May Allāh destroy them.&#8221; <em>(Aqidah As-Salaf wa Ashab Al-Hadith)</em></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080">The Treatise (Narrations 1-25)</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Ash-Shaykh Shams Al-Din Muhammad bin Ahmad bin &#8216;Uthman Adh-Dhahabi said:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Affirming Al-Yad for Allah, Exalted is the Attribute from His Attributes</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Allah, Exalted is He, said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;What prevented you from prostrating to whom I created with both My Hands.&#8221;<br />
</strong><em>(Surah Sad, 38:75)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">And He said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;Rather! Both His Hands are outstretched.&#8221;<br />
</strong><em>(Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5:64)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">And He said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;Do they not see that We have created for them from what Our Hands have</strong> <strong>made&#8230;&#8221;<br />
</strong><em>(Surah Ya-Sin, 37:61)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">And He said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;&#8230;and the Heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand&#8230;&#8221;<br />
</strong><em>(Surah Az-Zumar, 39:67)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">And He said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;Verily, those who pledge allegiance to you are pledging allegiance to Allah, the Hand of Allah is above their hands.&#8221;<br />
</strong><em>(Surah Al-Fath, 48:10)</em></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily, Musa met Adam, so he said: &#8216;Allah created you by His Hand, and the Angels prostrated to you, so by Allah! If you had not done what you had done, not one single person from your offspring would enter the Fire!&#8217; So he replied, &#8216;O Musa! You are the one who Allah chose for His Message and to Speak with&#8230;'&#8221;¹ </strong>and he mentioned the Hadith.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Allah will fold up the Heavens on the Day of Resurrection, then He will take them by His Hand and He will say, &#8216;I am the King! Where are the Tyrants? Where are the arrogant?'&#8221;²</strong></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">&#8216;Umar bin Hamzah mentioned the previous Hadith, and he added, &#8220;I heard &#8216;Ikrimah saying: Both of the Hands of Allah are Right, so He will fold up the Heavens and take them by His Hand, then say: &#8216;I am the King!&#8217;, then he will take the Earths by His other Hand.'&#8221;³</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily when a slave gives charity from good, Allah accepts it, and takes it with His Right Hand, and grows it as one of you would raise his colt or young camel, and even if a man gives charity with a crumb, then it grows in the Hand of Allah until it becomes like Mount Uhud &#8211; so give in charity.&#8221; </strong>These Ahadith are authentic.⁴</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily the first thing that Allah created was the Pen, so He took it with His Right Hand, and both of His Hands are Right, and He wrote what is to be from the actions, righteous or immoral, [in every] moist or dry [place], so He counted them in Adh-Dhikr, then He will say: Read, If you wish: </strong><strong>&#8220;This record of Ours speaks about you with truth, Verily, We were recording what you used to do.&#8221; </strong><em>[Al-Jathiya, 45:29]</em><em><br />
</em>This is a Hasan Hadith.⁵</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;The Right Hand of Allah is full, and nothing in the night or the day (i.e., His Bounty) diminishes it, and in His other Hand is the Two Scales, He raises it and lowers it.&#8221; </strong>Agreed upon (by Bukhari and Muslim).⁶</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;The Just will be on pulpits of light on the Right of Ar-Rahman, and Both of His Hands are right &#8211; those that are just with their families and their judgements and those that they are in charge of.&#8221;</strong> Muslim narrated it.⁷</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Allah will take His Heavens and His Earths by His Hands and He will say, &#8216;I am Allah.&#8217; &#8211; And he (The Messenger of Allah) clenched his fingers and opened them &#8211; &#8216;I am The King, I am Ar-Rahman.'&#8221; </strong>And this is a Sahih Hadith.⁸</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily, on the Day of Resurrection, Allah (Mighty and Majestic) will gather the Heavens and the Earths in His Grasp, then He will say: &#8216;I am Allah.'&#8221;⁹</strong></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Allah created the Garden of Eden, and He planted its trees by His Hand, then He said to it, &#8216;Speak.&#8217; So it said, &#8216;Certainly, the believers are successful.&#8217; </strong>[Surah Al-Mu&#8217;minun, 23:1]<strong>.&#8221; </strong>Authentic.¹⁰</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, &#8220;Allah created the creation, and they were in His Grasp, so He said to those in His Hand: Enter into Jannah with peace, and He said to those in His other Hand: Enter into the Fire.&#8221; Al-Lalaka&#8217;i and Ibn Battah both narrated it through the path of &#8216;Abdur Rahman.¹¹</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Prophet ﷺ said,<strong> &#8220;Verily, Charity falls into the Hand of Allah, Exalted is He, before it falls into the hand of the recipient.&#8221; </strong>And this is authentic.¹²</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily, Allah wrote a book with His Hand, and He placed it with Him above the Throne: &#8216;Verily My Mercy has overcome My Anger.'&#8221; </strong>And this is an authentic Hadith.¹³</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Allah created the creation, and he decreed the Divine Will, then He took the People of the Right by His Right Hand, and He took the People of the Left by His Other Hand, and Both of His Hands are Right, then He Said: Am I not your Rabb?&#8230;&#8221; </strong>And this is a Hasan Hadith, Ibn Battah narrated it in Al-Ibanah.¹⁴</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Verily Allah created four things with His Hand: Adam, and the Pen, and the Garden of Eden [and the Throne], and He said for the rest of the creation: &#8216;Kun (Be)&#8217; and so it was.&#8221; More than one narrated this from &#8216;Ubayd, such as Sufyan Ath-Thawri and &#8216;Abdul Wahid Ibn Ziyad.¹⁵</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from from Mughith bin Sumi that he said, &#8220;It has reached me that verily Allah did not create anything with His Hand except three: He planted Al-Jannah with His Hand, and He created Adam with His Hand, and He wrote the Tawrah with His Hand.&#8221;¹⁶</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from from Hakim bin Jabir that he said, &#8220;I have informed you that your Rabb did not touch anything with His Hand except three: He planted Al-Jannah with His Hand, and He created Adam with His Hand, and He wrote the Tawrah with His Hand.&#8221;¹⁷</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from Sa&#8217;id bin Abi Hilal who said, &#8220;It has reached me that the first thing revealed from Allah upon Musa was: &#8216;In the Name of Allah, Ar-Rahman, Ar-Rahim, This is a book from Allah by His Hand in the Tablets for His Slave, Musa.'&#8221;¹⁸</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from &#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Yasar that he said, &#8220;The Angels said: &#8216;O Rabb! You made Bani Adam, then you made them to eat, and to drink, and to enjoy women, and you did not make any of those for us, so when you made the Dunya for them, then make the Akhirah for us.&#8217; So Allah, Mighty and Majestic, said: &#8216;I will not make the offspring of the one I made by My Hands like the one I said &#8216;Kun&#8217; (Be) for.'&#8221; ¹⁹</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And &#8216;Abdullah bin Salih narrated it from Al-Layth, from Hisham bin Sa&#8217;d, from Zayd bin Aslam, from &#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Yasar, from &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr and bin Al-&#8216;As, and this chain of narration is authentic and established, &#8216;Uthman bin Sa&#8217;id Ad-Darimi likewise narrated it from &#8216;Abdullah bin Salih.²⁰</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from Ibn &#8216;Abbas that he said, <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;The Seven Heavens and the Seven Earths are not in the Hand of Ar-Rahman, except like a </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">mustard</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> seed in the hand of one of you.&#8221;²¹</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from Wahb bin Munnabih that he said, &#8220;The creation is not in the Grasp of Allah, except like a mustard seed here in the hand of one of you.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from Ibn &#8216;Abbas that he said, &#8220;Allah wiped the back of Adam, then removed every purity with His Right Hand, and removed every impurity with His Other Hand.&#8221;²³</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it has been narrated with a Hasan chain of narration that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;The first thing Allah created was the Pen, then He took it with His Right Hand, and Both of His Hands are Right, and He wrote the Dunya and what is to occur in it.&#8221;</strong> Narrated by Baqiyyah bin Al-Walid, from Arta&#8217; bin Al-Mundhir, from Mujahid, from Ibn &#8216;Umar.²⁴</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Whoever gives the equivalent of a date from good income in charity, and Allah does not accept anything except good, then verily Allah raises it for one of you like one of you raises his colt or young camel, then it grows in the Hand of Ar-Rahman until it becomes greater than a mountain.&#8221;²⁵</strong></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Three Categories of Tawheed and Shirk &#8211; Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Aziz ibn &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Baaz Rahimahullaah</strong></p>
<p>(This is) a clarification of the categories of Tawheed, and they are three:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah (Lordship)</li>
<li>Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah (Worship)</li>
<li>and Tawheed al-Asma` was-Sifaat (Names and Attributes)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As for Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah:</strong> Then it is to believe that Allah, the Most High, is the Creator of everything, and is the Disposer of Affairs of everything, and He has no partners besides Him in that.</p>
<p><strong>And as for Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah:</strong> Then it is to believe that Allah, the Most High, is the One worshipped in truth, and He has no partners besides Him in that. And this is the meaning of Laa Ilaaha Illa Allaah, and the meaning of this is: <strong>there is no deity worshipped in truth except Allah.</strong></p>
<p>So all the acts of worship from Salaah (prayer), Sawm (fasting), and other than them, then <strong>they must be (done) sincerely for Allah alone and it is not permissible to associate, anything from these acts of worship, with anyone other than Allah.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And as for Tawheed al-Asma` was-Sifaat:</strong> Then it is to believe in everything that has been revealed in the Noble Qur’an and the authentic ahadeeth, from the names of Allah and His attributes. And affirming them for Allah alone, at the level that is befitting the Most High, <strong>without Tahreef (perverting the texts), without Ta`teel (denying their meanings), without Takyeef (seeking after their specific details), and without Tamtheel (likening Allah to His Creation).</strong>Complying with the statement of the Most High:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad): He is Allah, (the) One. Allaah-us-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks). He begets not, nor was He begotten; And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Surah Al-Ikhlas (112):1-4</p>
<p>And His (subhana wa ta’aala) statement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>“There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Surah Ash-Shura (42):11</p>
<p>And some from the people of knowledge (Ahlul ‘Ilm), have divided it in to two types and have entered Tawheed al-Asma` was-Sifaat in to Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah. And this does not fall short in that, since the purpose is clear in both divisions.</p>
<p>And the categories of Shirk are three:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shirk Akbar (major Shirk)</li>
<li>Shirk Asghar (minor Shirk)</li>
<li>and Shirk Khafee (hidden Shirk)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As for Shirk Akbar:</strong> It requires the futility of the deeds (of an individual) and the eternal existence in the Fire for the one who died upon it.</p>
<p>As the Most High said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>“But if they had joined in worship others with Allah, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Surah Al-An’aam (6):88</p>
<p>And the Most High said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>“It is not for the Mushrikoon (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah), to maintain the masaajid of Allah (i.e. to pray and worship Allah therein, to look after their cleanliness and their building, etc.), while they witness against their own selves of disbelief. The works of such are in vain and in Fire shall they abide.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Surah At-Tawbah (9):17</p>
<p>And whoever died upon that, Allah will not forgive him, and Paradise is forbidden for him.</p>
<p>As Allah (subhana wa ta’aala) said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Surah An-Nisa (4):48</p>
<p>And the Most High said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>“Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Dhaalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Surah Al-Ma`idah (5):72</p>
<p><strong>And from the types of Shirk Akbar are:</strong> calling upon the dead and the idols, seeking rescue from them, swearing by them, offering animal sacrifices to them, and similar to that.</p>
<p><strong>And as for Shirk Asghar:</strong> then it is what has been established from the texts of the Book or of the Sunnah, as being designated as Shirk, but it is not from the types of Shirk Akbar. Such as riyaa` (performing a deed only to be seen by others) in (the performance of) some deeds, swearing by other than Allah, saying: What Allah willed (Maa shaa` Allaah), and so and so willed, and similar to that.</p>
<p>Due to the statement of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p><em><strong>“What I fear for you the most is the minor shirk.”</strong></em></p>
<p>So he was asked concerning it, so he said:</p>
<p><em><strong>“‘ar-Riyaa’.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Reported by al-Imaam Ahmad, at-Tabaraani, and al-Bayhaqee from Mahmood ibn Lubayd al-Ansaari (radiallaahu ‘anhu) with an authentic chain. And it was reported by at-Tabaarani with authentic chains from Mahmood ibn Lubayd, from Raafiya` bin Khadeej, from the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p>And his (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saying:</p>
<p><em><strong>“Whoever swears by other than Allah, then he has indeed committed Shirk.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Reported by al-Imaam Ahmad with a saheeh chain from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (radiallaahu ‘anhu) and reported by Abu Dawood and at-Tirmidhee with a saheeh chain from the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (radiallaahu ‘anhu) from the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p>He (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p><em><strong>“Do not say: ‘What Allah willed, and so and so willed’, rather say: ‘What Allah willed, then so and so willed.’”</strong></em></p>
<p>Reported by Abu Dawood with a saheeh chain from Hudhayfah bin al-Yamaan (radiallaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p>And this type (of Shirk) does not dictate apostasy, nor does it necessitate eternal existence in the Fire <strong>but it makes deficient the perfection of Tawheed, which is an obligation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As for the third type: and it is as-Shirk al-Khafee</strong> and the proof of this is the statement of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p><em><strong>“Shall I not inform you of what I fear for you more than the Maseeh ud-Dajjaal (the false messiah)?”</strong></em></p>
<p>They (the companions) said: ‘Of course, O Messenger of Allah!’</p>
<p>He (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p><em><strong>“It is the hidden Shirk (Khafee). A man stands for prayer and beautifies his prayer for those who are watching him.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Reported by al-Imaam Ahmed in his Musnad from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudree (radiallaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p><strong>And it is more befitting that Shirk be divided in to two types: Akbar (major) and Asghar (minor). As for the hidden Shirk, then it is contained in them both.</strong></p>
<p>So it is found in the major (Shirk), like the Shirk of the Munafiqoon (hypocrites). Because they hide their false aqa’id (creeds), and show Islam outwardly with duplicity and fear for their own selves.</p>
<p>And it is in the minor Shirk, such as riyaa`, as is related in the hadeeth of Mahmood ibn Lubayd al-Ansaari that was presented and the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed that was mentioned.</p>
<p>And Allah is the One with Whom is success.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When the Islamic Qiblah changed from Jerusalem to the Kabah, the Muslims showed great rejoice and happiness. Then the following verse was revealed, <strong>It is not <em>Al-Birr </em>(piety, righteousness) that you turn your faces towards east and or west; but <em>Al-Birr </em>is (the quality of) the one who believes in Allah&#8230;”</strong>  and to have belief in the aforementioned aspects mentioned in the verse.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah said they are the people who are truthful in their faith and because their statements and actions affirmed their belief in their hearts. They proved they would not change irrespective of the circumstances relating to fear and terror. This verse further shows the people who are not attributed with this attributes cannot be truthful in their claims of having Eemaan. Allaah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>It is not <em>Al-Birr </em>(piety, righteousness) that you turn your faces towards east and or west; but <em>Al-Birr </em>is (the quality of) the one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to the kinsfolk, to the orphans, and to <em>Al-Masakin</em> (the poor), and to the wayfarer, and to those who ask, and to set slaves free, performs <em>As-Salat</em> (<em>Iqamat-as-Salat</em>), and gives the <em>Zakat</em>, and who fulfill their covenant when they make it, and who are <em>As-Sabirin </em>(the patient ones, etc.) in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles). Such are the people of the truth and they are <em>Al-Muttaqun </em>(Soorah al-Baqarah 2:177)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The person who believes in Allaah and the last day, fears his punishment and torment, accepts his commands and orders, stays away from that which has been prohibited and acknowledges his punishments then Allaah will make a way out from the punishment. He will be provided sustenance which he never envisaged.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“&#8230;That is instructed to whoever should believe in Allah and the Last day. And whoever fears Allah &#8211; He will make for him a way out. And will provide for him from where he does not expect&#8230;” (Soorah at-Talaaq 65:2-3)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah The Most High sent Nooh (Alayhis-Salaam) to his nation as a mercy to them and instructed him to propagate the message of Tawheed to his nation. He informed them to abandon shirk and if they didn’t they would face a great punishment and torment from Allaah The Most powerful.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So Nooh (Alayhis-Salaam) followed Allaahs orders immediately and informed his nation that he was sent by Allaah to warn them of his punishments and to clearly and totally clarify what shirk and kufr was. He told them his call was worship the one true deity and not to associate any partners with him and fearing him at all times. He also informed them to follow his commands and prohibitions as they were from Allaah because he was Allaahs Messenger.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He told them Allaah would forgive their sins if they accepted his call and would let them live till their appointed time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>He said, &#8220;O my people, indeed I am to you a clear warner, [Saying], &#8216;Worship Allah , fear Him and obey me. Allah will forgive you of your sins and delay you for a specified term. Indeed, the time [set by] Allah, when it comes, will not be delayed, if you only knew.” (Soorah an-Nooh 71:2-4)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mankind are all the children of Adam (Alayhis-Salam) and Hawaa and so they are all equal. So those from amongst them who have more taqwaa or who obey and follow their respective Messengers will indeed have a great and high rank with Allaah. Allaah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.” (Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:13)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Bukhaari transmits from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) was asked, <em>“&#8221;Who are the most honourable of the people?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The most honourable of them in Allah&#8217;s Sight are those who keep their duty to Allah and fear Him..” </em>(Saheeh al-Bukhaari, no 4689)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Muslim narrates from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) said, <em>“Verily Allaah does not look to your bodies nor to your faces but He looks to </em><em>your hearts and actions.” </em>(Saheeh Muslim no.6543)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah explained to the people the success of the hereafter and the idleness of this world and not to become reliant on the luxuries of this world but rather work on making your hereafter successful because real success is success in the hereafter and this is for those who are worshippers. Allaah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And the worldly life is not but amusement and diversion; but the home of the Hereafter is best for those who fear Allah, so will you not reason? (Soorah al-An’aam 6:32)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A person should always have a link with Allaah in terms of his worship, fear him and his punishment. They should also mention his grandeur and loftiness and this should always remain the centre of attention of their mind and soul. Hence Allaah the Most High said,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims [in submission to Him].” (Soorah Al’e-Imraan 3:102)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah further said to fear him as much you can according to your capability and to continue acting upon his commands. He further said to spend wealth in his way from what he has given you and there is goodness in this. Also know the people who will achieve success and salvation in the hereafter are those who spend in the way of Allaah from their wealth and they are not miserly or greedy. Hence Allaah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“So fear Allah as much as you are able and listen and obey and spend [in the way of Allah]; it is better for your selves. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul &#8211; it is those who will be the successful.” (Soorah at-Taghabun 64:16)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah has informed the people in the aforementioned verses to have taqwaa, fear his punishment, and fulfill his necessary commands and orders and to abstain from unlawful acts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah also informed us that we should always speak the truth and based on the elements mentioned before Allaah will accept our actions and deeds. Similarly he will forgive our sins as our good deeds wipe out or bad deeds. He also gave glad tidings to those who follow Allaah and his Messengers commands and it is they who will achieve a great success. Allaah the most High said,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>O you who have believed, fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice. He will [then] amend for you your deeds and forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly attained a great attainment. (Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:70-71)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah will put love and honour in the heart of the people for those who adopt taqwaa. Allaah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>O you who have believed, if you fear Allah, He will grant you a criterion and will remove from you your misdeeds and forgive you. And Allah is the possessor of great bounty. (Soorah al-Anfaal 8:29)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In another verse Allaah advised us to fear him openly and inwardly, to continuously work towards in making our hereafter better and to be aware that Allaah is looking at every action we do and its being recorded as nothing is hidden from his knowledge. Allaah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“O you who have believed, fear Allah. And let every soul look to what it has put forth for tomorrow &#8211; and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do. (Soorah al-Hashr 59:18)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullaah Ibn Masood (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) would often supplicate, <em>“O Allaah. I beg of you for the right guidance, safeguard against evils, chastity and freedom from want.&#8221; </em>(Saheeh Muslim no. 6904)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A believer should always adopt actions of taqwaa and piety hence the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) said, <em>“Whoever swears by something (ie to do) and then he sees something which has more piety in it then he should take that up instead.”</em> (Saheeh Muslim no.4275)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Taqwaa takes a person to paradise so Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) was asked, <em>“Which action will cause the people to enter Paradise the most? He replied, “Taqwaa and good manners.” He was then asked, “Which action will people to Hell the most?” He replied, “The mouth and the private part.” </em>(Sunan Tirmidhee no.2004 Imaam al-Albaanee said the chain is Hasan.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Having Taqwaa makes a person’s life easy and the doors of mercy are opened for him hence Allaah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And whoever fears Allah &#8211; He will make for him of his matter ease. (Soorah at-Talaaq 65:4)</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[RULINGS FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) This hadith proves that the meat of horses is halal and thus permissible to eat</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) The hadith of Jabir (RadhiAllahu Anhu) is a Qawli hadith in which the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) gave permission for horse meat to be consumed  and in the wording of Bukhari it mentions the word Rakhasa i.e. if need be instead of explicit permission. [Bukhari [4219], Muslim [1941], Abu Dawud [3788], Nasai [7:210], Ahmad [3:361], Baihaqi [9:326], Darimi [1993], Ibn al-Jarud [885] . See the next hadith of this chapter i.e. no,371</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Imams Ahmad, Shafi, Abu Yusuf, Muhammad Shaybani held it is permissible and lawful to eat where as Imams Abu Hanifah and Malik were of the position it is unlawful i.e. haram to eat. [Subl al-Salam [4:1824] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) This incident took place in Madinah after Jihad was textually obligated as other narrations elucidate Asma (RadhiAllahu Anha) said we were in Madinah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) Animals that one can make Dhahb one can also make Nahr of them and vice versa and it is recommended to make Nahr of Camels only and dhahb of other animals.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">A man from the family of Khalid Ibn Usayd: One Hadith</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[84] </strong><strong>from Malik from Ibn Shihab from a man (Umaya Ibn Abdullah Ibn Khalid) of the family of Khalid ibn Usayd that he said to Abdullah ibn Umar (Radi Allahu anhu), &#8220;Abu Abdur-Rahman, we find </strong><strong>the fear prayer and the prayer when settled mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an, but we do not </strong><strong>find any mention of the travelling prayer in it.&#8221; Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8220;Son of my brother! </strong><strong>Allah the Mighty and Majestic sent us Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam)</strong><strong>, and we knew nothing. We only do as we saw him doing.&#8221; </strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>The hadith from Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri have been completed. These are 84 ahadith.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/145,146 hadith no.332, book 9, chapter 2, hadith no.7), at-Tamhid (11/161), al-Istidhkar: (no.303)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by al-Hakim al-Kabir in Awali Malik (no.209) from the hadith of Malik and narrated by Muhammad Ibn Abdullah ash-Sha’ithi from Umaya Ibn Abdullah Ibn Khalid Ibn Usayd that Ibn Umar said to him (the hadith), transmitted by an-Nasa’i (1/226 hadith no.458) and its chain is <em>[Hasan]</em> good, and Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing this hadith from Abdul Malik Ibn Abi Bakr Ibn Abdurahman with Bayhaqi (3/136) and Ya’qub Ibn Sufyan al-Farisi in al-Ma’rifah and at-Taarikh (1/372) and the hadith has another route with Abi Dawud (no.457) and Nasa’i (no.1435) and Ibn Maja (no.1066) and its chain is <em>[Hasan]</em> good and Ibn Khuzaima authenticated it (no.946) and Ibn Hiban (al-Mawarid: no.101) and al-Hakim (1/258) and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Whether you are in a state of fear or security, it is still sunna to shorten the prayers whilst travelling. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2)  <span style="color: #000000">The hadith is the explanation and commentary of the Quran. Therefore saying about an authentic hadith that it is not in the Quran or that it goes against the Quran is a false principle and an incorrect understanding.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) From other evidences it is also established that praying the full units of prayer whilst travelling is also allowed. For example see Sunan an-Nasa&#8217;i (3/121 hadith no.1457, and its chain is <em>[Sahih]</em> authentic, al-&#8216;Ala Ibn Zuhair is Thiqa and there is no Shudhudh in the narration (i.e. the narration does not contradict  a more authentic one) </span></p>
