<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Kitāb al-Aṭʿimah &#8211; The Book of Eating</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated Abu Ubaydah</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Checked &amp; Additional Notes</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">The permissibility of slaughtering with anything that makes the blood flow, except teeth and other bones</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[380] Rafi&#8217; Bin Khadij (Radi Allahu Anhu) said,<br />
&#8220;We were in the company of the Prophet (Sallalhu Alayhi Wa Sallam) at DhulHulaifa, and the people suffered from hunger. We got some camels and sheep (as booty) and the Prophet (Sallalhu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was still behind the people. They hurried and put the cooking pots on the fire. (When he came) he ordered that the cooking pots should be upturned and then he distributed the booty (amongst the people) regarding ten sheep as equal to one camel then a camel fled and the people chased it till they got tired, as they had a few horses (for chasing it). So a man threw an arrow at it and caused it to stop (with Allah&#8217;s Permission). On that the Prophet (Sallalhu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, &#8216;Some of these animals behave like wild beasts, so, if any animal flee from you, deal with it in the same way.&#8221; My grandfather asked (the Prophet (Sallalhu Alayhi Wa Sallam)), &#8220;We hope (or are afraid) that we may meet the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives. Can we slaughter our animals with canes?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalhu Alayhi Wa Sallam) replied, &#8220;If the instrument used for killing and causes the animal to bleed profusely and if Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on killing it, then eat its meat (i.e. it is lawful) but don’t use a tooth or a fingernail and I am telling you the reason: A tooth is a bone (and slaughtering with a bone is forbidden), and a fingernail is the slaughtering instrument of the Ethiopians.&#8221;<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;">[REFERENCES]</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bukhari, Book of Jihad, Chapter: Not to slaughter the camels and sheep of the booty (before distribution) [no. 5503, 5509]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muslim, Book of Sacrifices, Chapter: The permissibility of slaughtering with anything that makes the blood flow, except teeth and other bones [no.1968]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. Halfahu is said to be called a (medicinal) herb, that is predominantly found in this area and because of this relevance it is named dhul hulayfa. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. The army of Muslims encamped in this valley which had the (spoils of war or) war booty wealth of camels. When they became hungry they hastily slaughtered them and started to cook them. Since they did this without permission of the prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Salam), he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) commanded them to overturn the cooking pots in order to correct their manners and teach them a lesson. The cooked meat was wasted and they listened to the command. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. Essentially this was to teach a lesson that it is not correct to use the war booty wealth used before it is distributed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4. Afterwards the Prophet (Salallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) distributed it. On this occasion a companion asked that if you can&#8217;t find a knife to slaughter the animal then can we use a cane instead or something else. He (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) replied by saying that anything that can cut and is sharp enough to shed blood profusely can be used. However teeth or fingernails are not allowed because teeth are bones and fingernails are a type of bone and they are the knives of the Abyssinians.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5. The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) used to travel at the back of the Muslim army. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6. The leader for his people (citizens) or general (for his army) can immediately make a decision in order to reconcile and rectify the issue. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7. The reason why the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) told the companions to over turn the cooking pots and waste the meat is that so they wouldn&#8217;t make the mistake of getting ahead of themselves without permission again. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8. It is necessary for the leader to be just and fair with his people. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9. You should be just and fair whilst distributing the spoils of war. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10. If a camel, cow, goat etc. runs away and you can&#8217;t catch it and someone shoots it with an arrow, it is permissible to eat it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">11. Whichever tool causes bleeding can be used to slaughter an animal. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">12. It is necessary to say bismillah Allahu Akbar meaning the Takbir at the time of slaughtering otherwise the meat will not be halal. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">13. It is not allowed to slaughter an animal using teeth or fingernails. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">14. It is not allowed to slaughter an animal using a bone no matter how sharp it is.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[379] Narrated Salim Ibn Abdullah bin `Umar (Radi Allahu Anhuma)<br />
I heard the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) saying, &#8220;He who kept a dog other than one meant for hunting or for the protection of the herd would lose two qirat of his deeds every day.&#8221; Salim said: Abu Huraira (Radi Allahu Anhu) used to say: Or the dog meant for watching the field, and he was the owner of the land.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;">[REFERENCES]</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bukhari, Book of Slaughtering and Hunting, Chapter: whoever keeps a dog that is neither for hunting nor for guarding livestock (i.e. As a pet) [no.3324]</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. Dogs are impure animals. It is not allowed to keep them in the house as a hobby (or pet) as it becomes the means of gaining less mercy since the Angels don&#8217;t enter the houses which have dogs in. Additionally, it is not allowed to eat from a bowl where a dog has put its mouth in unless it has been cleaned 7 times as well as cleaning it once with mud so that the dirt (bacteria) has been cleaned thoroughly because it&#8217;s bacteria is deadly. However if the purpose of keeping a dog is to protect yourself from burglars (i.e. Guard dog), looking after herds, farming etc then it is allowed to keep them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) Keeping a dog as a pet is not allowed and each day it is kept two qirat (When the companions enquired to the exact measure of the qirat, the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) equated the qirat to be the measure of gold as huge as a mountain) of reward will be lost.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) The Angels of mercy don&#8217;t come into houses that keep dogs</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) There are a lot of deadly bacteria in the mouth&#8217;s of dogs</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) It is allowed to keep dogs for protecting yourself from burglars (i.e. Guard dog), looking after herds, farming and hunting</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Hunting With Trained and Untrained Dogs</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[377] </strong><strong>Narrated Abu Tha`laba Al-Khushani (Radiullahu Anhu):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>I came to the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! We are living in a land ruled by the people of the Scripture (i.e. Jews and Christians); Can we take our meals in their utensils? In that land there is plenty of game and I hunt the game with my bow and with my hound (dog) that is not trained and with my trained hound (dog). Then what is lawful for me to eat?&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for what you have mentioned about the people of the Scripture, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat out of theirs, but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash their utensils and eat out of it. If you hunt an animal with your bow after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it. and if you hunt something with your trained hound after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it, and if you hunt something with your untrained hound (and get it before it dies) and slaughter it, eat of it.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[GRADING]</span> <span style="color: #000000;">– [BUKHARI AND MUSLIM]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;">[REFERENCES]</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bukhari, Book of Slaughtering and Hunting, Chapter: About hunting with a bow [no.5478]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Muslim, Book of The Book of Hunting, Slaughter, and what may be Eaten, Chapter: Hunting with trained dogs and arrows [no.1930]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1)  During hunting if you shoot your arrow and say Bismillah Allahu Akbar and the game (animal) has fallen and died then its meat is halal </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2) If the hunting dog catches the game (animal) and brings it back to you then its meat is halal on the condition that when you released the hunting dog to carry out the hunt you said Bismillah Allahu akbar. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3) If you release an untrained hunting dog to carry out a hunt and it catches the game meat alive then you sacrifice it in a halal manner it is allowed to eat it. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4) This hadith clearly shows the virtue and superiority of the one who has knowledge compared to the one who is ignorant i.e. the trained (knowledgeable) dog compared to the untrained (ignorant of hunting skills) dog. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) It is allowed to use the kufars utensils and clothes on the condition that you can’t get hold of other utensils and clothes. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Before using these type of utensils or clothes they should be washed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) It is necessary to clean used utensils or clothes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) It is allowed to hunt with a trained (hunting) dog and bow and arrow (in this era it’s equivalence such as a gun).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) The takbir should be said at the time of hunting when shooting the arrow, firing the bullet or letting the hunting dog loose. The wording for the takbir is Bismillah Allahu Akbar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) It is allowed to have game meat that has been hunted by a non trained (hunting) dog on the condition that it brings the game back alive and you slaughter it in a halal manner. If the game animal is brought back dead then it is not allowed to eat it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[RULINGS FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) The reason behind licking the fingers after eating is to ensure you don’t lose out from the blessings in the food. Nobody knows which part of their food contains the most blessings. This is why we have been commanded to lick the fingers (and finish the plate of food). This is from a hadith as transmitted in Muslim [no.2033] and Tirmidhi [no.1801]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Finishing the food on the plate and licking the fingers is a sign and way of honoring, dignifying and appreciating the food because it is a blessing from Allah. The food shouldn&#8217;t be thrown in the rubbish or sewers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) You should fill your plate to as much as is required so the plate can be finished.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) Some ahadith mention the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) licked his three fingers (Thumb, Index and middle finger) [Muslim [no.2033] as narrated from a number of companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) Your wife or child can be asked to lick your fingers. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[368] Narrated An-Nu&#8217;man bin Bashir (Radi Allahu Anhu):<br />
I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) saying and he pointed with his fingers towards his ears, &#8216;Both legal and illegal things are evident but in between them there are doubtful (suspicious) things and most of the people have no knowledge about them. So whoever saves himself from these suspicious things saves his religion and his honor. And whoever indulges in these suspicious things is like a shepherd who grazes (his animals) near the Hima (private pasture) of someone else and at any moment he is liable to get in it. (O people!) Beware! Every king has a Hima and the Hima of Allah on the earth is His illegal (forbidden) things. Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body if it becomes good (reformed) the whole body becomes good but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[RULINGS FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) The halal things are absolutely clear and the haram things are absolutely clear. Every muslim is commanded to use the halal and refrain and avoid the haram.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) It is a sign of taqwa to refrain and avoid the unclear matters.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) The heart is such an important piece of the body that when it is upright the whole body is upright and when it is corrupt, the whole body becomes corrupt.<br />
