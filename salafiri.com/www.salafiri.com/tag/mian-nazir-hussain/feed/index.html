				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I clarified this in the previous parts this method, of asking a reputable scholar of the Sunnah a question and following it based on evidence is not taqlid and this is undoubtedly the mainstream view of the Ahl al-Hadith and inshallah we shall bring further names to support this claim. In comparison to the senior, well known and famous scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith, the younger students who are virtually unknown have little significant value. Let us look at what Shaikh Abdullah Rawpari (d.1384/1964) said. However before we progress and present Shaikh Abdullah Rawpari&#8217;s words let us look at some of the other members of his family said and again we shall keep this brief.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Wahhab Rawpari, who is is from the Shaykhs grandson cousin said in the introduction Taqlid or Ulaa Deoband,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This group only follows i.e. does ittiba of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and does not do taqlid of any specific Imam or Mujtahid because all taqlidi methodologies were formulated in later years and this is why, when the concept of taqlid shakhsi reached its peak that is when divisions and sectarianism took hold.&#8221;</em> (Taqlid Aur Ulama Deoband p.11)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Although he talks and refers to taqlid shakhsi, it shows 2 things, the non existent of the concept of this taqlid wajib idea and he also further clarifies this in a footnote in the book which we shall cite later inshAllah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdullah Rawpari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;On this basis accepting the Quran and Hadith is is not taqlid nor is accepting Ijma taqlid..(he goes onto say) accepting the statement of a companion is also not taqlid because it is similar to the hadith. accepting the statement of Imam Abu Hanifah or Imam Shafi&#8217;i without the knowing the evidence if taqlid (this is exactly like taking the statement of a mujtahid without evidence). So we have two possibilities the first is, an issues arises and the individual himself is a scholar, then he should research the Quran, Hadith and the statement of the companions for an answer and if he finds it, it is good. If he cannot then he should retort to the view of the Imams and the scholars of the Salaf which is prominent from the angle of the evidence and take it. If at times he has to do ijtihad and deductions then he should not go outside of the view of the salaf. If he is a lay person then according to the command in the ayah, Fasalau Ahl al-Ziki In Kuntum la ta&#8217;lamun, as the people of zikr if you not know. </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">The second type or possibility is to hold the inherent mindset to follow and accept the statement of only one Imam and that he would seek out and only search for his statement in every issue. If he is a scholar he does the same i.e. to find the statement of that particular imam and if he is a lay person he ask the scholars of his madhab as well as others what is the view of the imam in such and such statement,</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The first type is the methodology of the Ahl al-Hadith and this was also the way and mindset of the salaf, hence Shah Waliullah has detailed this discussion in his treatise Insaf and i have also mentioned this in detail in my book, Ta&#8217;rif Ahl al-Hadith part 1, and also in this treatise and in a summarised form in other works, whether anyone calls this way TAQLID OR ITTIBA.&#8221;</em> (Taqlid Aur Ulama Deoband p.13-14)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Wahhab Rawpari puts a footnote at the end at the bottom of page 14,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Some people call this taqlid however what is correct is that this is ITTIBA because this methodology is on the basis and in accordance with evidence and following based on evidence is ittiba and not taqlid.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">More can be cited from Shaikh Abdullah Rawpari&#8217;s work and the scholars of this learned family highlighting the concept of Ittiba and not taqlid as we ascertained is the mainstream of the elders of the Ahl al-Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If one looks at the books of Shaykh Abdul Karim Zaydan, both in Jam&#8217;e al-Usul and al-Wajiz Fi Usul al-Fiqh we will find he cites both views and says in both books that this issue is very simple and that Allah has obligated the believer to to Ittiba of Allah and his Messenger and the lay person asks a mujtahid if he does not know. There is no mention of the latter form being taqlid. This is what the Ahl al-Hadith are upon and also the view of the mainstream scholars of Ahl al-Hadith</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">more to follow inshAllah</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1326H &#8211; 1908c</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Muhammad Tanzil al-Siddiqi al-Hussaini</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Dr. Abu Nasr Fazal Hussain bin Qadi Farakh Hussain bin Qadi Wahid Ali bin Shah Ramadan Ali Ja’fari Mehdawani was a great scholar, an accomplished Doctor, writer and poet. He is the one who authored the biography of his illustrious teacher Shaikh al-Kul Mian Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi titled, ‘al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat’ and the book is well known due to him. He was born in the Mehdawan’s which was his ancestral residence. He lived in the Pakki Sarai area of Muzaffarpur.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Farakh Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Farakh Hussain possessed a lot of knowledge and was an expert in Arabic, Persian and Urdu. He was born in 1242H in the Mehdawans. He would indulge in Persian and Urdu poetry. He married three times, his first marriage was to the daughter of Shaikh Ja’far Faruqi of Bhawalpur. He had a son from this marriage and he was Shaykh Fazal Hussain. Qadi Farakh Hussain died in 1306H. (refer to, Kulliyat Fakhar: p.59, Tazkirrah Mehdawanu: p.34 and Tazkirrah Ulama Bihar: 2:204)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Birth of Shaykh Fazal Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Fazal Hussain was born on the 27<sup>th</sup> of Muharram 1271H corresponding to 1854H in the Mehdawans.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Seeking Knowledge</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He sought knowledge from Shaykh Muhammad Arif Peshawari and Shaykh Abdul Hamid Bihari. He later travelled to Delhi and sought knowledge from the Musnad of the time Shaikh al-Kul Mian Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi and studied hadith and tafsir with him. He also learnt medicine from Hakim Abdul Majid Dehlawi whilst in Delhi.  </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">After Seeking Knowledge</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He started to practise as a Doctor and was counted from amongst the accomplished Doctors of Bihar. He continued to reside in Muzaffarpur and and also set up his clinic there. He was also an avid writer and was a weekly columnist in the Weekly newspaper, ‘Taj’ which would be published in Patna.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Poet</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was very interested in poetry and would recite poems in both Persian and Urdu. He would use the poetic name of Hashr</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">His Books</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain wrote books on different disciplines some of them were,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(1) al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a biography of Shaykh al-Kul Sayyid Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi. This is considered to be Shaykh Fazal Hussains most important and famous work. It is approximately 367 pages and printed by Matba’a Akbari in Agra in 1326H/1908c and it has been reproduced a number of times thereafter. Dr. Muzaffar Iqbal said concerning this book, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This biography was authored based on modern principles and is worthy to be considered from the foremost of biographies in the Urdu language. The wording and presentation is highly reverential and the passages are clear, simple and continuous.”</em> (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857c until 1914c: p.200)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(2) al-Sufiyyah wal-Tasawwuf</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh mentioned this book himself in ‘Hayat Ba’dal Mamat’ when he wrote, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Sufiyyah wal Tasawwuf’ is a specific treatise I wrote wherein I discuss Tasawwuf in detail. The avid reader can thus distinguish and differentiate every claimant of Tasawwuf whether they are even actuals Sufi’s or not.”</em> (al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat: p.144).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the words of the Shaykh it is indicative this book was already published before al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat was authored. However, we have not seen this book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Tamaddun Arab Aur Hadith Afak (Arab Civilisation and the Hadith of Afak)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is a substantive and detailed answer to the well known French orientalist Museo Layban’s book, ‘Arab Civilisation’ wherein he attempted to misrepresent the hadith of Afak and other doubts. The columnist who reviewed the book in the newspaper, ‘Taj’ of Bankipur of Patna on the 27<sup>th</sup> of October 1902 said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is our view that such a work should be translated and spread in the Arab world.”</em> (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.68)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Risalah Fiqh Wa Hadith</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh briefly outlines the knowledge of jurisprudence and hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Kitab al-Kuhl</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh discusses and debates in detail, the great evil, catastrophic harm and unlawfulness of alcohol. It is 177 pages and was published in 1902c. Dr. Muzaffar Iqbal wrote, “The reality of alcohol and its unlawfulness are scrutinised in detail. The editor of ‘Taj’ of Bankipur Patna, Allamah Fazal Haq Azad has published a review of the book in the issue dated 13<sup>th</sup> October 1902c. (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.216)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(6) Qunut Fi’l Nazila</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is concerning making Qunut at times of calamities and disasters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was a brief overview of the writings of the Shaykh and there are perhaps other works we do not know about.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Children</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain married the daughter of Muhammad Akram Faruqi. He had five children, 3 sons and 2 daughters. The sons were Ali Akbar, Ahmad Hussain and Ghulam Muhammad.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">His Death</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Dr. Abu Nasr Fazal Hussain spent his life based on knowledge and its practical example. He spent time practising medicine as well as poetry. He died at the age of 55 in 1326H / 1908H in Lucknow and he was also buried there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat, Nuzhatul Khawatir: 8:360-361, Hadiqah al-Insab: 1:78-88, Ashab Ilm Wa Fadal: p.110, Tazkirrah Ulama Bihar: 1:224, The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.68, 199-200, 216, Kulliyat Fakhar: p.151-152, Tazkirrah Mehdawanu: p.11-40, 70, 177, Hayat Nazir: p.199)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Ma’ayar ul-Haq Fi Tanqid Tanwir ul-Haq</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh al-Kul al-Allamah Nazir Hussain Muhadith Dehlawi (1320H)</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Muqallid Excuse Of Not Being Able To Act On The Quran and Hadith</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence it is proven a scholar upon the way of Hadith (non muqallid) whilst making knowledge based deductions should not make Taqlid of a Mujtahid in the texts of an issue, even though the mujtahids statement is in accordance with the Hadith. Yet the people who prohibit us from acting upon ahadith and even though clear manifest truth does not concur with them, one of the lame excuses they put forth in their defence is that acting upon ahadith in current times is extremely difficult.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They say the Quran and Hadith is an ocean of knowledge without any shores and hence understanding and acting on them is the duty of a Mujtahid only (ie not the common people). They say it is not in their permit to understand the Quran and Hadith and even if they were to read and understand the literal translation, they would not know whether a particular Hadith was abrogated or not, what the actual meaning of a text is or if there were any conflicting ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we say we answer this excuse from two angles</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first angle is that the Quran and Hadith is not as difficult, such that no one other than a Mujtahid mutlaq can understand them. On the contrary it is indeed very easy and whoever knows arabic especially and particular the scholars, who will easily and compressively understand the intent and meaning of the Quran and Hadith as is the saying of Allah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And We have certainly made the Quran easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?” (Soorah al-Qamar:17)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His ayaat and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom – although they were before in clear error.” (Soorah al-Jumu’ah:2)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient.” (Soorah al-Baqarah:99)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So whoever says we do not understand the Quran and Hadith despite being a scholar will fall under the punishment mentioned in the aforementioned ayah just as Mawlana Muhammad Ismail Shahid (InshaAllah) has mentioned in the treatise ‘Taqwiyat ul-Iman’</span></p>
