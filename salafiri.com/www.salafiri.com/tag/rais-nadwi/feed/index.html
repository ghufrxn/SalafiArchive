				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[10] al-Lamhat Ila Ma Fi Anwar ul-Bari Minuz Zulumat</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> </strong></span><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Allamah Muhammad Rais Nadwi (1430H)</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Discussing the Reality of Imam Abu Hanifah Being Tabi’i According the Usul Of The Hanafi Madhab </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and documented the Imam was born in 80H of the period of Prophet ie in other words the era of the companions. The last companion was Abu Tufail Amir bin Wathilah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), who according to the most correct opinion died in 110H (Taqrib ut-Tahdhib).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore according to this the Imam encountered 30 years of the companions era, in other words the Imam was around 30 years during the time of the companions. These 30 years were the last years of the companions. Some narrations mention after the death of Anas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), who died in the year 90H or 91H until 110H (until the death of Abu Tufail) ie during this 20 year period only one companion was alive, namely Amir bin Wathilah and there was no other companion during this 18 or 20 year period.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even if there were a handful of other companions who were alive during this era, one can only conclude and deduce the Imam encountered a limited period of time of a very few companions. Some hanafi authorities with great desperation and exhorted efforts have enumerated the names of 20 companions in the 30 years from the time of the birth of the Imam up until the era of the companions. (Rad al-Mukhtar 1/44)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mentioning some of these names is an outright and clear error whereas some of the companions died literally a few days after the birth of the Imam when he was a very small child. Those the Imam saw when he was at a tender age and or when he was at an age where it was possible to see them, then there affair is such that every intelligent person knows that any individual alive at a particular time cannot see every person who is alive during his era. Meeting everyone, hearing from them or accompanying them is something far from reality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even the author of Anwar, even with numerous resources is not able to see the millions of people alive during his era. Even myself I have not seen the author of Anwar and their prestigious centre of learning ie Deoband or most of its teachers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author of Anwar has ascertained the death of imam Shafi to have been in 150H and the death of Imam Abu Yusuf in 182H. In other words both imams were living in the same era for approximately 32 years, but the author of Anwar writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Imam Abu Yusuf and Imam Shafi’i did not convene at one place just as Allamah Ibn Taymiyyah, Hafidh Ibn Hajr and Hafidh Sakhawi have also clarified. As for some of the masanid of Imam Abu Hanifah which have been transmitted by Imam Abu Yusuf via Imam Shafi’i are incorrect because Yusuf has been incorrectly written as Abu Yusuf and this Yusuf is bin Khalid as-Samti and Allah knows best.” (Muqaddimah Anwar 1/179 via Hasan al-Taqada)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So according to the author, although both imams were living in the same era for 32 years they never met or saw each other. Then we ask how does one conclude that the imam being around during the time of the companions would have seen them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Lamhat Ila Ma Fi Anwar ul-Bari Minuz Zulumat (2/265-267)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and an established fact, from the time of Ādam Alayhis Salām to the time of Nūh Alayhis Salām for ten generations all the people were upon Tawḥīd, the Millah Waḥidah i.e the one nation i.e the one Dīn of Islām. Then the people became trapped in the deception of shayṭān, and slowly by slowly, they deviated from Tawḥīd and began to commit Shirk. A prophetic ḥadīth as narrated by Ayādh bin Humar Majashī that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said that Allāh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I created all of my servants upon Hunafā i.e clear and pure Dīn of Tawḥīd. Then shayṭān came to them and beguiled them, made them change their Dīn. They made ḥarām what I made ḥalāl for them and he made them equal to me in affairs for which I did not reveal any evidence for.”</em> [Reported in Muslim, Mishkāt al-Masābīḥ [2/460].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Ḥadtīh Qudsī indicates from the time of Ādam Alayhis Salām, all the people were upon Tawḥīd for a long time, until the time just before the time of Nūh Alayhis Salām. Some people became trapped in the plots of shayṭān and the people deviated from the creed of Tawḥīd and began to associate entities (ie partners) with Allāh (the most high), for which Allāh, the most high, did not legislate any proof or evidence. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Allāh, the Most High, sent his Prophets and Messengers to these people who deviated from Tawḥīd in order to rectify their affairs. When Nūh Alayhis Salām went to these mushriks, he informed them of many issues. From them one such point was:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“I do no say to you that I have treasures from Allāh nor do I have knowledge of the unseen.” [Sūrah Hūd: 31]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This clearly shows that Nūh being a great Messenger of Allāh, the most high, and His Prophet, He did not have any such share in the specific attribute of Allāh i.e knowledge of the unseen. Then, How is it possible that someone other than a Messenger can have such a share in this specific attribute of which only belongs to Allāh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nonetheless, it is a reality that from the beliefs of the mushrikīn is that they believed other than Allāh also had knowledge of the unseen, from this attribute of Allāh. Nūh very clearly advised such people who deviated from Tawḥīd that he did not have knowledge of the unseen and that no Messenger or Prophet was equal to Allāh in this attribute.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When our Prophet Muḥammed ﷺ the final messenger, prophecised that his Ummah will follow in the footsteps of the previous nations, in their misguidance and deviation, then at the same instance, He ﷺ also very clearly informed us that people from his Ummah will also worship idols and commit shirk and kufr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence, Thawbān (RaḍiAllāhu Anhu) narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The hour (of Judgement) will not be established up until tribes (groups of people) from my Ummah do not join the mushrikīn to the extent that tribes from my Ummah will worship idols”</em> [Narrated Abū Dawūd, Tirmidhī, Mishkāt [2/465]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ḥurairah (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) narrated the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“At the time of Jahilīyyah, people from my Ummah will also worship idols before the Day of Judgement”</em> [Agreed Upon, Mishkāt [2/481]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similar such reports have been transmitted from ʿĀishah (RaḍiAllāhu Anha) and other companions via numerous chains. Ziyād bin Lūbaid (RaḍiAllāhu Anhu) narrated that</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Messenger of Allāh </em>ﷺ<em> while mentioning that something of fear will occur, He said it will happen when knowledge will be taken away. So, Ziyād Bin Lūbaid (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) asked How will knowledge be taken away when we read the Qurān and teach our children and so on, and this will remain until the Day of Judgement? He </em>ﷺ<em> replied “I thought of you as a person with most understanding in the city of Madīnah, However, you did not understand my point. You see the Jews and Christians reading the Torah and the Injīl but they do not act upon them, and thus the same thing will happen to my Ummah” </em>[Aḥmad, Ibn Majāh, Ḥākim in mursal form, Tirmidhī from Abū Dawūd, Dārimī from Abu Umamāh, Mirʿāh al-Mafātih Sharḥ Mishkāt al-Masābih 1/362]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Taken from Tashih al-ʿAqā’id)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">JazakāAllāhu Khair to Abū Maryam for his help.</span></p>
