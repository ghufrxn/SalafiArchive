				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Biography of ash-Shaykh Muhammad ‘Alee Aadam al-Ithyoobee</strong></h2>
<p>Taken from <em>Is‘aaf Thawee al-Watar</em> (1/13-14)</p>
<p>Translated by Aboo Shaybah</p>
<p>The source of this biography is the book <em>Is‘aaf Thawee al-Watar</em> (<em>Daar al-Aathaar</em> print, 1st ed.) and it is an explanation of Alfiyyah as-<em>Suyootee</em> which deals with the area of <em>mustalah al-hadeeth</em>. The explanation was authored by our Shaykh and teacher, Muhammad ‘Alee Aadam, and one of his students put together this brief biography printed with the book in 2008/1429h. A few small notes were added by the translator concerning certain works of the Shaykh which were in print by the time of this translation in 2012/1433h.</p>
<p>He is the Shaykh and outstanding scholar in <em>hadeeth</em>, <em>fiqh</em>, <em>usool</em>, and <em>nahw</em>, Muhammad ibn ash-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Alee ibn Aadam ibn Moosaa al-Ithyoobee al-Wallawee.</p>
<p>He studied with many scholars in his home country, among them: his father, as well as ash-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abdul-Baasit ibn Muhammad ibn Hasan al-Ithyoobee al-Buwarannee al-Minaasee, and others.</p>
<p>He memorized many academic texts and poetry as well, such as <em>Alfiyyah ibn Maalik</em>, the <em>Alfiyyah</em> of as-Suyootee in <em>mustalah al-hadeeth</em>, and others. He became very proficient and outstanding in various branches of theoretical and transmitted knowledge including <em>nahw</em>, <em>sarf</em>, <em>balaaghah</em>, <em>usool</em>, <em>mantiq</em>, <em>hadeeth</em>, <em>fiqh</em>, and other disciplines of Islamic scholarship.</p>
<p>He later moved to the sanctified land of Allaah, <em>Makkah al-Mukarramah</em>, where he presently teaches by day at <em>Daar al-Hadeeth al-Khayriyyah</em> and by night in its <em>masjid</em>. [Translator’s note: at the time of this translation, the Shaykh currently teaches by night at a <em>masjid</em> called <em>Jaami‘ al-Abraar</em> in a part of Makkah known as <em>an-Nakkaasah</em>]. He has devoted himself in the service of knowledge and all who seek it in the sanctified land of Allaah, and he has authored many works in various sciences, and particularly in the field of hadeeth. Among them are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">1) An explanation of the <em>Alfiyyah</em> of as-Suyootee in <em>mustalah al-hadeeth</em> which is entitled, <em>Is‘aaf Thawee al-Watar bi-Sharh Nathm ad-Durar fee ‘Ilm al-Athar</em>. It is a two volume work which is his abridged explanation of the <em>Alfiyyah</em>. He has a more expansive commentary which has not yet been printed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">2) An explanation of <em>Sunan an-Nasaa’ee</em> which is entitled, <em>Thakheerah al-‘Uqbaa fee Sharh al-Mujtabaa</em>. It is a forty volume work which showcases how truly well-read he is and the incredibly vast scope of his knowledge. Over twenty volumes of it have already been printed. [Translator’s note: at present, all forty volumes have been printed. The first printing was done by <em>Daar al-Mi‘raaj</em> and <em>Daar aal-Baroom</em>, and a second printing was issued by <em>Daar ibn al-Jawzee</em> in 2011/1432h).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">3) An explanation of <em>Sunan ibn Maajah</em> which is entitled <em>Mashaariq al-Anwaar al-Wahhaajah wa Mataali‘ al-Asraar al-Bahhaajah</em>. The Shaykh is still in the process of completing it, and it will be a twelve volume work once finished.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">4) <em>Qurrah al-‘Ayn fee Talkhees Taraajim Rijaal as-Saheehayn</em>, a single volume work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">5) A poem in one hundred and eighteen lines about <em>mudallis</em> narrators of <em>hadeeth</em> entitled <em>al-Jawaahir an-Nafees fee Nathm Asmaa’ wa Maraatib al-Mawsoofeen bit-Tadlees</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">6) An explanation of the introduction to <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> which is presently under publication. [Translator’s note: this explanation to the <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> introduction has been printed in two volumes. The Shaykh has also authored a very expansive explanation of <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> itself, entitled <em>al-Bahr al-Muheet ath-Thajjaaj fee Sharh Saheeh al-Imaam Muslim ibn Hajjaaj</em>. At the time of this translation, approximately twenty volumes of it have been printed.]
<p style="padding-left: 60px">7) <em>al-Jalees as-Saalih an-Naafi‘ bi-Tawdeeh Ma‘aanee al-Kawkab as-Saati‘</em>. It is a large single volume work which is an <em>usool</em> based commentary to the poem [<em>al-Kawkab as-Saati‘</em>] of as-Suyootee in <em>usool al-fiqh</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">8) A poem in <em>usool al-fiqh</em> conforming to the principles of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa‘ah</em> consisting of over two thousand lines. He also has a commentary to it, some of which has been printed in the form of course material for his students. [Translator’s note: the poem has been printed under the title <em>at-Tuhfah al-Mardiyyah</em>, and its explanation has been printed under the title <em>al-Minhah ar-Radiyyah</em>.]
<p style="padding-left: 60px">9) <em>Fath al-Qareeb al-Mujeeb fee Sharh Kitaab Mudnee al-Habeeb mimman yuwaalee Mughnee al-Labeeb</em> which is on the subject of <em>nahw</em>. It is an explanation of a poem composed by his Shaykh, al-‘Allaamah ‘Abdul-Baasit ibn Muhammad al-Buwarannee.</p>
<p>He has authored other works as well which have not yet seen the light of day.</p>
<p>One of the most astonishingly remarkable things about the Shaykh is that when he first came to</p>
<p><em>Daar al-Hadeeth</em>, he sought to be admitted there as a student. When they examined him, as they do with any other student, they found themselves before a multi-disciplinary scholar and they admitted him as an instructor rather than a student. May Allaah reward him immensely for his service to Islaam.</p>
<p>The Shaykh has regular classes in Makkah. Many talented students study with him and very many students of <em>Daar al-Hadeeth</em> have graduated at his hands and spread throughout the world. This is in addition to his work in the area of issuing verdicts and calling to Allaah.</p>
<p>We ask Allaah to bless him in his life and to bestow upon him health and protection. Indeed, Allaah is near and responds.</p>
<p>In closing, what is written here about our Shaykh and tremendous scholar, Muhammad ‘Alee Aadam, is insufficient to do justice in describing him.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1326H &#8211; 1908c</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Muhammad Tanzil al-Siddiqi al-Hussaini</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Dr. Abu Nasr Fazal Hussain bin Qadi Farakh Hussain bin Qadi Wahid Ali bin Shah Ramadan Ali Ja’fari Mehdawani was a great scholar, an accomplished Doctor, writer and poet. He is the one who authored the biography of his illustrious teacher Shaikh al-Kul Mian Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi titled, ‘al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat’ and the book is well known due to him. He was born in the Mehdawan’s which was his ancestral residence. He lived in the Pakki Sarai area of Muzaffarpur.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Farakh Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Farakh Hussain possessed a lot of knowledge and was an expert in Arabic, Persian and Urdu. He was born in 1242H in the Mehdawans. He would indulge in Persian and Urdu poetry. He married three times, his first marriage was to the daughter of Shaikh Ja’far Faruqi of Bhawalpur. He had a son from this marriage and he was Shaykh Fazal Hussain. Qadi Farakh Hussain died in 1306H. (refer to, Kulliyat Fakhar: p.59, Tazkirrah Mehdawanu: p.34 and Tazkirrah Ulama Bihar: 2:204)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Birth of Shaykh Fazal Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Fazal Hussain was born on the 27<sup>th</sup> of Muharram 1271H corresponding to 1854H in the Mehdawans.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Seeking Knowledge</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He sought knowledge from Shaykh Muhammad Arif Peshawari and Shaykh Abdul Hamid Bihari. He later travelled to Delhi and sought knowledge from the Musnad of the time Shaikh al-Kul Mian Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi and studied hadith and tafsir with him. He also learnt medicine from Hakim Abdul Majid Dehlawi whilst in Delhi.  </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">After Seeking Knowledge</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He started to practise as a Doctor and was counted from amongst the accomplished Doctors of Bihar. He continued to reside in Muzaffarpur and and also set up his clinic there. He was also an avid writer and was a weekly columnist in the Weekly newspaper, ‘Taj’ which would be published in Patna.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Poet</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was very interested in poetry and would recite poems in both Persian and Urdu. He would use the poetic name of Hashr</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">His Books</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain wrote books on different disciplines some of them were,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(1) al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a biography of Shaykh al-Kul Sayyid Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi. This is considered to be Shaykh Fazal Hussains most important and famous work. It is approximately 367 pages and printed by Matba’a Akbari in Agra in 1326H/1908c and it has been reproduced a number of times thereafter. Dr. Muzaffar Iqbal said concerning this book, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This biography was authored based on modern principles and is worthy to be considered from the foremost of biographies in the Urdu language. The wording and presentation is highly reverential and the passages are clear, simple and continuous.”</em> (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857c until 1914c: p.200)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(2) al-Sufiyyah wal-Tasawwuf</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh mentioned this book himself in ‘Hayat Ba’dal Mamat’ when he wrote, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Sufiyyah wal Tasawwuf’ is a specific treatise I wrote wherein I discuss Tasawwuf in detail. The avid reader can thus distinguish and differentiate every claimant of Tasawwuf whether they are even actuals Sufi’s or not.”</em> (al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat: p.144).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the words of the Shaykh it is indicative this book was already published before al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat was authored. However, we have not seen this book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Tamaddun Arab Aur Hadith Afak (Arab Civilisation and the Hadith of Afak)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is a substantive and detailed answer to the well known French orientalist Museo Layban’s book, ‘Arab Civilisation’ wherein he attempted to misrepresent the hadith of Afak and other doubts. The columnist who reviewed the book in the newspaper, ‘Taj’ of Bankipur of Patna on the 27<sup>th</sup> of October 1902 said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is our view that such a work should be translated and spread in the Arab world.”</em> (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.68)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Risalah Fiqh Wa Hadith</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh briefly outlines the knowledge of jurisprudence and hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Kitab al-Kuhl</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh discusses and debates in detail, the great evil, catastrophic harm and unlawfulness of alcohol. It is 177 pages and was published in 1902c. Dr. Muzaffar Iqbal wrote, “The reality of alcohol and its unlawfulness are scrutinised in detail. The editor of ‘Taj’ of Bankipur Patna, Allamah Fazal Haq Azad has published a review of the book in the issue dated 13<sup>th</sup> October 1902c. (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.216)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(6) Qunut Fi’l Nazila</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is concerning making Qunut at times of calamities and disasters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was a brief overview of the writings of the Shaykh and there are perhaps other works we do not know about.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Children</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain married the daughter of Muhammad Akram Faruqi. He had five children, 3 sons and 2 daughters. The sons were Ali Akbar, Ahmad Hussain and Ghulam Muhammad.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">His Death</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Dr. Abu Nasr Fazal Hussain spent his life based on knowledge and its practical example. He spent time practising medicine as well as poetry. He died at the age of 55 in 1326H / 1908H in Lucknow and he was also buried there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat, Nuzhatul Khawatir: 8:360-361, Hadiqah al-Insab: 1:78-88, Ashab Ilm Wa Fadal: p.110, Tazkirrah Ulama Bihar: 1:224, The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.68, 199-200, 216, Kulliyat Fakhar: p.151-152, Tazkirrah Mehdawanu: p.11-40, 70, 177, Hayat Nazir: p.199)</span></p>
