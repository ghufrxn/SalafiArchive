<h3><span style="color: #000080">An Introduction to the Treatise</span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify">Origin<strong><br />
</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">This treatise is found in Kitab Al-Kawakib Ad-Darari of Imam Ibn &#8216;Urwah, Volume 39 across six pages in Darul Kutub Adh-Dhahariyyah, and in Markaz Makhtutat w&#8217;at-Turath Kuwait #5/12811, and its chain of narration to the author is authentic, every narrator is a trustworthy Imam.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify">Narrators</h4>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify">&#8216;Ali bin Husayn bin &#8216;Urwah Abu&#8217;l Hasan Ad-Dimashqi, he was born in the year 760H, Ibn Muflih said regarding him, &#8220;The Shaykh, the &#8216;Aalim, the Pious, the Role-Model &#8211; he arranged the Musnad (of Imam Ahmad) in accordance to the chapters of Al-Bukhari, and he named it Al-Kawakib Ad-Darari Fi Tartib Musnad Al-Imam Ahmad &#8216;Ala Abwab Al-Bukhari, and he explained it in 120 volumes.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Yahya bin Yusuf bin Ya&#8217;qub Ar-Rahbi Ad-Dimashqi, he was born in the year 714H, and Ibn Hajar said regarding him, &#8220;He took from many of the companions of Ibn Taymiyyah, and he passed away in the year 894H.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Al-Imam Al-Hafidh Abu &#8216;Abdillah Muhammad bin Ahmad bin &#8216;Uthman Adh-Dhahabi, the author of this treatise, he was born in the year 673H, and his father was a goldsmith, hence he was known as Adh-Dhahabi. He was the great Hafidh and scholar of Hadith, author of the famous &#8216;Siyar A&#8217;lam An-Nubala&#8217; and &#8216;Tarikh Al-Islam&#8217; &#8211; well versed in the various sciences such as Aqidah, Fiqh, Hadith, History, and his Shaykhs were many, the most famous of which being Al-Hafidh Ibn Kathir, author of the famous Tafsir, may Allah have mercy on them all.</li>
</ol>
<h4>The Topic of this Treatise</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">This treatise pertains to affirming and establishing the attribute of Al-Yadayn (The Two Hands) of Allah, Exalted is He, and the author establishes these Lofty Attributes by using evidences from the Ayat of the Qur&#8217;an, Ahadith, and Athar of the Salaf As-Salih. The methodology of the Ahlul-Hadith, Ahlus-Sunnah, is to affirm these attributes without Tahrif (distortion), or Takyif (ascribing a modality to these attributes), or Tamthil or Tashbih (likening these attributes to the creation) &#8211;  The early Imams of this Ummah discussed these Lofty Attributes in their works, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">Imam At-Tirmidhi, &#8220;They (the Jahmiyyah) say: &#8216;Allah did not create Adam with His Hand&#8217;, and they say: &#8216;Verily Hand here only means power.'&#8221; <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">&#8216;Abdullah bin Zubayr Abi Bakr Imam Al-Humaydi (Student of Sufyan bin &#8216;Uyaynah), &#8220;The Sunnah with us is [&#8230;] belief in the Ru&#8217;yah (seeing Allah) after death, and what has been mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and Hadith, such as: {&#8230;and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand&#8230;} [Az-Zumar, 39:67].&#8221; <em>(Usul As-Sunnah, Musnad of Al-Humaydi)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">Imam Al-Muzani (Student of Imam Ash-Shafi&#8217;i), &#8220;&#8230;Then He created Adam with His Hand.&#8221; <em>(Sharh As-Sunnah of Imam Al-Muzani</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">Imam Harb Al-Kirmani (Student of Imam Ahmad and Ishaq bin Rahuyah), &#8220;and He (Allah) created Adam with His Hand, in His Image.&#8221; <em>(Ijma&#8217; Al-Salaf fil I&#8217;tiqad)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">Imam Ibn Abi Dawud, &#8220;and the Jahmiyyah certainly reject His Right Hand.&#8221; <em>(Al-Ha&#8217;iyyah)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">Imam Ibn Abi Zayd Al-Qayrawani, &#8220;And verily He is [able to be] heard and seen, and He Grips and Opens [His Hand], and both of His Hands are outstretched.&#8221; <em>(Al-Jami&#8217; fi&#8217;l Sunan w&#8217;al-Adab w&#8217;al-Maghazi w&#8217;at-Tarikh)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">Imam As-Sabuni said, &#8220;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">They (Ashab Al-Hadith) do not distort the Words from their proper places (meanings) by claiming the Two </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Hands</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> are only His Blessings, or His Power, [like] the distortions of the Mu&#8217;tazila Jahmiyyah, May Allāh destroy them.&#8221; <em>(Aqidah As-Salaf wa Ashab Al-Hadith)</em></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080">The Treatise (Narrations 1-25)</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Ash-Shaykh Shams Al-Din Muhammad bin Ahmad bin &#8216;Uthman Adh-Dhahabi said:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Affirming Al-Yad for Allah, Exalted is the Attribute from His Attributes</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Allah, Exalted is He, said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;What prevented you from prostrating to whom I created with both My Hands.&#8221;<br />
</strong><em>(Surah Sad, 38:75)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">And He said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;Rather! Both His Hands are outstretched.&#8221;<br />
</strong><em>(Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5:64)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">And He said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;Do they not see that We have created for them from what Our Hands have</strong> <strong>made&#8230;&#8221;<br />
</strong><em>(Surah Ya-Sin, 37:61)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">And He said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;&#8230;and the Heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand&#8230;&#8221;<br />
</strong><em>(Surah Az-Zumar, 39:67)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">And He said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;Verily, those who pledge allegiance to you are pledging allegiance to Allah, the Hand of Allah is above their hands.&#8221;<br />
</strong><em>(Surah Al-Fath, 48:10)</em></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily, Musa met Adam, so he said: &#8216;Allah created you by His Hand, and the Angels prostrated to you, so by Allah! If you had not done what you had done, not one single person from your offspring would enter the Fire!&#8217; So he replied, &#8216;O Musa! You are the one who Allah chose for His Message and to Speak with&#8230;'&#8221;¹ </strong>and he mentioned the Hadith.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Allah will fold up the Heavens on the Day of Resurrection, then He will take them by His Hand and He will say, &#8216;I am the King! Where are the Tyrants? Where are the arrogant?'&#8221;²</strong></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">&#8216;Umar bin Hamzah mentioned the previous Hadith, and he added, &#8220;I heard &#8216;Ikrimah saying: Both of the Hands of Allah are Right, so He will fold up the Heavens and take them by His Hand, then say: &#8216;I am the King!&#8217;, then he will take the Earths by His other Hand.'&#8221;³</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily when a slave gives charity from good, Allah accepts it, and takes it with His Right Hand, and grows it as one of you would raise his colt or young camel, and even if a man gives charity with a crumb, then it grows in the Hand of Allah until it becomes like Mount Uhud &#8211; so give in charity.&#8221; </strong>These Ahadith are authentic.⁴</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily the first thing that Allah created was the Pen, so He took it with His Right Hand, and both of His Hands are Right, and He wrote what is to be from the actions, righteous or immoral, [in every] moist or dry [place], so He counted them in Adh-Dhikr, then He will say: Read, If you wish: </strong><strong>&#8220;This record of Ours speaks about you with truth, Verily, We were recording what you used to do.&#8221; </strong><em>[Al-Jathiya, 45:29]</em><em><br />
</em>This is a Hasan Hadith.⁵</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;The Right Hand of Allah is full, and nothing in the night or the day (i.e., His Bounty) diminishes it, and in His other Hand is the Two Scales, He raises it and lowers it.&#8221; </strong>Agreed upon (by Bukhari and Muslim).⁶</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;The Just will be on pulpits of light on the Right of Ar-Rahman, and Both of His Hands are right &#8211; those that are just with their families and their judgements and those that they are in charge of.&#8221;</strong> Muslim narrated it.⁷</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Allah will take His Heavens and His Earths by His Hands and He will say, &#8216;I am Allah.&#8217; &#8211; And he (The Messenger of Allah) clenched his fingers and opened them &#8211; &#8216;I am The King, I am Ar-Rahman.'&#8221; </strong>And this is a Sahih Hadith.⁸</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily, on the Day of Resurrection, Allah (Mighty and Majestic) will gather the Heavens and the Earths in His Grasp, then He will say: &#8216;I am Allah.'&#8221;⁹</strong></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Allah created the Garden of Eden, and He planted its trees by His Hand, then He said to it, &#8216;Speak.&#8217; So it said, &#8216;Certainly, the believers are successful.&#8217; </strong>[Surah Al-Mu&#8217;minun, 23:1]<strong>.&#8221; </strong>Authentic.¹⁰</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, &#8220;Allah created the creation, and they were in His Grasp, so He said to those in His Hand: Enter into Jannah with peace, and He said to those in His other Hand: Enter into the Fire.&#8221; Al-Lalaka&#8217;i and Ibn Battah both narrated it through the path of &#8216;Abdur Rahman.¹¹</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Prophet ﷺ said,<strong> &#8220;Verily, Charity falls into the Hand of Allah, Exalted is He, before it falls into the hand of the recipient.&#8221; </strong>And this is authentic.¹²</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily, Allah wrote a book with His Hand, and He placed it with Him above the Throne: &#8216;Verily My Mercy has overcome My Anger.'&#8221; </strong>And this is an authentic Hadith.¹³</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Allah created the creation, and he decreed the Divine Will, then He took the People of the Right by His Right Hand, and He took the People of the Left by His Other Hand, and Both of His Hands are Right, then He Said: Am I not your Rabb?&#8230;&#8221; </strong>And this is a Hasan Hadith, Ibn Battah narrated it in Al-Ibanah.¹⁴</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Verily Allah created four things with His Hand: Adam, and the Pen, and the Garden of Eden [and the Throne], and He said for the rest of the creation: &#8216;Kun (Be)&#8217; and so it was.&#8221; More than one narrated this from &#8216;Ubayd, such as Sufyan Ath-Thawri and &#8216;Abdul Wahid Ibn Ziyad.¹⁵</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from from Mughith bin Sumi that he said, &#8220;It has reached me that verily Allah did not create anything with His Hand except three: He planted Al-Jannah with His Hand, and He created Adam with His Hand, and He wrote the Tawrah with His Hand.&#8221;¹⁶</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from from Hakim bin Jabir that he said, &#8220;I have informed you that your Rabb did not touch anything with His Hand except three: He planted Al-Jannah with His Hand, and He created Adam with His Hand, and He wrote the Tawrah with His Hand.&#8221;¹⁷</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from Sa&#8217;id bin Abi Hilal who said, &#8220;It has reached me that the first thing revealed from Allah upon Musa was: &#8216;In the Name of Allah, Ar-Rahman, Ar-Rahim, This is a book from Allah by His Hand in the Tablets for His Slave, Musa.'&#8221;¹⁸</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from &#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Yasar that he said, &#8220;The Angels said: &#8216;O Rabb! You made Bani Adam, then you made them to eat, and to drink, and to enjoy women, and you did not make any of those for us, so when you made the Dunya for them, then make the Akhirah for us.&#8217; So Allah, Mighty and Majestic, said: &#8216;I will not make the offspring of the one I made by My Hands like the one I said &#8216;Kun&#8217; (Be) for.'&#8221; ¹⁹</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And &#8216;Abdullah bin Salih narrated it from Al-Layth, from Hisham bin Sa&#8217;d, from Zayd bin Aslam, from &#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Yasar, from &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr and bin Al-&#8216;As, and this chain of narration is authentic and established, &#8216;Uthman bin Sa&#8217;id Ad-Darimi likewise narrated it from &#8216;Abdullah bin Salih.²⁰</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from Ibn &#8216;Abbas that he said, <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;The Seven Heavens and the Seven Earths are not in the Hand of Ar-Rahman, except like a </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">mustard</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> seed in the hand of one of you.&#8221;²¹</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from Wahb bin Munnabih that he said, &#8220;The creation is not in the Grasp of Allah, except like a mustard seed here in the hand of one of you.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it is authentic from Ibn &#8216;Abbas that he said, &#8220;Allah wiped the back of Adam, then removed every purity with His Right Hand, and removed every impurity with His Other Hand.&#8221;²³</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">And it has been narrated with a Hasan chain of narration that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;The first thing Allah created was the Pen, then He took it with His Right Hand, and Both of His Hands are Right, and He wrote the Dunya and what is to occur in it.&#8221;</strong> Narrated by Baqiyyah bin Al-Walid, from Arta&#8217; bin Al-Mundhir, from Mujahid, from Ibn &#8216;Umar.²⁴</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Whoever gives the equivalent of a date from good income in charity, and Allah does not accept anything except good, then verily Allah raises it for one of you like one of you raises his colt or young camel, then it grows in the Hand of Ar-Rahman until it becomes greater than a mountain.&#8221;²⁵</strong></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #999999">Fatwas of Ibn Baz&gt; Volume 6&gt; Important questions and their answers&gt; The Meaning of: &#8220;Allah created Adam in His Own Image&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Q4: <em>&#8220;Allah created Adam in His Own Image.[1]&#8221;</em> Does this mean that all the characteristics of Adam are also Divine?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It is authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) that he (peace be upon him) said: Allah created Adam in His own image In a narration by Ahmad and some scholars of Hadith, the same Hadith reads: in the image of Al-Rahman (the Most Merciful). In the first Hadith, the pronoun refers to Allah. Some scholars like Ahmad (may Allah be merciful to him), Is-haq ibn Rahawayh and the Imams of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) said: &#8220;We have to accept the Hadith in a way befitting Allah without Tashbih (comparison), Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation) or Ta`til (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes). It does not necessarily mean that His Image (Glorified be He) is like the image of human beings. Similarly, attributing a face, hand, fingers, feet, leg, anger, and the like attributes does not entail that Allah&#8217;s Attributes are like those of the human beings. He (Glorified be He) is described as what He tells about Himself and what His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) said in a way befitting Him, without being in similitude with any of His Creatures. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: &#8220;There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; [Surah al-Shura 42:11].</p>
<p>We have to accept this in the way that the Messenger intended without Takyif (descriptive designation of Allah&#8217;s Attributes) or Tamthil. The meaning &#8211; Allah knows best &#8211; is that He created Adam in His Image with a face and ability to hear, speak, see and do whatever he wants. It is not necessarily that the image is the same. This is a general rule according to the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream), meaning that the Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and Hadiths speaking about Divine Attributes should be accepted as true without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Takyif, Tamthil or Ta`til. They confirm His Names and Attributes without Tamthil and exalt Him above being similar to His Creatures without Ta`til, contrary to those who commit Bid`ah (innovation in religion) of Al-Mu`attilah (deniers of Allah&#8217;s Attributes) and Mushabihah (those who liken Allah’s Attributes to those of His creation). The hearing, seeing and knowledge of the creature is never like those of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), for none of His creatures can be compared to Him. Indeed, there is nothing like Him, for the Attributes of Allah are perfect and infinite, with no shortcomings. As for the attributes of the creatures, they are finite and imperfect.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p><span style="color: #999999">Fatwas of Ibn Baz&gt; Volume 25&gt; Book on Hadith, First Section&gt; Book on Iman&gt;Degree of the authenticity of the Hadith: Allah created Adam in His own image</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">33- What is the authenticity of the Hadith that reads: <em>Allah created Adam in His Own Image[1]</em>.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: The following Hadith is recorded in the Sahih collection of Al-Bukhari, Book of Asking Permission: Allah has created Adam in His own image It falls within the subject of Asking Permission and the Beginning of Creation. Its exact wording is: <em>&#8220;Allah created Adam in the image of the Beneficent.[2]&#8221;</em> Ibn Hajar (may Allah be merciful to him) commented: It is soundly reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated that Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam in the Image of the Beneficent. How authentic is this Hadith?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This information contained in this Hadith is sound. The Hadith is Sahih (authentic) as confirmed by Is-haq, Ahmad and others. It means that Allah is All-Hearer and All-Seer but it does not conclude that His Hearing or Seeing resemble those of human beings. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <em>&#8220;There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; [Surah al-Shura 42:11]</em>. This denotes that Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam in His Own Image and endowed him with the faculties of hearing, seeing and speech and with hands and feet. Yet, Allah&#8217;s (Exalted be He) Image does resemble that of human beings, High Exalted be He above having likes or peers.</p>
<p>Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; [Surah al-Shura 42:11] And, &#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221; [Surah al-Ikhlaas 112:4] and, &#8220;Do you know of any who is similar to Him?&#8221; [Surah al-Maryam 19:65] And, &#8220;So put not forward similitudes for Allâh (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything).&#8221; [Surah an-Nahl 16:74].</p>

<p><span style="color: #999999">Fatwas of Ibn Baz&gt; Volume 28&gt; Book on subject related to `Aqidah&gt; the Creed of Ahl Al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community)&gt; Questions&gt;Degree of authenticity of Hadith: Allah created Adam in His own image</span></p>
<p><strong>Q9: What is the degree of authenticity of the following Hadith: &#8220;Allah created Adam in His own image.[1]&#8221; Or &#8220;&#8230; In the Merciful&#8217;s image&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it is a Hadith Sahih (authentic Hadith). Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam in His own image i.e. He can hear, see, speak, with eyes, hands, and feet. However, the Hadith does not imply any Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation), for Allah (Glorified be He) states: &#8220;There is nothing like Him&#8221; [Surah al-Shura 42:11] And: &#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221; [Surah al-Ikhlaas 112:4].</p>
<p>This is the explanation of the Hadith by scholars of Ahl-ul-Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah) such as Ahmad, Is-haq and others (may Allah have mercy on them all).</p>

<p>Al-Imaam Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah) discusses the hadeeth: Allaah Created Adam upon His Image</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> A hadeeth has been reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in which he prohibits cursing the face (literally saying &#8216;may Allaah make your face ugly&#8217;), and it mentions that Allaah (Subhaanahu) created Adam upon His Image. So what is the safe belief in reference to this hadeeth?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The hadeeth is confirmed from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), that he said: &#8220;When one of you hits (someone else), then let him avoid the face, for indeed Allaah created Aadam upon His Image.&#8221; And in another wording (of this hadeeth) he said, &#8220;upon the Image of Ar-Rahmaan (the Most Merciful).&#8221; And this (hadeeth) does not necessitate resembling or likening Allaah (to His creatures).</p>
<p>The meaning of it with the people of knowledge is that Allaah created Adam hearing, seeing, and speaking if he wished to do so (i.e. Aadam had these attributes). This is also the description of Allaah, for verily He is Hearing, Seeing, and Speaking if He wishes, and He has a Face, Magnificent and Exalted is He.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean resembling or likeness. Rather, the Image that is for Allaah is not like the image that is for the creation. It only means that He is Hearing, Seeing, and Speaking if and whenever He wishes to do so. And thus did Allaah create Aadam as one who is hearing, seeing, and possessing a face, and a foot. However, the hearing (of one) is not like the hearing (of the other), and the seeing (of one) is not like the seeing (of the other), and the speaker is not like the (other) speaker. Rather, Allaah has attributes that are befitting His Majesty and His Sublimity, and the slave (of Allaah) has attributes that are befitting him. The attributes of the slave (of Allaah) is exposed to cessation and deficiency, whereas the attributes of Allaah are perfect and not exposed to deficiency, cessation of being, or ending. For this reason, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic said, &#8220;There is nothing like Hime, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.&#8221; And He, Glory be unto Him, said, &#8220;And there is none comparable or coequal to Him.&#8221; Thus, it is not permissible to strike the face (of someone), nor to curse the face (saying &#8216;may Allaah make your face ugly&#8217;).</p>
