				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">READ PART 38</span> &#8211; </span><a href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-38-mawlid-beginnings-historical-origins-rafidhi-fatimids/"><span style="color: #008000;">Mawlid Beginnings &amp; Historical Origins – Rafidhi Fatimids</span></a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Th historians differ greatly as to when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born ie the exact date however most of them opine it was the 9th of Rabī Al-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Sa‘īd Muzaffar Kaukabūrī was himself unsure of the exact date of the Mawlid due to the difference of opinion, he Kawkaburi, who was considered the chief Mawlid innovator, would celebrate the Mawlid on the 8th of Rabi ul-Awwal in one year and on the 12th the following year. (al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah 1:552)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Dahiyyah, the one who wrote one of the earliest books promoting the Mawlid, was of the opinion the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 8th of Rabi ul-Awwal and he refutes the notion of it being the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal (<em>al-Tanwir Fi Mawlid al-Bashir wal-Nazir from al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah</em> 2:260)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Dahiyyah also mention the 17th of Rabi ul-Awwal as another potential birth date (<em>al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah</em> 2:260)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is strange how the Barelwis use Imam Ibn Kathirs al-Bidayah to support their views in other things but in such instances they turn a blind eye to such remarks and research. The likes of Saqid Shami are happy to use Ibn Kathir on Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and his alleged book on the Mawlid, so we are we using here too?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The founder of Baraliwism Ahmad Raza Khān said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 12th of Rabī Al-Awwal and he died on the same day.&#8221;</em> (Malfūzāt 2:220)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Qādir Jilānī said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Prophet ﷺ was born on the 10th of Muharram.&#8221;</em> (<em>Ghuniyyah al-Tālibīn</em> 2:392).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan said about Shaikh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The illustrious son and descendant of the Glorious Prophet ﷺ and the true representative and inheritor of Prophetic Bounties, the great Ghawth Shaykh Sayyid ‘Abd al-Qadir Jilani (d 561/1164) states: ‘I see all the cities of Allah as I see a mustard seed in the centre of my palm.’ The Grand Ghawth also states: ‘The pupil of my eye is set on the Luhe-Mahfuz.&#8221;</em> (Malfuzat 1:35-36, Barelwi translation)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is deception at its highest level, on one hand they have this belief about Abdul Qadir al-Jilnai while at the same time reject his view regarding the birth date and hence the Mawlid. The conclusion, Ahmad Raza was categorically lying when he made this statement about Shaykh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another Barelwi writer, Muhammad Umim Ehsan al-Mujaddadi al-Barkati said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on a Monday in the year of the Elephant, either on the 8th, 9th or the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Awjaz al-Siyar Mulhiq Bi-Mishkat al-Masabih</em> 1:586)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdul Haq Dehlawi also mentions the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal being the birth date of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ (<em>Ma Thabt Bil-Sunnah</em> p.288, <em>Madarij al-Nabuwwah</em> 2:23)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qādi Muhammad Suleimān Mansūrpūrī said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Prophet ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī Al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant, corresponding to 22nd April 571ce, corresponding to the 1st Jith 628 Bikrami in Makkah in the early morning before sunrise. &#8220;</em> (<em>Rehmah Al-Alamīn</em> p.40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The historians have differed with regards to the birth date, Tabari and Ibn Khaldun said the 12th, Abu Fida said the 10th. However all are agreed the Monday (of the birth) on that year corresponds to the 9th and this is why the 9th of Rabi ul-Awwal seems to be most accurate date of birth.&#8221;</em> (<em>Rehmah Al-Alamīn</em> p.40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Suleimān Nadwī said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;As regards to the birth of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ Egypt&#8217;s Mahmūd Pashā the astronomer authored a treatise in which he proved mathematically that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 9th Rabī Al-Awwal corresponding to 20th April 571ce.&#8221;</em> (<em style="color: #000000;">Sirah al-Nabī</em> 1:171)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Indian historian Akbar Shah Najibabadi said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant corresponding to the 40th gathering of Kisrah Naushirwan corresponding to the 22th April 571ce in the morning before sunrise.&#8221;</em> <em style="color: #000000;">(Tārīkh Al-Islām</em> 1:76)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The leader of the Sufi&#8217;s, Yusuf bin Ismail Nabahani said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;And what is famous and well known and what the majority (of the scholars) are agreed upon is that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Hujjatullah Alal A&#8217;lamin</em> p.231)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Deobandi church father, Ashraf Ali Thanwi has also mentioned a difference of opinion with regards to the exact birth date. (<em>Nashr al-Tayyib</em> p.28)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of the well known scholars were of the view that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal. Imam Nawawi mentioned,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away on the Monday morning on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal after the 12th year after the Hijra.&#8221;</em> (<em>Taqrib Ala Ibn Salah</em> 2:251)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti, who is revered by the proponents of the Mawlid because of his generic reverence of the birth of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, said in explanation of the words of Imam Nawawi,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The majority (of the scholars) are upon what the author (i.e. Imam Nawawi) mentioned, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tadrib al-Rawi Sharh Tarib al-Nawaw</em>i 2:51)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Tal&#8217;at, the author of <em>Tarikh Dawal al-Arab wal-Islam</em> was also of the view the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabi ul-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdur Rahman Mubrakpuri in his <em>Tuhfa</em> brings the statement of Hafiz Ibn al-Jawzi from his <em>al-Tanqih</em> in which he says,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;They are agreed the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the Monday in the year of the elephant in the month of Rabi ul-Awwal, however, they differ with regards to the exact date of the month and there are four views, (1) 2nd Rabi ul-Awwal, (2) 8th Rabi ul-Awwal, (3) 10th Rabi ul-Awwal and the (4) 12th Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tuhfa al-Ahwadhi Sharh Tirmidhi</em> 4:295)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the dismal shenanigans and unprincipled debacle of the Sufi Barailwis let us return to the chains of Tahir ul-Qadiri to Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi as mentioned in PART 2, let us examine them in detail and unearth some stark, shocking and epiphany moments of the Sufi Barelwis. The chains of studentship direct to Ahmad Raza Khan were mentioned as</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Maulana Zia ud Din Madani who was a direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan Barailwi</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Maulana Syed Ahmad Abul Barkat Qadiri the son of Syed Didar Ali Qadiri, who was a direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan Barailwi</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Mawlana Abdul Ma’bud Jilani, who died at the age of 165, who was a direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>1. Mawlana Zia ud Din Madani (d.1401/1981)</strong></span></h5>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7500 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?resize=219%2C300" alt="zia-ud-din-madani" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?resize=219%2C300 219w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?resize=768%2C1053 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?resize=747%2C1024 747w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?w=1106 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 219px) 100vw, 219px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a resident of Madinah and spent most of his life there, he received ijazah and Khalifa(ship) from Ahmad Raza Khan when he was in his teens, i.e. 18 years old. He also received Ijazah and Khalifaship from the Sufi Yusuf Nabahani (d.1350/1932), who is revered by both strains of the Hanafiyyah from the sub continent i.e. Deobaniyyah and of course the Barelwiyyah, both arch Sufi&#8217;s. (see <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.darultahqiq.com/qadi-yusuf-al-nabhani-d-1932-ce1350-ah-on-the-jala-al-aynayn-of-numan-al-alusi/">http://www.darultahqiq.com/qadi-yusuf-al-nabhani-d-1932-ce1350-ah-on-the-jala-al-aynayn-of-numan-al-alusi/</a>) </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">he also got ijaza and because the Khalif for the following Sufi&#8217;s (as stated by them)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wasi Ahmad Muhadith Surti, Syed Hussain Al-Hassani Al-Kurdi, Ahmad Al-Shamah Al-Malaki Al-Qadri Marakashi, Syed Abdul Rahman Seraj Makkahi, Badruddin al-Hassani Shami, Ahmad Sharif Asanousi Tarablasi, Abdul Baqi Farangi-Mahali, Ameen Qutabi, Shah Abdul Haq Muhajjar Alla Abadi, Shah Ali Hussain Ashrafi, Nour Yousaf Kachochavi, Abul Khair Meer Dad Makki, Syed Ahmad al-Hariri, Syed Sabbagi, Syed Alawi Bin Abbas Malaki (Father of Syed Muhamad Alawi Malaki Sahib)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Most of them were ardent fanatical Sufi&#8217;s and some of them are of importance, Wasi Ahmd Surti was an arch enemy of Ahl al-Sunnah in the subcontinent, Badr al-Din Hasani revered by both Deobandi&#8217;s and Barelwi&#8217;s, Syed Alawi bin Abbas, the father of the notorious Alawi Maliki who has demonstrated his extreme hatred for Tawhid and its people in his books. He has also been thoroughly refuted by the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama&#8217;ah. Dear readers we find this a web and matrix of deviation of these Deobandi and Barelwis holding the same beliefs in opposition to the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">another interesting link is the leader of these guys</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/green-hat.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7504 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/green-hat.jpg?resize=300%2C183" alt="green-hat" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/green-hat.jpg?resize=300%2C183 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/green-hat.jpg?w=502 502w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ilyas-atari.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7505 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ilyas-atari.jpg?resize=236%2C238" alt="ilyas-atari" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ilyas-atari.jpg?w=236 236w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ilyas-atari.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He has ijazah and Khalifship from the grandson of Zia ud Din Madani, Rizwan Qadiri. Yet again another intertwined link between these brothers in faith. Also we find some refutations of Ilyas Attari Qadiri on his fellow Qadiri Fraternity brother which are accessible via the internet and also Tahir ul-Qadiri&#8217;s comebacks in his usual frantic rants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;">2. <strong>Syed Ahmad Maulana Abul Barkat Qadiri (d.1398/1978)</strong></span></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">He was the son of Syed Didar Ali Qadiri who inturn was a direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan and took ijazah from him. Abul Barkat also attended Jamia Naeemia of Naeem ud Din Muradabadi and gained an ijazah in Dars Nizami from him. Naeem ud Din Muradabadi was also a direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi. in 1915c he travelled to Bareli and studied directly under Ahmad Raza Khan and after a year or so Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan gave him an ijazah for all of his books and islamic sciences and wrote the ijazah with his own hand. (Shahansha Baghdad p.89-91, Fadhail Mustafa p.6+)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #333300;">In this way Abul Barkat Syed Ahmad was a student of the students of Ahmad Raza Khan via 2 routes and also had direct ijazah from Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi himself, it obviously does not get any closer than that. So Tahir ul-Qadiri has again direct chain to Ahmad Raza Khan via one person. Dear readers this shows how</span> the fighting between the Barelwis despite their close ties to each other and being direct students of Ahmad Raza. You see, its very easy throwing allegations and making points of confusion all day long against the Salafi&#8217;s and the Ahl al-Hadith but the fact of the matter is the differences between the Sufi Barailwi&#8217;s is of precedent levels. Also remember the very same students of Abul Barkat are the ones refuting and issuing fatawa&#8217;s against Tahir ul-Qadiri and vice versa. This is their reality due to their Sufi Tariqahs and factionalism. The students Abul Barkat are known as Barkati&#8217;s, yet another group and tariqah to disunite and separate the Muslims.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Saqib &#8216;Shami&#8217; delivered a talk a few years back, parts of which were uploaded on to youtube titled as, &#8220;<em>Death of Ibn Taymiyyah What Really Happened? Did (BIDDAH &amp; SHIRK) Take Place?&#8221;</em> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Saqib is based at this centre</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7457 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-1.jpg?resize=540%2C419" alt="kunz-1" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-1.jpg?resize=300%2C233 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-1.jpg?resize=768%2C596 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C795 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-1.jpg?w=1236 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It has now been revamped with a modern look,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7459 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?resize=529%2C363" alt="kunz-2" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?resize=300%2C206 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?resize=768%2C527 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C703 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?resize=110%2C75 110w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?w=1544 1544w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?w=1236 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Apart from the disastrous distortions and misconstrued interpolations to serve the innocent listeners in the gathering, most of the points do not extend beyond comical digressions and hyped hellenistic delusions. One of the outright lies uttered by Saqib was that Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah wore a Ta&#8217;wiz or talisman (which he cleverly terms as a Dauri &#8211; a subcontinent term for a thick string attached to a type of tawiz) and hence he died with that around his neck etc, the viewers can watch the comical presentation themselves from 5:50 onwards in the video below</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JCPp8Pq4AYM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first deliberate distortion and deceptive lie Saqib utters is that he says the student of Ibn Taymiyyah, Hafiz Ibn Kathir is saying this &#8211; the reason we say a deliberate deceptive because Saqib clearly says he is reading the text and translating it directly. Hence the deliberate lie and an attempt to present such beliefs on Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and Hafiz Ibn Kathir is appalling. If we look at the text of al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah Hafiz Ibn Kathir clearly says</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (18:295+)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ed.Dr. Abdullah bin Abdul Muhsin al-Turki,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Markaz al-Buhuth Wad-Dirasat al-Arabiyyah al-Islamiyyah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">(Riyadh: Dar al-Hajr, 1419/1998) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That Shaykh Alam ud Din al-Birzali said his his Tarikh&#8230;.and then Hafiz Ibn Kathir relays the whole incident and events surrounding the death of Imam Ibn Tayniyyah from al-Birzali! Why did Saqib deliberately omit this very important detail and attempt to present Hafiz Ibn Kathir said all of this. This is surely treacherous and at the very basic level negligent in misquoting peoples names is beguiled narratives, especially when the ardent bigoted individual has animosity for the great Shaykh in question.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Saqib then proceeds to quote allegedly Hafiz Ibn Kathir, that when Shaykh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah died they recovered a &#8216;Dauri&#8217; i.e. a thick string attached to a type of Tawiz. He then offers his 10 pence worth of refutation regarding the matter. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fact of the matter is, anyone who has read the glorious history and life struggles of Shaykh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, his trials and inquisitions will know that he was imprisoned for sticking firmly to the Quran and Sunnah, something his adversaries and the likes of Saqib will have no clue about. Jail is not the most hygienic of places with little access to water and cleansing facilities, one can only but imagine the state of the prisons in those eras and the treatment of those who oppose the creed of the state. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being Imam Ibn Taymiyyah had head lice / nits and the treatment for head lice during that era was to use a string or thread around the neck soaked in mercury or quick silver. This was very common in that era and many people would often wear such strings or threads. There was no Dauri or tawiz as Saqib would like you to believe or deliberately lie to the people. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A person oft quoted by these Sufi&#8217;s Barelwi&#8217;s is their Ibn Batutta, he mentions whilst crossing the Sahara that people in the area would wear strings/threads around their necks due to the area having a lot of lice and the string would have mercury in it which would kill the lice. (Halsall P. (ed.), <em>“Ibn Battuta prepares to cross the Sahara”</em> in <em>Internet Medieval Source Book: Ibn Battuta: Travels in Asia and Africa 1325-1354</em>, (Fordham University Center for Medieval Studies: New York, 2000)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another one of their boys, Ibn Sina (Avicenna) also advocated the use of mercury to kill head lice, others extracted this and used it in a form of a string around the necks. (Carraher C.E., Jr. and C.U.Pittman C.U., Jr., Chapter 1, <em>Organometallic Compounds in Biomedical Applications</em>, Vol.3 page.3 <em>Biomedical Applications,</em> A.S.Abd-El-Aziz (ed.), John Wiley &amp; Sons: Inc. 2004)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No one says wearing, an oxygen mask, inhaler, ECG pads, wires, drips etc are tawiz because everyone is old enough and intelligent to say these are forms of medical treatments. As they were such medical treatments in the times before, furthermore, no one claims or says all the people who used such strings to treat head lice were Tawiz. Dear readers by now you would have realised how far fetched and how appaling this notion was to defame and discredit Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and the Salafi&#8217;s whereas the reality is crystal clear. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the other reports and incidences that are mentioned they have no bearing on Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah as this was done by the general people. On one hand they say we had no followers or Imam Ibn Taymiyyah had no followers except a few fringe people and at the same time they say all of these people were with Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, it is perhaps about time these Sufi Barelwis made their minds up before falling prey to their wobbling sadistic movements. The only difference is that the general Muslims had great love and reverence for Imam Ibn Taymiyyah due to this closeness to Allah via the Quran and Sunnah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the actions of the people are a litmus test, then know for sure, none of Ibn Taymiyyahs followers especially the men, wore bells on their feet and danced like women on graves (as happens in England) or exploited the sexuality of vulnerable women at the Darbars and your holy places and the list is endless if you would like us to continue, e.g. women impregnated under the guise of holy miracles at shrines, filthy naked despicable men sitting around and lets not forget the overwhelming level of Sujud to graves and the living Pirs&#8230;.. I&#8217;m sure you get the point&#8230;.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the very least they have admitted Imam Ibn Kathir was with Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and not a Sufi as some of these people claim. Furthermore, as we have mentioned Hafiz Ibn Kathir quoting al-Birzali does not use any word at all whatsoever which can be even remotely used to denote Tawiz, here are his words,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_0278-1.png"><img class="wp-image-7463 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_0278-1.png?resize=618%2C401" alt="IMG_0278" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_0278-1.png?resize=300%2C195 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_0278-1.png?resize=768%2C500 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_0278-1.png?resize=1024%2C666 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_0278-1.png?w=1236 1236w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_0278-1.png?w=1854 1854w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (18:297)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As you can see dear readers, Birzali says the thread that was used had mercury in it, i.e. al-Zi&#8217;baqu. So we ask 1. why did Mr Saqib deliberately and deceptively leave this very important piece of information out, i.e. that according to you Imam Ibn Taymiyyah was wearing a taw with MERCURY in it, as you can see if he had mentioned this it would have made him look stupid and thus he would have been unable to deceive and lie to the people. Secondly we ask, if you claims this was a Tawiz, show us from your own people A SINLGE PERSON who wears a tawiz with mercury in it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Last but not least we leave you with this fantastic mind boggler which will perhaps go down very well with the Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s because they seem to be very astute at such intellectual marvels and that is if Mr Saqib claims that Imam Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah wore a Tawiz, for head lice, then show us just ONE PERSON from amongst your Sufi Barelwis who uses a Tawiz for head lice, REMEMBER JUST ONE PERSON, we will be waiting very patiently!!! It means the people do not use a tawiz for head lice and thus Imam Ibn Taymiyyah did not use a tawiz at all, let alone for head lice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers this is just one basic reply to such deceptions and disastrous distortions of these people, which they continuously utter to serve their self delusions and misguidance and misguiding others from the true facts.</span></p>
