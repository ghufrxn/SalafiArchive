				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and an established fact, from the time of Ādam Alayhis Salām to the time of Nūh Alayhis Salām for ten generations all the people were upon Tawḥīd, the Millah Waḥidah i.e the one nation i.e the one Dīn of Islām. Then the people became trapped in the deception of shayṭān, and slowly by slowly, they deviated from Tawḥīd and began to commit Shirk. A prophetic ḥadīth as narrated by Ayādh bin Humar Majashī that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said that Allāh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I created all of my servants upon Hunafā i.e clear and pure Dīn of Tawḥīd. Then shayṭān came to them and beguiled them, made them change their Dīn. They made ḥarām what I made ḥalāl for them and he made them equal to me in affairs for which I did not reveal any evidence for.”</em> [Reported in Muslim, Mishkāt al-Masābīḥ [2/460].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Ḥadtīh Qudsī indicates from the time of Ādam Alayhis Salām, all the people were upon Tawḥīd for a long time, until the time just before the time of Nūh Alayhis Salām. Some people became trapped in the plots of shayṭān and the people deviated from the creed of Tawḥīd and began to associate entities (ie partners) with Allāh (the most high), for which Allāh, the most high, did not legislate any proof or evidence. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Allāh, the Most High, sent his Prophets and Messengers to these people who deviated from Tawḥīd in order to rectify their affairs. When Nūh Alayhis Salām went to these mushriks, he informed them of many issues. From them one such point was:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“I do no say to you that I have treasures from Allāh nor do I have knowledge of the unseen.” [Sūrah Hūd: 31]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This clearly shows that Nūh being a great Messenger of Allāh, the most high, and His Prophet, He did not have any such share in the specific attribute of Allāh i.e knowledge of the unseen. Then, How is it possible that someone other than a Messenger can have such a share in this specific attribute of which only belongs to Allāh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nonetheless, it is a reality that from the beliefs of the mushrikīn is that they believed other than Allāh also had knowledge of the unseen, from this attribute of Allāh. Nūh very clearly advised such people who deviated from Tawḥīd that he did not have knowledge of the unseen and that no Messenger or Prophet was equal to Allāh in this attribute.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When our Prophet Muḥammed ﷺ the final messenger, prophecised that his Ummah will follow in the footsteps of the previous nations, in their misguidance and deviation, then at the same instance, He ﷺ also very clearly informed us that people from his Ummah will also worship idols and commit shirk and kufr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence, Thawbān (RaḍiAllāhu Anhu) narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The hour (of Judgement) will not be established up until tribes (groups of people) from my Ummah do not join the mushrikīn to the extent that tribes from my Ummah will worship idols”</em> [Narrated Abū Dawūd, Tirmidhī, Mishkāt [2/465]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ḥurairah (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) narrated the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“At the time of Jahilīyyah, people from my Ummah will also worship idols before the Day of Judgement”</em> [Agreed Upon, Mishkāt [2/481]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similar such reports have been transmitted from ʿĀishah (RaḍiAllāhu Anha) and other companions via numerous chains. Ziyād bin Lūbaid (RaḍiAllāhu Anhu) narrated that</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Messenger of Allāh </em>ﷺ<em> while mentioning that something of fear will occur, He said it will happen when knowledge will be taken away. So, Ziyād Bin Lūbaid (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) asked How will knowledge be taken away when we read the Qurān and teach our children and so on, and this will remain until the Day of Judgement? He </em>ﷺ<em> replied “I thought of you as a person with most understanding in the city of Madīnah, However, you did not understand my point. You see the Jews and Christians reading the Torah and the Injīl but they do not act upon them, and thus the same thing will happen to my Ummah” </em>[Aḥmad, Ibn Majāh, Ḥākim in mursal form, Tirmidhī from Abū Dawūd, Dārimī from Abu Umamāh, Mirʿāh al-Mafātih Sharḥ Mishkāt al-Masābih 1/362]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Taken from Tashih al-ʿAqā’id)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">JazakāAllāhu Khair to Abū Maryam for his help.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated And Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All thanks and praise is due to Allah, we seek His help and forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from the evil within ourselves and the consequences of our evil deeds. Whoever Allah guides will never be led astray, and whoever Allah leads astray will never find guidance. I bear witness there is no God but Allah, alone without any partners, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Verily, the most truthful speech is the Book of Allah, the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, and the worst affairs are newly invented matters. Every newly invented matter is a religious innovation, and every religious innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A brother asked the following question after having presented it to other brothers who were not able to provide a satisfying answer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No doubt it is difficult question and thus the answer will also be difficult and whenever an author passes away there is no way of knowing the basis behind his words or authorship neither is there any way of verifying or presenting questions about any unclear speech.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So what follows inshaAllaah is by far the best possible explanations I can think of in defence of Allaaamah Muhammad Raees Nadwee, May Allaah have mercy on him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The issue was Allaamah Muhammad Raees Nadwee quoted Mulla Alee Qaaree Hanafee Matureedee [1014H] from one his books and he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Mulla Alee Qaaree said in <strong>‘Miftaah al-Quloob’</strong>….”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(in Tas-Heeh al-Aqaa’id pg.350 (Umm ul-Qurra Edn) and pg.426 (Idaarah Buhooth al-Islaamiyyah Jaamia Salafiyyah Edn)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the objection is <strong>‘Miftaah al-Quloob’</strong> is not Mulla Alee Qaaree’s book and if so, the full reference should be provided.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>FIRST ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mulla Alee Qaaree has numerous books, one such book is,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Mugeeth al-Quloob Limaa Yazool Bihi E’llal al-Jaa’a waz-Zanoob”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is about tasawwuf and Mu’waa’iz ie admonition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book has been cited as one of the works of Mulla Alee Qaaree by Muhammad Abdur Rahmaan ash-Shama’a in his journal article titled <em>‘Mulla Alee Qaaree Fehris Mu’alafatuhu Wa Maa Kataba Anhu’ </em>(pg.32-33) (Majallah Afaaq ath-Thaqafiyyah Wat-Turaath Issue no.1, 1414H/1993ce, printed by Markaz Jaam’e al-Maajid Lith-Thaqafah Wat-Turaath, Dubai)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus it is possible Allaamah Muhammad Raees may have referenced this book as <strong>Miftaah</strong> and<strong>Mugheeth</strong> are very similar especially when written in Arabic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It will not also be surprising to know those who have raised this objection will not even be aware of one third of the books authored by Mulla Alee Qaaree.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>SECOND ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Numerous books, in fact many of the books of Mulla Alee Qaaree have been printed over the last 2 centuries and one book has been given different titles, sometimes 2 different or even 3 different titles where as in essence the book is the same and therefore it is possible Allaamah Muhammad Raees may have referred to a book as <strong>‘Miftaah al-Quloob’</strong> which we may know as a different name.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here we are talking about the names of his books which have been printed or even those which are in manuscript form, let us show this</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Adaab al-Mureedeen</em> is also known as <em>Fath Abwaab ud deen</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Itthaaf an-Naas Bi-Fadhal Waj Wa Ibn Abbaas Taraajim</em> also known as <em>Asteenaas an-Naas</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Al-Ajwabatul al-Muhrrah Fil-Baidhah al-Khabeethah al-Munkarah</em> and this same book is known as <em>Ankar Feehaa Alan-Nasara Maa A’taadu Mann Ta’atee al-Baidh Wa Ghair Dhaalik Fee A’yaadhim</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Al-Ahadeeth al-Quddsiyyah al-Arbaa’iniyyah</em> is also knwon as <em>al-Ahadeeth al-Quddsiyyah Wal-Kaalimaat al-Insiyyah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Al-Adab Fee Rajab</em> also known as <em>Mu’waaiz Fee Fadhal Sharh Rajab</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Al-Istinaan Endal Qiyaam Ilas-</em>Salaah also known as <em>Ma’rifah an-Nisaak Fee Fadhal as-Siwaak</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Heenah as-Suniyaat Fee Tabayyeen Ahadeeth al-Mawdoo’aat</em> also known as <em>Asraar al-Marfoo’a Fil Akhbaar al-Mawdooo’aa</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And there are many many example like this. It should also be noted the names of these books are not just on printed books but rather the names of these books differ with regards to their names on the manuscripts and when such is the case what chance to the normal readers have!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So hence again it is possible Shaikh Muhammad Raees Nadwee may have referred to the <strong>‘Miftaah al-Quloob’</strong> which generically maybe known as a different book.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THIRD ANSWER   </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many books especially those propagating and promoting soofism, tasawwuf and alien concepts to Islaam and orthodox Sunnism have been continuously translated from Arabic into Urdu and this has been the case for well over 200 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence thus it is also possible Allaamah Muhammad Raees Nadwee may have referenced an Urdu translation of a book by Mulla Alee Qaaree, which may have been titled <strong>‘Miftaah al-Quloob’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Example Mulla Alee Qaaree wrote a book on the biography and virtue of Shaikh Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee titled, <em>‘Nuzhatul Khaatir al-Faatir Fee Tarjamah</em> (in one manuscript <em>‘‘Manaaqib’</em>)<em>Sayyidee Abdul Qaadir’</em> (printed 1307H / 1890ce, Istanbul). Manuscripts of this book are available throughout the libraries around the world.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book was translated into urdu approximately 35-40 years after the first ever Arabic print in approximately 1930 and it was printed in Lahore, Pakistan. The urdu translation was titled,<em>‘Mahboob al-Atqiyaa Fee Dhikr Sultaan al-Auliyaa’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore again it is possible Shaikh Muhammad Raees may have referenced and referred to a translated book of Mulla Alee Qaaree which might have been titled <strong>‘Miftaab al-Quloob’.</strong> I personally do not have the Arabic book and neither do I think it is easily available, if someone does come across please kindly inform us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This succinctly leads us on to our next point,</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>FOURTH ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Muhammad Raees Nadwee was based in Jaamia Salafiyyah and its very possible he may had access to both books mentioned above in answer number three, and utilised the quote from this book but mistaking referenced it as <strong>‘Miftaah al-Quloob’.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is highly relevant as the quote that is being questioned is regarding the position of Shaikh Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee as quoted via Mulla Alee Qaaree!!! This is not unlikely especially with regards to some of the titles that are formulated for Shaikh Abdul Qaadir al-Jeelaanee’s book with words like Quloob and Miftaah!!!</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>FIFTH ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another plausible explanation is that, as we know in the sub continent it is a common practise, publishing and printing houses reprint books with different titles or names. Sometimes instead of being reprints the publishing houses print these books as their publications and hence they might have given this book a different name which might have been referenced by our Shaikh Muhammad Raees!!!</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>SIXTH ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Raees Nadwee’s style of writing at times is very brief and if one consults his books it is clearly seen he often says, “Refer to the general books of hadeeth…” or “Refer to the general books of rijaal….” and this would often be done in order to keep discussion brief and to the point, this may have been one such point. If the Shaikh was alive then the ahnaaf…… we could have asked him!!!</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>SEVENTH ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also possible that Shaikh Muhammad Raees Nadwee may have made a mistake in mentioning Mulla Alee Qaaree’s name for this quote, as he mentions him directly afterwards for the Sharh Fiqh ul-Akbar quote, which might have been a repetition and yet again it is very likely he might have mentioned Mulla Alee Qaarees for the first quote and made a common mistake of repetition of the author.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is very easily done and even major scholars have fallen short in this regard and there are numerous examples of this, in fact this is so common that only someone who is totally lost will deny this.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>EIGHTH ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Knowing the great Hadeeth Master on a personal level, he would sometimes get his students to write for him, so he would dictate from MEMORY and they would write for him. It is therefore possible this error might have crept in this way.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>NINTH ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Muhammad Raees Nadwees book was a newer edition with additional notes which was printed in 1419H / 1998ce (Jaamia Salafiyyah Edn) in answer to the newer addition of <em>‘ash-Shaahid’</em> authored by the Barailwee’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is highly unusual the Barailwees have decided to raise this objection now after over a decade when the pinnacles and the elite of the Soofiyyah Barailwiyyah of India did not raise any such objections at the time when the book was published  in 1998. So the major Scholars of the Barailwiyyah Soofiyyah had no problem with this quote, so where has this objection come from now!!!!  </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>TENTH ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also very possible and likely that Shaikh Muhammad Raees Nadwee was unsure of the authenticity of this statement attributed to Mulla Alee Qaaree and then to Shaikh Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee and hence the reason no reference was provided!!!! </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ELEVENTH ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Are the objectors even attempting to deny this Aqeedah for Mulla Alee Qaaree, as we know and it is conclusively proven from him via his various well known and respected books that he refuted and denied the Aqeedah of the Omnipresence of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). For example refer to his Mirqaat Sharh Mishkaat and even his al-Mawdoo’aat al-Kabeer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to this, eminent Deobandee Hanafee Scholars have affirmed this for him and so if this is a problem, the barailwees need to take this up with their fellow Deobandee brothers.</span></p>
