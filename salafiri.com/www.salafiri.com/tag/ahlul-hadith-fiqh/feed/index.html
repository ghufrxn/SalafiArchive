				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Sunnah is to look at and focus on the index finger during tashahhud and not to extend the sight beyond the index finger. This view of the Ahlul Hadith is supported by a number of textual evidences.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The First Evidence </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Abdullah b. az-Zubayr narrates from his father, az-Zubayr RadhiAllahu Anhuma narrates the Prophet Sallalalhu Alayhi Wasallam</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong><em>“His sight did not go beyond the pointing (of his index finger) [meaning he focussed on his index finger]”</em></strong> (Abu Dawud (no.990), Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (no.718), Sahih Ibn Hibban (al-Ihsan) (3/201 no.1941), al-Bayhaqi, Sunan al-Kubra (2/190 no.2790), al-Baghawi, Sharh as-Sunnah (no.677) and its chain is Hasan while its origin is in Sahih Muslim (no.579).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Muhammad b. Ajlan in the chain transmits by An’ana however, in <strong>Musnad Ahmad</strong> (4/3 no,16145), <strong>al-Fath ar-Rabbani</strong> (4/115) he clarified he heard the hadith directly. This hadith was <strong>graded authentic</strong> by Imams Abu Awanah, Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban while an-Nawawi and Ibn Mulaqqin <strong>graded the chain authentic</strong>. (Mustakhraj Abi Awanah (no.2018), Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (no.718), Sahih Ibn Hibban (al-Ihsan) (no.1941), Khulasah al-Ahkam (1/427), at-Tawdhih (7/32).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Shaykh Shams ul-Haq al-A’zimabadi said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">“That is that his sight follows the pointing (of his finger) since it is the etiquette of conforming to humility. It means he does not look at the sky with signifying Tawhid which is the practise of some people, rather he should look at his finger and not beyond this.” (A’wn al-Ma’bud (3/197)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Shaykh Abdur Rahman al-Mubarakpuri said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">“Benefit: The Sunnah is that a person should not look beyond the pointing of his finger as the aforementioned hadith of Ibn az-Zubayr mentions. It should be pointed towards the Qiblah with the intent of indicating at-Tawhid and sincerity.” (Tuhfatul Ahwadhi (2/160).  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Someone might argue this is not the meaning of this hadith, that the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam fixated on his index finger, but it means he did not look beyond his index finger yet his focus could have been on anything closer than his index finger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imam Ibn Khuzyamah clarifies this doubt through his chapter title and hence shows this was the view of the early Ahlul Hadith, Imams of Hadith and Sunnah. He adds the chapter, <strong>“To Look at the [index] Finger While Pointing with it in Tashahhud.”</strong> (Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (1/355 no.718). Imam al-Bayhaqi wrote the following chapter heading, <strong>“The Sunnah is not to Look Beyond the Pointing of the Finger.”</strong> (as-Sunan al-Kubra (2/90)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The Second Evidence</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong><em>“On the authority of Abdullah b. Umar, He saw a man moving pebbles with his hand while praying. When he finished, Abdullah said to him: “Do not move the pebbles since you are praying, for that is from Shaytan. Rather do what the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam used to do.” He said: &#8220;What did he used to do?” He said, &#8220;He would put his right hand on his right thigh, and point with the finger next to his thumb [index finger] towards the Qiblah, and he would look at it (the pointing of the finger) or thereabout.” Then he said: &#8220;This is what I saw Allah’s Messenger Salallahu Alayi Wasallam doing.”</em></strong> (an-Nasa’i (no’s.1160, 1265, 1266), its chain is authentic and its origin is in Sahih Muslim (no.580), Abu Dawud (no.987), Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (no.719), Sunan al-Kubra (2/132)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">This hadith was <strong>graded authentic</strong> by Imams Abu Awanah, Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban. (Mustakhraj Abi Awanah (no.2017), Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (no.719), Sahih Ibn Hibban (3/202 no.1944) and Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Sunan an-Nasa’i.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imam an-Nasa’i placed in under the following chapter: <strong>“Where to look During Tashahhud</strong>.” (Sunan an-Nasa’i (no.1160). Imam Abu Awanah Israfayni established the following chapter<strong>, “In Clarifying in Pointing with the Finger to the Qiblah and Fixating on it.”</strong> (Mustakhraj Abu Awanah (1/539 no.2017).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Shaykh Muhammad Ataullah Hanif al-Bhojiyani said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">“Meaning – he would turn his sight to his finger and Naf’i said when Abdullah b. Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma would sit in prayer he would place his hands on his knees and point with his finger and fix his sight on it and he then said, Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <strong><em>“This is more severe on shaytan than an iron rod.”</em></strong> (Ahmad (2/119) as cited in Mishkat.” (at-Ta’liqat as-Salafiyyah A’la Sunan an-Nasa’i (2/178).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imam an-Nawawi said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">“It is from the Sunnah not to look beyond the pointing of the finger.” (Sharh Sahih Muslim (6/81). </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">He further said while expanding on the issue of pointing with the finger,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The fifth: Not to move your sight beyond the pointing of the finger, al-Bayhaqi and others used the hadith of Abdullah b. az-Zubayr as evidence that the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam placed his right hand (on his right knee) and pointed with his finger and his sight did not go beyond it. And Abu Dawud transmitted it with an authentic chain and Allah knows best.” (al-Majmu’ Sharh al-Muhazzab (3/302).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Hafiz Ibn Rajab said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">“Our Companions said it is recommended when a person sits for tashahhud not to look beyond the pointing of the finger.” (Ibn Rajab, Fath ul-Bari (6/369).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Shaykh Abdul Aziz b. Baz said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">“The Sunnah when sitting (in prayer) is to look at the pointing of the finger when sitting for tashahhud or between the two sujud.” (Ibn Baz, Majmu’ Fatawa (29/241).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Shaykh Muhammad b. Salih al-Uthaymin said something similar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">While some madhhabs advocate looking at ones lap or the area between the thighs!!! And according to another opinion, to generally look at the lap and only at the index finger when indicating with it. The Sunnah and hadith of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam takes precedence over all other opinions.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Fazilatush Shaikh Abdullah Nasir Rehmani</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Amir Jamiyyah Ahlul Hadith Sindh</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>[1] When Fasting Is Obligated</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The obligation of fasting the month of Ramadhan commences when the month begins. The commencing or beginning of the month is determined in three ways,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The First Way</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Through observing the moon. Allah says <strong>“…So whoever of you sights (the crescent) the month (of Ramadhan) he must observe the fasts…” (Surah al-Baqarah:185)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <strong>“Fasting by observing (the moon crescent).”</strong> (<em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> (1909), <em>Sahih Muslim</em> (1081/19).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Therefore, fasting becomes obligatory upon the who observes the moon.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The Second Way</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">An individual does not see the moon himself but reports of observation are conveyed to him. If the one who saw or the one relaying the news is trustworthy, honest and obligated of the commands of Allah, their reports will be accepted. This is supported by the narration of Abdullah bin Amr RadhiAllahu Anhu who said<strong>, “Once people were in doubt regarding the observation of the moon and so I informed Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam that I had seen the moon. He Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam then fasted himself and ordered others to also fast.”</strong> (<em>Abu Dawud </em>(2342), <em>Ibn Hibban</em> (3447), <em>Hakim</em> (1541), <em>ad-Daraqutni</em> (2127)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The Third Way</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">By completing 30 days of the month of Sha’ban If on the 29<sup>th</sup> the moon is not observed. Whether this is due to clouds, poor visibility or other environmental factors. The evidence for this is the statement of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, <strong>“A month can be 29 days so do not (begin [the month]) fast until you see (the moon) and break the fast (ie end the month) until you see (the moon) and if its overcast then complete the month (ie. 30 days).</strong>” (<em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> (1907), <em>Sahih Muslim</em> (2499) and its Muslims wording)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">We have specified the meaning of the words <strong>“then complete the month”</strong> to mean 30 days by using the hadith of Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu which mentions, <strong>“If it is overcast, complete 30 days (of Sha’ban)”</strong> (<em>Sahih al-Bukhari </em>(1909), <em>Sahih Muslim</em> (2516) and its Muslims wording).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Remember, it is impermissible to fast on the day one has doubts about it. Ammar bin Yasir RadhiAllahu Anhu said, <strong>“Whoever fasted on the day they doubted have disobeyed Abul Qasim Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.”</strong> (<em>Imam al-Bukhari</em> transmitted this in Kitab as-Sawm, Chapter: Fast when you see the crescent, in ta’liq form)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Similarly, fasting a day or two before Ramadhan is also impermissible. Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <strong>“</strong><strong>None of you should fast a day or two before the month of Ramadhan unless he has the habit of fasting </strong>(eg Modays or Thursday)<strong> then he may fast that day.&#8221;</strong> (<em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> (1914), <em>Sahih Muslim</em> (1082),<em> Musnad Ahmad</em> (7722).</span></p>
