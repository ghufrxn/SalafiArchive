<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[1] </strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1250H-1326H </strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(1834c-1908c)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the early 2000’s we compiled short biographies of some of the scholars of the sub continent, we also mentioned they were summaries of detailed biographies which were delayed in being published for some reason or another. In additional to the fact that in recent years, unfortunately some imprudent ignorant people from Birmingham began to say our dawah was to the scholars of ‘India and Pakistan,’ despite the sheer ignorance of such people and being totally clueless and oblivious of the dawah of the scholars before, we thought it was time and most pertinent to share some of the biographies of these great luminaries of the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafi’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was the summarized biography which has been since amended and updated by this biography.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[Biography] – Allamah Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani [1326H]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">http://www.salafiri.com/biography-allamah-muhammad-bashir-Sahaswani-1326h/</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is Allamah Kabir Muhammad Bashir bin Hakim Muhammad Badr al-Din bin Sadr al-Din al-Faruqi al-Sahaswani. He is not in need of any introduction, he is the renowned Scholar, the <em>Muhaddith</em>, the jurist, the debater, the teacher, the <em>mufti</em>, the admonisher and speaker. <em>(Forty Scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65 and Hayat nazir p.173 both of Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whenever Sahaswan is mentioned Shaikh Muhammad Bashir is the first one who comes to mind. <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab bayna mu’idihah wa mu’aridahah fi shabbah al-qarihah al-hindiyyah p.63 of Shaikh Abul Mukarram bin Abdul al-Jalil)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Family Roots and Background</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His lineage traces back to Umar ibn al-Khattab (RadhiAllahu Anhu). His grandfather was a resident of Thanesar which is in western Punjab, which he left and settled in Sahaswan. He had studied with various scholars and was known to be upright and righteous. <em>(Dabistan hadith p.216 of Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father, Hakim Muhammad Badr al-Din Faruqi was a Doctor and resided in Lucknow due to his work in the early years of the Shaikh’s life and this is where he received his early education, under the guidance of his father. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250 of Shaikh Imam Khan Nawshahri, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.379-380 of Muhammad Qadi Aslam Sayf Fairuzpuri)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father was a renowned physician who had learnt and studied Medicine at the hands of the experts of the Day which included the likes of Shaikh Shah Rafi al-Din Muhaddith Dehlawi. He also studied Ibn Sina’s classical Medical magnum opus <em>‘al-Qanun.’ </em>The Shaikhs father would treat everyone ranging from poor to the elite and even received honorary titles from the ruler of Oudh. He also had knowledge and had studied the Islamic sciences. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dabistan hadith p.216, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237 oh Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi, Forty Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith p.65)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father died in approximately 1260H/1844c and at the time Shaikh Muhammad Bashir was approximately 10 years old. Thereafter he returned to his native area of Sahsawan with his mother.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Birth of the Allamah Kabir</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani was born in approximately 1250H/1834c in Sahsawan which is in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Sahaswan is an old city with rich history. Sahsawan had always been a city of learning and Islamic sciences and a great number of scholars hailed from there. Likewise, and similarly a large number of Ahl al-Hadith scholars used to live in Sahaswan <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.379-380, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237, Forty Scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The historians and biographers have differed with regards to his exact date of birth. Shaikh Idris Nigrami mentions his birth to have been in 1240H in <em>‘Tazkirrah Ulama Hal’</em> where as Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hassani mentions 1254H in his <em>‘Nuzhat al-Khawatir.’</em> Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions that he was born approximately in the middle of the century and he was no more 8-9 years old when his father died. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:437)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abul Muakkaram mentions his birth day to be 1245H <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous Ahl al-Hadith historian, Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti mentions his date of birth as 1252H (1836-1837c) <em>(Dabistan hadith p.217)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The biographers have generally accepted his birth to have been around the years 1250H-1251H based on the statement of the Shaikhs student.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some Ahl al-Hadith historians and researchers have mentioned another Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani who died in 1321H who authored <em>‘Tabsirah al-naqid,’ </em>we were unable to find anything on this Shaikh and perhaps it is a mistake in the citation of the name and also the potential difficulty in reading the hand writing and script from books of that era. <em>(Was Islam Spread in the Subcontinent due to the efforts of the Sufiyyah, p.154 of Shaikh Ghazi Uzair)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani, who spend a lot of time under the tutelage of Shaikh Sahaswani authored a book on the biographies of the scholars of Sahaswan titled, <em>‘al-Yaqut al-marjan fi zikr ulama Sahaswan.’</em> Which is often referred to as ‘<em>Hayat al-ulama’ </em>and we will also refer to it with the same name here on in.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Pursuit of Knowledge</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Early Days in Sahaswan and Lucknow</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh began his studies with his father who had himself studied in Delhi and thus spent time with notable luminaries of the era. After returning to Sahaswan he began to study under Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan for approximately 10 years or so. Then in 1273H/1856c, just after the period of mutiny was subsiding he travelled to Lucknow and studied with the Scholars of Farangi Mahal from the likes of Shaikh Hidayahtullah Khan Rampuri, Shaikh Wajid Ali Banarasi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also studied with his paternal cousin, Shaikh Nur al-Hasan Sahaswani whilst in Matharah. He studied the Islamic sciences of tafsir, hadith, fiqh and usul <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.217, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Studies with Shaikh Muhaddith Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After Lucknow the Shaikh travelled to Delhi to study with Allamah Imam Sayyid Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, he studied Hadith, Fiqh and Tafsir with him and also obtained chains for ahadith from him Ie ijazat. He studied the two Sahihs and the four sunans. He also obtained (isnad) chains of hadith from Allamah Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin Ansari al-Yamani who was the Qadi of Bhopal. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Dabistan hadith p.217, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237-238, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Teachers from the Najd</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Shaikh travelled to the Hijaz and Najd to perform Hajj he studied with the likes of Shaikh Ahmad bin Ibrahim bin Isa al-Sharqi al-Najdi (d.1329H) and Shaikh Muhammad bin Abd al-Rahman Saharanpuri who migrated to Makkah and respectively attained ijazahs in hadith. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Transformation</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was upon the way of taqlid in his early years until his studies and the constant diligent nurturing of his first teacher, Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan Sahaswani who instilled the love and admiration of the Quran and Sunnah. Thereafter the Shaikh abandoned taqlid and held firmly onto the Kitab and Sunnah and the manhaj of the Salaf. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90-91, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani said when Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani studied the books of Ulum Aqliyyah, Mantiq, philosophy, Fiqh and Usul he leaned towards taqlid and the hanafi madhab and would issue legal edicts based on it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, when he sat in the lessons of Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan and benefitted from his manhaj, Shaikh Sahaswani’s inclination for research grew stronger, leading him to follow the Quran and Sunnah, he would refer to it in every issue. He adopted the manhaj of Amal bil-Hadith and believed it was obligatory to abandon the taqlid of specific people and opinions. <em>(Hayah al-ulama p.91, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Spreading the Quran and Sunnah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani was essentially a teacher and spent all of his life learning and teaching.  Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il al-Salafi also comes to this conclusion in his introduction to Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi’s <em>‘Ma’yar ul-haq,’he </em> categorises the Shaikhs students into, writers, debaters, teachers and so on where he says Shaikh Sahaswani was more of a teacher and educationalist. <em>(Introduction to Ma’yar ul-haq</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the beginning he spent a year teaching in Bangladesh and then another year in Bihar. This was followed by 15 years of teaching as a professor in Akbarabad, Agra in a college. This is what he would do in the day and then in the evening he would teach Quran and Hadith and conduct lessons at his house. There would be a constant flow of students to his gatherings of learnings during the day and the evening, the students would benefit greatly from his knowledge. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Time in Bhopal </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During this era Shaikh Allamah Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan was active in Bhopal due to his family. At the request of Allamah Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan in 1295H/1878ce Shaikh Sahaswani was appointed as a teacher in Madrassah Shah Jahaniyyah in Bhopal after leaving Agra and he remained there for sometime. Shaikh Sahaswani was given great respect and a high position in the teaching circles and was essentially made the head of all the learning faculties. <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst in Bhopal the Shaikh would deliver lectures and sermons and the Shaikh was such a prolific speaker and orator, most of the gathering would cry due to the fear of Allah due to the Shaikh reminding them of the affairs of the Din and Dunya. He would also deliver lectures in the residence of the leaders, who would also cry to the power of his admonitions. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:251, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani had been in Bhopal for approximately 12 years. In these 12 years both scholars worked together. Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan would write books and Shaikh Sahaswani would answer all the question that were presented and in this was why Shaikh Sahaswani was known as the Mufti. At the same time Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin Ansari al-Yamani was also in Bhopal and he was the Qadi. Bhopal flourished with Ilm and became a powerful learning centre for the Salafi’s and Ahl al-Hadith. <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.376-380, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Later around 1307H/1890c after the death of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan, the atmosphere of Bhopal was changing and Shaikh Sahaswani thought it was time to move on to Delhi. The family of Shaikh Siddiq Hasan Khan were unhappy with his decision due to the great benefit and knowledge he would propagate to the people and therefore he remained in Bhopal for longer. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The historians and biographers differ how long Shaikh Sahaswani’s stayed in Bhopal with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hassani saying 30 years and Shaikh Imam Khan Nawshahri saying 24 years. It seems more appropriate that he stayed in Bhopal for approximately 24 years because this is in line with other information. Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti mentions 25 years.  After Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan’s death Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani remained in Bhopal after another 12 years making his total time in Bhopal as 24 years. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252-253, Dabistan hadith p.220, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During this period Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan and Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi had an exchange of a book debate, where they both wrote books against one another. Shaikh Lucknowi alleged that Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani was the actual one writing the books under Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan’s name. Shaikh Sahaswani crushed this false allegation and clarified he was not the one writing the books. Shaikh Lucknowi later accepted this. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.93, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:251, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the wife of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan died in 1319H/1901c, the situation of Bhopal had changed with the new authority having a different approach to the Islamic sciences. It was at this time Shaikh Sahaswani thought it was time to move on. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.94, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Time in Delhi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh left Bhopal in approximately 1319H and spent approximately 6-7 years in Delhi where he taught Tafsir and Hadith, he also published some books and engaged in answering the general questions of the people ie Ifta. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.381)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh continued to teach in the place of his teacher, Shaikh Muhaddith Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi after his death in Delhi and he remained in this position until he died. Allamah Sahaswani was an exceptional orator, he gave circles in explanation of the Quran for years in Delhi and many scholars of that time would sit in his lessons.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>An Example of His Exemplary Character and Being Firm Upon Islam</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh only had a one son who was born in 1288H whose name was Nazir Hussain upon the name of his teacher Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi.  The Shaikh concentrated on the well being and nurtured his son upon the Quran and Sunnah and was fervently diligent in educating and teaching him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Eventually the Shaikh married his son off at the tender age of 17. However, after just 6 months the Shaikhs son died in 1305H. This was a very difficult and testing time for the Shaikh, losing an only son at such a young age and even that after 6 months of marriage. The Shaikh remained patience and continued his teaching and worship of Allah. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255-256)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh also set a precedent in his era which was unheard of and in fact was frowned upon due to the Hindu culture and practices that were prevalent in society at the time which did not bother the Shaikh nor did he care. The Shaikh arranged another marriage for his daughter in law with his own expense. Even during this era, the Muslims were affected by the hindu culture and they would think it was a bad and disliked practice for the woman to get married again. In this way the Shaikh put into practice what he had learnt and studied with his teachers.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What the Scholars Said About Him</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Bashir was well known for his knowledge and deep insight into the affairs of the Quran and Sunnah and numerous scholars testified to this including his teachers, from there were the likes of,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi praised Shaikh Sahaswani for his knowledge of the Quran and asks the family of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan to instruct Shaikh Sahaswani to start writing a tafsir of the Quran as others will not be as capable as him. <em>(Makatib naziriyyah p.159)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hussian bin Muhsin Yamani wrote in a letter to Shaikh Shams al-Haq A’zimabadi,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“May Allah have mercy on our brother al-Allamah Muhammad Bashir who is an Alim and Muhaqqiq who holds onto the Quran and Sunnah.”</em> <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams al-Haq A’zimabadi considered Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani from amongst the foremost students of Shaikh Sayyid Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi. <em>(Ghayah al-maqsud fi hal sunan abi dawud 1:59)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allamah, the Shaikh was the epitome of knowledge and the pride of the Khalaf to the Salaf in his virtue and good qualities. He was a mujaddid of the Din in the late era, the Imam of the time and a mujtahid mutlaq.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Sahaswan in an area which has produced scholars for years and if a scholar did emerge from there, it would not be unusual or something unheard of. However, a scholar of his caliber being born in the 13/14<sup>th</sup> century gave his era radiance and his area of Sahaswan such recognition that it will be forever remembered.” (Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Rashid Rida said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was the Shaikh, Muhammad Bashir al-Sahaswani, May Allah have mercy on him, he was from the powerful Scholars of India and from the major scholars of hadith, he encompassed the various science of the Shari’ah and other than it, coupled with actions based upon knowledge, taqwa and righteousness.”</em> <em>(Muqaddimah siyanah al-insan p.14)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hassani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Shaikh al-Fazil al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Muhammad Bashir al-Umari al-Sahaswani, a famous and well know scholar of India. … he was from the major scholars. He had piety and taqwa, he was righteous and upright. He was a genius with lofty manners and he had complete mastery over Usul al-Fiqh.”</em> <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:437-438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions great praise for him, his excellent and loft qualities he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I benefitted from the Shaikh with regards to knowledge of the texts and interpretation whilst he was in Agra and Bhopal. A whole group of students in fact the whole city of Dehli would benefit from his knowledge as we would deliver lessons and lectures on various sciences and disciplines. He would deliver a lesson every day for two hours after Fajr on the explanation of the Quran and Haidth and the people would travel far and wide to come to listen to him.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi goes onto say he would would teach the students the Quran and Hadith directly and he would answer questions on various in great depth and research like a mujtahid. He would also deliver lessons after jumu’ah on the Quran and Hadith in Masjid Qadi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was only interested and fervently followed the Quran and Sunnah and he was only interested in the victory of the truth. He set the precedence of knowledge in Bhopal and in fact in the whole of India and thereby established his rank and status in terms of his knowledge and powerful deductions of ijtihad. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Badi al-Din Shah al-Rashidi al-Sindi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Shaikh of the Mashaykh. The one and only, The Muhaddith of his time, the embodiment of taqwa, the revered scholar, the one who acted upon Islam completely, Shaikh, the well known Muhammad Bashir bin Badr al-Din Sahaswani he died in 1306H (this is a typo in the book it should be 1326H) , he authored ‘Siyanah al-Insan an waswasah al-shaikh dahlan’ which caused devastation in the circles of Ahl al-Bid’ah, he also wrote 3 treatises on the visitation of the Prophets (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) grave, ‘al-Qawl al-muhkam, al-Qawl al-mansur and al-Sa’i al-mashkur (Itmam al-hujjah)’(Muqaddimah hidayah al-mustafid p.96-97) </em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Shaikhs as a Debator</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Book Debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Shaikh Sahaswani went to the Hijaz to perform Hajj he saw some of the practices of the people in their veneration of the Prophets grave and saying the visiting of the grave was pillar of Hajj. Upon his return to India he authored a book on the subject titled, <em>‘al-Qawl al-muhaqqiq al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em> Some authors have cited the book as, ‘<em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani cites the book as <em>‘al-Qawl al-muhaqqiq al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em> This is essentially a primary source as it comes directly from the Shaikhs students. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.91</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri cites the name as <em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhaqqiq al-Muhkam…</em>’ <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Indian Shaikh and researcher Shaikh Uzair Shams perhaps also relied on the latter two Mashaikh and thus also mentions the name of the book as <em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhaqqiq al-Muhkam…</em>’ Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti also mentions the book with the same name. <em>(Dabistan hadith p.219)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This led to a book debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hanafi Lucknowi of Farangi Mahalli who was of the fervent opinion of the obligation and necessity to visit the Prophets grave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi wrote a reply titled <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mubram Fi Radd al-Qawl al-Muhkam’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani wrote a counter replied titled, <em>‘al-Qawl al-Mansur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi wrote his reply to the counter reply titled, <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur Fi Radd al-Qawl al-Mansur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Lucknowi in <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur’ </em>failed to answer the the main pivotal points and in return relied heavily on Subki’s arguments and <em>‘Shifa al-Siqam.’</em> Shaikh Sahaswani knew of Hafiz Ibn Abdul Hadi’s answer to al-Subki, ie <em>‘al-Sarim al-Munki’ </em>however Shaikh Sahaswani did not have the book. After a lengthy and exhausting search the Shaikh found the book wrote a follow up titled, <em>‘Itmam al-Hujjah Ala Man Awjab al-Ziyarah Mithal al-Hujjah al-Ma’ruf al-Madhab al-Ma’thur Fi Ziyarah Sayyid al-Qabur’ </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi replied with <em>‘al-Sai’i al-Mashkur Fi Radd al-Madhab al-Ma’thur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The latters reply was all regurgitation and repetition of the same arguments. Shaikh Lucknowi relied heavily on Subki’s <em>‘Shifa al-Siqam’</em> as mentioned and on the writings of Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Haithami. Shaikh Lucknowi overlooked the counter replies and arguments and thus in this regard the book <em>‘Itmam al-Hujjah’</em> remains by far the most comprehensive reply to all of the Sufi arguments even today. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani showed the contradictions, inconsistencies and irregularities from the own words of Shaikh Lucknowi from his books and then showed Shaikh Lucknowi’s contradictions from his other books. The discussions ranged from Usul al-Hadith, Usul al-Fiqh and rijal. Shaikh Sahaswani would first quote Shaikh Lucknowi from his book <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur’</em> and then answer all of his arguments in a writing style showing a written debate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani also wrote the reply to Shaikh Lucknowi’s <em>‘Madhab al-Ma’thur’</em> but it was never published and also due to the fact that Shaikh Sahaswani felt the arguments were just irrelevant repetitions and that he had already answered the claims anyway and also penned answers in his other book <em>‘Siyanah al-Insan’</em> as his student Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92, </em><em>Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:254)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both Scholars had mutual respect for each other and did not leave the realms of the Quran and Sunnah whilst addressing each other and the detailed issues.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Debate with the Mulhid Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani was an excellent debater and was very sharp Alhamdulillah. When the disbeliever Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani Hanafi challenged Allamah Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi for a debate, however as Allamah Nazir Hussain was very busy and also frail due to age. All of his students gathered to debate and he chose and Allamah Sahaswani to have a written debate with Mirza Qadiyani Hanafi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani came to Delhi around 1312-1313H and had issued a poster challenging for a debate as Shaikh al-Allamah Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi was one of the first scholars in the whole world to declare him to be a disbeliever. In those days sometimes they would have a written debate someone would be challenged and then they would respond to each other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The responses would usually be sent to each other via messengers depending on the place of residence. What was interesting is that Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani in order to show his bold nature in an attempt to fool the people of India thought he would come to Delhi as in go to the lions den in popular proverbs.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani came from Bhopal for the debate and began the written debate with Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani. One of the treacherous tricks of Mirza Qadiyani was when the other party would accept his challenge for a debate, he would digress and diverge into the conditions of the debate so that he would have an option to runaway from the debate. The Sufis and Barelwis of today also do the same, big mouths with little actions. Anyhow, Shaikh Sahaswani was an erudite Scholar and knew of such tricks so he said at the very beginning I agree with all of your conditions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence the debate took place which was concerning the living of the Messiah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mirza Qayani presented the ayah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>when Allah said, &#8220;O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve (Surah Ale Imran:56)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani recited</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>And there is none from the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe (in Jesus) before his death. (Surah al-Nisa:159)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This obliterated Mirza Ghulam Qadiyanis points which left him to resort to red herrings and illogical and stupid distortions and manipulation. It is said Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani tried to make different excuses to leave he was unable to answer and counteract the evidence of Allamah Sahaswan, he said he had to go to the train station to pick up his father in law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate continued for a period of 6 days and after the disgraceful fleeing of Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani, Shaikh Sahaswani remained in Delhi for another 2 days and then returned to Bhopal and Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani Hanafi never set foot in Delhi again. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.94-95, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.382, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate took place approximately around in either 1309H or 1312-1313H, showing he was from amongst the first people to refute and rebut the fallacious claims of the Mulhid Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani. This was the position of the Ahl al-Hadith at the very onset and then years later the Hanafi quarters followed, perhaps because he was one of their own. The book was published around 1313H titled <em>‘</em><em>al-Haq as-sarih fi hayat al-masih.’</em> <em>Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63-64)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ahl al-Hadith historians and biographers have differed as to when the debate took place, some have said it took place in 1309H whilst others seem to think it was later in 1312H-1313H <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi, the famous Ahl al-Hadith historian and biographer said he read the book in Shaikh Abdul Majid Seharwardi’s library and that it was printed by Matba’a Ansari in Delhi in 1309H and it was 136 pages. <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66-67)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is possible and plausible, the actual written debate took place in 1309H and the book was later published in 1312-1313H.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Well Known Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh had a huge number of students due to his constant teaching in the various places he taught and travelled to and numerating all of them would be impossible however, some of them were major scholars of Hadith in their own right who themselves produced many other scholars. Some of the students include,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ahmadullah Muhaddith Partabghadhi and Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Sa’id Sharf al-Din Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il Ansari Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Iqtidar Ahmad Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Amir Ahmad Sehswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mazhar Ali Sahaswani (the Shaikhs younger brother)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Wahhab Nabina Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid E’jaz Mu’jiz Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Sattar Umrpuri (The father of Shaikh Abdul Ghaffar Hasan Rehmani)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdur Rahman Bastawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Uthman Aligharhi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Taqi Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdus Samad Bastawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mubarak Ali Akbarabadi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ma’sum Ali Akbarabadi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And manu more</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Sahaswani an an Author</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was a prolific writer as we have already mentioned in his book debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi. The Shaikh was essentially a teacher however he did write some books and what outstanding and monumental books they were. From them we have the revolutionary book which caused havoc amongst the Sufi’s, making them feel things besides their usual wajd (Sufi dances) and esoteric trances!!! </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Siyanah al-insan an waswasah al-shaikh </strong><strong>dahlan &#8211; </strong><strong><em>Protecting The Human From The Satanic Whisperings of Shaikh Dahlan.</em></strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Shaikh Sahaswani went to Hijaz to perform Hajj he had a debate on Tawhid with the Ash’arite and Shafi Mufti Shaikh Ahmad bin Zaini Dahlan. The later also authored <em>‘</em><em>Durar al-saniyyah fi radd ala al-wahhabiyyah.’ </em>Shaikh Sahaswani upon his return to India authored his book answering all of the allegations and distortions of Dahlan as well as his slanderous aspersions against Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. The book is in debate format and contains some very detailed discussions. It was first printed in 1324H/1906c has been printed many times. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92-93, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.64, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.68)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is very important to understand is that after the debate with Shaikh Dahlan, Shaikh Sahaswani returned to India and Shaikh Dahlan also authored his <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah.’</em> Some people may argue Shaikh Sahaswani’s book was only a summary of the verbal debate they had in Makkh and that <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> is not an answer to <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah.’</em> It is very evident that Shaikh Sahaswani’s book more than likely was authored after he looked a <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah’</em> because he answers it in <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> and also the fact that it was published just two years before his death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another clear evidence which supports the aforementioned point is that Shaikh Ahmad Zaini Dahlan died in 1304H, way before Shaikh Sahaswani died and therefore it naturally leads to the conclusion that Shaikh Dahlans book <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah’ </em>was authored at least before 1304H </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Rashid Rida in his introduction to the book said,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In summary it can be said about this book, not only is it a refutation of Shaikh Dahlan or the jurists who have been cited for example Shaikh Taqi al-Din al-Subki and Shaikh Ahmad bin Hajr al-Haithami al-Makki but rather it is also a refutation of all of the grave worshippers and innovators of our time and those to come.”</em> <em>(Muqaddimah siyanah al-insan p.17, cf. </em><em>Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.65-66)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> is still used and it is of great benefit due to its depth and precision in answering the claims and distortions of the innovator grave worshippers. To add the book to date has not been answered!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad bin Zaini Dahlan had other issues, one was his position on the british colonialists, his edict can be read here</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>The Wahabis – Zainee Dahlans Real Opinion &amp; The British</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">also this is a refutation of Subki and Dahlan from the <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em></span></p>

</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is on the obligation of reciting fatihah behind the Imam and again it is a very detailed book answering the points of those who say otherwise. The Shaikh would deliver a lesson everyday after Fajr on this issue for approximately 3 months. The well known hanafi scholars of Delhi would be in attendance and would note every word. The Shaikhs student Shaikh Ahmadullah Dehlawi also noted every word and later published it as a book with this title. This book was published 1327H/1909c <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252-253, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.381, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.68)</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is on the issue of the permissibility of sacrificing on Eid al-Adha until the end of the month, this was an odd opinion of the Shaikh in which he opposed the people of knowledge. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The contentions that is well known amongst Ahl al-Sunnah is whether it can be done for 4 days.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh initially published a general poster in Bhopal on this issue after the death of Shaikh Nawab siddiq Hasan Khan. This was one such view which Shaikh Sahaswani erred on and his teacher Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin al-Yamani wrote a treatise answering Shaikh Sahaswani’s points as did another prominent student of Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, none other that the Imam of Hadith and Rijal in his own right, Shaikh al-Allamah Abul Mukarim Muhammad Ali Mu’i titled <em>‘Umdah al-tahqiq fi ithbat al-dhihayah ila akhir ayam al-tashriq’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani mentions Shaikh Sahaswani wrote a book collecting the evidences as well as his research into a book, however it was never published in reply to some of the points raised by the aforementioned scholars. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.95) </em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate which Shaikh Sahaswani had with Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani on the issue whether the messiah was alive, this was authored in book form with some additional points and printed with this title around 1313H.</span></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="13">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Ayam al-safar</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi mentions this as one of the works of Shaikh Sahaswani, other biographers have not mentioned this. <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said Shaikh Sahaswani wrote many books, some which were lost and other unprinted. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahsawani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani, who was also his student during his time in Bhopal and Delhi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He wrote many other treatises on the affairs of the Din which were attributed to some of his students.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Death</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh felt ill whilst in Delhi and passed away on the 29<sup>th</sup> of Jumada al-Ula/ Thani 1326H / 29<sup>th</sup> June 1908c at the age of 74. He was buried next to his teacher Shaikh Allamah Sayyid Nazir Hussain, in the Shaidipura graveyard. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hassani has yet made another mistake in his biographical entry for Shaikh Sahaswani where he says that he died in 1323H. <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Salafis and Ahl al-Hadith lost a great scholar who truly answered the grave worshipping innovators. It is therefore without a doubt that Shaikh Sahaswani is considered and will be known as one of the scholars who subdued and kept them at bay.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was from the scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith who they all respected. It is a shame just as the learning places and institutions were deprived of someone to replace the scholars, it was the same case with Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani, that there has been no one like him from Sahaswan or from the general Ahl al-Hadith”</em> <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah forgive him and shower him with her mercy, Amin</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Ma’ayar ul-Haq Fi Tanqid Tanwir ul-Haq</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh al-Kul al-Allamah Nazir Hussain Muhadith Dehlawi (1320H)</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Muqallid Excuse Of Not Being Able To Act On The Quran and Hadith</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence it is proven a scholar upon the way of Hadith (non muqallid) whilst making knowledge based deductions should not make Taqlid of a Mujtahid in the texts of an issue, even though the mujtahids statement is in accordance with the Hadith. Yet the people who prohibit us from acting upon ahadith and even though clear manifest truth does not concur with them, one of the lame excuses they put forth in their defence is that acting upon ahadith in current times is extremely difficult.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They say the Quran and Hadith is an ocean of knowledge without any shores and hence understanding and acting on them is the duty of a Mujtahid only (ie not the common people). They say it is not in their permit to understand the Quran and Hadith and even if they were to read and understand the literal translation, they would not know whether a particular Hadith was abrogated or not, what the actual meaning of a text is or if there were any conflicting ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we say we answer this excuse from two angles</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first angle is that the Quran and Hadith is not as difficult, such that no one other than a Mujtahid mutlaq can understand them. On the contrary it is indeed very easy and whoever knows arabic especially and particular the scholars, who will easily and compressively understand the intent and meaning of the Quran and Hadith as is the saying of Allah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And We have certainly made the Quran easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?” (Soorah al-Qamar:17)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His ayaat and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom – although they were before in clear error.” (Soorah al-Jumu’ah:2)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient.” (Soorah al-Baqarah:99)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So whoever says we do not understand the Quran and Hadith despite being a scholar will fall under the punishment mentioned in the aforementioned ayah just as Mawlana Muhammad Ismail Shahid (InshaAllah) has mentioned in the treatise ‘Taqwiyat ul-Iman’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ma’ayar ul-Haq Fi Tanqid Tanwir ul-Haq (pg.70-71)</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Publishers Foreword</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Alhamdullilahi Rabbil A’lamīn, Waṣalatu Wasalam Ala Rasūlillahil Karīm,  Wa, Ba’d</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is before you is part one of a great book of Allāmah al-Albānī ‘Qāmūs al-Bidʿah’ ie <em>‘An Encyclopedia concerning Biʿdah.’</em> The Shaikh started the book but was taken away by Allāh before he could complete it. One of the students of the Shaikh, Shaikh Mashūr Ḥasan Aāl-Salmān and Shaikh Aḥmad Ismāʿīl Shakwakānī took the responsibility on completing the book from the works and lectures of the Shaikh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh has used over hundreds of books, recordings and column pieces written by the Shaikh to try to do justice in order to complete the book. May Allāh bless the Shaikhs who strove to give the reader an amazing text which we hope insha’Allāh can be seen as a legacy of Shaikh al-Albānī in time to come.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The parts will be released gradually and summarised whilst taking from the most relevant and important points. Shaikh Muḥammad Nāṣir ud Dīn al-Albānī discussion on bidʿah at times are very detailed and takes the course of an Usūlī discussion and at times they very succinct and precise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wherever possible the translators have attempted to keep to the method and style of the Shaikh in order to give the readers a better comprehension of the thought of his Imām of Ahlus Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Last but not least, this work alone is a testament of Imām al-Albānīs deep comprehension, interpolation and deductions which is no ordinary feat and at the same instance it silences the ardent and staunch detractors of the Imām.    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allāh accept it from everyone involved, Amīn. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was fervent in his efforts to highlight bidʿah and its manifestations. To have knowledge of bidʿah and that which leads to it is from the chapter of knowledge which is obligatory to learn and understand so one can be saved from Bidʿah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh states in his tremendous book <em>‘al-Ajwibātun Nāfʿe’</em>,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is an obligation for one to know about Bidʿah and it&#8217;s evils as it is through this that a person will be saved and gain closeness to his Lord. Salvation from bidʿah will only be achieved after one is aware of the principles of bidʿah otherwise a person can very easily and unknowingly fall into the evils of bidʿah. It is a well known maxim amongst jurists &#8220;that which leads to fulfilling an obligation is in itself an obligation. the same can be said about the likes of shirk, for it is obligatory to know what will lead to shirk for staying away from it is an obligation.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the companion Huḍaifah ibn al-Yamān (RaḍiAllahu ʿAnhu) narrates that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The people used to enquire from the prophet about good but I used to ask about the evil, so that I could avoid it.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, in this book we shall explore the meaning of bidʿah and its various manifestations. We will also look at types of bidʿah that have crept into the Muslim creed and worship, knowledge of which is a must so that bidʿah can be avoided. May Allah help us all upon his path. Amīn.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>WHAT IS BIDʿAH?</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>LINGUISTIC DEFINITION</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allāmah Albānī records from Imām Ṣiddīq Ḥasan Khān that bidʿah is,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“That for which there is no previous established example [proof]”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE SHARĪʿAH DEFINITION</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh mention in his books <em>‘Salāt at-Tarāwīh’</em> and <em>‘al-Ibdā’</em> that bidʿah in the religion means,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Something introduced into the religion which has a resemblance to the Sharia in some form. One acts upon it in order to worship Allah and get a nearness to him.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE PRINCIPLES OF IBĀDAH [WORSHIP] AND BIDʿAH [INNOVATION] IN ISLĀM. </strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh in his book <em>‘Ḥujjatun-Nabī’ </em>states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“For worship to be accepted before Allāh it must fulfill two basic conditions: a] That it be purely for the sake of Allāh and b] It be in accordance with the book of Allāh and the Sunnah of his Prophet.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>TYPES OF SUNNAH</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>1] Sunnah is of two types:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sunnah Tarkīyyah [that which was left by him] and Fʿilīyyah [that which was said or performed by him].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh explains in <em>‘Ḥujjatun Nabī’</em> that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Should someone perform an action or saying as part of worship, yet those actions or sayings were not performed by the prophet in order to get close to Allah as part of his worship is a something which is in opposition to the Sunnah. This is because Sunnah is of two types being Tarkīyyah and Fʿilīyyah. Therefore, to leave off performing that which the prophet left off is Sunnah. One should consider how there is no adhān call to prayer for the Eīd and Funeral prayer yet to give such a call is to praise Allah.  The prophet left doing this and therefore to also leave this off is considered a Sunnah and that which makes one close to Allah. The blessed companions of the prophet understood how important it was to stay away from and warn from bidʿah. Huḍaifah Ibn al-Yamān (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) narrates that, “All that was left off by the companions of the prophet must be left off” and Abdullāh Ibn <u>Masʿūd</u> (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) said that, “Follow the Sunnah and do not innovate. The Sunnah is sufficient for you so follow it.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2] The saying of the prophet “every bidʿah is misguidance” is to be left upon its general and complete meaning. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh in <em>‘al-Ajwibatun Nāfʿe’</em> states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is narrated by Jābir Ibn ʿAbdullāh (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) that the prophet whilst giving his sermons used to say, &#8216; The best speech is the book of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, and the worst of affairs is that which is innovated, and every innovation is a misguidance”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh states in ‘<em>Masājilah ʿIlmīyyah’</em> that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This shows all bidʿahs in the dīn without restriction are based on and lead to misguidance. Indeed the messenger said “every innovation is misguidance and every misguidance leads to the hellfire.””</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh in his book <em>‘Salāt at-Tarāwīh’</em> whilst recording a statement from <em>‘Majālis ul-Abrār’</em> of Mullā Aḥmad Rūmī Ḥanafī that he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The jurists have said concerning actions such as Ṣalāt ul-Ragā’ib and its pray in congregation, Reciting the Qurān in the bowing and to make remembrance aloud ahead of the funeral procession that these are all from the rejected actions and bidʿah. So the one who says that they are ‘ḥasanah’ [good] it will be said to him in reply, “Those actions which have a proof from the religion as being ‘ḥasanah’ will be ḥasanah due to them not being from bidʿah, in which case the ḥadīth &#8216;every innovation is misguidance&#8217; shall remain upon its unrestricted meaning. So the one who who specifies and makes exceptions to these words of the prophet let him bring an evidence from the book and Sunnah or consensus of the scholars to establish the exception to the general words of the prophet. One cannot rely upon opinions and customs to make exceptions to the ḥadīth of the prophet.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>3] It is necessary to oppose those who reject the truth, regardless of whether the opposers are many or few in number.</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh said at the end of his treatise <em>&#8216;Risālah Eīdain’ </em>that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Regarding the two groups there are those upon the truth and those who oppose. As for the ones upon the truth then they are the ‘jamaʿāh’ [Ahlus Sunnah community]. This is so as they are upon the Sunnah of the prophet and it is about them that the prophet described as “The Jamaʿāh”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a> and in another place he said “They [The Jamaʿʿh] are upon what I and my companions are upon.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><strong>[11]</strong></a> Indeed those who oppose them cannot harm them even if they are greater in number as the prophet said “There never cease to be a group [Jamaʿāh] in my Ummah who shall be manifest upon the truth. Its opposers cannot harm it up until the order of Allah shall come and they shall remain upon it”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><strong>[12]</strong></a> Thus, the believer is not afraid by being shunned by the sheer number of those who oppose the truth. Imām Shaṭibī states in his ‘al-ʿEitiṣām that, “It has been the way of our lord that the  ones upon the truth have been fewer in number than those upon falsehood.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><strong>[13]</strong></a> Allah says. <strong>“</strong></em><strong><em>And most of the people, although you strive [for it], are not believers.</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><em><strong>[14]</strong></em></a> <em>and <strong>“</strong></em><strong><em>And few of My servants are grateful.</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><em><strong>[15]</strong></em></a><em>So it can be said that the one who has intellect and understanding whilst reflecting upon the history of Islām and the prophets before Muḥammad will know that those upon truth have always been the strangers and fewer in number.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><strong>[16]</strong></a> </em></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise be to Allaah who completed the religion for us, perfected the blessing on us and chose Islaam as our religion. May the blessings and peace be upon His servant and Apostle, who called upon people to obey his Lord and cautioned against extravagance, innovation and disobedience; And may Allaah bless his posterity, his companions and those who follow his footsteps till the Day of Judgement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have been acquainted with the article published in the first page of the weekly magazine “Edarat” of the Kanpur, Industrial city of Utter Pradesh in India. The writer alleges that the creed of the Salaf (Early adherents to Islaam) does not agree with the Sunnah. By this, the writer aims at creating division amongst the Ahl-as-Sunnah and encouraging the innovations and superstitions. This attitude, no doubt, is most abominable and dangerous and aims at offending the Religion of Islaam and spreading innovations and deviations from the truth. Furthermore, the article concentrates clearly on the subject of celebrating the Prophet’s birthday (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) as an excuse to discuss the creed of others. Therefore, I consider it necessary to enlighten the People on this subject. So seeking help of Allaah, I say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is not permissible to celebrate the birthday of the Apostle (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) (May the blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him), or somebody else. In fact, it must be stopped, as it is an innovation in the religion. The Apostle of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) neither celebrated it, nor commanded others to do this for himself. or for any one who died before him amongst the Prophets, for his daughters his wives, or his other relatives. The rightly guided Caliphs the Companions of the Prophet (radi-Allaahu ‘anhum) or the successors who rightly followed them did not celebrate this event, nor did any one of the muslim scholars in the centuries before.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They knew the Sunnah of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) best, they loved him more, and followed the Shari’a better than those who came after them. If celebrating his birthday was a good deed, they would have done it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are commanded to follow and forbidden to innovate. This is because of the perfection of the Islaamic religion and the Sufficiency of what Allaah and His Messenger have given us and are accepted by Ahl-al-Sunnah wal-jama’at- The Muslim community of the companions and those who followed them in the best way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is related that the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) that he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong>He who innovates something in this matter of ours that is not of it, will have it rejected.</strong>” [Transmitted by Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to Muslim who reported:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong>Whoever does an act which is not in agreement with our matter, will have it rejected.</strong>“</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another tradition the Prophet said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong>You must keep to my Sunnah and of the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Caliphs, cling to it firmly… Beware of newly invented matters, for every new matter is an innovation and every innovation is misleading.</strong>“</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He used to say in every Friday sermon:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong>The best discourse (speech) is the Book of Allaah and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad the Apostle of Allaah, and the worst matter is that of innovation and every innovation is misleading.</strong>“</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, these traditions contain a strong caution against innovations and a warning that such an act is a deviation from the right course. The Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) warned the people of the gravity of these innovations and of their bad consequences. There are many traditions adduced in this connection.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the Almighty has said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>So take what the Messenger gives you, and refrain from what he prohibits you.</em></strong>” [59:7]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah, Most High said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>Then let those beware who withstand the Messenger’s order, lest some trial befall them. or a grievous Chastisement be inflicted on them.</em></strong>” [24:63]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah, the Almighty said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>You have indeed in the Messenger of Allaah an excellent exempler for him who hopes in Allaah and the final day, and who remember Allaah much.</em></strong>” [33:21]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allaah the Almighty said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>The vanguard of Islaam the first of those who forsook their homes and of those who gave them aid, and also those who followed them in all good deeds, well – Pleased is Allaah with them as are they with Him. For them hath He prepared gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therin forever, that is the supreme Triumph.</em></strong>” [9:100]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allaah, the Almighty said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.</em></strong>” [5:3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This verse decisively indicates that the Almighty Allaah has completed the religion for this Ummah, and has showered His blessings on them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) passed away only after he had imparted the complete message of Allaah to the Ummah as well as his legislations concerning sayings and deeds. He also stressed that all things invented by people and then attributed to the religion of Islaam are innovations and to be rejected, even if their inventors did so in good faith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is established that the Companions of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) and the righteous successors after them warned the people against innovations as they add to Islaam and legislate what is not permitted by Allaah, in line with the enemies of Allaah such as the Jews and the Christians who added to their religion and innovated what was not allowed by Allaah. Moreover, to admit innovation in Islaam is incomplete and imperfect. Such a belief is not only an evil but contradicts the following verse:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>This day have I perfected your religion for you.</em></strong>” [5:3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the sayings of the Prophet which warn us against innovations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To celebrate the anniversary of the birth of Prophet and the others, means that the Religion is not perfected by Allaah (the Glorious, the Almighty) for this Ummah, and the Apostle did not impart to the people what was necessary regarding their religious duties, till these late ones appeared and invented in the religion what is not permitted by Allaah, thinking that this would bring them nearer to Allaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Undoubtedly, this is a great danger and is tantamount to criticzing Allaah the Almighty and the Prophet (Peace be upon him): whereas Allaah the Almighty has already completed the religion and perfected His grace, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) has conveyed the message openly and informed the Ummah of all such ways that will lead them to the Paradise and save them from Hell-fire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to an authentic Hadith, on the authority of Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-As the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong>Allaah Ta’ala (the Almighty) did not send a Prophet but obliged him to lead his people to the best way which is known to him, and warn them against the worst which is known to him.</strong>” [Transmitted by Muslim]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well-known that our Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) is the best of all the prophets, the last and the most perfect of them regarding the way he conveyed the message and advised his people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Had the celebration of Milaad been an act of Religion chosen by Allaah for His servants, the Prophet would have either explained that to his people, would have celebrated it during his life, or his Companions would have done it. As these did not happen, it becomes clear that Islaam has no concern with Milaad. On the contrary, it is one of the innovations against which the Prophet has warned his people as mentioned earlier.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A host of scholars have not only rejected the celebration of Milaad but have warned against it in view of the evidences given above.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to the rule of the Islaamic Sharee’ah all matters regarding legalization or prohibition and all disputes among the people, should be referred to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) in line with the saying of Allaah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>O you who believe obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those charged with authority among you. If ye differ in anything among yourselves, refer it to Allaah and his Messenger, if ye do believe in Allaah and the Last Day: That is best and most suitable for final determination.</em></strong>” [4:59]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allaah The Almighty said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>Whatever it be wherein you differ, the decision thereof is with Allaah.</em></strong>” [42:10]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Referring this issue back to the Book of Allaah, we find it ordaining upon us to follow the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) in his Commandments and warns us against what ever he prohibits. Furthermore it tells us that Allaah has perfected the religion for the people. So, as long as Milaad is not among the teachings of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam), it cannot be a part of the religion which Allaah has perfected for us and asked us to adhere to by following the Prophet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again when we refer this issue back to the Sunnah, of the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam), we do not find either the Prophet or the Companions doing it by themselves or asking others to do it, So it becomes evident that Milaad, is not a part of religion, rather one of innovations and blind immitation of the people of the book, i. e. the Jews and the Christians in their festivals. With this argument in mind, it becomes crystal clear for everyone having the least insight and inclination towards truth and justice, that celebrating any birthday has nothing to do with Islaam. It is rather among the innovations which Allaah and His Messenger (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) warned against emphatically.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A wise man must not be deceived by seeing a large number of people doing it throughout the world because the truth is known and recognized by the evidences of Shari’a and not by the acts of a great number of people. {{Please read: <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://theauthenticbase.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/the-majority-is-not-a-proof-that-something-is-correct-by-sh-saalih-al-fawzaan/">“The Majority Is Not A Proof That Something Is Correct”, By Sh. Saalih Al-Fawzaan</a>}}</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah Ta’ala (the Almighty) says regarding the Jews and the Christians:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>And they say: None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew, or a Christian, those are their vain desires. Say: Produce your proof if ye are truthful.</em></strong>” [2:111]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the Almighty also said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>Were it thou to follow the common run of those on earth, they will lead thee away from the way of Allaah. They follow nothing but conjecture: They do nothing but lie.</em></strong>” [6:116]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Most of these innovations, in addition to their innovatory nature, also do not usually escape from a number of other evils, such as mixed gatherings of men and women, songs accompanied by musical instruments. drinking intoxicants, narcotics and the like. They may also involve the worst thing i. e. the greatest Shirk, through showing exaggeration in the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) and other saints and through praying to him, invoking his help or believing that he knows what is hidden and all similar claims which render a believer as an infidel. It is authentically reported that the Messenger of Allaah has said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong>Beware of extravagance in the Religion: It has caused the people before you to perish.</strong>“</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong>Do not lavish praise on me as the Christians did with the son of Maryam. I am just a bondman. So Simply say: The bondman of Allaah and His Messenger.</strong>” [Bukhaaree]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is curious to note that a great many people participate most actively in these celebrations and defend them vehemently, while they sit back from attending the obligatory forms of worship such as daily and friday prayers. They are not even ashamed of this, nor do they realize that they are committing a great evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Undoubtedly, this shows the weakness of their faith, their short-sightedness, and the deeply ingrained rust on their hearts because of sins and disobedience. We ask Allaah’s protection for us and for all the Muslims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is even more astonishing to note that some people believe that the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) is present at Milaad. Consequently they stand to greet and Welcome him. That is not only a sheer lie but a worst form of ignorance, as the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) shall neither come out of his grave before the Day of Resurrection, nor shall he meet the people or attend their meetings. Instead, he shall remain in his grave till the Day of Resurrection while his soul rests at the highest of the high with his Lord in the most exalted and highest place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah Ta’ala (The Almighty) Says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>After that at length ye will die, again on the Day of Judgment, will ye be raised up.</em></strong>” [23: 15, 16]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong>I am the first one to rise from the grave on the Resurrection Day and I will be the first intercessor and the first one whose intercession is to be accepted.</strong>“</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The aforesaid evidences from the Qur’aan and Hadeeth prove beyond doubt that the dead people will come out of their graves only on the Day of Resurrection. All the scholars of Islaam agree upon this. A Muslim should be aware of these things and must not be easily misled by the innovations and the superstitions created by the ignorant people with no authority from Allaah at all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for offering the blessings and greetings (Salat and Salam) to the prophet (peace be upon himl, they are among the most prefered and virtuous deeds in accordance with the saying of Allaah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>Allaah and His Angels send blessings on the Prophet, O you that believe, send ye blessings on him, and salute him with all respect.</em></strong>” [33:56]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) has said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong>Whosoever sends blessings on me one time, Allaah sends blessings on him ten times.</strong>“</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is prescribed on all times, particularly at the end of each prayer. It is held obligatory at last Tashahud of each prayer by most of the scholars. It is strongly required at a number of occasions such as immediately after Adhaan, at the mention of the name of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam), during the day of Friday and the night preceding it according to a host of Ahadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is what I wanted to emphasize regarding this issue. I hope it will satisfy everyone whom Allaah has shown the light.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How sad it is to see some devoted Muslims, known for their strength of faith and love for the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) organizing such innovatory celebrations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us ask such people: “<em>Tell us, if you belong to Ahl-as-Sunnah and follow the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam), whether he himself or one of his Companions or their Successors did this or is it no more than a blind following of the enemies of Islaam from among the jews and the Christians and the like?</em>“</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The love of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) is not reflected by the celebration on his birthday, but by obeying him, believing in his teachings, keeping away from what he prohibited and by worshipping Allaah in the way he prescribed for us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also reflected through offering Salat and Salam to him from time to time, particularly at the mention of his name and during prayers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The *******yya, as the writer tends to put it, are not new in rejecting all such innovations. Their creed is to hold fast to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam): to follow his footsteps and those of his rightly guided successors: to believe and practice what was propounded by the virtuous predecessors and the Imams of learning and guidance who were capable to issue religious injunction concerning the knowledge of Allaah, and His attributes of perfection and dignity as shown in the Glorious Book and the authentic traditions of the Prophet and as wholeheartedly accepted by his companions. The *******yya believe in them, the way they are reported without any alteration, personification, examplifying or negation of such attributes. They stick to the way of successors and their followers from among the people of learning, faith and piety. They believe that the foundation of the faith is to bear witness that there is none to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. To them, this is the root of faith and one of its most exalted branches as well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They know in accordance with the consensus of the muslims, that this root requires knowledge, acknowledgement and practice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It implies that none is to be worshipped except Allaah the Almighty. Who has no associates at all. It further implies the negation of worshipping any other except Him. It shows why jinn and mankind were created; why the Messengers were sent and why the Books were revealed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition, Ibaadah (worship) is not only complete submission and love but also complete obedience and veneration as well. Islaam is the only religion prescribed by Allaah and disseminated by the prophets and nothing, save it, is acceptable to Allaah whether in the past or the present. The one who submits his will to Allaah as well as to someone else beside Him is a Mushrik (polytheist). The same is true for the one who prays to Allaah and someone else beside Him. As for the one who does not submit to Him, he is arrogant concerning his duties towards his Creator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah the Almighty Says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>For we assuredly sent amongst every people a Messenger, (with the Command) “Serve Allaah and eschew Evil.”</em>“</strong> [16:36]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus the creed of the *******yya is based upon fulfillment of witnessing that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and completely abandoning all innovations, superstitions and whatever goes against the Sharee’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is what Shaykh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab – may Allaah have mercy upon him – believed and invited others to believe. Whoever accredits to him anything contrary to it, does not only lie but commits a great sin and claims what is totally unfounded. He will, no doubt, receive what Allaah has promised to all the fabricators of lies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh has shown – through a series of his well-known treatises and scholarly books on the topic of the Declaration of Unity: Laa Illaaha ill’Allaah – that no one deserves worship except Allaah the Almighty and that this type of worship should be devoid of all sorts of SHIRK whether big or small. Anyone who is aware of these writings, his way of preaching and calling people to Allaah and of the way of his pupils and disciples, can easily find out that his approach was not different from that of our virtuous predecessors, the great Imams of learning and guidance. Indeed, he has propounded what they did throughout their lives concerning the worship of Allaah Alone and leaving all innovations and superstitions aside.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is in no need of any addition after what Allaah and His Prophet have ordained and what the Ahl-al-Sunnah Wal’ Jama’at, from among the Companions, the Successors and their followers have already received. To forbid celebrating the birthday of the Prophet due to its innovative nature in addition to the signs of extravagance and Shirk normally associated with it, is not un-lslamic orderogatory to the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam). Instead, it is an act of obedience as the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) himself said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong>Beware of the extravagance in matters of religion. Those before you have perished because of extravagance in the matters of religion.</strong>“</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong>Do not lavish praise on me as the Christians did with the son of Maryam. I am but a bondman. So simply say: ‘Slave of Allaah and His Messenger.’</strong>“</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is what I wanted to point out regarding the aforesaid article.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allaah help us and all the Muslims to understand His religion, to continually confirm us on it, stick to Sunnah and keep away from the innovation. Indeed He is Generous and Kind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And May Allaah Shower His blessings and mercy upon our prophet Muhammad, his posterity and his Companions.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Rasheed Barbee</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Question</strong>:</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is there a difference between the innovation that is considered a sin and the innovation that takes a person outside the fold of Islam?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yes; there is innovation that takes a person outside the fold of Islam such as denying that Allah will be seen in the afterlife, denying that Allah is above His creation, making supplication to other than Allah, sacrificing to other than Allah, these are all types of innovation that take a person outside the fold of Islam, but we don’t declare a person to be outside the fold of Islam until we have established the proof against him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is because some of the people have had the doubts heaped upon them and they are far removed from the era of the Prophethood and far removed from the light of Prophethood. As a result they fall into innovations such as these; and these innovations take the person outside the fold of Islam. We say, denying that Allah will be seen in the afterlife is disbelief, as is denying that Allah is above His creation, and claiming that the Koran is created is also disbelief, major disbelief.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">But as for the one who says, I bear witness that no one has the right to be worshipped except and Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and he prays and he fasts and he desires paradise and he believes in it etc, etc; then perhaps some of the doubts of the people of falsehood came to him and piled up upon him until he fell into the aforementioned innovations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we say to him, you fell into disbelief and the proof is this and that and we make it clear to him. So if Allah gives him the success to return to the truth then all praises belong to Allah, if not then we will say he is a disbeliever only after the proof has been established against him. As for the innovation that is sin then it is different than this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example I see him with rosary beads (dhikir beads) these rosary beads, oh my brothers, there origin is taken from the Christians and the Hindus! These beads are something which is foreign to the Muslims. Who were they taken from? (They were) taken from the Hindus and the Christians, the Christians took them from the Hindus. And I have seen for myself a Christian monk wearing these beads and a Hindu monk wearing these beads and they were using these beads and now the innovators from the Muslims have taken these beads from them. And other than this from the different types of innovations such as the different types of remembrance that have in them deviation from what is correct as for these types of innovations we don’t say they remove someone from the fold of Islam. We don’t say that a person has left Islam except with proof, and we don’t say that a person is a sinner (fasiq) except with proof. So although it is bida you don’t automatically make him a sinner because of it, but he becomes a sinner after it has been made clear to him after it has been made clear and he stays upon this bida then he becomes a sinner (fasiq).</span></p>
