<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><em>Taken from ‘Faḍā’il-e-Ṣaḥāba Ṣaḥīḥ Aḥadīth Ki Roshnī Mein’ (p.125-130)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Noble Prophet ﷺ said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“Paradise is obligatory (i.e. guaranteed) for the first army from my Ummah that undertakes Jihād on the Ocean.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 2924)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This Jihād occurred during the time of the Khilāfat of Sayyidunā Muʿāwiya bin Abī Sufyān (<em>Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 6282, 6283)</em>, and Sayyidunā Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān participated in that Jihād <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 2799, 2800).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Sayyidunā ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said: I was playing with the children when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ arrived, I had thought that he arrived for me so I hid behind the door, so he pat me on the back and said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“Go and call Muʿāwiya for me” and he (Muʿāwiya</strong><strong>) used to write the Revelation.</strong> <em>(Dalāi’l An-Nabuwwah of Bayhaqī 2/243, and its chain is ḥasan)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">From this we understand that Sayyidunā Muʿāwiya was a scribe of the Qur’ān, Hafiẓ Ibn ‘Asākir wrote: <strong>“[Muʿāwiya is the] uncle of the believers, and the scribe of the revelation of the Rabb of the Worlds, he accepted Islām on Yawm Al-Fatḥ (the day of conquest).”</strong> <em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/38)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The famous tābi’ī ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Ubaydullāh ibn Abī Mulaykah Al-Makkī narrated that Muʿāwiya prayed one rak’at (cycle) of witr after ‘Ishā, then Ibn ‘Abbās said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“He is correct, verily he is a faqīh.”</strong> <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 3765)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In opposition to this narration, Ṭaḥawī Al-Ḥanafī, “from Mālik b. Yaḥyā (who Ibn Ḥibbān is alone in declaring trustworthy), from ‘Abdul Wahhāb b. ‘Aṭā who said: from Imran b. Ḥadīr,,,” narrated a rejected narration using this chain <em>(Sharḥ Ma’ānī Al-Āthār 1/289)</em>. This narration is rejected on account of it opposing the narration of Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī, and Ṭaḥawīs claim that Ibn ‘Abbās said “He is correct.” by way of Taqiyyah is incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Ṣaḥābī ‘Abdur Raḥmān b. Abī ‘Umayrah narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said for Muʿāwiya: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“Oh Allāh! Make him a guiding one, and guide [others] through him.” </strong><em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhī No. 3842, and he [Imām Abū ʿĪsā At-Tirmidhī] said, “This is a ḥadīth ḥasan gharīb.”, Tārīkh Al-Kabīr of Al-Bukhārī 5/240, Tabaqāt Ibn Sa’d 7/487, Al-Āḥād wal Mathānī of Ibn Abī ‘Āṣim 2/358 No. 1129, Musnad Aḥmad 4/216 No. 17895, and it is a Ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This narration is from Marwān bin Muḥammad and other than him from Sa’īd bin ‘Abdul Azīz, and Marwāns narrations from Sa’īd bin ‘Abdul Azīz are in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim <em>(108/1043, No. 2403 [Darussalam Edition])</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It has been established that Sa’īd bin ‘Abdul Azīz’s narrations were narrated before he lost his memory <em>(As-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 1969)</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>It is narrated from Umm ‘Alqamah (Marjāna) that Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān</strong><strong> arrived in Madīnah and asked ʿĀʾishah</strong><strong> for the cloak and hair of the Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>, then he put the cloak on and dipped the hair into water and drank it and poured it over his body. </strong><em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/106 and its chain is ḥasan, and Marjāna is trustworthy according to Al-‘Ijilī and Ibn Ḥibbān.)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It is narrated from Maswar bin Makhrama that he and one delegation went to Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān and Muʿāwiya fulfilled all his needs, then Muʿāwiya called him saying, “What happened to your criticism of the rulers?”. Maswar said, “Leave this, and have good behaviour as we previously had.” Muʿāwiya said, “No, by Allāh! You have to tell me about yourself and why you are criticising me.” Maswar said that he told him every fault he saw in him. Muʿāwiya said, “No one is free from sin, O Maswar! Do you know how much I have tried to correct the people? One good deed will have the reward of ten, or will you keep counting the sins and forsaking the good actions?” Maswar said, “No, by Allāh! We only mention the sins that we see.” Muʿāwiya said, “We acknowledge every one of our sins in front of Allāh – O Maswar! Do you not have some sins that you fear that if they are not forgiven that you will perish?” Maswar said, “Yes.” Muʿāwiya said, “What has made you deserving of forgiveness that you do not hope for me? By Allāh! I try harder than you to rectify but by Allāh! In two matters, I only prefer one. Between Allah and other than him, I only choose Allah. I am upon this religion in which Allāh accepts righteous actions, He recompenses for good deeds and sins except for those who He chooses to forgive. I hope that for every righteous action I do, Allāh will recompense me many times over. I am facing great matters that neither you nor I can count – I have established the Salah, and Jihād in the way of Allāh, and have established a system that rules by what Allāh has revealed and like this there are other matters that if I told you, you wouldn’t be able to count them – ponder on this.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Maswar said that he understood that Muʿāwiya overcame him in this conversation. <strong>‘Urwah bin Al-Zubayr said, “After this we never heard Maswar censuring Muʿāwiya, he used to pray for his forgiveness.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Baghdād 48/208,209 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Ja’far Aṣ-Ṣādiq, with the following sanad: “Qāsim b. Muḥammad said: Muʿāwiya b. Abī Sufyān said:”, narrated a ḥadīth in which Qāsim bin Muḥammad (bin Abī Bakr) said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“So, the people were amazed at the truthfulness of Muʿāwiya</strong><strong>.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/115 and its chain is ḥasan)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">From this narration we understand that Amīr Muʿāwiya was truthful in the view of the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Sayyidunā ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“I have not seen anyone more befitting, meaning to rule (after the Rightly-Guided Caliphs) than Muʿāwiya.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/121 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Muṣannaf ‘Abdur-Razzāq 11/453 No. 20985)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">‘Irbāḍ bin Sāriyah narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“O Allāh! Teach Muʿāwiya Al-Kitāb and Al-Ḥisāb and save him from the Punishment.” </strong><em>(Musnad Aḥmad 6/127 No. 17152 and its chain is ḥasan, Ṣaḥīḥ ibn Khuzaymah 1938)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Amīr Muʿāwiya</strong> passed away in 60H – one should always stay silent on the battles that occurred between the noble companions due to ijtihad (i.e. they were seeking the truth). Imām of Ahlus-Sunnah Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal said, “Whenever you see a man cursing the companions of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, then doubt his Islām.” <em>(Manāqib Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal of Ibn Al-Jawzī No. 160, and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Tarīkh Dimashq 62/144)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Mu’āfa bin ‘Imrān al-Mauṣilī (d. 185H) was asked about Amīr Muʿāwiya, so he said: <strong>“Nobody can be placed next to the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>, Muʿāwiya was his companion, and he was the brother of Ummul Mu’minīn Umm Ḥabība</strong><strong>, and he was his scribe and the one entrusted [with the writing of] the Revelation of Allāh.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Baghdād 1/209 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Tarīkh Dimashq 62/143)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal said, <strong>“Whoever belittles anyone from amongst the Companions of Messenger of Allāh</strong> ﷺ<strong>, then he does not harbour anything except an affliction, and he has a hidden evil towards the best of the People, and they are the Companions of Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>.” </strong><em>(As-Sunnah of Al-Khallāl 2/477 No. 758, and the Muḥaqqiq said: its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibrahīm bin Maysarah Aṭ-Ṭā’ifī narrated that <strong>‘Umar bin ‘Abdul Azīz</strong><strong> never hit anyone except one man that cursed Muʿāwiya</strong><strong>, so he whipped him. </strong>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/145 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">163 aḥadīth are narrated by Amīr Muʿāwiya in Musnad Baqī bin Makhlad <em>(Siyar A’lām An-Nubalā 3/162)</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Those that narrated from him [from the companions] include:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="color: #000000">Jarīr b. ‘Abdullāh Al-Bajalī</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">As-Sā’ib b. Yazīd</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">‘Abdullāh b. ‘Abbās</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Muʿāwiya b. Hudayj</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Abu Sa’īd Al-Khudrī and other than him from the Noble Companions, may Allāh be pleased with them all.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">[And from the successors:]</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="color: #000000">Abul Sha’thā</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Jābir b. Zayd</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Ḥasan Al-Baṣrī</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Sa’īd b. Al-Musayyib</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Sa’īd Al-Muqbarī</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">‘Aṭā b. Abī Rabāḥ</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Muḥammad b. Sīrīn</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Muḥammad b. ‘Ali b. Abī Ṭālib (ibn Al-Ḥanafiyyah)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Hummām b. Munabbih</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Abū Salamah b. ‘Abdul Raḥmān and other than him from the tābi’īn, may Allāh have mercy upon them all. <em>(Tadhībul Kamāl 18/201,202)</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In the view of Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jama’āh, all the Companions are considered truthful in their narrations (‘Ādil) <em>(Ikthiṣār ‘Ulūm Al-Ḥadīth of Ibn Kathīr 2/498)</em>. Those differences that occurred between them out of ijtihad, and the fighting that happened, they are excused, and we should remain completely silent about them. O Allāh! Fill our hearts with a complete love for the Companions and save us from insulting and degrading them! Āmīn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">رضي الله عنهم أجمعين</span></p>
