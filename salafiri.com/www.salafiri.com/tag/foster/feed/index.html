<p><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> <span style="color: #000000">– [SAHIH]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Urwa Ibn az-Zubayr) in Bukhari (no.4303)</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 2/739 hadith no.1488, book 36, chapter 21, hadith no.20) at-Tamhid (8/178), al-Istidhkar: (no.1412)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.6749) from the hadith of Malik and narrated by Muslim (no.1457) from the hadith of Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It has come in the original from Yahya Ibn Yahya’s narration: Utbah Ibn Waqas and Sa’d Ibn Waqas</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) A man married a woman then after (9 months) the woman gave birth to a boy or girl. This boy or girl has been born from the bed of that man therefore it is established according to this hadith that this boy or girl belongs to this man except if the father denies rejects this or if their is legislated reason for this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Some people say, “So and so person is the son of so and so man. This proof is found by (him) imitating (the other man)” this saying of these people is false because the proof of the son or daughter is found from this authentic hadith (and other Ahadith). When the nikah is established then the children automatically are established (to be from the parents) who have been born after the nikah from the father’s bed. The meaning of the father’s bed is that so and so is that woman’s husband.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Taking precaution and avoiding doubtful things is more virtuous. The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, <em>“Leave what makes you in doubt for what does not make you in doubt.”</em> (Sunan at-Tirmidhi: (no.2518) and its chain is authentic, and Tirmidhi said, “this hadith is authentic” and Ibn Khuzaimah authenticated it: (no.2348) and Ibn Hiban, al-Muwarid: (no.512) and al-Hakim (2/13) and adh-Dhahabi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) The Mother of the believers and noble companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) were always submitted and active (prompt, diligent, alert, efficient) in following of the noble Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) Without (unless there is) a Shari’ah right, actions will be done in accordance to all the apparent texts of the Shari’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) The punishment of zina (illegal sexual intercourse) is rajam (stoning to death) with the condition that the person who has committed zina is married. The hadith, <em>“A child belongs to the household (where he was born) and the adulterer is stoned.”</em> is mutawatir. See Qatful azhar al-Mutanatharah fil akhbar al-mutawatirah (no.82) wa nadhmul mutanathar minal hadith al-mutawatar (no.181). The same way it is also mutawatir that Ma’iz Ibn Malik (Radi Allahu Anhu) was stoned to death because of committing zina. See Qatful azhar (no.83) wa laqtul la ali al mutanatharah fil hadith al mutawatirah (no.47) wa nadhmul mutanathar (no.182) Apart from this there are also a lot more Ahadith therefore it is established that giving the stoning to death punishment for a married person who comitts zina is mutawatir, definite, certain and established from the Ahadith. The denial (rejection) of the punishment of stoning to death by some of the rejecters of hadith is false and rejected. Also see hadith (no.54)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[40] And with the same chain of narration from Ibn Shihab that he was asked about the suckling of an older person. He said, &#8221;Urwa ibn az-Zubayr informed me that Abu Hudhayfa ibn Utba ibn Rabia, one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) who was present at Badr, adopted Salim (who is called Salim, the mawla of Abu Hudhayfa) as the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) adopted Zayd ibn Haritha. He thought of him as his son, and Abu Hudhayfa married him to his brother&#8217;s sister, Fatima bint al-Walid ibn Utba ibn Rabia, who was at that time among the first emigrants. She was one of the best unmarried women of the Quraysh. When Allah the Exalted sent down in His Book what He sent down about Zayd ibn Haritha, &#8216;Call them after their true fathers. That is more equitable in the sight of Allah. If you do not know who their fathers were then they are your brothers in the deen and your mawali,&#8217; (Surah 33 ayah 5) people in this position were traced back to their fathers. When the father was not known, they were traced to their mawla. &#8220;Sahla bint Suhayl who was the wife of Abu Hudhayfa, and one of the tribe of Amr ibn Luay, came to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) and said, &#8216;Messenger of Allah! We think of Salim as a son and he comes in to see me while I am uncovered. We only have one room, so what do you think about the situation?&#8217; The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, &#8216;Give him five drinks of your milk and he will be mahram by it.&#8217; She then saw him as a foster son. A&#8217;isha umm al-muminin took that as a precedent for whatever men she wanted to be able to come to see her. She ordered her sister, Umm Kulthum bint Abi Bakr as-Sidiq and the daughters of her brother to give milk to whichever men she wanted to be able to come in to see her. The rest of the wives of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) refused to let anyone come in to them by such nursing. They said, &#8216;No! By Allah! We think that what the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) ordered Sahla bint Suhayl to do was only an indulgence concerning the nursing of Salim alone. No! By Allah! No one will come in upon us by such nursing!&#8217; &#8220;This is what the wives of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) thought about the suckling of an older person.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
