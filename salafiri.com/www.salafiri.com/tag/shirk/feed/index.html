				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">The author replies to these doubts with a general answer, and he gives an example of a doubt with the Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;There will certainly be no fear for the close servants of Allah, nor will they grieve.&#8221;<br />
</strong></em>[Surah Yunus, 10:62]
<p style="text-align: justify">and that the Shafa&#8217;ah (Intercession) is true, and that the Prophets have a high rank with Allah.¹ The author then answers every doubt with a specific answer, or two answers, or more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The First Doubt:</strong> That those that affirm Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah, believing that only Allah creates, provides sustenance, and controls affairs, also assert that Muhammad ﷺ, as well as &#8216;Abdul-Qadir [Al-Jilani] and other than him, do not have the capacity to cause harm nor confer benefit, and they only intend intercession from the righteous due to their esteemed status, so they are not Mushrikin (polytheists).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The Messenger of Allah ﷺ fought those [Mushrikin of Quraysh] that affirmed what was mentioned [i.e., Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah], and they intended what you intend [i.e., seeking intercession through their idols].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Second Doubt:</strong> That the Ayat were revealed regarding those that worship idols and the likes thereof, and we do not worship the idols.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer</strong><strong>:</strong> From amongst the disbelievers are those who worship idols, worship saints, invoke &#8216;Isa bin Maryam and his mother (peace be upon them both), and worship the angels. There is no difference between these objects of worship², all such practise constitutes Shirk (polytheism), and everyone that worships them are Mushrikin. Allah has denounced those that worship idols to be disbelievers, and similarly He denounced those that worship the righteous and angels to be disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Third Doubt:</strong> Seeking intercession from them is not polytheism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> This is the exact statement of the disbelievers, when they said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;&#8230;&#8217;We worship them only so they may bring us closer to Allah&#8217;&#8230;&#8221;</strong></em><br />
[Surah Az-Zumar, 39:3]
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">They did not intend anything except seeking intercession from the Rabb Al-&#8216;Alamin, and verily He denounced them as disbelievers due to that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fourth Doubt:</strong> Their denial of worshipping the righteous whilst simultaneously invoking them and slaughtering for them, despite affirming that these are acts of worship, and these acts align with the practises of the earlier Mushrikin. Whether they refuse to recognise that these are acts of worship, or are unaware of the fact, the Ayat and Ahadith elucidate the truth of the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fifth Doubt:</strong> That whoever rejects [the polytheistic manner of] seeking intercession from the Messenger and the righteous effectively rejects the Intercession of the Messenger and is a disparager of the righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The matter is the opposite, for verily intercession belongs to Allah, and does not occur except after His permission, and Allah does not give permission except to the People of Tawhid. Seeking intercession from other than Allah constitutes Shirk, and this is the underlying reason behind its prohibition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Sixth Doubt: </strong>That the Prophet ﷺ is given intercession, thus it is sought from him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> This intercession was given to him in a restricted manner (Muqayyid), not unrestricted (Mutlaq). Furthermore, his intercession is for the sinners, not for the Mushrikin. Additionally, intercession was granted to other than the Messenger, and it does not indicate that he can give it to whoever asks for it, nor to those who seek it from him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Seventh Doubt: </strong>Seeking refuge with the righteous is not considered polytheism, thus he is not a polytheist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer by Challenge: </strong>He is asked, &#8216;what is Ash-Shirk?&#8217; and, &#8216;what is &#8216;Ibadah of Allah?&#8217;, for verily he does not know what At-Tawhid is, nor what Ash-Shirk is, that which he has fallen into.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Eighth Doubt:</strong> His statement: Ash-Shirk is worshipping idols, and we do not worship idols.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>So it is said to him:</strong> Did they [i.e., the idol-worshippers] believe that the [idols] created and provided sustenance? If he replies: &#8216;The one that directs his worship to wood, stone, structures on graves, or other than these, invoking it and slaughtering for it says: It draws us nearer to Allah in rank, and Allah bestows upon us His blessings.&#8217; Then this explanation of idol-worship is correct, and it is exactly what you do, underlining Ash-Shirk is not specific to idol-worship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Ninth Doubt:</strong> Their statement: Verily they make Takfir of the Muslims, and they equate us to the earlier Mushrikin [of Quraysh], whilst we declare &#8216;La ilaha illAllah&#8217;, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and we affirm the Resurrection, and we pray and fast, and we perform Hajj and &#8216;Umrah, whilst they were the opposite &#8211; how can you make those that have these divisive characteristics like those who do not possess anything from them?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>So he responded to them with nine answers:</strong> He clarified that these characteristics have no effect on the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah, nor Ijma&#8217;, rather these characteristics are what makes their Kufr (disbelief) more severe! Whoever commits an act of Kufr, in affirming something from the Messenger [of Allah] whilst disbelieving in something else, or raising the creation to the level of the Creator, or exaggerating regarding one from the righteous until he claims divinity for him, or opposing the Shari&#8217;ah in some matters, such as Istihlal (declaring the permissibility) of the Nikkah of two sisters, or a branch from the branches of apostasy are found from him, or he mocks Allah or his Ayat, then he is an apostate &#8211; and it is not a condition in his apostasy to combine all types of apostasy, or combine all types of Shirk, or giving all the rights of the Rabb of the &#8216;Alamin to his object of worship. Verily apostasy is two types:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 60px">Unrestricted apostasy: To turn away from everything that the Messenger [of Allah] ﷺ came with.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 60px">Secondly: To disbelieve in some parts of what the Messenger [of Allah] came with.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Tenth Doubt: </strong>That whoever says, &#8216;La ilaha illAllah&#8217;, cannot be declared a Kafir nor killed, whatever he does, and they use some Ahadith as evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> These Ahadith are not evidence for what this person is claiming, in that the sole utterance of &#8216;La ilaha illAllah&#8217; is a preventative for Takfir, rather many people say it whilst they are disbelievers, either due to a lack of knowledge regarding its meaning, or a lack of action of what it necessitates, or the existence of that which nullifies it. An example of that is the Jews who used to say it, and the companions of Musaylimah whom the Sahabah [of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ] fought, likewise those that &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) burnt to death, so the statement of it [i.e., the Shahadah] by the tongue does not suffice in protecting ones blood and wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Eleventh Doubt:</strong> Their statement: That Al-Istigatha (seeking relief) by other than Allah is not Shirk, due to Al-Istigatha by the Prophets on the Day of Resurrection being permissible, and verily the author clarified their ignorance in not differentiating between the two different types of Al-Istigatha.<b>³</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Twelfth Doubt: </strong>Their justification that Al-Istigatha by the dead and absent is not Shirk, due to Jibril offering to help Ibrahim (Peace be upon them both).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> That verily this Al-Istigatha is one type, and that is another type, so whoever equates them has equated two different matters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In clarification that At-Tawhid must exist by the heart, tongue and actions of the limbs, and if one of these are missing, then a man is not a Muslim, and we ask Allah to make these actions sincerely for His Dignified Countenance, verily He is All-Hearing, The Most Near, The One who responds to supplications, and may His Praise be upon Muhammad, his family and his companions.</p>

<p style="text-align: left"><strong>¹ [TN:]</strong> i.e., These are used as doubts to justify seeking the prohibited and polytheistic intercession by way of the righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>²</strong> In that they do not possess any divinity [and are not befitting for worship].</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h4><span style="color: #000080">The Author (Shaykh Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhab, may Allah have mercy on him) said,</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #800000">&#8220;The Fourth Principle: That the Mushriks (Polytheists) of our time are more severe in their Shirk than [those Mushriks] that came before, for verily those that came before would commit Shirk in times of ease, whilst dedicating [their worship] solely to Allah in times of difficulty, whereas the Shirk of the Mushriks of our time is constant, in ease and in difficulty. The proof is the statement of the Most High:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #800000"><strong><em>&#8216;And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allâh, making their Faith pure for Him only: but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others.&#8217; [Al-Ankabut, 29:65]</em>&#8220;</strong></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080">The Explainer (Shaykh Salih Al-&#8216;Usaymi, may Allah grant him success) said,</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">&#8220;<strong>And the objective of this Principle is: </strong>To clarify the severity of the Shirk of the people during the time of the author, and whoever is after them is from the latecomers (Muta&#8217;akhirin), and verily they are more severe in Shirk than the ones that came before (Al-Awwalin).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>And the benefit of establishing its severity is: </strong>Realising that that the state they (i.e., the Mushriks of our time) is more worthy of Takfir (excommunication) and fighting than the Mushriks that came before, and this was declared by the author in another book of his, &#8216;Kashf Ash-Shubuhat&#8217;, and the Mushrikun were mentioned with the disbelief with which they were described previously in the initial statement of the author, <span style="color: #800000">&#8216;Verily the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ fought&#8230;&#8217;¹</span>, so they disbelieved by Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b>And a collection of Shari&#8217;i (legislative) evidences and events which have occurred due to the Divine Decree indicate that the Shirk of the later Mushriks is more severe than the Shirk of the earlier Mushriks in ten aspects:</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The First Aspect: <span style="color: #800000">&#8216;For verily those that came before would commit Shirk in times of ease, whilst dedicating [their worship] solely to Allah in times of difficulty.&#8217; </span></strong><span style="color: #800000"><br />
</span>As for the later Mushriks, then they commit Shirk in times of ease and difficulty alike. The author mentioned this aspect here in &#8216;Qawa&#8217;id Al-Arba&#8217; and additionally in &#8216;Kashf Ash-Shubuhat&#8217;, and he used the aforementioned Ayah as evidence from Surah Al-Ankabut, for travelling in the ocean on &#8216;Al-Fulk&#8217; &#8211; i.e., a ship &#8211; is a time of difficulty, for their hearts would be filled with fear and they would call on Allah alone sincerely. Then, when they would set foot on land and be in a state of ease, due to their safety from the harm which they had feared, they would return to their Shirk, calling upon other than Allah, and a group [of scholars] after the time of the author mentioned this, from them: his grandsons Sulayman bin &#8216;Abdillah and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Hasan, and &#8216;Abdullah Aba Butayn, and Sulayman bin Sahman.<br />
The aforementioned Ayah clarifies the state of the earlier Mushriks between times of difficulty and ease, as for the state of the latecomers, then they are continuous in their Shirk, rather they increase in it when calamities befall them and when their fear intensifies! So the matter has been clarified by those that have witnessed their condition, and the writings of their pens attest to their (i.e., the Mushriks of our era) precedence over the [earlier Mushriks] in Ash-Shirk with the Rabb of Al-&#8216;Alamin. Meaning: That the Ayat are evidence regarding the reality of the condition of the [earlier Mushriks]; For verily they would commit Shirk in times of ease whilst dedicating [their worship] solely to Allah in times of difficulty.<br />
As for the latecomers, then if you wish to know their reality with regards to them committing Shirk in both times of ease and difficulty, then upon you is to witness their condition if you are from the countries which have been afflicted with this [i.e., widespread Shirk], or to read into what has been written regarding them, and you will find their Shirk in every case, whether in ease or in difficulty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Second Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would call upon the Muqarrabun (those brought near to Allah) from the Prophets, Angels and Righteous besides Allah, or they would call upon trees or stones that are not sinful, and these later Mushriks call upon the Fussaq (wicked evildoers) and Fujjar (criminals) besides Allah. The author mentioned this aspect separately in &#8216;Kashf Ash-Shubuhat&#8217; as well, and Muhammad bin Isma&#8217;il As-San&#8217;ani attested to the actualisation of these events during his time in &#8216;Tathir Al-I&#8217;tiqad.&#8217;²<br />
The root cause of their supplications, whilst witnessing their sins, is fear of their evil, for verily they believe they have influence and control [over the creation] such that they can cause harm to them, despite them being in such a repulsive condition.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>The Third Aspect</strong><strong>:</strong> That the earlier Mushriks affirmed that what they were upon was in opposition to the call of the Prophets and Messengers, for verily they said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong> &#8216;Has he made the âlihah (gods) (all) into One Ilâh (God &#8211; Allâh). Verily, this is a curious thing!&#8217; [Surah Sad, 38:5]</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the later Mushriks, then verily they claim that their actions are in accordance to the call of the Prophets and Messengers, and &#8216;Abdul-Latif bin Abdur-Rahman mentioned this by meaning in his refutation on Dawud bin Jarjis, and likewise his student, Sulayman bin Sahman, mentioned it.<br />
So the earlier Mushriks denied the statement, &#8216;La ilaaha illAllah&#8217;, whereas the later Mushriks claimed to be from its people and did not deny its statement, so the earlier Mushrikun rejected it by wording and meaning, whereas the later Mushriks affirm its wording whilst rejecting its meaning. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Hasan brought this benefit in &#8216;Fath Al-Majid&#8217;, and Ibn Qasim in &#8216;Hashiyah Kitab At-Tawhid&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fourth Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would not commit Shirk with Allah in anything from the Dominion, nor in a completely unrestricted ability to dispose of affairs (At-Tasarruf Al-Kulli Al-&#8216;Am), rather they would say in their Talbiyah, <em>&#8216;Labbayk Allahumma Labbayk! (Here I am Allah, Here I am), Labbayk La Sharika Labbayk (Here I am, you have no partner), Except the partner that You have, You control him and that which he controls.&#8217; </em><br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they ascribed complete sovereignty and disposal of affairs of the cosmos to those whom they venerate, and they invoke them due [to their belief] that they have control of the creation and that which occurs in it, and this is Shirk which was not known in the time of Al-Jahiliyyah (Ignorance). &#8216;Abdullah bin Faysal bin Su&#8217;ud mentioned this aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fifth Aspect: </strong>That many of the later Mushriks invoke their objects of worship besides Allah whilst believing they are independent (i.e., not dependent on Allah). As for the earlier Mushriks, then they would invoke their objects of worship in order to seek nearness to Allah, and they believed them to be intercessors and intermediaries, as opposed to many of those Mushriks that came after &#8211; even if they claim otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Sixth Aspect</strong>: That, generally, the Shirk of the earlier Mushriks was restricted [generally] to Al-Uluhiyyah (Worship), and would rarely occur in other than it. As for the later Mushriks, then their Shirk is much, in &#8216;Uluhiyyah, Rububiyyah (Allah&#8217;s actions), and Asma&#8217; w&#8217;as-Sifat (Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes). Rather, Sulayman bin Sahman declared [this] to be one of the differences between the Mushriks of our times who are in a far more evil state than the Mushriks of Al-Jahiliyyah; that the earlier Mushriks affirmed Tawheed of Rububiyyah, for verily their Shirk was only in Al-Uluhiyyah, and this confirms what we mentioned previously.³</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Seventh Aspect:</strong> That the later Mushriks claim that intending [acts of worship], invoking, and devoting [acts of worship] towards the Righteous is from their rights, and to abandon this is to loathe and disregard them, and the earlier Mushriks did not mention this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Eighth Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks used to affirm their Shirk, just as was mentioned previously in their Talbiyyah, and they used to call their Raghbah (Fervent Desire) towards those that they venerated &#8216;Ibadah (Worship)&#8217;.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they claim that they do not commit Shirk with their Rabb, and they call their Raghbah towards those that they venerate &#8216;Mahabbah (Love)&#8217;, and they are liars in this claim of theirs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> <strong>The Ninth Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would only ask their false-deities to fulfil their worldly needs, such as returning a missing person, and they would not take them as preparation for the Day of Judgement (Yawm Al-Din), due to their rejection of the Resurrection, or due to their belief that they will be rewarded with wealth and children after the Resurrection on account of their favour with Allah.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they desired from their objects of veneration fulfilment of their needs in this world, and in the Hereafter. Hamad bin Basir bin Mu&#8217;ammar mentioned this aspect, may Allah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Tenth Aspect:</strong> That the earlier Mushriks would venerate Allah and His symbols, so they would venerate oaths taken by Allah, and they would protect those that sought refuge by Allah and His House (i.e., the Ka&#8217;ba), and they would believe that Al-Bayt Al-Haram is greater than the houses of their idols.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then verily one of them may take an oath by Allah, truthfully or falsely, whilst he would not dare to falsely take an oath by the one he takes as an object of worship and veneration, nor would he protect the one that seeks refuge by Allah and his House, whilst protecting the one who seeks refuge by the one whom they venerate, or by his grave, and they believe that staying at the tombs of the saints is greater than staying in the Masjid. The majority of them believe that Istighatha (seeking aid) by their false-deities, by their graves, is more beneficial and more successful than Istigatha with Allah in the Masjid! And this aspect was derived from the various speech of Sulayman bin &#8216;Abdullah in &#8216;Taysir Al-&#8216;Aziz Al-Hamid&#8217;, and some of it from the speech of Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandson (Taqi&#8217;uddin), and the author [himself], and As-San&#8217;ani, and Hamad bin Nasir bin Mu&#8217;ammar, and &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Aziz Al-Husayyin, and &#8216;Abdul-Latif bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Hasan, from the scholars of the Rectifying Da&#8217;wah, may Allah have mercy on them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>(Sharh Qawa&#8217;id Al-Arba&#8217; of Shaykh Salih Al-&#8216;Usaymi, may Allah preserve him, p.29-33,<br />

<h4 style="text-align: left"><span style="color: #000080">[TN: The Shaykh, may Allah preserve him, added two more aspects in his lesson the following year:]</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">&#8220;<strong>The Eleventh Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would not seek from their false-deities everything which they sought from Ar-Rahman, for they had requests which they would seek from their false-deities, and requests they would seek from none other than Allah, out of veneration for Allah (Perfect and Exalted He is), so they made the most lofty requests specifically for Allah.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they would seek from their false-deities that which they do not [even] seek from Allah, and made their greatest requests for those that they deify, and would not seek them from Allah, Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandson, mentioned this aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Twelfth Aspect:</strong> That within the later Mushriks are those that claim that Allah manifests in the image of their objects of worship from the creation, so they worship them for verily [they believe] that Allah manifests in them, and not a single one from the earlier Mushriks believed that Allah manifests in an image other than His Self from the creation. Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandson, also mentioned this in meaning. His companion, Ibn Al-Qayyim, relayed this from him in &#8216;Rawdhatul Muhibbin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> The Author, may Allah have mercy on him, said, <strong>&#8220;The First Principle: That you know that verily the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ fought would affirm that Allah, Exalted is He, is the Creator and the One who controls all affairs, and that [this belief] did not enter them into Islam.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Qawa&#8217;id Al-Arba&#8217;)</em></p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:] </strong>Imam Amir As-San&#8217;ani, may Allah have mercy on him, said, <strong>&#8220;Rather, it has reached such a state that they flee to the graves of the oppressors&#8230;&#8221; </strong><em>(Tathir Al-I&#8217;tiqad p.99, Matkabah Al-Wadi&#8217;i edn.)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan expained, <strong>&#8220;When oppression and injustice occurs from the rulers or other than them, they would seek refuge with [the occupants of] these graves to spare them from the injustice and oppression, so this is seeking refuge with other than Allah, to the extent that a poet said:</strong></p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: center"><strong><em>&#8216;O those who fear the Tatar, seek protection by the grave of Abi &#8216;Umar<br />
</em></strong><em><strong>Seek refuge by the grave of Abi &#8216;Umar, he will save you from harm.'&#8221;<br />
</strong></em><em>(Sabil Ar-Rashad fi Sharh Tathir Al-I&#8217;tiqad p.191)</em></p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: left">³ <strong>[TN:]</strong> Allah, Most High, says,</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;Who provides for you from the sky and the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs?&#8221; They will say: &#8220;Allâh.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Will you not then be afraid of Allâh’s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allâh)?&#8221;&#8221;<br />

<span style="color: #ff0000;">DECEMBER 26, 2020 / SUNNI HANAFI</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Refuting http://www.salafiri.com/pinned-ebook-dismantling-the-proofs-for-tawassul-and-istigatha-with-conclusive-evidences-part-2-the-%e1%b8%a5adith-of-fatimah-bint-asad-radiallahu-anha-and-the-tawassul-of-me/</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Some pseudo-Salafis have began to make allegations of weakness on the hadith of Sayyida Fatima bint Asad رضى الله عنه .</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">For example they say that</span> “Imām Dhahabī in his summary of the al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Fīʾl Aḥadīth al-Wahiyyah of Ḥāfiẓ Ibn al-Jawzī again grades Rawhū weak thus showing his consistency. (Talkhīs Kitāb al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Li-Ibn al-Jawzī (p.91 no. 218), Riyadh: Maktabah al-Rushd, 1419H/1998)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Irshād ul-Ḥaq al-Atharī said in his notes to al-ʿEllal after mention the statements of Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy, Imām al-Dāraquṭnī, Imām Ibn Mākūlā, Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Yūnus, the authentication of Imām al-Ḥākim and the entry of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān in his al-Thiqāt as mentioned in Lisān (2:465),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I say their leniency (tasāhul ie of al-Ḥākim and Ibn Ḥibbān) is well known and al-Shaikh al-Albānī has mentioned in Silsilah al-Daʿīfaʾ no.23 so refer to it.” (al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Fīʾl Aḥadīth al-Wahiyyah (1:269 footnote no.5), Edn, Khalīl Mayyis (1:270 footnote no.8)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They do ta’wil of Imam al-Hakim and Imam Ibn Hibban’s tasHih yet they consider us “deviant and people of innovation” for doing tawasul/istighatha. If the followers of the pseudo-Salafi/Wahabi movement have any intellectual honesty, they will tell me why they have not considered Imam al-Hakim or Imam Ibn Hibban a deviant for doing tasHih of a narration on tawassul.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Barelwi in order to bulk the size of so called reply reproduced large chunks of my paper, whereas his response is a few paragraphs if that. In his response he the unnamed one] fails to make any recourse to the books related to the science of hadith, rijal and or without reference to any classical books other than emotive polemics, so nothing usual here for typical Barelwis so far.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Unnamed begins with the accusation of ta&#8217;wil, meaning explaining the authentication of Imams al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban. The unnamed author hid behind a generality, that this attribution to al-Hakim, that he authenticated it came from al-Haythami in his (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid (9:256-257), Cairo: Maktabah al-Quddūsī, 1414H:1994) and Majma&#8217;a al-Zawaid, 18:736 under no.15388)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">So, the accusation levied against me should be put first and foremost to al-Haythami, who despite citing Ibn Hibban&#8217;s and al-Hakim&#8217;s authentication continued to class it weak!!! I wonder why the unnamed author forgot this very little but important information? I guess, al-Haythami is also a pseudo Salafi? I reproduce the words of al-Haythami and what I wrote in the paper,</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;He, al-Haythamī also said after transmitting it in his Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid said,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Transmitted by Ṭabarānī in al-Kabīr and in al-Awsaṭ and Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ is in the chain who was declared trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim, however he has weakness with him and the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ.” (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid (9:256-257), Cairo: Maktabah al-Quddūsī, 1414H:1994)&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>al-Haythami himself organised the Thiqat of Ibn Hibban, so he was fully aware of Ibn Hibban&#8217;s entry for Rawhu, yet despite this he still graded him weak. (Tartib Thiqat Ibn Hibban,5:393 no.3979. 1st edn (Mansura: Dar Ibn Abbas, 1440H/2019).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Hamdi answered the very point made by this brother and i quoted this, and it is well known amonsgt the circles of hadith, that Ibn Hibba and al-Hakim were mutasahil, if someone does not even know the basic, they should refrain from discussing things way over their head. Shaykh Hamdi said,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Ḥamdi ʿAbd al-Majīd al-Salafī answers the authentication of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and says,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“As for Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who has been declared to be trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and Hakim, then it is well known about both of them that they are mutasāhil ie lenient. He was declared to be weak by Ibn ʿAdiyy and Ibn Yūnus said he would narrate rejected narrations. Darāquṭnī said he is weak in Ḥadīth and Ibn Mākūlā weakened him and Ibn ʿAdiyy said after transmitting two of this ḥadīth he has many āḥadīth and some of them are abandoned.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thus, this is detailed criticism from the specialist critical analysts, furthermore, his narrations are rejected and this is the case with this narration and when he is alone in reporting such ḥadīth they are rejected and cannot be used as evidence therefore, the ḥadīth is is weak.” (Muʿajam al-Kabīr (24:351-352), Cairo: Maktabah Ibn Taymiyyah, 1415H/1994)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, I also quoted the Sufi Shaykh ʿAbd Allah bin Ṣiddīq al-Ghumārī he also acknowledged the weakness of Rawhū. He said,</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Rawhū, his weakness is light.” (Ittihāf al-Azkiyaʾ Bijawāj al-Tawassul bil-Anbiyāʾ waʾl Awliyāʾ (p.11) (?: ʾAlī Raḥmī, p.11) and (p.20) cited from Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ (p.146)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">So, this charge should be levied against these personalities too, especially Hafiz al-Haythami. In reality this is nothing but pure desperation and a feeble attempt to answer what I wrote. The unnamed author failed to even cite one reference and he called its a refutation!</span></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Leniency of Imam al-Hakim</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr in this introduction to his <em>Lisan ul-Mizan</em> indicates and alludes to the leniency of Imam Ibn Hibban by discussing some of his principles. (Lisan ul-Mizan 1:208-209, ed Abu Guddah Abdul Fattah (Beirut: Dar al-Basha&#8217;ir, 1423H / 2002CE).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">And the Imam as-Salah, in his reference work for hadith, <em>Ulum al-Hadith</em> also grades Imam al-Hakim as lenient. (Ulum al-Hadith, 22 (24th edition (Damascus/Beirut: Dar al-Fikr /Dar al-Fikr al-Ma&#8217;asir, 1440H / 2019CE) ed. Nur ud-Din al-&#8216;Itr</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imams al-Nawawi and al-Suyuti in his <em>Taqrib and Tadrib al-Rawi Fi Sharh Taqrib al-Nawawi</em> both held the view that Imam al-Hakim was lenient. al-Suyuti even went onto say that Imam al-Dhahabi rendered many of al-Hakims hadith in his al-Mustadrak weak and even compiled a treatise of around 100 fabricated narrations. This all indicates towards th leniency of Imam al-Hakim (Tadrib al-Raw 1:112. (Riyadh: Dar al-Taybah, 1422H) 5th edition ed. Abu Qutaybah Nazar Muhammad al-Faryabi).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi himsef alludes to the lenenicy of al-Hakim and says himself that he collated the fabricated and weak ahadith in al-Hakims al-Mustadrak (Siyar al-A&#8217;lam al-Nubala, 17:175)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi very clearly declares Imam al-Hakim to be Mutassahil, he says, &#8220;Like the the type that is referred to as Mutasaahil like al-Hakim (Ma&#8217;rifah ur-Ruwat al-Mutakkalm Fihim Bima Yujad ar-Radd, 15. (Dar al-Ma&#8217;rifah)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi said another time. &#8220;The mutasahil (lenient ones) are like at-Tirmidhi, al-Hakim and ad-Daraqutni sometimes&#8221; (al-Muqizah Fi Ilm Mustalah al-Hadith, 83. ed. Abdul Fattab abu guddah. (Beirut: Maktabah Matbuat al-Islamiyyah, 1425H) 8th edition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Shaykh Salim al-Hilali brings a long passage from al-Lucknowi&#8217;s <em>al-Rafa&#8217; wa&#8217;t-Takmil</em>, 282-308, who in turn quotes Hafiz al-Sakhawi saying the same in his <em>Fath ul-Mughith</em> (Kifayah ul-Hifzah Sharh a-Muqaddimah al-Muqizah, 323. (UAE: Maktabah al-Furqan, 1422H / 2001CE) 2nd edition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Ibn al-Mulaqqin also attributed Tasahul to Imam al-Hakim (al-Muqn&#8217;i Fi Ulum al-Hadith, 67. (KSA: Dar al-Fawaz)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr does the same in his <em>al-Nukt Ala Ibn as-Salah</em>, 314.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">IMAM IBN HIBBAN</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000080;">The author of this below standard reply wont be able to grasp the finer details and Imam Ibn Hibban&#8217;s methodology in his <em>ath-Thiqat</em>, which is the core theme of his contention, namely Rawhu&#8217;s inclusion in the Thiqat. The Imam outlines he is likely to include narrators who have also been criticised and Rawhu is one of them (Kitab ath-Thiqat, 1:11. 1st edition. (Beirut: DKI, 1419H/1998CE)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">al-Lucknowi outlines Ibn Hibban&#8217;s methodology in his <em>Thiqat</em> and concludes, Ibn Hibban was lenient in his Tawthiq. (ar-Rafa&#8217; Wat-Takmil Fi Jarh wa&#8217;t-Ta&#8217;dil, 332-339. 4th edition (Pakistan: Maktaba Maroofia, 1433/2013), edited Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Ghuddah Abdul Fattah endorses this view and also says the view of the Hanafi Zafar Ahmad Thanwi in his </span><em style="color: #000080;">Qawaid Fi Ulum al-Hadith</em><span style="color: #000080;">, 180. He further said numerous scholars have attributed Tasahul to Imam Ibn Hibban from the classical and contemporary scholars. He goes onto say that even al-Kawthari, who undoubtedly is probably highly respected by the author of this reply, also indicates tasahul of al-Hibban this in several places in his <em>Maqalat</em>, 69, 185, 303. (ar-Rafa&#8217; Wat-Takmil Fi Jarh wa&#8217;t-Ta&#8217;dil, 335, footnote 2).</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">This then makes the argument of the detractor redundant as instead of applying Sunni sciences, he applies the usual emotion and this is not how we scrutinise reports. Therefore, in conclusion the TasHih of Imam al-Hakim and the grading of Imam Ibn Hibban is problematic. The Sufi authors have also acknowledged this as I presented in the paper.</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Furthermore they say:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">“Shaikh Zubair ʿAlī Zaʾī graded the report to weak on account of the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ according to the scholars of Ḥadīth. He also argued, even if he was authentic the second problem is the tadlīs of Sufyān al-Thawrī. Shaikh Zubair said seven scholars of Ḥadīth classed Rawhū to be weak,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Ibn ʿAdiyy, (2) Ibn Yūnus, (3) al-Dāraquṭnī, (4) Ibn Mākūlā, (5) al-Dhahabī, (6) Ibn al-Jawzī, (7) Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah al-Baghdādī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān, al-Ḥākim authenticated him and Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī narrated from him. These three authentications are rejected based on the criticism of the majority of the scholars of ḥadīth. (al-Ḥadīth no.76, Ramaḍḥān 1431H/September 2010, p.9-12).Shaikh Zubair ʿAlī Zaʾī graded the report to weak on account of the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ according to the scholars of Ḥadīth. He also argued, even if he was authentic the second problem is the tadlīs of Sufyān al-Thawrī. Shaikh Zubair said seven scholars of Ḥadīth classed Rawhū to be weak,</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Let’s assume this is true- for sake of argument. There is a big question – what is the similarity between the tad`if of, Imam al-Daraqutni or Ibn al-Jawzi or Ibn Adiyy or Allamah al-Dhahabi and those of today, like Zubair Alizai? One main difference – the former `ulama never had the manhaj of denying tawassul. Check Siyar al-Alam al-Nubala 12:469 for Imam al-Dhahabi narrating about wasilah through Imam al-Bukhari رضى الله عنه and 16:400, ed. Arna`ut for wasilah through the Messenger ﷺ .</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong><br />
<strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">This is purely clutching at straws and saving oneself after they have sunk neck deep. The unnamed detractor provides no Hadith based answer except another digressive point which is the usual tactic of Barelwis. What exactly does the narration under discussion and the scrutiny of its chain and narrators have to do with someone allegedly making tawassul through the grave of Imam al-Bukhari? Precisely, nothing. The  unnamed chap seems to forget the Imams of the Salaf who declared Rawhu weak while Shaykh Zubair Ali Za&#8217;i relayed this information. Honestly at times there is a serious level of disingenuous by Barelwis, who instead of presenting a direct answer, tend to skirt around digressive points. At this point the detractors is literally making things up to support his view. Nonetheless since he has presented this point lets scrutinise it briefly.</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">1. The unnamed detractor quotes a report from a book of biographies of Imam al-Dhahabi, claiming then that he believed in Tawassul is an outright lie since the task of a biographer is to quote incidences related to the entry. If this was the case, we have to attribute to Imam al-Dhahabi as a belief system everything he quotes in his 30 volume of the Siyar, and of course this is absurd but for sure a Barelwi would bring such a silly point to fool the readers.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">The detractor surprisingly did manage to quote the correct reference for this report, namely Siyar al-A&#8217;lam an-Nabula, 12:469 (Beirut: ar-Risalah al-A&#8217;lamiah, 1438H/2017CE) and the chain Imam al-Dhahabi quotes it from through Abu Ali al-Ghassani who died in 498H (Siyar 19:150).</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi died 748H and therefore there is a gap of 250 years in the chain. In conclusion this chain is disconnected and hence weak with all scholars of hadith, the early and later ones. It is therefore upon the unnamed Barelwi detractor to first bring the chain, then prove its connected and continuous chain and only then proceed to authenticate and use it as evidence. It is unsurprising to learn this since this is a hallmark of Barelwi Sufis who claim link and chain connections to knowledge but terribly bring chainless report to prove their Aqidah. Barelwism has no hope if this is the best they come with him as a reply as their Tanbih al-Ghafilin, it seems more appropriate for the detractor to apply this to himself due to his dire negligence of hadith and Aqidah sciences.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">As for this claim :</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Muḥammad ibn ʿAlawī al-Malikī quotes it in his book and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“There is a difference of opinion regarding one of the narrators, Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ, however Ibn Ḥibbān mentions him in his al-Thiqāt and al-Ḥākim said he was safe and trustworthy. So both of them, the two Ḥāfiẓs authenticated the ḥadīth. Likewise al-Haythamī followed up on this in (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid) and said Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is in the chain, Ibn Ḥibbān declared him to be trustworthy as did al-Ḥākim, however, he has some weakness and the remaining narrators are the narrator of the Ṣaḥīḥs.” (Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ (p.146), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1430H/2009)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamdūḥ does the same and claims the narration is Ḥasan. He also quotes the statements of the scholars as we have mentioned above. He says the scholars have differed over Rawhū, some have said he is weak and others have declared him trustworthy. (Rafʿ ul-Minārah Li-Takhrīj Aḥadīth al-Tawassul wal-Ziyārah (p.147-148), Cairo, Maktabah al-Azhariyyah Lit-Turāth, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʿIsā Himyarī jubilantly went on to assert the Ḥadīth is Ṣaḥīḥ ie authentic according to the conditions of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim and Ḥasan according to the conditions of others. (al-Tāʾmul Fī Ḥaqīqah al-Tawassul, p.214-215)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a little imaginative of Himyarī to say the ḥadīth is authentic according to the condition of both Imām Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">G.F. Ḥaddād has also attempted to authenticate this report while relying on the works of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ and Muḥammad bin ʿAlawī al-Malikī. He pushes the line of argument of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ that the criticism is undetailed which is laughable as we have shown in this discourse. The Sūfī Aḥmad Daḥlān has also attempted to authenticate this report as does al-Ḥabīb al-Jifrī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The central argument of the detractors is that Rawhū is differed over and that the criticism levied against him is not detailed but rather general and therefore we take the general praise and authentication of him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and accepted by the detractors themselves that Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim are both mutāsahil ie lenient with their gradings and authentication. It does not make sense for them to accept this and leave the criticism. They couple this argument with the fact the criticism and discrediting is undetailed and vague, therefore one retorts to the position of praise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This has been answered by Shaikh al-Albānī and the scholars before him wherein he mentions the reasons Rawhū is weak. The main reason being he would narrate rejected narrations and that his narrations were rejected themselves. At times he would be a lone reporter of narration without any support.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAmr bin ʿAbd al-Munʿim explains that Imāms al-Ṭabarānī, Abū Nuʿaym and Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythamī have all declared this to be a lone report of Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and none of the other students and companions of Sufyān narrates this from except Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and these other students of Sufyān were memorisers and trustworthy narrators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Imām Ibn Ḥibbān citing Rawhū in his al-Thiqat, it is not tantamount to trustworthiness as he is known to be lenient ie Mutasāhil. Whatever he mentions under his entry in his al-Thiqāt does not clarify the affair of Rawhū except that it is information as we have shown under his entry, which has preceded. Rather we find this entry alludes to all of his narrations being of the rejected type.”</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is responded to here:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Abu Nuaym chains contain Rawh ibn Salàh al-Hàkim asserted was trustworthy and highly dependable (thiqa ma’mun) –as mentioned by Ibn Hajar in Lisàn al-Mïzàn (2:465 #1876), Ibn Hibbàn included him in al-Thiqàt (8:244), and al-Fasawï considered him trustworthy (cf. Mamdoh, Raf‘ [p. 148]).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Al-Haythamï (9:257) said: “Al-Tabarànï narrated it in al-Kabïr and al-Awsat and its chain contains Rawh ibn Salàh whom Ibn Hibbàn and al-Hàkim declared trustworthy although there is some weakness in him, and the rest of its sub-narrators are the men of sound hadïth.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I was unable to find Abu Hàtim’s declaration of Rawh as trustworthy reported by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Alawï in his Mafàhïm (10th ed. p. 145 n. 1). Nor does Shaykh Mahmod Mamdoh in his discussion of this hadïth in Raf‘ al-Minàra (p. 147-155) mention such a grading on the part of Abu Hàtim although he considers Rawh “truthful” (sadaq) and not “weak” (da‘ïf), according to the rules of hadïth science when no reason is given with regard to a narrator’s purported discreditation (jarhmubham ghayr mufassar).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mamdoh (p. 149-150) noted that although Albànï in his Silsila Da‘ïfa (1:32-33) claims it is a case of explicated discreditation (jarh mufassar) yet he himself declares identically-formulated discreditation cases as unexplicated and therefore unacceptable in two different contexts! Ibn ‘Alawï adds that the hadïth is also narrated from Ibn ‘Abbàs by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr –without specifying where –and from Jàbir by Ibn Abï Shayba, but without the du‘à.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Imàm al-Kawtharï said of this hadïth in his Maqàlàt (p. 410): “It provides textual evidence whereby there is no difference between the living and the dead in the context of using a means (tawassul), and this is explicit tawassul through the Prophets, while the hadïth of the Prophet from Abu Sa‘ïd al-Khudrï ‘O Allàh, I ask You by the right of [the promise made to] those who ask You (bihaqqi al-sà’ilïna ‘alayk)’* constitutes tawassul through the generality of Muslims, both the living and the dead.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Furthermore, the hadith of Hadrat Fatima bint Asad رضى الله عنه is proving the istihbab or fadail of tawasul and daif ahadith are accepted in fada`il.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong><br />
<span><strong><span style="color: #000080;">There is no answer from the detractor except that I had already mentioned it on my article. We already know some scholars of hadith praised Rawhu but he was criticised by numerous others and the criticism takes precedence and the author even knows this yet the Barelwi sect will try anything to slip falsehood through. Interesting to Ibn Alawi used Abu Hatim when that does not even exist while our detractors is concerned with Tasahul. It does not matter how many other chains there are if they cannot be substantiated as the detractors acknowledges. al-Kawtharis statement is redundant as it it is another attempt to mix the issues up, in order to seek tawassul from the dead you need clear authentic evidences which you have not provided, and as Shaykh al-Albani has done in his book besides many others proved permissible tawassul from authentic texts.</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><strong><span style="color: #000080;">If the claim was Istihbab then the detractor and his Sufi Barelwi elders would not have had a problem with those who did not make tawassul with the dead, so its not a case of Istihbab with you. The unnamed guy then admits the narration could be weak and then changes his line of argument by saying weak narrations can be used in Fadhail? So, you admit the narration is weak? What the detractor should be more concerned with is, if Tawassul is matter of creed and not a matter of fiqh with them, they need to bring mutawatir ahadith and not Ahad ahadith for them to be taken in Aqidah, since this is the core principle of Sufi Barelwi Ash&#8217;arim. What is the point of responding if you don&#8217;t follow your own theological principles.</span></strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many Sufi writers, whether they belong to the Ashari and maturidi theological rhetoric school of thought or whether they belong to the two sub continent sects of Deoband or Barelwi, all utilise and use the incident and the story of the people of the cave to either justify their impermissible tawassul and wasilah or they incorrectly deduce from the ayah in Surah Kahf the permissibility of buildings structures over graves and in turn this leading to shirk and grave worship and also relic worship. They further interpret this ayah and use it is a their most convincing argument to establish the permissibility of building domes over graves, relics and religious holy sites and thus arguing existence of the Green dome as well other mausoleums and shrines. These such shrines and tombs are widespread in the muslims lands and are commonly known as darbars or dargahs in the sub continent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These Sufi&#8217;s argue based on ayah 21 from Surah al-Kahf (18)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png"><img class=" wp-image-7473 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?resize=548%2C210" alt="18_21" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?resize=300%2C115 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?resize=768%2C294 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?resize=1024%2C392 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?w=1350 1350w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?w=1236 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;And thus We made their case known (to the people), that they might know that the Promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour. (Remember) when they (the people of the city) disputed among themselves about their case, they said: &#8220;Construct a building over them; their Lord knows best about them;&#8221; (then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): &#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong><strong>Surah al-Kahf (18):21</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sufi Barelwi churchfather and the student of the students of Ahmad Raza Khan, Mufti Ahmad Yar Khan Naeemi (d.1391H) said in his acclaimed book amongst his sufi followers says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Construction of some buildings near or in the vicinity of the grave of the common muslims is no doubt forbidden, but it is allowed (jaiz) in the case of islamic scholars and expert theologians&#8230;.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">he goes onto say</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is Jaiz (permissible) to construct a building near or around the shrines of illustrious &#8216;Mashaikh,&#8217; Aulia and Islamic scholars. Its justification is found in the ayah of the Holy Quran, the deeds of the Sahabah and the common Muslims and the sayings of the scholars. The holy Quran, while describing the event of Ashab-e-Kahaf (and then mentions the ayah above)&#8230;&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then goes onto bring the explanation of Ismail Haqqi (1127H) a Sufi of the Naqshabandi order from his <em>Tafsir Ruh al-Bayan</em>, the avid reader can refer to it or from the works of Naeemi. Ahmad Yar Khan Naeemi goes onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Holy Quran has mentioned two things of these people: (1) to hold mutual consultation about building a shrine and making a dome around the As-hab-e-Kahaf. (2) constructing a masjid near them, denying nothing which shows that these two actions were lawful in the past and are also lawful even today as is proved by the book of principles.&#8221;</em> (Ja&#8217;a al-Haq (p.328-329 Eng Tran. p.279-280 Urdu)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we can see the Sufi Barelwis and their compatriots have misconstrued this ayah to establish the permissibility of making structures, shrines, tombs and even mosques/masjids over graves when the reality is far from this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first thing to understand in this regard is, and numerous Imams of the Salaf have mentioned this, the people of the time denied the hereafter and that they would be raised again. Ikrimah mentions some people from amongst them claimed only the souls will be raised again without the bodies. (<em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> 3:747, <em>Tafsir al-Tabari</em> 15:270-271, <em>Tarikh Tabari</em> 2:46)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Qurtubi mentions something similar, that there was a righteous ruler at the time and some people differed concerning the raising of the soul and body. Some people became doubtful and denied the raising of the body and claimed only the souls will be raised while the earth will consume the bodies. Others argued and said both the body and soul will be raised. This became a difficult matter for the King to answer, who later spent time pondering the answer until the incident of the people of the cave. (<em>Tafsir Qurtubi</em> 10:380, see also <em>Mukhtasar Tafsir al-Qurtubi</em> 2:313)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Meaning of Masjid in the Ayah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr clarifies the meaning of masjid in the ayah and brings the statement of the illustrious companion and explainer of the Quran, Abdullah ibn Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The people said honour your brothers, so the people after thinking and pondering  said we will make a masjid over them. Then they began praying over them, seeking forgiveness for them and supplicating for them.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tagliq al-ta&#8217;liq</em> 4:264)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So here, praying over them refers to praying their funeral prayer which is further evidenced by the fact that they supplicated for them and asked Allah for forgive them. There is no mention of erecting ornate structures, shrines, tombs, mausoleums, darbars etc and certainly making a masjid over their grave so that people continue to pray over them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the explanations of this ayah by the various explainers of the Quran who use the word masjid in this context is solely and mainly praying the funeral prayer of the people of the cave, seeking forgiveness and supplicating for them. The Sufis cite the words of Fakhar al-Din al-Razi who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Some people said that the door of the cave should be closed so that nobody can enter it and the affair of the People of the cave are hidden. Some said that It is better to build a masjid at the door, this saying proves that these people were righteous people of Allah who wanted to worship him and offer their prayers.&#8221; </em>(Tafsir al-Kabir 5:75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fakhr al-Din al-Razi also said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><b>&#8220;</b>And when Allah said <b>&#8220;</b>Those who prevailed over their affair<b>&#8220;</b> this refers to the leader of the Muslims or the friends of Ashab al-Kahf or the leaders of town. <b>&#8220;</b>We will surely build a masjid over them<b>&#8220;</b> so that we can worship Allah in it and preserve the affairs or affect of the people of the cave with the masjid.&#8221;</em> (Tafsir al-Kabir 5:475]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again this refers to the funeral prayer and also to make a masjid to preserve their &#8216;Athar&#8217; which can be understood as their affair or their affect meaning their worship of Allah and singling him out as one and his Tawhid. This is the message of the people of the cave, the Tawhid of Allah The Mighty and Majestic. This is what the leaders and the people wanted to preserve and even if this is understood as a masjid, they wanted to preserve their effect i.e. the worship of Allah. It is not how the sufi barelwis project in the building of structures riddled with shirk and bidah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti and al-Mahalli said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>&#8220;</strong>They were disputing<b>&#8220;</b> That is, the believers and the disbelievers, <b>&#8220;</b>among themselves their affair<b>&#8220;</b> i.e. the affair of the youths, with regard to building something around them; <b>&#8220;</b>so they<b>&#8220;</b>, the disbelievers, said, <b>&#8220;</b>Build over them<b>&#8220;</b> that is, around them, <b>&#8220;</b>a building&#8221; to cover them up; &#8220;their Lord knows them best.’ Those who prevailed regarding their affair&#8221; i.e. the affair of the youths, “i.e. the believers &#8221; &#8220;We will verily set up over them) around them &#8220;a Masjid&#8221; for prayers to be performed therein. And this indeed took place at the entrance of the cave.&#8221;</em> (Tafsir al Jalalyn 2:4)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti further said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Imam Ibn Abi Hatim narrates from Suddi, the kind go the country called the religious leaders of his nation and consulted them concerning the affair of the people of the cave. The King was known as Decius and the youth of the cave had gone missing during his era and he had written their names on a tablet on the city gates. (When the youth returned to buy something) they read the names and it was the same people. The king was happy as these people who he though had died were in actual fact alive and then it became well known among the people that Allah had raised the dead from the living. The King said he would make a place of worship near their graves and I will continue worshipping Allah in it until I die. Abdur Razzaq and Ibn Abi Hatim transmit that Qatdaah said, &#8220;<strong>those who won their point said..&#8221; </strong>this refers to their rulers and leaders. Ibn Abi Hatim transmits from Sa&#8217;id ibn Jubayr who said the King made a church over the graves and wrote Ibna al-Arakanah, Ibna al-Dahqin.&#8221;</em>  (<em>Tafsir Dar al-Manthur</em> 4:569-570)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows they never built anything on the cave or over the graves but rather a masjid at the entrance, therefore, using this as an evidence to make mosques over graves is incorrect and a wrong understanding.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Tabari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Mushrikeen said: We will build a building over it and worship Allah in it but the Muslims said: We have more right over them and we will surely build a mosque so that we can pray there and worship Allah.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tafsir at-Tabari</em> 15:149)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Qurtubi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The view of the majority is the height from which a grave it is to be lowered which is higher than a handspan. The height to keep is for it to be recognised and for it to be respected (as in not walked over as flat earth). This is the situation with the grave of our Prophet Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and both of his companions.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tafsir Qurtubi</em> 10:380)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also says something very similar and along the same lines in his book al-Tazkirrah (p.86)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Qurtubi further explains it was the reign of Decius in which the youth went missing, he had the names written down and in the later generations when they returned to buy something from the city, the ruler at the time was righteous and pious etc. Imam Qurtubi further mentions the ruler said we will build a structure to remember them by. The people on the religion of the youth said make a masjid and the unbelievers said we will makee our place of worship or a resting place over them. The Muslims objected and said we will make a masjid. When some of the people went to the cave they noticed the cave had closed and the people had vanished. According to a report of Abdullah ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) Allah concealed their affair from the people, hence the ruler suggested making a a structure to remember them by. (<em>Tafsir Qurtubi</em> 10:380, al-<em>Maharrar al-wajiz</em> 3:507)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then Imam Qurtubi goes on to cite many narrations in the prohibition of making masjids and places of worship over graves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Kathir and Imam Tabari mentions when one of them returned to the city to buy some food, things had change and so had his money. Once they find out things were not adding up they presented him to the ruler, the roman ruler, Decius. Then Decius and the people followed the person to the cave and he entered the cave himself first. (<em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> 3:747, <em>Tafsir al-Tabari</em> 15:271).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Kathir goes on to say it is not know how he entered the cave or what happened thereafter. Another view was, the ruler was Theodosius, who was a believer, who also entered the cave and embraced the people. They later left and the people of the cave went back to sleep and eventually died. (<em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> 3:747-748, <em>Tafsir al-Tabari</em> 15:277 and <em>Tarikh Tabari</em> 2:46)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Kathir further mentions the people were leaders and people of influence or suggested the idea of building a structure over or near their graves however the questions is, were they such and worthy to be followed. Therefore it is very questionable for them to be followed in this because the Messenger of Allah ﷺ cursed the jews and christians for making places of worship on the graves of their prophets. (<em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> 3:747-748)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are other similar sayings the other explainers of the Quran have mentioned, Nasafi in <em>Tartib al-Madarik</em> (3:18), Abu Hayyan in <em>Bahr al-Muhit</em> (7:158), Imam Ibn al-Jawzi cites the view Imam Ibn Qutaybah <em>Za&#8217;d ul-Masir</em> (5:124) as well his own view as Shaykh al-Albani brings (5:123) as we proceed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Clarification of Shaykh Muhammad Shinqiti</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He refutes those who use this ayah as evidence for making places of worship on graves and those who do not have knowledge say this is something encouraged from the Quran and Sunnah, whoever holds this view is from the most ignorant of creation. So are we to follow this group who say lets make a masjid over them? or were they disbelievers, who it is impermissible to follow? There is a difference if they were people of Fatrah or a group of disbelievers. If it is said they were disbelievers, then there is no problem because this is not evidence for us (<em>Tafsir Qurtubi</em> 10:379), He says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;If they claim they were Muslims, then we answer and say it is not hidden from the most deficient in intelligence that they were Muslims from a previous nation and that it this does not oppose the authentic clear text transmitted from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ except those whose intelligence is confused. This is because the Messenger of Allah ﷺ before he passed away cursed those who build places of worship over the graves. Therefore, it is clear whoever follows the ways of those who advocate building places of worship over graves have been cursed from the tongue of the most trustworthy and honest, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.&#8221;</em> (<em>Adwa al-Bayan</em> 3:159)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Statement of Imam Abdul Aziz Ibn Baz</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn Baz said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The answer to that is: that Allah has told us about the leaders and powerful people of that time, and that they said these words. That does not imply that He liked that or approved of them, rather He said that by way of blaming them and condemning their action. This is indicated by the fact that the Messenger sallalahu alayhi wasallam to whom this verse was revealed and who was the most knowledgeable of people as to how it should be interpreted, forbade his ummah to build mosques over graves, warned them against doing so, and cursed and condemned those who did that.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">If that had been permissible, then the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alayhi wasallam would not have discouraged it in such emphatic terms, and gone to the extent of cursing those who did it, and said that they are the most evil of mankind before Allah. This is sufficient to convince the seeker of truth. Even if we were to assume that building places of worship over graves was permitted to those who came before us, it is not permissible for us to follow their example in that, because our sharee’ah abrogates the laws that came before it, and our Messenger sallalahu alayhi wasallam is the Final Messenger whose Shari&#8217;ah is complete and universal. He has forbidden us to build mosques over graves, so it is not permissible for us to go against him. We must follow him, adhering to that which he brought and abstaining from anything from the ancient laws that goes against that or any custom that appeals to the one who does it but goes against that. For there is nothing more perfect than the laws of Allah and there is no guidance better than the guidance of the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alayhi wasallam</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Allah is the One Whom we ask to help us and all the Muslims to adhere firmly to His religion and to follow the shari’ah of His Messenger Muhammad sallalahu alayhi wasallam in all that we say and do, both outwardly and inwardly, in all our affairs, until we meet Allah, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Near. May Allah send blessings and peace upon His slave and Messenger Muhammad and his family and companions, and those who follow his guidance, until the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</em> (<i>Majmu Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawi’ah li Samahat al-Shaykh Ibn Baz </i>1:434)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani&#8217;s Answer</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani cites the doubt of the Sufi&#8217;s who say in regard to this ayah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This ayah evidences the permissibility of making masajid over graves and the point of deduction is that the people who said this were the followers of Isa Alayhis Salam i.e. christians as it has been mentioned in the books of Tafasir. Therefore, we find it was permissible to make a mosque over graves in their shari&#8217;ah as Allah mentions this without reprimanding it. Thus the principle is, if Allah mention a ruling of the previous nations without rejecting it then it is also shariah for us which means that it is permissible for us to do the same as mentioned in this ayah.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tahzir al-Sajid</em> p.48)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani answers this and says there are three answers to this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>First Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is established in the knowledge regarding the principles i.e. Ilm al-Usul that previous shariahs i.e. legislation before the advent of Islam is not shariah for us, there are numerous evidences for this which. As an example Imam Ibn Hazm brings approximately 50 or so evidences to prove the previous shariahs were not incumbent upon us. (<em>al-Ihkam Fi Usul al-Ahkam </em>5:16)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani adds a note and says these can referred to in larger volumes on Ilm al-Usul and specifically<em> al-Ihkam Fi Usul al-Ahkam</em> of Ibn Hazm and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani continues and says one such evidence for this is the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) that he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I have been given five things that no Prophet before was given, a Prophet was sent to his respective nation whereas i have been sent to the whole of mankind.&#8221; </em>(Bukhari Muslim and I have referenced it in al-Irwa ul-Ghalil no.285)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even if the aforementioned ayah alludes to making masjid over graves, it was in the previous shariahs which have been since abrogated and neither does it command us to act on this ayah and therefore it is not permissible for us to make mosques over graves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Second Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even if we were to accept their statement that the previous shariahs were incumbent upon us, then this still has another binding condition intertwined with it which is that there can be nothing that contradicts or opposes it from our shariah. This however this is not the case because this condition is missing because mutawatir (overwhelming number of) ahadith prohibit making masjids over graves. This is a clear evidence to indicate the previous shariah is not incumbent or binding upon us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Third Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not hold the aforementioned ayah alludes to the permissibility of making mosques over graves in the previous shariahs i.e. in the legislation of Isa Alayhis Salam because it only shows some people expressed an idea or thought to build a masjid on the people of the cave &#8211; Ashab al-Kahf. There is no clarification whether they were believers. Even if we accept they were believers there is no clarification if they were righteous and obedient to the shariah of Isa Alayhis Salam but rather some evidences show they were not following the shariah (of Isa Alayis Sallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The View of Hafiz Ibn Rajab (795H)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence Hafiz Ibn Rajab (795H) wrote in the explanation of the hadith, <em>&#8220;May the curse of Allah be upon the jews and christians who built places of worship over the graves of their Prophet.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This hadith which prohibits making places of worship over the graves of Prophets is also evidenced in the Quran where Allah says about the people of the Cave  &#8211; Ashab al-Kahf, <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong>This ayah shows making places of worship on graves were the actions of the people of power and leadership which shows this had no basis or ruling in their shariah but rather they just wanted to do this based on their wishes as being the leaders and people of power. This was not the action of the people of knowledge and virtue who were obedient and following the guidance revealed to their Prophets who were also the companions and helpers.&#8221;</em> (Fath al-Bari 65:280 from al-Kawakib al-Darari &#8211; manuscript from in Maktabah al-Zahiriyyah. TN. See also Fath al-Bari 2:397 of Ibn Rajab)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The View of Shaykh Ali bin Urwah and Hafiz Ibn Kathir</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ali bin Urwah concurs and supports Hafiz Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir, he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ibn Jarir has cited two statements on explanation of this ayah, the first being that, we will build a place of worship, they were believers and the second statement was that they were polytheists &#8211; mushriks, Allahs knows best. What is apparent is that they were people of power and influence but what they said was not the truth because the statement of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) is that he cursed the jews and christians for making places of worship on the graves of their Prophets. His intent was to warn his Ummah from this evil action. There is also a report Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) during his reign they found the grave of Prophet Danyal in Iraq with his scrolls. He quickly buried him with his book, concealing it from the people.&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar al-Kawakib 10:208:2, Tafsir Ibn Kathir 3:78)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani adds a notes to the statement of Imam Ibn Jarir that Imam Ibn al-Jawzi mentioned exactly the same in his Za&#8217;d al-Masir 5:123, Maktab al-Islami)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani continues and said, we find from these details, using this ayah to make places of worship over graves is totally incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The View of Allamah al-Muhaqqiq Alusi (1270H)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This ayah has been used to prove the permissibility of building shrines over the graves of the pious people. From the people who have put forward this deduction are Shihab Khafaji which he mentions in his notes to al-Baydawi, However this deduction is totally and absolutely incorrect, false and corrupt.&#8221;</em> (Ruh al-Ma&#8217;ani 5:31)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albnai says, then Allamah Alusi cites some ahadith in prohibition of this issue and supports it by citing a statement of Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Haithami, which I have presented on (p.22 -Tahzir al-Sajid)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Statement Shaykh al-Albani is referring to on (p.22) is where Hafiz al-Haithami said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Building places of worship/masjids over graves means to pray next or on top of them.&#8221;</em> (al-Zawajir 1:121)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani continues and says, &#8220;then, Allamah Alusi in his book, <em>&#8216;Sharh al-Minhaj&#8217;</em> also cites another statement of Hafiz Ibn Hajr Haithami, where he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;A group of scholars have issued an edict to demolish all the structures built over graves in Qarafah in Egypt, even the mausoleum of Imam Shafi&#8217;i which was build by a revering ruler. Every Muslim should, if no problems arise, demolish and ground every structure (built over graves) and if troubles and problems are likely to arise it becomes the responsibility of the leader and ruler. These points have been taken from Ibn al-Raf&#8221;ih&#8217;s book &#8216;Kitab al-Sulah'&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;then Allamah Alas goes onto say it can be argued (i.e. they argue) making places of worship over graves was permissible in the previous shariahs based on the ayah of Surah al-Kahf and presenting evidences from previous shariahs is something the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) would do. For example he said whoever sleeps or forgets to pray he should pray immediately when he remembers or wakes up (This hadith is authentic and referenced in the Sahihayn and it is not correct to say it has been narrated as it indicates weakness in the terminology of the scholars as i have clarified in Salah al-Tarawih (p.63-64), also i have referenced this hadith in Sahih Abi Dawud no.461, al-Irwa no.263), and he presented the ayah, &#8220;and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat) for My Remembrance.&#8221; (Surah Taha 20:14). whereas this command was given to Musa Alayhis Salam which was mentioned in the Quran as an incident. Likewise and similarly Imam Abu Yusuf when there is a need for Qisas between husband and wife, Imam Karkhi when there needs to be Qisas between a servant and master, Dhimmi and Muslim have used as evidence the ayah, <strong>&#8220;And We ordained therein for them: &#8220;Life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wounds equal for equal.&#8221; But if anyone remits the retaliation by way of charity, it shall be for him an expiation&#8230;&#8221; (Surah al-Ma&#8217;idah5:45)</strong> therefore we can also use the ayah from Surah al-Kahf as evidence.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">The answer to this doubt is that the previous shariahs have some bearing on us but this now absolute, complete and with restriction but rather it is restricted with conditions that Allah mentions a ruling or command without rejecting and remember rejecting what the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) says is also rejecting Allah. We have already read Allahs Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) has cursed those who make places of worship on graves. It must also be succinctly noted, if making places of worship over graves was something permissible and acceptable in the Shariahs before the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) would not have cursed them for doing this. furthermore, this ayah (18:21) is not like the other ayahs which have been mentioned from which the Imams made deductions or used as evidence compared to the other ayahs. This ayah merely mentions the idea of a group of them wanting to build a place of worship over their graves and it just shows their honour not that they should be followed. Therefore until it is not established that anyone from amongst them was infallible nothing can be considered to be part of our shariah. Another reason that this is overlooked is that they were leaders and people of power who were less obedient to their religion and more fervent in their leadership.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">We find that the first group were believers who were aware of the prohibition of making places of worship over graves and hence decided to make a closed entrance to the grave without any connection tot he people of the cave. The other group who were leaders, people of power and influence did not accept their view and decided to build a place of worship of their graves.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">If if someone wants to hold this later and second view of <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221;</strong> it did not mean the prohibited type of place of worship on their graves which is cursed but rather wanted to make a place of worship ear or next to the graves. Hence according to the narrations of Suddi and Wahb, they clearly state this type of building a place of worship which is not prohibited. At the very most it can be understood as Masjid al-Kahf just as Masjid al-Nabawi. (TN. This is incorrect as Masjid al-Nabwi is titled that because the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) built it not because it was next to the grave.)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">It can also be argued and presented the people wanted to make a place of worship on the mount where the cave was situated. There is a report in this regard from Mujahid, the ruler at the time left the people of the cave in there places and wanted to build a place of worship on the mountain in remembrance of them. This is what seems the closest to the apparent meaning of the ayah.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, this is only applicable if the assumption is made that the people of the cave woke up and died later and if they went to sleep again after waking up, i.e. they were still alive (as the ayat indicate) and did not die, then this whole discussion and using this ayah for this interpretation is null, void and has no bearing whatsoever.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani adds a note and says that Allamah Alusi further cited the statement of Hasan al-Basri who said a place of worship was built on the cave, ready for them when they would wake up. Alusi then said the basis of this statement, the people of the cave did not die when they returned to the cave but rather slept like they had done before. Some said they would remain asleep until the Mahdi comes, when they will wake up and help him. However all of these statements are without authenticity and are somewhat spurious. (Ruh al-Ma&#8217;ani 5:31)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Alusi contines and says whoever has any guidance and truth will not have the audacity to hold onto the generality of this ayah and a view opposing and contradicting the clear authentic ahadith and reports. Whoever uses this ayah to prove building places of worship over graves is extreme ignorance and misguidance and yet despite this scholars for names sake render the actions of these ignorant people to be permissible, from what they do to the graves of the pious people. This includes raising the heights of graves, making them rectangular and solid, hanging ornaments from them, praying towards the graves, kissing them, having festivals there etc and they all of this under this ayah of Surah al-Kahf and the incident of the people of the cave as well as other narrations. One such report being the ruler persevered the people of the cave with specific woodland would organise annuals birthday celebrations, however all of these issues are innovations and new things and have not an iota of importance in the opposition to what Allah and his Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) are as such in formulating a new religion which Allah gave them no permission.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In order to know and to seek the truth look at the actions and dealings of the companions with the best grave on the planet, the grave of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam)? What was their practise in visiting his grave and offering salutations? Then compare their actions and practises with these grave worshippers and how much of a stark and dire difference there really is? What did the comparisons do and what are these grave worshippers doing.&#8221; (Ruh al-Ma&#8217;ani 15:31-32) End of the words of Allamah Alusi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answering and Refuting the Reckless Speech of a Contemporary &#8211; &#8216;Abu </strong><b>Faiz Ahmad al-Siddiq al-Ghumari&#8217;</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: A contemporary whilst discussing this ayah of Surah al-Kahf instead of debating permissibility has gone to the extreme extent and claimed it is recommended. The points of deduction are somewhat new and different to those previously mentioned and details answers to them have preceded. This individual says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This ayah proves the permissibility of making masjid over graves because Allah mentioned their statement, <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them&#8221;</strong> without shunning, correcting or refuting it&#8230;&#8221;</em> (TN &#8211;<em>Ihya al-maqbur min adillati jawaz bina al-masajid ala qubur</em> p.21+, <em>I&#8217;lam al-rak&#8217;e al-Sajid Bi-Ittihazu al-Qubur Masajid</em> p,70)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All three Ghumaris, Ahmad, Abdullah and Abdul Aziz have authored books against Shaykh al-Albani but two of them in particular on this issue, the first by Ahmad Ghumar, &#8216;Ihya al-Maqbur Min Adillati Jawaz Bina al-Masajid Ala Qubur&#8217; and Abdullah Ghumari, <em>&#8216;I&#8217;lam al-rak&#8217;e al-sajid bi-ittihazu al-qubur masajid.&#8217;</em> The arguments in both books are similar without anything new and anything that was new Shaykh al-Albnai answered.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mu&#8217;allami mentions something similar in his book that they claim it is recommended, whereas others believe it is in fact obligatory to makes places of worship over graves. He calls them ignorant extremists. (al-Bana&#8217;u alal qubur p.55+)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani goes onto say, this analysis has two answers</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the refuting, correction or shunning is not mentioned, and holding this to be the correct view is within of itself incorrect except if it is proven the people who said <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong>are muslims and people who were also obedient and followed the respective shariah of their Prophet. However there is no such indication int he ayah and what seems closer to the truth and reality is they may not have even been Muslims  or at the very least were not practising or righteous muslims but rather were evil disbelievers, this has preceded from the statements of Ibn Rajab Hanbali and Ibn Kathir. In such circumstances mentioning their statements without refuting or shunning it is actual essence reprimanding it and this is because attributing a statement or action of the disbelievers of evil sinners and then mentioning it is sufficient as a censure and refutation of it by in of itself. Therefore, using the silence or the lack of reprimand as evidence from the aforementioned ayah under discussion  is incorrect and this is further supported by the second answer</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This deduction and the extraction of this point can be considered to be correct by the people before and the current day people by those who follow their whims and desires based on their ways and principles, who only consider the Quran to be the Din without have any respect, reverence and giving any importance whatsoever to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). However the belief and principles of Ahl al-Sunnah wal Jama&#8217;ah are that both the Quran and Sunnah is to have Iman and conviction in both of them. They believe in the following authentic well known hadith where the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Be attentive that I have been given the Quran and something similar to it. in another report it mentions he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, &#8220;Whatever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) makes unlawful then it just like Allah made it haram or unlawful.&#8221;</em> (Mishkat, Kitab al-Iman, Bab al-Ei&#8217;tisam no.163)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How can the contemporary say Allah never reprimanded or refuted the statement of these people when they said, <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong>whereas it has been refuted and rejected in mutawatir hadith. Allah cursed these people via the speech of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and therefore what can more clear and manifest in terms of a refutation than this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Using the ayah of Surah al-Kahf to establish the permissibility to build places of worship over graves of the Prophets in opposition and in contradiction to the mutawatir hadith is just like proving the permissibility of taking pictures and idol worship from the following statement of Allah with regard to the Jinns obeying the commands of Suleiman Alayhis Salam,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;They worked for him as he desired, (making) high rooms, images, basins as large as reservoirs, and (cooking) cauldrons fixed (in their places). &#8220;Work you, O family of Dawud (David), with thanks!&#8221; But few of My slaves are grateful.&#8221; (Surah al-Saba 34:13)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is done by overlooking all of the ahadith which prohibit making pictures and the prohibition of idol worship, however any muslim who have Iman in the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) will not have the audacity to do this. This concludes the answer to the deduction these people use from the ayah of  <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong>End of the words of Shaykh al-Albani from <em>Tahzir al-Sajid Min Ittihazu al-Qubur Masajid</em> p.48-58)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Former Mufti of Egypt</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The former mufti of Egypt, Ali Gomaa/Jumua also used this ayah to prove the permissibility of building places of worship over graves, he generally uses the same arguments when it comes to this ayah and its incorrect interpretation. He has been answered in a book over 300 pages titled, &#8216;<em>Isti&#8217;dhah bi al-Ghafur min bid&#8217;ah bina al-masajid wa-qibab ala al-qubur, wa-ma‘ahu ta‘aqqubat ala mughalatat fatwa al-duktur AlI Jum‘ah fī bina al-masajid ala al-qubur.&#8217; </em>by Abu Anas ibn Abdul Maqsud.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdur Rahman Mu&#8217;allami al-Yamani (1386H) has given a very detailed answer to the deductions and points drawn by these people from this ayah, He discusses it great length and in intricate detail which will be too lengthy to reproduce here, so let the avid reader refer to it. (Al-Bana&#8217;u al-alal qubur p.7+)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Making masjids over graves is not from the Din of the Muslims, rather it is prohibited it from established texts from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and according to the agreement of the Imams of the Din. In fact it is impermissible to make masjid over graves, whatever is practised in those masjids even with the intent of praying near them, and all of the Imams of the Din are unanimous in prohibiting this.&#8221;</em> (Majmu&#8217;a al-Fatawa 27:477)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Imams are agreed in not building masjid on graves.&#8221;</em> (Majmu&#8217;a Fatawa 22:145)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said another time,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Scholars have said it is impermissible to build masjid/places of worship over graves.&#8221;</em> (Majmu&#8217;a Fatawa 27:77)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s Ahmad Yar Khans points and deductions then they are irrelevant and poor without any substance to the because we have shown the meaning he extracts from the ayah are a dire exaggeration of his imagination because none of the points mention the making of shrines or tombs on graves and doing and saying it is permissible or recommended by the likes of Ahmad Yar Khan and Ahmad Siddiq Ghumari is a clear distortion of the ayat of the Quran.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point of Ahmad Siddiq Ghumari and Ahmad Yar Khan Naeemi are further refuted by the authentic hadith of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) which Ai&#8217;shah (RadhiAllahu Anha) narrates,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Um Salama told Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) about a church which she had seen in Ethiopia and which was called Mariya. She told him about the pictures which she had seen in it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) said, &#8220;If any righteous pious man dies amongst them, they would build a place of worship at his grave and make these pictures in it; they are the worst creatures in the sight of Allah.&#8221;</em> (Bukhari no.434, Muslim no.528)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">See also Bukhari no.1330, Muslim 529 for a hadith with a very similar meaning</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;These Masajid which have been built on the graves of the Prophets, the righteous, rulers and others, then it is a must to demolish them or by any other means, this is such an affair that I do not know of any difference of opinion between the well known scholars.&#8221;</em> (Iqtida Sirat al-Mustaqim 1:330)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To emphasise on the point of Shaykh al-Albani and his answer to Ahmad Siddiq Ghumari that whatever Allahs Messenger ﷺ declared to be unlawful is divine legislation i.e. shariah and thus we have a very explicit hadith from Jundub (RadhiAllahu Anhu), the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said 5 days before his death,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Beware, the people before you would places of worship on the graves of their Prophets and righteous people, beware attentively DO NOT make graves as places of worship for verily I forbid you from that.&#8221;</em> (Muslim no.532)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith is as explicit as it will get and if this does not suffice the individual of sound intellection and mindset, then we do not know what will. The readers can also refer to short but succinct treatise of Imam Shawkani, Sharh al-sudur fi thrill rafa al-qubur, where he discusses the issues in generally and brings numerous hadith to show the unlawfulness of building masjid or places of worship over graves. The later is also referenced and checked by Shaikh abdul Muhsin al-Abbad, wherein he also brings some points of benefit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find from the statements of the scholars, making graves as places or worship or masjid over graves is impermissible in our shariah due to the clear authentic texts. Furthermore, that we cannot use the ayah from Surah Kahf to justify its permissibility due to the answers which have preceded. In this article we have not cited the overwhelming number of hadith which clearly mention this prohibition because inshAllah they will be perhaps presented at a different time</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">by the two weak slaves of Allah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8th of Sha&#8217;ban /5th May 2017</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Birmingham</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">England</span></p>
