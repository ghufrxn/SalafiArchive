				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="center"><strong>Compiled &amp; Translated </strong></h5>
<h5 align="center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, no long introductions straight to the point. 6 scholars &#8211; 3 fathers and 3 sons who spent decades upon calling to Tawhid and Sunnah, teaching hadith, reprimanding Madhhabism and the associated bigoted taqlid. If anything take the benefit of nurturing your children on the pure pristine Salafi Manhaj and keep away from blind fanaticism of madhhabs and take evidence when it comes to you. Same people who fall prey to technical fiqhi buzz words and think they have a defence!</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[1] Shaikh al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Muhammad Sa&#8217;id Muhaddith Banarasi</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was born in a sikh household in 1274H and died in 1322H/1904CE. He was born as Mawl Singh in Gujrat and his father’s name was Karak Singh. He was a sikh and converted to Islam. He first sought knowledge in Deoband but later became Ahlul Hadith and eventually studied with major Salafi Ahlul Mashaykh like Shaykh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi who he studied hadith and tafsir with as well as Shaykh Abdullah Ghazipuri and Shaykh Muhammad Ibrahim Arawi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then went to the Banaras (Varanasi) the holiest city of the idol worshippers and set up Madrasah Sa&#8217;idiyyah in 1297H and taught for a few decades until he died. He also set up a printing press called Matba&#8217;a Sa&#8217;idiyyah and printed thousands of pages of amazing books that promoted the Madhhab of Ahlul Hadith and Salafis and refuted the bigoted Madhhabists</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From Sikhism to establishing a Salafi Madrasah built upon Tawhid and Sunnah in the holiest place of the idol worshiping Hindus and a phenomenal printing press.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaykh Abdur Rahman al-Faryawa&#8217;i said about him, <em>&#8220;He had numerous works and treatises most of which were fierce and vehement refutations of the muta’ssub Madhhabists and the bigoted staunch Muqallidin he also had a book on Fatawa in 2 parts.&#8221;</em> (al-Harakatus Salafiyyyah wa Dawriha Fi Ihya as-Sunnah (p.44)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He died in 1322H/1904CE. He had a son, who he nurtured on the Quran and Sunnah with care, affection and diligence and he was,</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[2] Shaikh al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Abul Qasim Muhammad Sayf Banarasi </strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was born in 1307H Banaras. He completed his Hifz of the Quran by the age of 7 and by the age of 16 he started teaching after having taken all the knowledge from his father, Shaykh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, Shaykh Abdul Mannan al-Wazirabadi, Shaykh Shams ul-Haq Azimabadi, Shaykh Hussain b. Muhsin Ansari.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He began teaching in his father&#8217;s Madrasah Sa&#8217;idiyyah where he taught Bukhari and Muslim 30 times (each) during his life. He spend his life defending and spreading hadith. When a Hanafi bigoted muqallid wrote a book called <em>&#8220;Jarh Alal Bukhari&#8221;</em> and 6-7 other books criticising and disparaging Sahih al-Bukhari and hadith in general. Shaykh Abul Qasim Sayf Banarasi answered and refuted all of them in overwhelming detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He defended and spread the Madhhab of Ahlul Hadith and Salafis through his numerous works. He was a prolific author and wrote books in Arabic and Urdu which number more than 65. Some of them include,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jam&#8217;a al-Quran wal-Hadith, Qadhiyatul Hadith Fi Hujjatul Hadith, Husul al-Maram, Kitab ar-Radd Ala Abi Hanifah &#8211; an rendering of the work of the Ahlul Hadith Muhaddith Imam Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Shaybah, Arba&#8217;in Muhammadi, Hidayatus Sa&#8217;il Ila Ahadith Wa&#8217;il, Naf&#8217;i al-Ahnaf, Hal Mushkilat Bukhari in 3 volumes also known as Kawthar al-Jari Fi Jawab al-Jarh Alal Bukhari, al-Amr al-Mubram Li-Ibtal Al-Kalam al-Muhkam, al-Siyar al-Hathith Fi Barah Ahlul Hadith, Ijtilab al-Manfa&#8217;a Liman Yatal&#8217;ih Ahwal Ai&#8217;matul Arb&#8217;a, 5 more books refuting the Hanafi muqallid who attacked Sahih al-Bukhari and many more.

The very same teachers who who rejected and shunned taqlid and lived their life accordance with following and obeying ie Ittiba of the Quran and Sunnah, they gave me their asanid and ijazat”. </em>(Aqidah Firqatun Najiyyah p.23-27)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the call of the Salafi&#8217;s and the Ahl al-Hadith, that the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) is above and beyond the statement, opinion and view of any human being ever born on this earth. If this usul of Ahl al-Sunnah is put first and foremost and then everything behind this, it is possible for a person to achieve salvation. There is a clear command from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) in instructing all of us to transmit and spread ahadith, </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From Ubadah ibn Samit (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who narrates in marfu form that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, </span></p>
<div class="inline-attachment" style="text-align: justify;">
<dl class="file">
<dt class="attach-image"><span style="color: #000000;"><img class="postimage aligncenter" src="http://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=112" alt="hadith.png" width="711" height="141" /></span></dt>
</dl>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong>&#8220;I will tell you a hadith, the one present should transmit/narrate to those who are absent&#8230;&#8221; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(Musnad al-Firdaws of al-Daylami (1:2:317) from Silsilah Ahadith al-Sahihah (4:298 no.1721) of Shaykh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani authenticated this hadith by citing other ahadith with supporting meanings and understanding</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Benefits from This Hadith</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">1. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) teaching the companions divine texts first and foremost which is evidenced from the words, &#8220;I will tell you a hadith..</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) referring to his own words as hadith and thus establishing their validity and authority.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3. Instructions and command to spread the speech and message of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) to others. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4. A group of people should devout time to learn the hadith and then to spread it to the people, i.e. to do dawah</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">5. The need of those who are absent to listen to the hadith and speech of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;">There are other enormous benefits we can extract from this hadith. It is an incredible refutation of the orientalists and modern day hadith rejectors who deny the existence and authority of hadith. The second being of those people who devout more than necessary time to understanding fiqh through the positions of the madhabs, when this hadith clearly shows the command and Prophetic instruction to spread and propagate the hadith. We can therefore deduce from this, the great need to refer back to the Prophetic hadith and to spread this in every affair.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[6] Taqlid Aur Amal Bil-Hadith </strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Nawab Syed Mahdi Ali Khan Bahadur (1325H)</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Practice of the People Before The Advent of The Four Madhabs</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During the time of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) there were no other books or texts other than the Quran that were consulted with regards to issues pertaining to the Shariah, the ahadith and rulings. At the time no books of ahadith were authored nor did any companion compile a book about issues of Fiqh and their rulings and nor did any scholar pen anything on Usul or Qawa’id.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the time there was just actions of the companions, they would see the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) perform an action and they would then just do the same. They did not intend to focus on Usul al-Fiqh and its compilations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) would issue a legal edict or answer a question, the companions would listen and remember them. The custom of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in terms of his actions and completion of the acts of worship etc would differ at different times and not all of the companions would be with him all of the time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, whichever companion saw an action he remembered it and when the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said something they would memorise it. Any particular reason or specific circumstances evolving around those instances, they kept to themselves not thinking any thing of them and they continued like this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From amongst the zealous and keen companions, they would endeavour to seek more knowledge and learn more about the finer details. They would ask one another and so on. So some of these companions became stronger jurists. The companions who spent more time with the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) learnt more and became more knowledgable in relation to others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the time of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) passed and it was the era of the companions, they would act on their knowledge as well as what they had heard directly from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If a new matter arose they would ask the other companions and if they were unable to find a clear answer from the Quran and Sunnah they would look at other similar issues that had been transmitted via the Quran and Sunnah and make deductions based on them. If they faced a difficult issue they would consult and seek advice from one another and resolve the matter in this way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people who were born in this era or those who accepted and reverted back to Islam, this is how they learnt the knowledge of the din, exactly the same way the companions had learnt from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). In other words, whenever a companion would meet each other, they would be jurists in their own right (because of what they knew in relation to the other companion in terms of hadith or rulings) and took issues of the shariah from them.</span></p>
