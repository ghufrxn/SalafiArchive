				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[6] Taqlid Aur Amal Bil-Hadith </strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Nawab Syed Mahdi Ali Khan Bahadur (1325H)</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Practice of the People Before The Advent of The Four Madhabs</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During the time of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) there were no other books or texts other than the Quran that were consulted with regards to issues pertaining to the Shariah, the ahadith and rulings. At the time no books of ahadith were authored nor did any companion compile a book about issues of Fiqh and their rulings and nor did any scholar pen anything on Usul or Qawa’id.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the time there was just actions of the companions, they would see the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) perform an action and they would then just do the same. They did not intend to focus on Usul al-Fiqh and its compilations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) would issue a legal edict or answer a question, the companions would listen and remember them. The custom of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in terms of his actions and completion of the acts of worship etc would differ at different times and not all of the companions would be with him all of the time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, whichever companion saw an action he remembered it and when the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said something they would memorise it. Any particular reason or specific circumstances evolving around those instances, they kept to themselves not thinking any thing of them and they continued like this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From amongst the zealous and keen companions, they would endeavour to seek more knowledge and learn more about the finer details. They would ask one another and so on. So some of these companions became stronger jurists. The companions who spent more time with the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) learnt more and became more knowledgable in relation to others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the time of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) passed and it was the era of the companions, they would act on their knowledge as well as what they had heard directly from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If a new matter arose they would ask the other companions and if they were unable to find a clear answer from the Quran and Sunnah they would look at other similar issues that had been transmitted via the Quran and Sunnah and make deductions based on them. If they faced a difficult issue they would consult and seek advice from one another and resolve the matter in this way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people who were born in this era or those who accepted and reverted back to Islam, this is how they learnt the knowledge of the din, exactly the same way the companions had learnt from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). In other words, whenever a companion would meet each other, they would be jurists in their own right (because of what they knew in relation to the other companion in terms of hadith or rulings) and took issues of the shariah from them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Taqlid Aur Amal Bil-Hadith (pg.8-9)</span></p>
