<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> To proceed,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From what we know of al-Ghazālī is that he retracted from his ardent Ashʾarī approach and returned back to the way of Ahl al-Sunnah or as he described, <em>Madhhab al-Salaf</em>. We find that he eventually denounced the Kalām approach or the way of the Kalāmiyyah. This has been well documented and accepted by many authorities, while some are still denying this established fact. What we learn from this historical fact and what is of primary focus is the rejection of the kalām system; which was adopted by many in order to understand the divine attributes or the Asmāʾ wa’l-Ṣifāt of Allāh. However, it must be said that actually never totally left Ashʿarism and began taking early steps<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, how much he left and how much of the creed of the Salaf he adopted is open for much discussion and debate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī censured the kalām approach and therefore believed it was no longer an acceptable or viable approach for the the common Muslims. This eventually led al-Ghazālī to author is well known, <em>Iljām al-ʿAwām ʿAn ʿIlm al-Kalām</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī wrote this treatise to aid the Muslims masses shortly before he died, and I will discuss the details and importance of this treatise later. It is similarly imperative to understand the various stages in al-Ghazālī’s life and the treatises he wrote and to correlate them with his theological views, which will essentially offer insight to his beliefs as well as his Ashʿarism and kalām approach. Unfortunately, these substantial changes or stages in al-Ghazālī’s life failed to create an acceptable understanding in some Islamic and modern academics, who continue to promote al-Ghazālī as an all out ardent Ashʿarī, who traversed this theological discourse uniformly throughout his life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an incorrect notion as the proceeding pages will evidence, it is however, acceptable to believe that he retained many aspects of Ashʿarism which was inevitable because to his lifelong attachment to this theological school. Al-Ghazālī also denounced and repudiated key premises of Ashʿarism, which were considered central ideas of Ashʿarism and I mention some of them further as we proceed through this paper, In-Shāʾ-Allāh. So, in order to evidence his denunciation and retraction from orthodox Ashʿarite beliefs and the Kalāmiyyah approach or theological rhetoric, we move onto the various stages in al-Ghazālī’s life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We find from those who knew him on a personal level, there were other concerns with his personality and approach which perhaps led to some of these changes, self realisation, criticism from his contemporaries and personal experiences, all seem to have played a relevant part. It would therefore, be important to present a brief synopsis of this to get a broader picture of his mindset.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Perspectives on al-Ghazālī</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī was someone who had a level of acumen and intelligence, he was pleased and aware of his knowledge and capabilities. He had ability to discern between different ideologies and methods of creed derivation, all of which is deduced from his summary of the various approaches he mentions in his <em>Munqiḍh</em>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> He was unsparing with his comments and rebuttal of the other sects, namely the Batinī’s and philosophers.  He was also not shy to express his contempt and scorn on them and used harsh words. We can draw lessons from this while showing the Ashʿaris and other bystanders how al-Ghazālī himself was unforgiving to other deviant creeds and belief systems, giving the Ashʿari’s and other sympathisers something to reflect over. A contemporary of al-Ghazālī, ʿAbd al-Ghāfir al-Fārisī (d.529H) says about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I visited him many times and it is without inference that whatever I saw of him in the past with regards to malice and harshness towards people, he looked down on them through his being led astray and by what Allāh had given him in terms of thought and expression and through the seeking of rank and position, had come to be the opposite and was purified from stains. I used to think there was a level of pretence with him, but I realized after investigation, it was the opposite to what I had thought and that he was a man who had recovered after being mad.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This serves as a direct account from a contemporary evidencing al-Ghazālī changing during his life and his approach in general to the Shariʿah. He also shows his dislike for taqlīd and blind following in general, where he encourages people to seek the truth and develop ones own Madhhab, he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, stop relying on the Madhhabs and seek the truth by looking into issues and become a founder of a Madhhab. Do not follow a guide like a blind man so that he leads you along while there are thousands of similar guides around you, calling out to you that he ruined and misguided you from the right path.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These statements and others show al-Ghazālī was an independent thinker, just like his teacher al-Juwaynī, he was not shackled and bound by the chains of taqlīd or blind following or imitation. Al-Ghazālī and al-Juwaynĩ were independent theologians, which perhaps the main reason why they left fundamental Ashʿarism and departed from many aspects, as if they were both unfaithful Ashʿarites. If having a culmination of anti taqlīd sentiments, being independent, having a precedence of his teachers, there is no doubt this approach led al-Ghazālī to depart from Ashʿarism, how much is the focus of discussion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Stages in al-Ghazālī’s Life</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī while passing through a number of stages during his life, also authored a number of works that depicted and offered an insight to his thought. This paper will not exhaust these various stages of his life, but rather it will highlight some key changes, which essentially reveal some of his final views.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was born in 450H in Tus and received his early education in a madrassah around 465H, he went to study in Jurjan.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Around 473H he travelled to Nishapur to study at the acclaimed Nizāmiyyah school. At the Niẓamiyyah he studied with one of the leading authorities of the Ashʿarī school, ʿAbd al-Mālik al-Juwaynī (d.478H) who had some sort of influence over him.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> It is a given without a doubt that he must have studied ʿAqīdah, theology and subsidiary issues including kalam, and philosophy at the Niẓāmiyyah school and also independently with the various teachers at the madrassah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the death of al-Juwaynī,<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> he went on to serve the minister Niẓām al-Mulk of the Seljuq empire in Baghdad, as part of an advisory board. On this board they debated and discussed an array of issues ranging from ʿAqīdah and fiqh. Al-Ghazālī remained with Niẓām al-Mulk for approximately six years. Then in 484H Niẓām al-Mulk appointed him as a professor at the Baghdad Niẓāmiyyah school which he had founded. He remained as a professor at the Niẓāmiyyah for approximately four years until 488H where he served as the chair of Shafiʿī fiqh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was in Baghdad when al-Ghazālī really focused and exerted extensive time consulting the books of the philosophers. In fact, he spent half of his time in Baghdad, approximately two years as he mentions in his autobiographical discourse, <em>Munqidh Min al-Ḍalāl.</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> When he completed his research he proceeded to write a number of treatises outlining the aims of the philosophers and refuting their ideas.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī even at this early age showed signs of crisis in his approach and belief. In some places he outlines his views which become manifest through his writings. One of the earliest periods of skepticism he displayed was during the time he started to delve deeper into the Islamic sciences and leaving for Baghdad from Nishapur. It was during this period that began having doubts about his approach to the Islamic sciences. He became very doubtful, his intellectual thought failed him and he was unable to reconcile his uncertainties with reason or any of the other sciences he knew. At the same time, he became very ill, lost his appetite and was in a state of sheer confusion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It will not be surprising to learn, during this period in Baghdad between 484-488H, while serving as a professor of Shafiʿī fiqh in the Baghdadi branch of the Niẓāmiyyah and after researching the ideas and principles of the philosophers and refuting and answering their claims, al-Ghazālī suffered a nervous break down.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> While in Baghdad he extensively studied philosophy and its books and wrote a number of treatise<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> in refuting them. Al-Ghazālī says he studied the books of the philosophers for two years while he remained in Baghdad.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to understand al-Ghazālī experienced this breakdown after reading and writing about the philosophers which was understood to be ‘a crisis of faith’. How tragic is it then; to see novice Ashʿarīs claim philosophy is the recourse to understand ʿAqīdah and the tenets of Imān? This clearly demonstrates how uninformed and the lack of knowledge the new age Ashʿarī has, who is oblivious of the unprecedented dilemma al-Ghazālī had to contend with.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to biographers and historiographers, this bewildered state of confusion lasted for approximately six months.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> When he recovered from it, which al-Ghazālī described as, ‘when Allāh illuminated his heart’. It was after this period when he decided to study in great depth four groups, the Mutakallimūn, the Bāṭiniyyah, the Philosophers and the Ṣūfī’s. He authored his well known book, <em>Munqidh Min al-Ḍalāl (Deliverance from Error)</em> based on his study of these four groups while outlining his own discourse, understanding and personal journey, as it was a semi autobiography of his journey to the truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After suffering his nervous breakdown and his crisis of faith, al-Ghazālī excused himself from his teaching post under the guise of travelling to Makkah for Ḥajj<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> but in reality it was ruse to get away and use the time to self reflect. In 488-489H he travelled to Damascus where he remained for two years,<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> spending time on worship and meditating the Ṣūfī way. It is perhaps during this period he began writing his <em>Iḥyāʾ ʿUlūm al-Dīn (Revival of the Islamic Sciences)</em>. He then travelled to Jerusalem, where he wrote his <em>al-Risālah al-Qudsiyyah (The Jerusalem Tract)</em>. He then travelled to Hebron in Palestine and then eventually on to Makkah and Madīnah. He spent a short while there and then returned to Baghdad for a brief period before moving on to his ancestral home of Tus around 490H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He remained in Tus for ten years until approximately 499H in retirement. Then the son of Niẓām al-Mulk, Fakhr requested al-Ghazālī to resume teaching at the Niẓāmiyyah school in Nishapur, where al-Ghazālī had begun his Islamic journey. It is not known how long he remained in Nishapur teaching<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> but a conservative estimate is about 2-3 years, as we know he died in his home town of Tus where he lived for a few years before he died in 505H.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We therefore, learn that al-Ghazālī’s life, from the time he began seeking knowledge throughout his career can be divided into six distinct periods with some overlap between the fifth and sixth period.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Period – 465-478H</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This early learning period from 465H when he first began seeking knowledge until 478H, when al-Juwaynī, who was teaching at the Niẓāmiyyah school in Nishapur died.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Period – 478-488H</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This teaching and advisory period can be summarized as the Baghdad Niẓām al-Mulk period. Where he served as an advisory minister to him for six years and under his courtesies. He went onto accept the chief Shafiʿī jurist position for four years, all at the Baghdad branch of the Niẓāmiyyah school.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Third Period – 488-490H</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This period can be aptly described as the deep crisis and revival period. In this period al-Ghazālī suffers from an enormous breakdown in the Rajab of 488H which lasts for six months. It is then followed with a period of two years of travel, search for the truth coupled with writing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fourth Period – 490-499H</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This period can undoubtedly be described as the retirement period. Al-Ghazālī retired to his ancestral home of Tus. What he exactly did during this period is not well documented.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fifth Period – 499~503H</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This period can be classified as his resumption period, wherein he returns to Nishapur to the Niẓāmiyyah to continue teaching at the behest of Fakhr al-Mulk. It is difficult to ascertain the exact length of this period; however, we can can make certain presumptions. Al-Ghazālī completed his major work on Uṣūl al-Fiqh, <em>al-Mustaṣfā Min ʿIlm al-Uṣūl</em> around 503H as some of the manuscripts of the book indicate. It would make sense if, <em>Al-Mustaṣfā</em> being a work of Uṣūl al-Fiqh was written during this period when he renewed his teaching at the college as it’s a work that would be written while teaching and not retirement. Nonetheless, it is also possible of potential overlaps from this period to his last peri0d of final retirement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Sixth Period – 503-505H</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The final retirement period, wherein he returns to native Tus until he dies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The importance of dividing al-Ghazālī’s life in such a manner will allow us to place certain treatises to these specific periods and thereby map his transformations. He also cross references many of his works, which further allows us to form an approximate chronology; this will also assist us to record theological changes through his life.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I divided al-Ghazālī’s life into six parts; I found this easier to show his respective works on theology, philosophy and theological rhetoric during these distinct periods and in turn his transformation. ʿAbd al-Karīm al-ʿUthmān, in his <em>Sīrah al-Ghazālī wa Aqwāl al-Mutaqaddimīn Fihi (The Biography of al-Ghazālī and the Statements of the Earlier [Scholars] About Him)</em> divided this period into five and also dates the treatises that are relevant to our paper.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>  The most extensive research is perhaps offered by ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Badawī, who authored, <em>Muʾallafāt al-Ghazālī</em>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> He presents four periods.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> I have focused on the works related to kalām, philosophy and Aqidah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We find from this tabulation that after reading and researching on Kalam and Philosophy during his early period this led to al-Ghazālī having a breakdown. He went onto write the <em>Iḥyāʾ,</em> the al-<em>Arbāʿīn</em>, the<em> Fayṣal</em> and the more important works of <em>al-Munqiḍh</em> and the Iljām, both of which refute and repudiate the ideas of Kalām and any other approaches.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Ghazālī’s Views on Kalām</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī described ʿIlm al-Kalām (Kalām for short) or commonly known as the Mutakallimūn<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> as those who claim to follow theory and speculation. He uses the words Ahl al-Raʾyy waʾl Naẓar, meaning the people of opinion and speculation.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a> We therefore, find even the definition of kalām poses a serious problem to the orthodoxy of Islamic Creed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the key factors in why al-Ghazālī perhaps rejected and denounced the way of theological rhetoric was due to the harms associated with it. He believed the kalām approach had both benefits and harms coupled with both advantages and disadvantages. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">We refer to ʿIlm al-Kalām and say it has advantages and disadvantages, usefulness and harm, commendable and obligatory as the need arises. When it is harmful it is unlawful and from its harm is that it raises doubts and undermines the pillars of Imān and strips them of their certainty and definiteness. These points are confused at first and then reestablishing them through evidences is uncertain and varies among individuals.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī further outlined a nominal system in utilizing his writings to correct any wavering issues of belief. He advised those who were of a single theological background and were not subjected to the polemics of theological discourse, that such people should rely on his foundation of beliefs in his <em>Iḥyāʾ</em>. That children and those exposed to theological polemics read and learn <em>al-Risālah al-Qudsiyyah Fī Qawāʾid al-ʿAqāʾid</em>. If further, an adolescent was astute and aware of doubts or he was skeptical, this then indicated uncertainties and the beginning of disbelief has started, in such a case he should be reading <em>al-Iqtiṣād Fī al-Iʿtiqād</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī then, which is the most crucial part, he says if doubt, uncertainty and disbelief persist, then kalām is useless and redundant in attempting to establish belief in the fundamental aspects of ʿAqīdah and Imān.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This approach is contrary to the modern day apprentice Ashʿarī, who misleadingly endeavors to bolsters support for Ashʿarism – claiming, salvation or redemption from ‘atheism’ lies through the approach of kalām. Al-Ghazālī disproves this notion or theory from the onset, showing the falsehood of the modern self styled novice Ashʿarī. We find the Ashʿarī neophyte’s propagating ʿIlm al-Kalām and philosophy as the only and essential resolution to most theisms, during the process of which they embark on a scathing attack on the Salafīs for the allegedly simplistic approach to complex matters of theology.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī further expresses his view regarding kalām, wherein he conveys its objectives but is conversely critical of its methodology. He says in general conclusion regarding kalām,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I carefully studied and pondered over it. I consulted the treatises of the experts of this science and I also composed a few treatises on the subject. I learnt that this science, although it fulfilled its aim, it did not attain my aim. Where its aim and intent should be to preserve the ʿAqīdah of Ahl al-Sunnah and defend it from the corruption of the people of innovation (Ahl al-Bidʿah).<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In order to emphasise his point – kalām being redundant to ascertain tenets of ʿAqīdah, he affirms the existence of the true, pristine and divine ʿAqīdah. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah sent to his servants through the message of his Messenger, an ʿAqīdah which is the truth and a means of rectification for his Din and the affairs of this world and all of this (i.e. ʿAqīdah) have been set by knowing the Quran and reports (hadith). Then Shayṭān misguided the innovators with his evil whisperings with principles that opposed the Sunnah. So the people adopted these plots and almost corrupted the true ʿAqīdah for the people.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī does not invalidate kalām in totality, he mentions its advantages and some token benefits but is also swift in mentioning its major disadvantages and harms. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah then brought forward a group of mutakallimūn to defend the Sunnah with the system of theological rhetoric (i.e. kalām) to expose the heresies of the reprehensive innovators which opposed the documented established Sunnah. This is therefore, the origin of theological rhetoric and its people.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Ghazālī’s Ashʿarism</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī has various statements concerning the Ashʿaris and the the Ashʿarism which can only be interpreted as him departing from the theological school, in whatever capacity while retaining certain aspects of it. This in line with his <em>al-Iljām</em> and other works makes perfect sense, more so when we have established when they roughly authored. He says for example,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Perhaps you might say, your words (ie. Al-Ghazāli’s) in this book are divided into those which conform to the school of the Ṣūfīs and those which conform to the school of the Ashʿarites and some Mutakallimūn. So, the words are to be only understood according to a particular school, which one of these schools is correct.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here al-Ghazālī and based on the views of others, makes a distinction between the school of the Ṣūfīs and the Ashʿarites and some of the Kalamiyyah. He concludes by making the premise that only one school is correct. If he was a fully fledged Ashʿarī, al-Ghazāli had no need to address this dilemma in this way, this therefore suggests the contrary with his ardent Ashʿarism, as claimed by the later adherents of the theological school, mores on in our era on the various social media platforms. In another statement al-Ghazālī is again seem to take a middle path between the Ashʿaris and the Ḥanābillah ie the Salafī creed. In retrospect, they don’t seem like the words of an established Ashʿari elder. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Because each group of people declare the detractors to be disbelievers and connect with them the denial of the Messenger of Allāḥ Sallalahu alayhi Wasallam. The Ḥanābillah declare the Ashʿarites as unbelievers, alleging that they deny the Messenger when he talked about the Faqwa i.e. aboveness of Allāh and His sitting on the throne. The Ash’arites declare the Ḥanābillah to be disbelievers, alleging that they are anthropomorphist.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further answers a rhetorical question:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Question: Should the names and attributes of Allah be applied as they are or should ta’wil be made of them using reason (i.e logic)? Qadi Abu Bakr’s (al-Baqillani) view is that its possible to make ta’wil of them provided the Shari’ah does not prohibit or restricts it or if it (i.e. the Shari’ah) shows the literal (Zahir) meaning does not apply to Allah. Al-Ash’ari’s (Abul Hasan) view is they should be taken as they are because it is impossible to apply metaphorical (majaz) meanings to the description (i.e. wasf/kayfiyyah), accept when it permissible (according to the Nusus). Our view is to separate the issue and say, what is simplified to the Name should be readily accepted. As for what can be simplified to the description and does not require permission for interpretation and also be readily accepted.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, at another instance he talks about Ashʿarīs in the third person, making a distinction that he was not part of them with designation. He says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ashʿarīs and Muʿtazilah went on to adopt taʿwil because of excessive investigation. They went onto admit the taʿwīl of many literal senses. Those closest to the Hanabillah in matters of the Hereafter are the Ashʿaris. They affirm most of the literal senses except a few. The Muʿtazilah have gone further in the taʿwīl than the Ashʿarīs. With this, they (i.e. the Ashʿarīs) are compelled to use taʿwīl in matters.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We essentially find from these statements a level of incoherence and confusion from al-Ghazālī in following traditional Ashʿarism. This is perhaps an important premise to establish his resignation from Ashʿarī doctrines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A person who looks at the central beliefs of the Ashʿarī theological school will come to know al-Ghazālī failed to adhere to them. For instance, the issue of al-Aṣlaḥ (optimism), Jawhar al-Farḍh (atomism) and the soul, his views were different. This is what led Ibn Khaldūn to conclude that logic, although it was a science used by other civilisations, it was denounced by early Muslim scholars and theologians. It later developed credence due efforts of al-Ghazāli and others like al-Razī. Ibn Khaldūn said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be known early Muslims and early speculative theologians (i.e. ʿIlm al-Kalām) greatly disapproved of the study of this discipline. They vehemently attacked it and warned against it. They forbade the study and teaching of it. Later on, ever since al-Ghazālī and al-Rāzī, scholars have been somewhat more lenient in this respect. Since that time, they have gone on to study logic, except for a few who have recourse to the opinion of the ancients concerning it and shun it and vehemently disapproved of it.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī was concerned about the common people (the awwām) and this is what perhaps led him to depart from orthodox Ashʿarism in order to help them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Although we don’t find any direct statements from al-Ghazālī denying he was an Ashʿarī, we do find his opposition to traditional Ashʿarite theology and views, which was possibly the onset of him returning to the true creed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Ghazālī’s </strong><strong><em>Iljām al-ʿAwām ʿAn ʿIlm al-Kalām</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have already introduced the Iljām. He authored it two weeks before he died. The <em>Iljām</em> is authentically established from al-Ghazālī and several authors have attributed it to him. Al-Subkī<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> (d.771H), al-Ḥusaynī al-Wāsiṭī<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a> (d.776h), Ibn Qāḍhī Shuhba<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a> (d.779H) and al-Zabidī<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a> (d.1205H). Contemporary authors have also attributed it to him like, ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Badawi<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>, ʿAbd al-Karīm al-ʿUthmān<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>, ʿAbdul al-Amīr al-Aʿsam<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a> and Mashhad al-Allāf.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Most researchers are also agreed al-Ghazāli authored the Iljām two weeks before he died. One manuscript is dated the 1<sup>st</sup> of Jumāda al-Thānī, 505H whereas he died on the 14<sup>th</sup> of the same month. Mashhad al-Allāf said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">A book on the Way of the Salaf and is the last book that al Ghazālī wrote at the beginning of Jumāda al-Akhir, 505H, that is, shortly before his death on Monday, Jumāda al-Akhir 14, 505H by no more than two weeks.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is considered a very important work of Imam al-Ghazālī because you can clearly read in it that his method was the same as that of the righteous predecessors (al-Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ), so much so that <em>Iljām</em> is named in some manuscripts as <em>Risāla fī Madhhab Ahl al-Salaf</em> (<em>A Treatise on the Way of the Salaf</em>) in which he emphasized Imam Mālik’s statement as the foundation of his subject sticking to it, and repeating it in a number of places.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Badawī confirmed the aforementioned entries on Iljām, giving additional listings of it in Brockelmann, the British Museum, and several other sources.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Manuscripts of the <em>Iljām</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the introduction of the Dār al-Minhāj edition it is accepted as the book of al-Ghazālī<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a>. It further mentions his student Abū Saʿīd al-Jāwalī al-ʿIrāqī transmitted it from him in Baghdad and many major scholars have attributed it to him.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The introduction mentions 6 different manuscripts of the <em>Iljām</em> and offer details of each one.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a> From them, the most relied upon is that of Shahīd ʿAlī Pasha and is housed in Istanbul no.1712. It is a complete manuscript and the closest to in time to the author. It mentions the manuscript is dated just 3 years after the death of the author.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a>  The manuscript is dated as the middle of Shaʿbān 507H, which makes it just 2 years, this is a mistake in the introduction. The confusion is over when the original book was written and when it was further copied. A colophon on the manuscript clearly says it was completed on the 1<sup>st</sup> of Jumāda al-Akhar, 505H while the manuscript was copied in 507H.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a> The <em>Iljām</em> has been published many times in Cairo, Istanbul and Beirut.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Contents of the <em>Iljām</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have already mention al-Ghazālī’s view on the contradictions and disadvantages of kalām and says that it is only useful in some matters. In the Iljām he presents his views of disapproving of Kalām and that it did not lead to the standard of knowledge in belief in Allāh. He said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Acquired by the speculative proofs of Kalām based on propositions that are acceptable only because of their popularity with leading scholars, the ignominy involved in repudiating them, and the people’s aversion to any dissemination of doubt in them. In this manner, the science of Kalām is useful in some theological matters, constituting a justified belief (Taṣdīq Jāzim) for the few who do not perceive the possibility of its contradictions.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was of the view that beyond this, he saw little or no benefit in Kalām advocating instead of teaching of Qurʾanic proofs to the common people.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a> al-Ghazālī in the <em>Iljām</em> distances himself from the Ashʿarī approach to divine attributes, which was to make taʿwīl – figurative interpretation and rather aligns himself with the Salafi approach of abandoning taʿwīl. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say that it is unlawful (harām) for preachers on the pulpits to answer questions that delve into taʾwīl and elaborates (on sifāt); rather the preacher’s duty is to confine themselves to what we have mentioned here as well as the Salaf, strongly emphasizing Allah’s sanctity and negating anthropomorphism.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī opens the <em>Iljām</em> with the following words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Know that the truth with the people of insight, in which there is no doubt, is the Madhhab al-Salaf. By that I mean the way of the companions and the followers (Tabiʿīn).<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The way of the Salaf is true and is opposite to bidʿah, which is blameworthy…..The common people delving into interpretation (taʾwīl) of Sifāt is a blameworthy bidʿah……Therefore, opposition to it-abstinence from speculative inquiry into sifat (i.e. Kalām) is recommended and praiseworthy.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reception of al-Ghazālī’s View and the <em>Iljām</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mashaad al-Allāf said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book (<em>Iljām</em>) is one of the most authentic books attributed to [al-Ghazzālī], yet Orientalists eschewed it because of its commitment to the Sunna, maxims, and lessons pertaining to the unification of Muslim ranks and their guidance to the straight path. Orientalists tried to disregard it and misdirect students of knowledge away from it.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ (d.643H) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">In several places, al-Ghazālī eloquently articulated fleeing from everything besides this path (of kalām and taʾwīl), and ultimately reined in every scholar and lay person to it with his bridle – i.e., his book <em>Iljām al-ʿAwām ʿAn ʿIlm al-Kalām</em>. It is definitely the last book of al-Ghazālī, in which he urged them to adhere to the way of the Salaf and those who followed them.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mullā ʿAlī al-Qārī quotes the view of the Ḥanafī scholar, Sirāj al-Dīn al-Qazwinī (d.750H) who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī came around to accepting that taʾwīl was unlawful after he had praised it.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some later Ashʿarites apologists like Saʿīd Foudah and Ḥussayn Athāys tried with great endeavor in pushing al-Ghazāli used kalām.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a> Fiazuddin Shuʿayb said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reactions of Ashʿarīs to al-Ghazzālī’s apparent adoption of the Way of the Salaf varied: they either belittled his knowledge of kalām or persisted in typecasting him as a proponent of Ashʿarī thought. The latter is obvious in the works of Ibn ʿAsākir (d. 1176), al-Subkī (d. 1370), and Ibn Khaldūn (d.808/1406), to name a few.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mālikī scholar al-Māzarī (d.530), for example, when asked about al-Ghazālī’s theology, said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for ʿilm al-kalām, which constitutes the foundations of the religion (uṣūl al-dīn), al-Ghazālī also wrote on it but did not expatiate it or attain mastery (mustabḥir) of it. I investigated the reason, discovering that it was due to his study of philosophy (falsafa) before achieving mastery in uṣūl al-dīn; consequently, his reading of falsafa caused him to take an audacious approach on semantics but was lax toward realities. That is because falsafa proceeds on its own thoughts ungoverned by rulings of sharīʿa or without fear of contradicting the leaders who follow it.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Subkī responds to his and says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I concur with al-Māzarī’s statement that he was not proficient (mustabḥir) in kalām, but I argue that his feet were firmly rooted in it, though not to the same extent as they were in the other sciences; so his opinion is speculative. As for his statement that al-Ghazālī was preoccupied with falsafa before he engaged uṣūl al-dīn, it is not so; rather, he did not study falsafa until after he had delved into uṣūl al-dīn, as he himself clearly explained in <em>al-Munqidh Min al-Ḍalāl</em>. Furthermore, al-Māzarī’s claim that al-Ghazālī read falsafa before becoming proficient (mustabḥir) in uṣūl al-dīn, which comes after his previous statement that he was not proficient (mustabḥir) in uṣūl al-dīn, is contradictory.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Makdisi wrote,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">His work entitled Iljām al-ʿAwām ʿAn ʿIlm al-Kalām was a source of embarrassment to the Ashʿarite propagandists who reacted to it in various ways…the Ashʿarite apologists (in general) do not mention Ghazzālī’s Iljām itself, though their concern about it and his reference to Shāfiʿī in the Iḥyāʾ as prohibiting Kalām  is evident….<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fiazuddin Shuʿayb said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Ghazzālī had his fair share of critics among Shiʿīs, Muʿtazilīs, Zanādiqa, and Sunnīs, such as al-Māzarī, al-Ṭarṭūshī (d. 520/1127), Ibn Ṣalāḥ (d. 643/1245), Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1327), Ibn Qayyim (d. 751/1350), and others who differed with him on a wide range of issues, including Arabic grammar, philosophy, Sufism (taṣawwuf), Ḥadīth, and Kalām<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62">[62]</a></span></p>

I have discussed the Arabic editions in a later footnote. The publication of this works also has an interesting history. The text of <em>al-Munqidh </em>was discovered in 1842 by Auguste Schmölders who translated the text and published it in French for the first time. Its first English translation appeared in 1909 by Claude Field, <em>The Confessions of Al Ghazzali </em>(London: John Murray, 1909) and then again titled as <em>The Faith and Practice of al-Ghazālī</em> (London: George Allen and Unwin Ltd, 1953) by M. Montgomery Watt, the recent reference point for Yasir Qadhi! Richard Joseph McCarthy also translated it <em>Deliverance from Error</em> (Boston: 1980). Reprinted 1<sup>st</sup> edition, <em>Deliverance from error: An annotated translation of al-Munqidh min al Dala</em><em>̄</em><em>l and other relevant works of Al-Ghaza</em><em>̄</em><em>l</em><em>ī</em>. (Louisville: Fons Vitae, 1999). 2<sup>nd</sup> edition, 2001. in 2001 again, a husband and wife from al-Azhar University, Dr. Muhammad Muhammad Abū Laylah and Dr. Nurshif ʿAbd al-Raḥīm Rif’at published a critical Arabic edition with an English translation of the <em>Munqidh</em> titled, <em>Deliverance from Error and Mystical Union with the Almighty</em> (Washington: The Council for Research in Values and Philosophy, 2001). The edition bears a certificate from the Director General of the Department for Research, Writing and Translation at al-Azhar al-Sharif Islamic Research Academy, Sami Sharʿawī that the Munqidh contains nothing that contradicts Islamic ʿAqīdah and we have no objection to its publication.  (Introduction to the Arabic (page F) English section, 329).</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><em><strong>Shaikh Dawud Arshad</strong></em></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Translated Abu Ubaydah</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Translated, Checked &amp; Additional Notes</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Chapter 1</span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">The Reasons Why People Fabricate Ahadith</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">There are many reasons why people fabricate ahadith and the Muhadithin have explained in detail why people do this. One of the reasons for this is because of Taqlid. The Muqalidin take the sayings of individuals as their madhab and religion instead of the Quran and Hadith. By doing so they have attempted to strengthen and support the sayings of an individual by fabricating ahadith. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imam Qurtubi said in the Sharh of Sahih Muslim,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em style="line-height: 1.5">“The Ahlur-Ra’i have said that it is allowed to attribute this ruling which indicates to Qiyas Jali (understanding of common sense) to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). They say that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said this. If you look into the books of fiqh then you will come to realise that they are full of these type of narrations whereby the matan bears witness to it being fabricated. The matan have been put into these books so they can appear to be in favour of the fatawa of the fuqaha. Whilst (the reality) is that the matans don’t even have chains of narrations.&#8221;</em><span style="line-height: 1.5"> (Taken from al-Ba’ith ul Hathith pg no.80)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Mawlana Abdul Hay Lakhnawi Hanafi openly acknowledged this by saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>“The sixth group who fabricate ahadith are those who have bigoted partisanship towards their madhab and try to maintain taqlid as the status quo. Just as Ma&#8217;mun Harwi fabricated the narration that ‘whosoever performs rafyul yadayn his salah is invalid, whosoever recites behind the Imam his salah is invalid, similarly (he fabricated narrations) denouncing imam Shafi’i and praising the virtues of Abu Hanifa.&#8221;</em> (al-Athar al-Marfu’ah fil akhbar al-mawdu’ah pg no.17)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The above saying of Mawlana Lakhnawi is based upon being completely fair and just. The Muqalidin have fabricated many narrations in order to support and assist the bigoted partisanship of Taqlid, the sayings of the fuqaha and opinions of people. Even today the same people are not afraid of fabricating ahadith. Molvi Isma’il Jhangawi the author of <em>‘A Gift To The Ahlul Hadith’</em> has also fabricated two ahadith, rather his own elders (scholarly elders, teachers) have made up ayat. Molvi Mahmud Hasan Khan Hanafi Deobandi was the Shaikhul hadith of Darul Ulum Deoband. The Hanafis remember him by the name of Shaikhul Hind. He replied to an advert (poster) of a renowned Salafi scholar Mawlana Abu Sa’id Muhamad Husain Batalwi, entitlteld <em>‘Adilah Kamilah’</em>, in which he established the obligation of Taqlid by writing a line of text in Arabic from himself and making it the Quranic ayat proof to base (his argument on). Molvi Muhamad Ahsan Amrwahi (who was a student of Nawab Sidiq Hasan Khan and later became a murtad and a Qadiyani) wrote a reply to <em>‘Adilah Kamilah’</em> called <em>‘Misbahul Adilah’</em> in which Amrwahi caught out Shaikhul Hind. However Molvi Mahmud Hasan Khan instead of repenting, being embarrassed and rectifying himself he wrote with a lot of determination and confidence. This is why he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>&#8220;And if you differ in anything then refer it back to Allah, and The Messenger and to those who are in command of you (Ulil Amr)&#8221; (T.N This is not in the Quran)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>And it is apparent that the meaning of ‘Ulil Amr’ from this ayah is other than the noble Prophets (Alayhimusalam) so you can see that it is absolutely clear from this ayah that the Prophets and the words ‘Ulil Amr’ are obligatory to follow.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>“ And refer it back to Allah and the Messenger if you believe in Allah and the day of Judgement.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>So now you have seen this ayah and you still don’t know by now that the Quran in which this ayah is in, the previous mentioned ayah is in the same Quran that has the same conditions. It will not be strange if you counted the two ayat as being contradictory to each other and start to give fatwas that one is abrogating and the other one is abrogated.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"> (Idah al-Adilah 93 published Deoband Book publishers Rahimiya, and 103 published by Jamal printing works publisher Dehli and pg no.97 published by Qasimi Deobandi publishers).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">If we present our view on this then maybe Jhangawi will become upset, so that’s why I will present the view of Mawlana Amir Uthmani Deobandi who wrote the numbers on Mawlana Azad Rahmani’s book. Mawlana Uthmani said that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>&#8220;Mawlana Rahmani is shocked and bewildered that, which Quran contains those words which Shaikhul Hind wrote with determination and confidence and declared it to be the Quranic ayat which are not present in any of the thirty parts of the Quran.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">(Tajali Deoband November 1962 pg no.62)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">And he writes on pg no.61 that it cannot be said that it is a mistake by the writer because the evidence of Shaikhul Hind is based on the extra part and he is explaining this extra part being present in the Quran considerably. He is also deducing the obligation of following (i.e. Taqlid) from this part and it is with great amazement and bewilderment that the extra phrase and it’s arguments have completely changed the purpose for which this ayah was originally revealed for. (Taken from Tawdihul Kalam pg no.255 vol no.1)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Similarly Jhangawi’s Pir, Murshid and Imam in the Art of misconception Molvi Master Muhamad Amin Okarwi writes that Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>&#8220;O people of Iman, stop and hold your hands together when praying salah.&#8221; (T.N This is not in the Quran)</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"><em> From this ayah some people have taken it as evidence to show the prohibition of doing Rafyul Yadan in salah.</em> (Tahiqiq Mas’alah Rafyul Yadayn, pg no.6 1st publication)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Read this phrase and please read it again and you cannot say it is a mistake of the writer because Mawlana Safdar (Amin Okarwi) is also translating these words. Therefore in accordance to the information we have the people of Deoband fabricated these two ayats however let us go towards the original topic of discussion with an open heart and review our reports and points and examine the narrations which the Hanafi Muqalidin have fabricated.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">The First Tahrif In Abu Dawud</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Sunan Abi Dawud is part of the famous six books of hadith. This contains Sahih, Hasan, Da’if and Munqati’ types of chains of narrations. Imam Abu Dawud reported a Da’if narration under the chapter heading of al-Qunut fil Witr which the Shafi’is take as evidence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) collected the people to congregate behind Ubay Ibn Ka’b (Radi Allahu Anhu) and he lead them in salah for 20 nights however he recited the Qunut in the last half. When the last ten days were remaining then he used to pray salah in his own house and the people said that Ubay has run away.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">(Abu Dawud with Awn pg no.538 vol no.1, and published by Muhamadi Dehli 1264 pg no.203 and published by Kanpur pg no.209 vol no.1, and published by Qadiri Dehili 1272 ph no.201 vol no.1)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">The Beginning Of The Tahrif </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The first person who started this tahrif was Molvi Mahmud Hasan Khan Hanafi Deobandi. Whilst publishing Sunan Abi Dawud he left the words ’20 nights’ in the main text of the hadith however in the marginal notes he put the symbol indicating to another manuscript and wrote the word ‘rak’ah’. (Abu Dawud pg no.209 vol 1 published 1316)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This modification and changing of 20 nights gives the meaning to be 20 rak’ahs and the reason for this was to create a proof for establishing 20 rak’ah for tarawih.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Taking The Tahrif To An Extreme Level  </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">When Molvi Fakhrul Hasan Gangohi Hanafi Deobandi published Sunan Abi Dawud with his own authentication he took the words of ’20 nights’ out and changed it to ’20 rak’ahs’ however he clarified that the word ‘nights’ as being part of another manuscript in the marginal notes. (Sunan Abi Dawud pg no.202 vol no. 1 published in Karachi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">And the copy which is being published now only contains rak’ah however the clarification of another manuscript has also been removed, although before the tahrif of Mahmud Hasan Khan whichever manuscript was published it only contained the words ’20 nights’ there was no other mention of another manuscript. Similarly all the written manuscripts of Sunan Abi Dawud only contain the words ’20 nights’ however these people have changed it in order to create an evidence for doing tarawih with 20 rak’ahs.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Nights Or Rak&#8217;ahs? </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The interior part of the text gives us the evidence that the words ‘Nights’ are correct and ‘Rak’ah’ is a tahrif.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Firstly, Imam Abu Dawud put this narration under the chapter heading of Qunut and did not mention it under the chapter heading of Tarawih.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Secondly, Ubay Ibn Ka’b (Radi Allahu Anhu) did not perform Qiyam (Tarawih) in the last 10 nights and therefore establishes the fact that it is ‘Nights’ and not ‘Rak’ah’</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Thirdly, Imam Bayhaqi, in his Sunan al-Kubra pg no.498 vol no.2, narrated from Abu Dawud with the words ’20 nights’.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Testimony From Your Own House</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The following reported the narration from Abu Dawud and all of them used the words ’20 nights’ and declared the narration to be weak.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Zayla’I Hanafi Mulla Ali Qari Hanafi died 1410 in (Nasburayah pg no.126 vol no.2)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Nujaim Hanafi in (al-Bahru’raiq pg no.40 vol no.2)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Humam in (Fathul Qadir pg no.375 vol no.1)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Allamah Halabi in (Mustamli pg no.416)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Ahmad Yar Hanafi Barelwi in (Ja’ul Haq pg no.95 vol no.2)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Similarly Ibn Turkmani in (Jawhar an-Naqi pg no.498 vol no.2). He also clarified it to be weak and Munqati’.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Hanafi Commentators </span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The following reported this narration from Abu Dawud with only the words ’20 nights’.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Mulla Ali Qari Hanafi died 1410 in (Mirqah pg no.184 vol no.3)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Shaikh Abdul Haq Muhadith Dehlawi Hanafi in (Ashatul Mu’ath pg no.581 vol no.1)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Molvi Qutbudin Dehlawi Hanafi in (Madhahir Haq pg no.416 vol no.1)</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">The Second Tahrif In Abu Dawud  </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imam Abu Dawud criticised (performed Jarh on) and said about the narration which mentions that Abdullah Ibn Mas’ud (Radi Allahu Anh) negated Rafyul Yadayn that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>“This is a summarised form of a lengthy hadith and it is not authentic with these words &#8211; meaning that he did not do Rafyul Yadayn again” </em>(Abu Dawud with Awn pg no.273 vol no.1 and Abu Dawud pg no.173 vol no.1 published in Halab 1952)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The following have cited this criticism (Jarh) of Imam Abu Dawud:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Author of (Mishkah pg no.77)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Abdul Bar in (at-Tamhid pg no.220 vol no.9)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Hajr in (at-Talkhis pg no.222 vol no.1)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Shawkani in (Naylil Awtar pg no.187 vol no.2)</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Muhadith Adhimabadi in his (Awnul Ma’bud Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud pg no.273 vol no.1) clarified that he has two authentic and credible handwritten manuscripts which have this Jarh present.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> However it is great injustice that the Deobandi school of thought’s great Muhadith Molvi Fakhr ul Hasan Gangohi removed the Jarh when he published Abu Dawud with his own authentication. (Abu Dawud pg no.109)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Testimony From Your Own House   </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">However when Abu Dawud was published with the authentication of Molvi Mahmud Hasan Khan on pg no. 116 vol no.1 in the marginal notes he put a sign indicating to another manuscript that in another manuscript there is a text mentioning this Jarh and then he cites the whole Jarh in full.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">The Third Tahrif In Abu Dawud    </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In Sunan Abi Dawud pg no. 120 vol no.1 Imam Abu Dawud brought a chapter heading called ‘Whosoever recites loudly’. However when Mahmud Hasan Khan Hanafi Deobandi published Abu Dawud with his own authentication he changed the chapter heading to ‘Whosoever dislikes reading the fatiha al-Kitab when the Imam is loud’ whilst this chapter heading is not present in any manuscript copies. (See Abu Dawud with Awn pg no. 305 vol no.1)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The people of knowledge know that when the Muhadith Adhimabadi puts the text of Sunan Abi Dawud in the Sharh Awnul Ma’bud then he mentions the different manuscripts. If there was a chapter heading which the Deobandi’s Shaukhul Hind made in any of the manuscripts of then the author of Awnul Ma’bud would have mentioned it. However the Muahdith Adhimabadi did not mention it which absolutely clearly shows that no manuscript copy had this chapter heading mentioned in it. However Shakul Hind mentions it. Inna Lillahi wa Inna ilayhi Raji’un. This is all being done in order to strengthen the Hanafi madhab because according to them reciting the fatiha behind in the imam is makruh.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Tahrif In Musanaf Ibn Abi Shaybah    </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Musanaf Ibn Abi Shaybah is an excellent book that contains hadith and Athar. A lot of people have had the honour of publishing it. Firstly it was published with the Ta’liq of Mawlana Abdutawab from Multan. Afterwards the first volume was published from Heydarabad Deccan by Mawlana Abulkalam Azad academy in 1386. Then it was published by ad-Darusalafiyah Mumbai in 15 volumes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In the Musanaf there is a hadith,</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> from the chain of Hadathana Waki’ from Musa Ibn Umair from Alqamah Ibn Wa’il Ibn Hujr from Ubai,</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> which mentions that,</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> <em>I saw the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) put his right hand over his left hand in salah.</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> (Musanaf Ibn Abi Shaybah pg no.390 vol no.1 published by Mumbai and Heydarabad Dakan)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">A muhadith of Deoband Shahir Mawlana Habiburehman al-‘Adhami published the first three / four volumes of Musanaf Ibn Abi Shaybah in 1984 (which is now published in full). The above hadith is present with the same above words on page no.351 vol no. 2 published by ar-Rashid Madina Munawara 1984. However when the Deobandi group Idaratul Quran Darul Ulum Islamiya published it in 1986 from Karachi they did tahrif in the text of the hadith by adding the words ‘Tahtus Surah’. From this addition the meaning of the hadith changed to, ‘I saw the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) put his right hand over his left hand below his navel in the salah’. Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Whilst this is clear dishonesty and corruption. This hadith is found in around a dozen other books of hadith and none of them have the extra words ‘Tahtus Surah’. The manuscript which these extra words are cited to have been declared as being weak and Ma’lul by the Deobandi elders also. For details see the book Deen ul-Haq pg no. 220 vol no. 1 written by the humbled poor author.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Tahrif In Musnad Humaidi</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">There is a hadith which is narrated Abdullah Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) in the Musnad of Humaidi. The words are as follows:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> <em>I saw the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) that when he started the salah he raised his hands up until his shoulders and when he wanted to go into ruku and raise his head up from ruku he did rafyul yadayn and did not perform rafyul yadayn between the two sajdas.</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> (Musnad Humaidi pg no.177 published by ahlul Hadith trust Karachi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This narration is exactly like this in Dhahiriya manuscript copy of Musnad Humaidi. Apart from this the narration in Musnad Humaidi is also present in the following books with the chain Hadathana Sufyan Hadathana Zuhri with the above mentioned words.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Musnad Ahmad pg no. 8 vol no. 2</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Abu Dawud pg no. 104 vol no.1</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Nasa’I pg no.123 vol no. 1 (Mujtaba)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Sunan al-Kubra pg no.350 vol no.1</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">However it is a great injustice that when the Muhadith Shahir Malvi Habiburehman A’dhami published Musnad Humaidi then he changed the text. So instead of being a proof for Rafyul Yadayn it became a proof for not doing rafyul yadayn. See the following:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>I saw the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) that when he started the salah he raised his hands up until his shoulders and when he wanted to go into ruku and raise his head up from ruku then he did not perform rafyul yadayn and not between the two sajdas.</em>(Musnad Humaidi pg no. 277 vol no.2)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">A Miracle Of The Power Of Allah</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">However Allah has taken it upon Himself to protect His religion. Through His power, He made the Deobandi Muhadith behave in such a way that even though he did tahrif it did not become a proof for the Deobandis. This was because in between Imam Humaidi and Zuhri there is Imam Sufyan who was dropped which was found out later on in the commentary of the book by ‘al’Athami’ because the chart of errors at the end of the book did not address this error.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Nevertheless the Deobandis made this a proof for themselves. However they would forgetfully mention the route through Sufyan (Nur ul-Isbah pg no.59) which the muhaqiq of our era Mawlana Irshad ul-haq al-Athari followed up on and said if the words ‘Hadathana Sufyan’ can be left out by the one who is joining the words then why is it not possible that the writer can make mistakes in mentioning some words. (A new effort on the overview of the issue of Rafyul Yadayn pg no.25)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In order to save themselves from this accusation when the Deobandis published Musnad Humadi the second time from Gujranwala they put Imam Sufyan in between the chain to make it authentic. Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilayhi Raji’un. (It seems like the publisher of Maktabah Hanafiya committed to making tahrif upon tahrif).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Benefit: We are mentioning the following as it is appropriate to the subject being discussed. The details of it is that, a &#8220;humble&#8221; person from the Barelwi school of thought came and said that I have come to know that there is a hadith which is authentic, marfu’ and comes in a connected chain in the Musnad of Humaidi which proves the negation of Rafyul Yadayn. The author started to laugh a lot when he heard this question, so the Barelwi man said, why are you laughing?, the author said that I remembered a benefit which is that, a man from a village claimed to be a ‘Sayid’, whilst there was a true Sayid residing in this village too. The true Sayid filed a complaint and court trial against the fake Sayid for acting disrespectfully, so the fake Sayid was summoned to court. The two parties entered the court and the judge asked the defendant to provide evidence of him being a Sayid so on the following summoning the fake Sayid brought a witness. The witness made a statement saying that this person is truly a Sayid so the judge asked how do you know that this person is Sayid. So the witness replied by saying, this person became a Sayid in front of me!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">After mentioning this benefit I said that it is well known to us that this hadith was made in front of us. So based on this reply he lowered his head out of embarrassment.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Tahrif In Ibn Majah </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Some scholars have said that Sunan Ibn Majah is part of the Sahah Sittah. It is a popular and educational book. It contains Sahih, Da’if and even fabricated narrations. There is a narration mentioned by Jabir (Radi Allahu Anhu) in it that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>&#8220;Whosoever has an Imam (in the salah) then the recitation of the Imam is equivalent to the recitation of the one behind in the Imam.&#8221;</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> (Ibn Majah pg no.61)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Hanafis use this narration as an evidence to show that one should not recite behind the imam. (Tadqiq al-Kalam pg no.195 vol no.1)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Ahlul Hadith scholars have replied to this by saying that the narrator Jabir al-Ju’fi in this chain is a Liar. (Tahqiq al-Kalam pg no.134 vol no.2)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Instead of accepting the truth the Hanafis did tahrif in Sunan Ibn Majah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The original chain of narration is like this:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> Hadathana Ali Ibn Muhamad Thana Ubaidillah Ibn Musa An al-Hasan Ibn Salih An Jabir An Abi az-Zubair An Jabir</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This was changed to:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Jabir wa Abi Zubair</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The letter wow was put between Jabir and Abi Zubair for the purpose of showing and giving the impression that Jabir al-Ju’fi was not alone in narrating, rather his thiqah mutabi’ Abi Zubair is also present who is a contemporary of Jabir al-Ju’fi and they both narrated it from Jabir (Radi Allahu Anhu). Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilayhi Raji’un</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Whilst the people of knowledge clearly know that if there was the letter wow in Ibn Majah and Jabir al-Ju’fi and Abi Zubair were both contemporaries then instead of Jabir wa an Abi Zubair it would be Jabir wa Abi Zubair. The purpose of stating this is that just as the individual who added the wow is treacherous and dishonest he is also ignorant and clumsy.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">The Chain Of Ibn Majah According To The Fairness Of The Muhadithin</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">There are a great number of other Muhadithin who have narrated this narration apart from Ibn Majah. However they have all mentioned it with the chain:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> Jabir An Abi Zubair</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">See Sunan Daraqutni pg no.331 vol. 1, Ibn Adi pg no.542 vol no.2 and Kitab al-Qira’ah pg no.158 and Musnad Ahmad no.339 vol no.3)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Testimony From Your Own House</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The scholars of the ahnaf have also narrated this narration with the chain of Jabir from Abi Zubair. See Sharh Ma’anil Athar pg no.149 vol no.1) Also Mawlana Abdul Hay Lakhnawi Hanafi also narrated this from Ibn Majah with the chain of Jabir from Abi Zubair. Imam ul-Kalam pg no.187 and at-Ta’liq al-Mujadid pg no.96, Allamah Zayla’I Hanafi also narrated it as Jabir An Abi Zubair without the wow in Nasburayah pg no.7 vol no.2 which is living proof that the additional wow put inside Ibn Majah is the dishonesty and tahrif of the Deobandis and have changed around a chain to try and make and raise a fabricated narration to be the saying of the Prophet (Sallalalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilayhi Wa Raji’un</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Tahrif In The Musnad Of Abu Awanah </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imam Abu Awanah has narrated a marfu hadith narrated by Abdullah Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) under the chapter heading of, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em><span style="color: #000000">Explanation Of Raising Both The Hands Up Tp The Shoulders At The Start Of The Salah Before The (First) Takbir And When Going Into Ruku&#8217; And When Raising One&#8217;s Head From Ruku&#8217; And That He Does Not Raise Them Between The Two Prostrations</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Meaning that I saw The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) that when he started the Salah he would raise both of his hands up until they were both aligned and adjacent to each other some narrators have said that he would raise both his hands up until they were adjacent to his shoulders and (during the times) when he would intend to go into Ruku&#8217; and raise his head up from Ruku&#8217;, and he would not raise them both up and some narrators have said that he would not raise them both up between the two prostrations and they both have one meaning.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">(Manuscript form of Musnad Abu Awanah taken from Nurul Aynayn pg no.169)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">However it is with great sadness that when the Ahnaf published the Musnad of Abu Awana they removed the &#8216;wow&#8217; (and) from:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">from Ruku&#8217;</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000"><em>and</em> </span><span style="color: #000000">he would not perform Rafyul Yadayn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">(Musnad Abu Awanah vol no.2 pg no.90. Afterwards they used this hadith as a proof to show the negation of Rafyul Yadayn. Nur ul-Isbah pg no.53) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">(T.N. by doing so the reader would be deceived into thinking that he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) would not perform Rafyul Yadayn when going into Ruku&#8217; and when raising his head up from Ruku&#8217;. &#8220;So woe to those who write the &#8220;scripture&#8221; with their own hands, then say, &#8220;This is from Allah,&#8221; in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.&#8221; Quran 2:79)  </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Overview On The Tahrif</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1. Abu Awanah put this hadith under the chapter heading of performing Rafyul Yadayn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2. To understand the text of this hadith you need to review and contemplate on the words. Such as what the words</span><em> <span style="color: #ff0000">(</span></em><span style="color: #ff0000"><em>And he did not raise both of them)</em> <span style="color: #000000">is in reference to. Is this in reference to the words before it or the words that come after it. In reality just as Imam Abu Awanah has stated the differences mentioned by narrators on how Rafyul Yadayn was performed i.e. some have said <em><span style="color: #ff0000">until they were both aligned and adjacent to each other</span></em> and some narrators have said <span style="color: #ff0000"><em>he would raise both his hands up until they were adjacent to his shoulders</em><span style="color: #000000">. In the same way his real purpose is to also mention differences of wording by narrators later on such as some have said <span style="color: #ff0000"><em>he would not raise them both up</em> </span>and others have said <span style="color: #ff0000"><em>and he would not raise them between the two prostrations</em> </span>and the words of the Imam when he says and <em><span style="color: #ff0000">the meaning is one</span></em>, i.e. that the intended meaning is that both wordings mean the exact same thing is supported whether you say <em><span style="color: #ff0000">he would not raise them both up</span></em> or <em><span style="color: #ff0000">and he would not raise them between the two prostrations</span></em>, they both mean the same thing and there is no difference. The question remains that if it is part of the words before just as the Deobandis claim then the what is the purpose in mentioning the words after it that <em><span style="color: #ff0000">some narrators have said and he would not raise them between the two prostrations and the meaning is one</span></em> and referring to an apparent contradiction and difference. Also what are the two phrases here which are being classified as having one meaning? If there are no two phrases here then what is the purpose of mentioning that the <em><span style="color: #ff0000">meaning is one</span></em>?</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3. Imam Abu Awanah has narrated this hadith through the chain of Abdullah Ibn Ayub Sa&#8217;dan Ibn Nasr and Shu&#8217;ayb Ibn Amr etc. which clearly means that Abdullah Sa&#8217;dan and Shu&#8217;ayb etc. narrate this hadith from Sufyan with these words. Now if we look at other books of hadith where this hadith has been narrated from these narrators such as in Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi vol no.2, pg no.69. This hadith is present through the chain of Sa&#8217;dan from Sufyan with the following words:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>That the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) used to raise both his hands up up until they were adjacent with his shoulders when starting the salah and when he would intend in going into ruku&#8217; and after rising up from ruku&#8217;. And he would not raise them between the two prostrations.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Now if we compare these words to the narration present in Sahih Abi Awanah then we can see that there is no difference of wording mentioned in this narration because the words transmitted by Sa&#8217;dan are </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #ff0000"><em>until they were adjacent with his shoulders </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #ff0000"><em>and he would not raise them between the two prostrations</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This route also shows that the purpose of mentioning the other wording of <em><span style="color: #ff0000">he would not raise them both up </span></em>is only to show the difference of wording by narrators. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">(An overview on the new effort of the issue of Rafyul Yadayn pg no.22</span>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4. Imam Abu Awanah narrated this hadith from the chain of Sufyan Ibn Uyaynah and Sufyan&#8217;s narration is present in Sahih Muslim vol no.1 pg no.168 which have the words:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #ff0000">And he would not raise them both up between the two prostrations</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Therefore the words</span> <span style="color: #ff0000">(And he would not raise them both up)</span> <span style="color: #000000">are connected to the phrase after it</span> <span style="color: #ff0000">(between the two prostrations). <span style="color: #000000">However the Hanafis have made tahrif in the Musnad of Abi Awanah and used it as a proof to negate performing Rafyul Yadayn. Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilayhi Raji&#8217;un</span></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Tahrif In Sahih Muslim  </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In 1376 Hijri Malak Sirajudin and Sons published Sahih Muslim with the tahqiq of Mawlana Muhamad Idris Kandahlawi Deobandi and other than him. There was a chain which was fabricated in it for the purpose of supporting the Hanafi madhab which was ill conceived. It is:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ubaydullah ibn Mu&#8217;adh al-Anbari narrated to me he said my father informed us he said Muhamad bin Amr al-Laythi informed us from Amr bin Muslim bin Amara from bin Ukayma al-Laythi  he said I heard Sa&#8217;id bin Musayab saying I heard Um Salama the wife of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam)&#8230;to the end of the hadith. (Sahih Muslim vol no.2 pg no.168)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Whilst the correct chain of the hadith is as follows:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ubaydullah ibn Mu&#8217;adh al-Anbari narrated to me he said my father informed us he said Muhamad bin Amr al-Laythi informed us from Umar ibn Muslim bin Amaar bin Ukayma al-Laythi he said I heard Sa&#8217;id Ibn Musayab saying I heard Um Salama the wife of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) (Sahih Muslim vol no.2 pg no.160)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This narration is present in the following books with the chain of Sahih Muslim:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Abu Dawud vol no.2 pg no.30</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Tirmidhi in Tuhfatul Ahwadhi vol no.2 pg no.365</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Nasa&#8217;i Mujtaba vol no.2 pg no.194</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Majah pg no.234</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Bayhaqi vol no.9 pg no.266</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">al-Muhalla of Ibn Hazm vol no.6 pg no.3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Sharh Ma&#8217;ani al-Athar vol no.2 pg no.334</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">and other than them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">There is definitely no connection of Ibn Ukayma al-Laythi after Umar Ibn Muslim Ibn Amar in all of them.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">The Reason For the Tahrif  </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In Tirmidhi with Tuhfatul Ahwadhi vol no.1 pg no.254 there is a hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah (Radi Allahu Anhu) which is an apparent evidence of not reciting behind the Imam for the other party (i.e. Hanafis). (Ahsanul kalam vol no.1 pg no.278)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">However in this chain there is the narrator Ibn Ukaymah al-Laythi. The purpose for putting Ibn Ukaymah al-Laythi is to try and make him a narrator of Sahih Muslim. It is requested that the people of knowledge study Tahthib at-Tahthib of Ibn Hajr vol no.7 pg no.410 in which he mentions him as a narrator of the four sunan but not of Sahih Muslim. If he was part of the previously mentioned chain then Ibn Hajr would have mentioned him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Additionally, if he was part of the chain then it would either be from Amara bin Ukayma al-Laythi or from Ibn Ukayma al-Laythi however here it is from bin Ukayma al-Laythi which establishes that where the person doing tahrif is a traitor they are also clumsy and ignorant.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Tahrif In The Mustadrak al-Hakim  </span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000">There is a hadith narrated by A&#8217;isha (Radi Allahu Anha) with the chain of Aban bin Yazid from Qatada from Zirara bin Awfa from Sa&#8217;d bin Hisham about the number of rak&#8217;at of witr which is [Shadh] due to it&#8217;s matn. (For details see Din ul-Haq vol no.1 pg no.434)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The wording of this hadith is:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000">A&#8217;isha (Radi Allahu Anha) said that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) used to pray 3 rak&#8217;at of witr and did not sit down (T.N in the tashahud position in between each rak&#8217;ah) except at the end of them (T.N. i.e. only sat down in the last rak&#8217;ah). </span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">However when the Ahnaf published the Mustadrak of al-Hakim they changed &#8220;did not sit down&#8221; to &#8220;did not perform salam (T.N. i.e. conclude the prayer)&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">From this tahrif those people killed 2 birds with one stone. </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000">According to the Hanafis one should sit down in the tashahud position in the 2nd rak&#8217;ah whilst in this narration it negates this action therefore these so called &#8220;Honest and faithful&#8221; people changed the wording so that the meaning of those words would distort any refutation against them. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">According to the Hanafis one should not perform salam (i.e. conclude the prayer) in the middle of the Witr prayer and therefore to support this they changed &#8220;did not sit down&#8221; to &#8220;did not perform salam&#8221; which negates the action of performing salam in the 2nd rak&#8217;ah of the prayer. By doing this tahrif in the matn of this narration those people supported the Hanafi madhab. Inna Lillahi wa Inna Ilayhi Raji&#8217;un </span></li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">The Testimony Of The Muhadithin  </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imam Bayhaqi narrated this same narration in (as-Sunan al-Kubra vol no.3 pg no.28) with the same chain of Mustadrak with the words &#8220;did not sit down&#8221;. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The following also narrated the same narration from Mustadrak with the words of &#8220;did not sit down&#8221;:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Adh-Dhahabi in (Talkhis Mustadrak vol no.1 pg no.304)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Hajr in (Fathul Bari vol no.2 pg no.385) and (Talkhis ul-Habir vol no.2 pg no.15)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">The Testimony Of The Hanafis  </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Naymawi Hanafi narrated the same narration in (Athar as-Sunan pg no.206) from Mustadrak however he used the words &#8220;did not sit down&#8221; and it is clearly mentioned in the marginal notes and commentaries that Imam Bayhaqi said in Ma&#8217;rifatus Sunan wal-Athar that the narration of A&#8217;isha (Radi Allahu Anha) with the route of Aban has the words of &#8220;did not sit down&#8221;. Therefore the correct words in this narration is &#8220;did not sit down&#8221; and not &#8220;did not perform salam&#8221;. (Marginal notes of Athar as-Sunan pg no.206) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Note: The author of this book made a mistake in (Din ul-Haq pg no.235) that the mentioned reference was attributed to Mawlana Fayz Ahmad. Therefore dear readers please correct this. </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Tahrif In The Musnad Of Ahmad  </span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The Hanafis published the Musnad of Ahmad from Hyderabad Deccan. As part of their routine habit, they also performed tahrif in this and they did it with pleasure. It is a well known saying that &#8220;the wolf may lose his teeth but never its nature&#8221; and this is what has happened here because the previously mentioned tahrifat were done with meaning and purpose to provide some support to the madhab but this tahrif has no purpose. Perhaps there is some sort of purpose in which the author of this book is unaware of. Nevertheless, let us look at the wording of the hadith. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Amr Ibn Mura (Radi Allahu Anhu) narrates that a person came to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and said that I recite the testimony of faith, I pray my salah, I give zakah and I fast. So he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, &#8220;Whichever person dies upon this then they will be in the company and fellowship of the Prophets, Siddiqs and martyrs on the day of judgement like this&#8221; and then he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) put his two fingers together. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">This hadith has also been narrated by Ibn Kathir in his (Tafsir vol no.1 pg no.523) with the chain of Musnad Ahmad. Likewise, as-Suyuti in (Dur Manthur vol no.2 pg no.182) and Haythami in (Majma az-Zawa&#8217;id vol no.1 pg no.46 and vol no.8 pg no.150) from Musnad Ahmad. There is an unpublished detailed study of this hadith with the Takhrij of the author at Muhamadiya pocket book. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">However it is with great sadness that they (i.e. the Hanafis) are the only ones working on the knowledge of the Prophet (Sallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) who removed this hadith from the Musnad of Ahmad. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hanbalee Text</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>al-Khiraqeee ( d. 334):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>– “The hands are raised up to the lobes of the ears or parallel to the shoulders, then the right hand is placed upon the left, and both of them placed below the navel.” (Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee)</strong></span></p>
<p><b>Reply</b></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly the origin and sources are the Quraanic text and the Prophetic ahadeeth and as it is often advocated by those who deem it necessary and permissible to adhere and follow a madhab usually tend to say evidences must have been used to derive these rulings and final positions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a basic text of Hanbalee fiqh authored by Abul Qaasim Umar bin al-Hussain bin Abdullah al-Khirqee and he died in the year 334H. It is considered to be one of the very first classical text on the hanbalee fiqh and as the name suggest it is Mukhtasar ie summarised and brief, its full name is <i>Matn al-Khirqee A’la Madhab Abee Abdillaah Ahmad ibn Hanbal ash-Shaibaanee</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore it is very strange that this text would be used to establish the opinion of the hanaabilah to clasp their hands below the navel when this text is just a very brief guide. Furthermore the author ie al-Khiraqee has not cited any evidences at all whatsoever and has just cited a position we known without evidences this is invalid as its just opinion. It is often said the madhaahib must have used evidences yet in this instance there is no evidence so just to cite Khiraqee saying the position of the madhab is below the navel is ambiguous and requires further investigation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The checker ie Abu Hudhaifah Ibraaheem ibn Muhammad of one of the editions of Mukhtasar al-Khirqee added a footnote to this passage and said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i>“</i><i>There are a number of narrations</i><i> </i><i>from Imaam</i><i> </i><i>Ahmad</i><i> </i><i>that acknowledge and establish the</i><i> </i><i>placing</i><i> (of the hands) </i><i>on the chest.”</i> (<i>Mukhtasar al-Khirqee</i> (pg.21), Chapter, The Characteristics of the Prayer. Edn 1st Daar us-Sahaabah Lil-Turaath of Tantha (Egypt) 1413H/1993)</strong> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So we have previously mentioned al-Khiraqee is a basic text of the Hanaabilah and it does not cite any evidences just opinions of the madhabs. In this situation and other situations it is obligatory upon as Muslims to refer back to the divine sacred texts and in this instance for the evidences utilised by the madhab.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then we look at these evidences in light of the scholars of hadeeth and fiqh if the hadeeth are authentic we take them irrespective of the madhab and what the end result of adopting the ahadeeth brings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A recent explanation of Khiraqee does not mention the evidence used for this position and this explanation was by Khaalid bin Abdullaah al-Ansaari titled. <i>‘Sharh Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee’</i> Edn 1st Daar ul-Ei’tisaam Lil-Nashr 1425H/2004H and he also does not mention any evidence. As it must be said by the checking by Muhammad Zuhair ash-Shaawaish of Matn al-Khiraqee of one of the earliest printed edition in this century with his checking back in 1378H/1954 and he also offered no explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the earliest explanations of the Khiraqee was that of Shaikh Noor ud deen Abee Taalib Abdur Rahmaan bin Umar bin Abil-Qaasim bin Alee bin Uthmaan al-Basree adh-Dhareer who died in the year 684H titled. <i>‘al-Waadhihu Fee Sharh Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee’</i> (Edn 1st Daar al-Khadar Lil Taba’ah Wan-Nashr Wat-Tawzee’a 1421H/2000, Beiroot Lebanon)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In it Shaikh Noor ud deen said in explanation of al-Khiraqees words,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i>“</i><i>and both of them placed below the navel” </i><i>This has been narrated from Alee, Abu Hurairah (</i><i>Radhiallaahu Anhuma) and others from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) who said, “It is from the Sunnah to place the right hand on the left below the navel.” Transmitted by Ahmad and this is equivalent to the Prophetic Sunnah. This statement is also emanated from the companions.</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i>It is also narrated from (Imaam) Ahmad the Sunnah is to place the hands above the navel and this is also the statement of ash-Shaafi’ee from what is narrated by Wail ibn Hujr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) who said, “I saw the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) praying and he placed his hands on his chest one over the other.”</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i>It is also narrated from (Imaam) Ahmad that one has the choice or option to place them below the navel or above the navel based on all of the narrations (on this subject) and the command pertaining to them is broad.”</i> (End of his words)(‘al-Waadhih Fee Sharh Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee’ (1/213-214)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>BENEFITS</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly the explainer Shaikh Noor ud deen has summarised the narrations and used different wordings from what is present in the books of hadeeth. The narrations of Alee and Abu Hurairah (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) have been continuously used by all of the different madhabs in support of this opinion and in recent times books on prayer in the English language from the hanafee school of opinion from the likes of <i>‘Fiqh ul-Imam’</i> of Abdur Rahmaan ibn Yoosuf and Mr Riyadhs book <i>‘Salah of The Believer’</i>which are of Deobandee Hanafee persuasion and also some have been printed in the English language by the Barailwee Hanafee persuasion all by default use the very same reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration elucidating the meaning of the report of Alee and Abu Hurairah can be found in the <i>‘Sunan Abee Dawood’</i>(1/201 no.756) of Imaam Abu Dawood and The <i>‘Musnad’</i> of Imaam Ahmad himself (1/110 no.875)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the narration of Wail ibn Hujr can be found in the <i>‘Saheeh Ibn Khuzaimah’</i> of Imaam Ibn Khuzaimah (1/234 no.479)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So we also find the evidences used by the Hanaabilah for the position of placing their hands below their navels are the very same reports of Alee and Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) but these report have been comprehensively established to be weak. (as a brief idea refer to an appendix of the English translation of Allaamah Muhammad Naasir ud deen al-Albaanees <i>‘Sifah Salaatun Nabee’ </i>which addresses the trustworthiness of the central narrator of both of these reports and he is Abdur Rahmaan ibn Koofee al-Waasitee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most staunchest and most bigoted in this issue are our brethren from amongst the Ahnaaf ie the hanafees and even they have admitted overwhelmingly and acknowledged in their various works throughout history the weakness of Abdur Rahmaan al-Koofee. Which inshaAllaah maybe addressed at a different time. It suffices for now to know that some traditionalists ie prominent and universally accepted scholars have even established universal consensus in his weakness ie Ijmaa which as we dear readers know constitutes evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next question we may ask ourselves well if these reports are so weak why did such scholars from amongst the hanaabilah or others for that matter still utilise them as evidence as part of their madhabs. Well the simple answer to this is that this issue has been continually argued and discussed throughout history on why people still utilise evidences that are weak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is such a complex issue that books have even been written on it, in recent times the great Saudi and renowned scholar of Usool and Aqeedah Allaamah Shaikh Muhammad ibn Saaleh al-Uthaimeen Rahimahullaah, authored a book on why scholars differed or why differences of opinion existed and the Shaikhs goes through such pertinent reasons. It is indeed one of those must read books and you will be pleased to know it has been translated into English a number of years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imaam Shaikh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah also wrote a monumental work on the subject of understanding the differences of opinion amongst scholars titled, <i>‘Raf al-Malaam Ann Ai’matul A’laam’</i> as have other Scholars from the likes of Shaikh Shaah Waleeullaah Dehlawee and Shaikh Muhammad Hayaat Sindhee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the reasons they have mentioned are that the scholars are unaware of the other ahadeeth or narrations, another reason is if they were aware they believed their position was stronger, another reason is that they may have been unaware of the authenticities of such reports and or the authenticity of opposing reports and this leads onto another reason and that is that the scholars of fiqh or compilers of such books on fiqh were not strong in the verification and research of ahadeeth but rather their expertise was more focussed on the interpretation, interpolation and elucidation of these sacred texts. The above narration is a prime example of this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> It must also be noted here and we find this extremely interesting and that is it is often said and re-iterated and this article that was shared with us is a pertinent example that the 2 opinions from Imaam Ahmad are below the navel or above the navel and this is what Shaikh Noor ud deen has mentioned in <i>‘al-Waadhih Fee Sharh Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee’ </i>baring in mind this was at least as early as the 7th century of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Unfortunately there are those who are from amongst us, who for some strange and odd reason lack the vision and insight into such issues and say, “well only the words above the navel has been mentioned from Imaam Ahmad as his opinion and therefore this does not mean on the chest so why do the Salafis and the Ahlul Hadeeth say Imaam Ahmads opinion was to place the hands on the chest.” This is a very common point made by such “madhabees” they also say in a different way above the navel does not mean on the chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In answer to this weak point Imaams Ahmad position was to place the hands on the chest because the evidence used for placing the hands above the navel is the hadeeth of Wail ibn Hujr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) which mentions on the chest. So this shows every time the wording above the navel is cited as Imaam Ahmads position, it should by default denote on the chest as this was the understanding of the explainer of <i>Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee</i> ie Shaikh Noor ud deen as he used the hadeeth of placing the hands on the chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore according to some opinions anything above the navel means the chest and this is well known according to the usoolee scholars and the linguists. So the defining line and distinguishing sign is the belly button ie the navel, below or above it and in this way the navel becomes the line of demarcation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is most pertinent and extremely interesting to note a cunning and deceptive ploy by our madhabee brethren in that they have now shifted their arguments and therefore now say placing the hands below the navel and also above the navel are both valid and correct opinions. They also say placing the hands them on the chest is something alien and an odd opinion. Similarly it also opposes the position of the majority of the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Previously they were (ie the Madhabees) vehemently opposed to anything above or on the navel and in recent times our beloved hanafee brethren have changed and refined their position after realising the strength and authenticity of the evidences presented and have now formulated a new argument that below the navel is good, above the navel is good and acceptable but just not on the chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This ploy according to them has been adopted in order to include the 2 varying opinions of the Hanbalee madhab according to their understanding that above the navel does not mean on the chest thereby increasing their numbers from just the hanafee madhab to now include the hanbalee madhab and to say to the Salafis and Ahlul Hadeeth that you guys now even oppose the hanaabilah, yet this is nothing but just distancing themselves from the truth and overlooking the divine sacred texts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A clear rebuking of this point is that numerous scholars and researchers from amongst the madhab of the hanabilah have done 1 of 2 things, the first is that they have adopted the opinion of the madhab which suggests according to their understanding of the hanbalee madhab that above the navel means the chest and therefore place their hands on their chests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly they may have simply adopted the stronger opinion based on the way of the Madhab of Ahlul Hadeeth that the ahadeeth mentioning the placing of the hands on the chest to be stronger and more authentic than the ahadeeth which mention the position of below the navel. There are numerous scholars from amongst the hanabilah who left and abandoned the position of their madhab in this issue and adopted the position of on the chest and there so many it seems daunting to mention them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Delving into the Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee we have yet another explanation titled, <i>‘Sharh az-Zarkashee A’la Matn al-Khiraqee’</i>which was authored by Shaikh Shams ud deen Abu Abdullaah Muhammad bin Abdullaah az-Zarkashee, who was Egyptian during the 8th century Hijree and he died approximately in the year 772H. So again this is an early explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaikh Zarkashee said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>“<i>and both of them placed below the navel” (Explanation) This is one report from (Imaam) Ahmad. From what Ahmad and Abu Dawood transmit from Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said, “It is from the Sunnah to fasten the palm(s) in the prayer below the navel.” And the definitive Sunnah is equivalent to the Sunnah from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam)</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i> </i><i>The second report (from Imaam Ahmad) and this has the most precedence (al-Afdhal)  is to place the hands below chest as is narrated from Qabeesah bin Hulb from his father who said, “I saw the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) he placed his hands on his chest” and Yahyaa ibn Sa’eed described this and said, “the right on the left above the joint.” Transmitted by Ahmad.</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i> </i><i>The third report (from Imaam Ahmad) one has a choice between the 2. This was adopted by Abee Moosaa and Abul Barkaat and his actions upon it has been reported. Abul Barkaat said, “and so from these narrations there is a wide scope in these 2 commands and there is no harm in anyone from amongst them. And Allaahs knows best.”</i> (Sharh az-Zarkashee A’la Matn al-Khiraqee (1/298) Edn 3rd 1430H/2009, Maktabah al-Asdee, Makkah, KSA)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>BENEFITS</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again essentially 2 opinions below the navel based on the narration of Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and this has been established and comprehensively elucidated to be weak due to a central problematic narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The saying of Shaikh Zarkashee below the chest is not problematic and just requires a little further comprehension and reasoning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Firstly</i></b> below the chest does not mean below the navel rather it means above the navel. It must also be noted Shaikh Zarkashee said back in the 8th century that this has precedence ie it is better to place the hands above the navel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Secondly</i></b> Shaikh Zarkashee uses the report of Hulb which categorically mentions chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Thirdly</i></b> he explains what he means by chest as he goes onto say Imaam Yahyaa ibn Sa’eed described ‘chest’ as being above the joint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Fourthly</i></b> the question what does the joint mean here? Well being open minded and not indulging into polemics that some will exhort to, it is most pertinent that they are answered before they create further confusion and that is the <i>‘Madhabees’</i>may say above the joint may mean placing the right hand on and over the joint of the left hand ie the palm of the right hand covers the back of the left hand, the wrist and the beginning of the forearm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> This is an incorrect notion as the word ‘fauqa’ (above) has been used denoting position in terms of height in relation to something else and if the meaning we have discussed above was intended, the word A’la (on) would have been used.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Fifthly</i></b> it could be strongly argued that Imaam Yahyaa ibn Sa’eed describing the narration of Hulb is doing so in specifying and clarifying what is meant and intended by chest and the author ie Shaikh Zarkashees by bringing his statement is also explaining his position where he said “below the chest.” So the joint here could mean and refer to the joint that occurs between the 2 sides of the ribs which is well above the navel and just below the chest in the general understanding of the word chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> We have also discussed previously the meaning of the word chest and what does some have opined it could refer to anything from the lower part of the neck to the navel.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Was it The Norm to Only Follow the Four Madhabs in the 7th and 8th Century<br />
&amp; The Existence of Other Madhabs</span></strong></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">PART 4</span></strong></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us look at why this is an shadh position (i.e Refutation of Those Who Do Not Follow The Four Schools) we will see in light of the statements and understanding of the scholars who were around the time of Hafiz Ibn Rajab who died in the year 795 after the Hijra.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Rajab allegedly says in the opening pages that he authored the book in answer to someone&#8217;s rebuke to. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Someone&#8217;s rebuke has reached me: a rebuke for my censuring people today who affiliate with the school of Imam Ahmad or another famous Imam, yet depart from their school in issues&#8230;&#8221; (Hafiz Ibn Rajab, Al-Radd &#8216;ala man Ittiba ghayr al-madhahib al-arba ? (Refutation of Those Who Do Not Follow The Four Schools) trans. Musa Furber (?: Islamosaic, 2003/2012/2015) p.1)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(**The dates of the translated publication are somewhat confusing, where the copyright is cited as 2003, 2012 but the translators introduction is dated 30th June 2015 in Abu Dhabi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is interesting to note how Hafiz Ibn Rajab did not restrict such affiliations to just the four Imams as the passage above shows but yet it is strange how the title of the book suggests and is restricted only to the four Madhabs!!! This is from amongst many reasons why some researchers have failed to accept this as Hafiz Ibn Rajab&#8217;s book. Some researchers accepted it to be his treatise with great difficulty but rejected the title. This will be discussed later In Sha Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Musa Furber, in his short biography of Hafiz Ibn Rajab cites al-Subki as one of his teachers, ie Shaikh Taqi al-Din. (Refutation of Those Who Do Not Follow The Four Schools, p.vIII)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, Shaikh Taqi al-Din al-Subki&#8217;s son, Shaikh Taj al-Din Subki (771H) who died just 24 years before Hafiz Ibn Rajab and was therefore from his era, he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“It is unacceptable to Allah, the forcing of people to accept one madhab and the associated partisanship (tahazzub) in the subsidiary issues of the Din and nothing pushes this fervour and zealously except partisanship and jealousy. If Abu Haneefah, Shafi, Malik and Ahmad were alive they would severely censure these people and they would dissassociate themselves from them.” (Mu’eed an-Na’am Wa Mubeed an-Naqam pg.76)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The later Hanafi scholars way after the time of Hafiz Ibn Rajab, even differed with the view of &#8220;only the four madhab&#8221; approach and they said if a muqallid Qadhi (judge) issues a verdict in opposition to the fatwa of the imam of the madhab, it is unworthy to be acted upon. Similarly when the Qadhi issues a verdict based on a weak statement of the madhab it will still not be worthy to be acted upon, so therefore how is it correct to act upon a statement of another madhab. (Refer to Durr ul-Mukhtar with Radd al-Mukhtar 1/76)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Others however on the other hand have shown some leniency and said if the Qadhi is a Mujtahid then his verdict which opposes the madhab can be acted upon based on ijtihad. (Refer to Durr al-Mukhtar 1/85 and 5/404)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the later scholars themselves differed with this even after the era of Hafiz Ibn Rajab and we have already shown the same from Hafiz Ibn Rajab&#8217;s era already, as for the time before, let&#8217;s not even go there!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Kamal ud Din Hanafi said that an individual referring to another madhab based on evidence and ijtihad is sinful and worthy to be reprimanded, then how about the individual who refers to another madhab without evidence or ijtihad, then he will be more worthy of sin and punishment. (Refer to Tahawi 2/417)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Dhahabi (748H), another contemporary of Hafiz Ibn Rajab extorts some beneficial points, his profound words are, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Oh Muqallid and oh you who think ijtihad has finished and there is no Mujtahid now! Then there is no benefit in your learning and studying the principles of Fiqh as learning the principles of Fiqh only benefits the Mujtahid. When an individual knows the principles of Fiqh and he still abstains from freeing himself from the shackles of taqlid, he does not achieve anything. Rather by studying it further he pushes himself into more difficulty and establishes proofs against himself.. ” (cited by Suyuti in Ar-Radd Ala Min Akhlad Ilal Ardh pg.153)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also further expounded on this and said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“A person who only follows one specific madhab is the one who is deficient of firm knowledge, just as the situation was with most of the scholars of our times who are mutassab (ie bigoted)” (Siyar A’lam an-Nabula 14/491)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Izz ud deen Ibn Abdus Salam (660H) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“There is great amazement at the blind following (Muqallid) jurists (fuqaha) who know the weak sources of their imams which they can not clarify or rectify, yet they are still adamant and continue to do taqlid of their Imams and they abandon and leave the position which is supported by the Quran and Sunnah. In doing so they formulate and concoct major false interpretations in defence and in promotion of their Imams.” (Qawaid al-Ahkam 2/135, also cited by Shah Waliullah in his Hujatullah 1/155, in his Ittihaf pg.110 and in his Iqd al-Jeed, Suyuti in his ar-Radd Min Akhlad pg.140, and Allamah Fulani in Iqaz al-Humam pg.108)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Salah (643H) the author of Muqaddimah Uloom al-Hadith) says in summary </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“When a lay person seeks a fatwa or asks concerning an issue from a scholar, he should emphasis on the answer and say was this the ruling of the Nabi (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). If the mufti says yes, he can act on the fatwa and nothing more is required from in terms of him being a lay person. However if the mufti says this is my opinion, or the opinion of Malik, Qasim, Abu Haneefah, Abu Yusuf, Shafi, Ahmad or Dawood Zahiri, or if he says it is the statement of a companion or tabi, or if he just remains silent, then it is haram to take the fatwa. Unless it specifies it is from the Nabi Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam), thereafter it becomes obligatory to take this and it is also obligatory for him to say to you to go and ask other scholars.”(Kitab al-Fatwa pg.280 of Ibn Salah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows even before Hafiz Ibn Rajab&#8217;s time the people and the scholars had an understanding beyond the four Madhabs and followed the methodology of referring back to the evidences, even if it was outside of the four Madhabs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Suyuti (911H), who was over a 100 years after the time of Hafiz Ibn Rajab, he also alludes to the existence of other Madhabs in the fifth century ie up to the 600H. So what changed so dramatically in 150 years or so until the time of Hafiz Ibn Rajab? Imam Suyuti said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Numerous mujtahids have passed through the various eras in addition to the numerous mujtahids after the time of the tabieen. There were 10 madhabs that were prevalent. So in addition to the four madhabs we have the Madhab Sufyan ath-Thawri, Madhab Awzai, Madhab Laith ibn Sa’ad, Madhab Ishaq ibn Rahawaihah, Madhab Ibn Jarir and the Madhab of Dawud. However after thr 5th century due to the lack of fervour, motivation and rejuvenation these other madhabs dimished.” (al-Hawi Lil-Fatawa 2/156 of Imam Suyuti)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (728H) has further expanded on this and asserted the other madhabs did exist, he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Imam Sufyan ath-Thawri who was an Imam of the people of Iraq and according to most of the scholars was greater in rank that the scholars of his era like Ibn Abi Layla, Hasan bin Saleh and Abu Haneefah. His madhab is present today in Khurasan. Likewise the madhab of Imams Ishaq ibn Rahawaihah and Dawud (adh-Dhahiri) is also prevalent today, in fact in the east and the west you will find that most of the followers are of the Dawudi madhab.” (al-Fatawa al-Kubra 2/374, it is also cited in his Majmu Fatawa)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also remember, Imam Ibn Taymiyyah died in 728H and he is saying that you will find people upon other madhabs, so this shows the people were not confined to these madhabs even in the 8th century of Islam, precisely during the era of Hafiz Ibn Rajab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people have even mentioned the different lands who were on different madhabs just before the time of Hafiz Ibn Rajab. For example Mas’ud bin Shaybah Sindhi, who was a staunch author and from amongtst 7th century hanafi scholars mentioned most of the people of Rauzrawar, Yazjard, Juzbazkan (central asia) and some of the people Hamdan are upon the madhab of of Thawri. (Muqaddimah Kitab at-Ta’lim pg.331)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The student of Shaikh Balqaini asked him what prohibits Shaikh Taqi ud deen as-Subki from doing ijtihad (and here it means of the Mustaqil or mutlaq type) whereas he has the capability and knowledge. The student also thought that Shaikh Balqaini was also of the same level and so whatever answers he gives I will also assume that to be his own reasons also.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However Shaikh Balqaini remained silent. So the student himself said, may be he thought it was inappropriate and this ijtihad was restricted to the 4 madhabs and those who left these 4 madhabs and performed ijtihad, they would not achieve anything because the people would abandon and not take Fatawa from them and at the same instance label them to be innovators. Then Shaikh Balqaini smiled upon my clarification and agreed with me. (Refer to Shaikh Shah Waliullahs al-Insaf Fee Bayan Sabab al-Ikhtilaf pg.60-61)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In summary dear readers we find, the scholars did not restrict the people only to the four madhabs and this was from scholars during the time of Hafiz Ibn Rajab, slightly before and well after. This also shows the existence of other madhabs during the same era in the different lands. There were other mitigating factors why scholars resorted to sicking to one of the well known madhabs as the student of Baqilaini highlighted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What must be added here, there is no legislated evidence in the Quran or Sunnah whatsoever that restricts a Muslim to only one of the four madhabs, this is huge milestone from restricting a Muslim to only one madhab.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Are The Fours Madhabs Always Upon the Truth? &#8211; A False Representation and the Severe Inter Madhab Strife</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong>PART 3</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The most obvious assumption such a book leads to is that all four madhabs are upon the truth and anyone upon other than the 4 madhabs are not upon guidance, whether this is the actual case or not is open for discussion and debate. However what is a factual, as the pages of history evidently dictate is the infighting, discord and epic argumentation between the madhabs which went to extreme levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">we have cited this else where and for the benefit of the readers we shall i recite them no matter how archaic the readers might think they are</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Asbag ibn Khalil who was an extremely bigoted Maliki and severely engrossed in madhabi partisanship would warn Qaasim bin Asbag not to listen to Hadeeth from Baqee Ibn Mukhlad.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He would also say that it would be more beneficial for a pig to be placed on his bier than Musannaf Ibn Abee Shaybah be placed in it. The reason for this was because the Musannaf of Ibn Shaybah contained narrations that rendered some Maliki (and Hanafi) views and juristic decisions to be futile, null and void. (Siyar al-A’laam an-Nabula (13/302) al-Ei’tisaam (2/348)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Katheer and Imaam Dhahabee also mention the trial and tribulation that befell Haafidh Abdul Ghanee al-Maqdisee. In and around 595H again The grand masjid in Damascus known as Jaam’e Amawee had 4 Musallahs, one for each Madhab. Haafidh Abdul Ghanee al-Maqdisee would deliver his lectures at the Hanbalee Musallah on the issue of Asmaa Was Sifaat of Allaah and Aqeedah in general. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the followers of the other madhabs like Qadhee Ibn at-Turkee and Dhiyaa ud deen Khateeb ad-Daula’ee could not fathom this because they differed with him on Aqeedah as well as Fiqh as they were from different madhabs. In light of this they went to the see the ruler at the time who was Saarim ud deen Barghash.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A debate on the issues of Aqeedah was organised and Haafidh Abdul Ghanee al-Maqdisee debated all of them ferociously. No doubt the opposers were followers of the other madhabs and were Asharee in Aqeedah. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When Haafidh Abdul Ghanee al-Maqdisee defeated them and the Asharees and followers of the other madhabs pushed Ameer Saarim ud deen Barghash further who in the end expelled and forced Haafidh Abdul Ghanee al-Maqdisee into exile. The people were ordered to destroy the Minbar of the Hanbalis, their books and literature were thrown out and on the same day there was no Dhuhr prayer for the Hanbalis. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise and similarly they were banned and prohibited from teaching in Jaam’e Amwaee and a lot of discord and dissention occurred as a result of this argumentative and quarrelsome period. (Refer to al-Bidaayah Wan-Nihaayah (13/218) and Siyar al-A’laam an-Nabula (21/463)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some historians mention Haafidh Dhiyaa al-Maqdisi, the author of the book of Hadeeth known as al-Mukhtarah was once going through and reading Imaam Uqailee’s adh-Dhu’afah to the public in Mosul, which is in present day Iraq. The people of Mosul captured Dhiyaa al-Maqdisi and put him in jail and wanted to eventually kill him. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The reason for this was because Imaam Uqailee’s adh-Dhu’afah had some statements disparaging the integrity of Imaam Abu Haneefah. Such was the case that whilst in jail the executioner was about to kill Dhiyaa al-Maqdisi when at the last minute he was told to stop. Later it transpired that Haafidh Barnee had ripped the pages in question disparaging Imaam Abu Hanfeeah from Imaam Uqailee’s book and therefore in this Haafidh Dhiyaa al-Maqdisi was spared.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Ibn Dawood was the Chief Justice of his era ie the Qadhee tul-Qadhaa. Ahmad Ibn Dawood was well known for his animosity against Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal in being the chief proponent and opposition to Imaam Ahmad on the issue of the creation of the Quraan. Imaam Ahmad had to suffer greatly at the injustice and partisanship of Ahmad Ibn Dawud who was a mutazilee Jahmee yet a Hanafi in jurisprudence.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He has spearheaded a vehement onslaught on the Aqeedah of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah regarding the creation of the Quraan and negation of the Sifaat. Yet he was a Hanafi, later historians and islamic intellectual authors have cited Ahmad Ibn Dawud was a staunch bigoted Hanafi and further opposed Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal due to his jurisprudence and Imaam Ahmad’s firm stance on taking ahadeeth over opinion and staunch partisanship madhabism. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ibn Humaam, the well known Hanafi jurist said, </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abul Yasr said it is impermissible for a Hanafi to pray behind a Shafiee and the reason for this is due to what Makhool an-Nasafee wrote in his book ‘ash-Sha’aa’a’ that raising the hands whilst going into ruku and rising from it invalidates the prayer because this is an excessive action. Qadhee Khan only allows its permissibility on the condition that the Shafiee is not staunch bigot and that he does not doubt his eemaan.(Refer to Ibn Humaams Fath ul-Qadeer (1/31)</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We ask is this not imposing and scaremongering the people in saying that that prayer is not valid behind a Shafiee, who in their right mind would want to be a Shafiee or even contemplate being one, knowing very well any prayer behind him would be invalid. Is this not a type of enforcing a madhab on the people by instilling the fear of consequence and reprimand? Of course it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">On the other end of the spectrum Imaam al-Haramain al-Juwainee who was a Shafiee would vehemently oppose and talk about imam Abu Haneefah and he would say if the prayer which Abu Haneefah held to be permissible was ever shown to a normal person he would never accept it. Whereas the prayer is a pillar of the deen and as their Aqeedah with regards to the prayer is null and void this clarifies and makes the futility of their madhab manifest. (Refer to Mugeeth al-Khalq (pg.59)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So now who would want to be a Hanafi when the Imaam of the Haram, Imaam al-Juwainee is effectively saying the prayer of the hanafis is invalid and because this is the case their belief regarding the prayer which is a pillar of the deen is defective, it in turn leads to the notion of the whole hanafi madhab being futile!!! Is this not partisanship being imposed and propagated as the only right way and also being enforced on the people as to show only the Shafiees prayer correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Bukhaari’s Saheeh al-Bukhaari is the most authentic book after the book of Allaah in fact numerous scholars of Hadeeth have cited and mentioned unanimous agreement ie Ijmaa that all of the Hadeeth in Bukhaari are all authentic.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Despite this, look at what a staunch and bigoted Hanafi by the name of Abu Yoosuf bin Moosaa bin Muhammad bin Abee Takeen al-Maltee and then Halabee famously said, </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whoever looks at (ie reads) Bukhaari has become a zindeeq (ie a heretic)” (Ambaa al-Ghamr Ba Ambaa al-Umar (4/448).</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Is this also not scaring the people from reading Bukhaari? Who would want to become a zindeeq ie heretic? No one. This is enforcing partisanship in reversing the understanding ie the one who looks at the prophets hadeeth is a zindeeq therefore remain a Hanafi!!!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From the later scholars Mulla Ali Qari Hanafi cited what the author of Kaidaani said that the 10th haram or unlawful thing to do in the prayer like the Ahlul Hadeeth do is the moving and pointing of the finger. This is the practise of those who follow the Hadeeth. (Cited by Shaikh Rasheed Ridha in his introduction to the al-Mughni (1/20).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Is this not enforcing a madhab based on partisanship and sheer neglect and disregard of scholarly foresight and differences. How unfair and unjust is it to say following any of the madhabs is correct yet at the same instance we have such confrontational bigoted statements that indicate that only one madhab is actually really correct according to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi 1307H mentions another a reason of bigoted partisanship was fabrication of Hadeeth to promote ones madhab. He mentions about Mamoon al-Harawi, who was Hanafi) fabricated a Hadeeth which allegedly mentioned the invalidation of the prayer of the individual who raised his (before and after ruku) and reciting Fatihah behind the Imaam. He also fabricated ahadeeth in the censure and disparagement of Imaam Shaafi’ee and in praise and veneration of Imam Abu Haneefah. (Refer to at-Tawaam al-Mar’ashah (pg.67)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The well known and hugely followed Hanafi madhab was enforced and spread via the state and in this regard also imposed on the masses. The government of that time was mutazili and Jahmi in belief and manifested itself at the state level in around after the second century. The state was under the rulership of Mamoon Rashid who began is rulership around 198H but manifested and propagated his mutazili and Jahmi beliefs around 212H.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This mutazili and jahmi government lasted and ruled for approximately 40 years and during this period it’s heads and leaders worked emphatically and vigorously to spread their beliefs and madhab in terms of Aqeedah. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah the Mighty and Majestic said,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment.” (Soorah Ale-Imran:105)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Such obstinance understanding of the madhabs and this staunchness led to further problems with the madhabs, in that there were more extreme and grave differences. This lead to some serious consequences and the following can only but show the fruits and affects of taqlid and blind following.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For example Yaqut Hamawi whilst writing his description and notes about the area of Rayy, he says first the hanafis and shafis joined forces and expelled and refuted the shia, thereafter he adds,</span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Then the hanafis and the shafis began fighting, the shafis despite being less in number would always be victorious to the extent that the hanafis of ar-Rustaq would come to aid their fellow hanafis but to no avail. In the end only those from amongst the hanafis and shafis were saved who hid their madhab and turned their houses into places of shelter and if they had not done this then no one would have been saved.” (Mu’ajam al-Buldan 3/117 and Dhuhr al-Islam 1/80)</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise and similarly he writes about Isbahan, </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“During this era and the time before around Isbahan and the surrounding areas due to the bigotry and partisanship of the shafis and hanafis, discord and dissension spread. A battle between them waged for 8 continuous days, when one would overpower the other they would destroy and demolish their houses and burn them and in doing so they would not feel any remorse or sorrow and this calamity befell a large group of people.” (Mu’ajam al-Buldan 1/209, al-Kamil 11/319, Dhuhr al-Islam 1/80)</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Ibn Athir said concerning the events of 323H,</span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The status of the Hanabillah grew, so wherever they saw fermented alcohol they would spill it and wherever they saw a singer they woulkd hit him and also brake the musical instrument. If they would see a man with a woman or children they would ask him who they were? If he replied correctly they would let him go and if not they would severely beat both of them and declare her to be a fahishah and then hand her over to the government officers. In the end Badr al-Kharshani made a public disorder announcement in Baghdad and said no two hanbalis can get together nor should anyone debate or quarrel with them and the Imams should recite Bismillah loudly. This then fulled the situation even more and if the hanbalis found a shafi they would severely beat him, rendering him unconscious.” (al-Kamil 8/307-308 and Dhuhr al-Islam 1/79-80).</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Ibn Athir also wrote concerning the events of 447H, he says? </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The shafis and the hanbalis had severe standoffs and argumentations in Baghdad under the leadership of Abu Ali bin Fura and Ibn Tamimi both hanbalis. The hanbalis began to severely warn against reciting Bismillaah loudly in the prayer, from reciting the qunoot in the fajr prayer and the secondary Adnan. At one masjid they prohibited the imam from reciting Bismillaah loudly in the prayer. So the imam bought the Quran to them and told them to erase the words of Bismillaah from the Quran so that he does not have recite it loudly.” (al-Kamil 9/614)</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And in the events leading upto 475H he wrote that the Shaikh Sharif Abul Qasim al-Bakri al-Maghribi came to Baghdad and he was an Asha’ari Shafi. He delivered lectures in Madrassah Nizamiyyah and he said whilst addressing the Hanabillah whilst reciting the ayah (Soorah al-Baqarah:102),</span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Sulaiman (Alayhis Salam) did not commit kufr but shaytan did and by Allaah I do not say (Imam) Ahmad committed kufr but his followers are kafirs!!!” (Siyar A’laam an-Nabula 18/562, al-Kamil 10/134)</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the same Madrassah of Nizamiyyah when the son of Shaikh Abdul Karim Abul Qasim al-Qushairi, Abu Nasr came to Baghdad in 469H he delivered lectures and admonitions in the Madrassah. He was Asha’ari and hence had a vehement difference with the Hanbalis. So this dissention and extreme animosity between the two became so propelled and violent that a group of them died in the fighting and killing that pursue. (Wafyat al-A’yan 3/208, Dhail Tabaqat al-Hanabillah 1/19-21, Siyar al-A’lam an-Nabula 18/319)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And when Imam Ibn Jarir at-Tabari died the Hanabillah refused and stopped him from being buring in the graveyard of the Muslims!!! So he had to be buried during the darkness of the night. (al-Bidayah Wan-Nihayah11/146, Zuhr al-Islam 2/40)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad bin Muhammad, who was a Shafi also came to the Madrasaah Nizamiyyah and started to deliver lectures and sermons. One day he started to have bad stomach pains and then eventually died. Then a whole group of people in the gathering also died. Later it was reveled that the Hanabillah had poisoned the food. (al-Kamil 11/376), Mir’atul Janan 3/382)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Ibn Athir writes, </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In the year 317H a major tribulation took place, Imam Abu Bakr al-Marwazi al-Hanbali and his student and the other people disagreed and differed with regards to the explanation and tafsir of the statement of Allah, “it is expected that your Lord will resurrect you to a praised station.” (Soorah al-Isra:79). So they differed so much with each other that they started fighting and killing one another, that a large number of people were killed on both sides.” (al-Bidayah Wan-Nihayah 11/162, al-Kamil 8/213) </em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And in Egypt which was known as the hub and home of the shafis and they considered it to be their homeland because Imam Shafi migrated there. When the ruler at the time died, they said this was punishment for him because he had allowed jurists and judges of the other madhabs to issue edicts and verdicts. (Tabaqat Shafiyyah 1/174, The laste Indian Hanafi Scholar Shaikh Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi also cited this in his book. Tarikh Dawat Wa Azimat 2/34)  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad bin Musa who died in the year 506H, was a Hanafi and the Qadhi of Damascus. He would say,</span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If I was the ruler I would take jizyah from the Shafis.” (al-Jauhar al-Mudhiyyah 2/136 and Meezan ul-Ei’tidaal 4/52)</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And the jizyah is like a tax the Muslim government takes from the non Muslims residing in the Muslim lands and here a Hanafi Qadhi is saying if he was in authority or power he would take this tax from the Shafi Muslims. What does this say about Muhammad bin Musa’s opinion about the Shafis when the jizyah is taken from the disbeleivers?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And some of them went on further to say, it was impermissible for Hanafis and Shafis to get married. Hence Shaikh Safkardi Hanafi said, </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is not possible (or appropriate) for a Hanafi to wed his daughter to a person who is upon the Shafi madhab however a Hanafi man can marry a Shafi girl.” (Fatawa al-Bazaziyyah 4/112 printed on the margins of al-Hidayah and also refer to al-Bahr ur-Raiq 2/51).</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And here Shaikh Safkardi Hanafi likened the situation to a Muslim man marrying a woman of the book and we also know a Muslim woman cannot marry a man from amogst the people of the book. Also note that he falls short of actually declaring it unlawful. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Also the hanafis, namely the hanafi jurist Abu Laith as-Samarqandi would say praying behind the Shafis is only permissible if the Shafi is not staunch or bigoted and he does not say concerning his Imam that he is inshallah a believer, that he does not majorly change the direction of Qiblah, if he does wudu if anything liquid is discharged other than his privates, if he has done wudu from a container that has 2 qullas of water and has impurities in it and that he does not raise his hands whilst going into ruku and rising from it. (Fatawa an-Nawazil pg.48-49, similar ideads have also been cited in Qadhi Khan 1/43, Radd al-Mukhtar 1/563-564, Fatawa Alamghiri with Qadhi Khan 1/84, Fatawa Tatarkhaniyyah 1/652 and also Fath ul-Qadir 1/313)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Shafis during their eras were also vehemently ferocious against the Hanafis and would also prohibit and declare it to be unlawful to pray behind the Hanafis just on the basis of differences in Fiqh. For example if the hanafi imam touched his wife whilst being in a state of wudu or if he did not pray in a clam manner. Imam Nawawi went onto say praying behind them under such circumstances was impermissible according to Shaikh Ibn Qaffal and this was also the position of the majority (of the scholars of the shafis) and this is what is correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say Shaikh Abu Ishaq Isfaraini said that a Shafi should never pray behind a hanafi, also they say if a Hanafi did wudu according to Shafi way then according to the majority (of the shafi) scholars praying behind such an Imam is correct. Shaikh Ibn Qaffal said his prayer is incorrect. Etc. Also statements of this kind have been cited from Shaikh al-Awdani and Shaikh al-Halimi who were from the major Shafi scholars. (The details of which can be seen in Sharh al-Muhazab of Imam Nawawi 1/203 and 4/289)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Hanbalis and Shafis argued and debated on issues of belief and this reached such heights that it was said by the Hanbalis, </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whoever is not a Hanbali is not a muslim.” (Siyar A’lam an-Nabula 18/508, Dhail Tabaqat al-Hanabillah 1/52)</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Hanbalis would say on the minbar, </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have been a Hanbali all of my life and so if I die I advise you, oh people become Hanbalis.” (Dhail Tabaqat al-Hanabillah 1/53 and Tabaqat ash-shafiyyah 3/117)</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The results of such fighting and argumentation led to the likes of Imam Juwaini writing his book agasint the Hanafi madhab ie his Mugith al-Khalq. He wrote numerous accounts of examples and incidences of partisanship and extreme bigotry which cannot be understood even in light of history.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Then Imam Ghazali followed suit and any remaining scope or possibilities he fulfilled and completed, thereby authoring his ‘al-Makhul’. Thereafter he presented it to his teacher Imam Juwaini, who after seeing it said, “You have buried me alive, you should have at least waited after my death.” (al-Munthazam 9/169)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the level of differences and disagreements that occurred between the madhabs and the level and extent this was rampant throughtout the Muslim Kindom. This also the reason why Imam Juwaini said all the Muslims should do taqlid of Imam Shafi (refer to Imam Juwainis Mugith al-Khalq) and this is why Zahid al-Kawthari, the arch Hanafi in his ta’assub and bigoted staunchness wrote a book refuting Imams Juwaini’s book. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the western Muslim Kingdom like Spain the Maliki Madhab was widespread and we have already mentioned in Part 1 how the Muslims of the area behaved with Imam Baqi Ibn Mukhlad. The Mailiks were not innocent of the shenanigans of the fight of the Madhabs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One head of the Malikis frabricated a hadith and attributed it to Abdullah Ibn Masood (RadhiAllahu Anhu) that he allegedly said he prayed behind all of the 4 Khaliphs and none of them raised their hands except for the first time!!! When it is known that Abdullab Ibn Masood (RadhiAllahu Anhu) died in 32H and hence therefore could not have prayed behind Ali (RadhiAllahu Anhu) and all of the years behind Uthman (RadhiAllahu Anhu)!!! Is this not extreme partisanship and staunch bigotry. (For for more details refer to Tartib al-Madarik 3/143, Lisaan al-Mizaan 1/458, Dhail al-La’ie pg.180) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The affair continued and they said if a Hanafi became a Shafi his testimony or him being a witness will not be accepted. (Refer to Durr al-Mukhtar, the Chapter of Testimony).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In its explanation they said, </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The individual who changes his madhab without a reason will be punished and the reason for this is the sin in his testimony being rejected. This is because it is not permissible for a lay person to change his madhab to a different one and the Hanafi and Shafi madhab are agreed upon this. It has also been mentioned if someone (ie a Hanafi) was to change his madhab to become a Shafi in order to get married, then we fear that if he was to die his iman would leave him.” (Radd al-Mukhtar 7/147, also refer to Fatawa Alamghiri 2/169 and Durr al-Mukhtar with Radd al-Mukhtar 4/80)</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The famous explainer of Hidayah, Amir Khatib al-Itqani who died in the year 758H. He mentions that in the year 747H he went to Damascus and one day the people were gathered to pray the Maghrib Salah and so they prayed. He says the Imam whilst going into ruku and whilst rising from it raised his hands, so I repeated my prayer and I said to the Imam. “Are you a Maliki or Shafi?” He replied that he was a Shafi.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So I said to him what harm was there if you did not do Raf ul-Yadain ie raise your hands so that the prayer of the congregation would not be null and void because when you raised your hands our prayers became null and void. (Taliqat as-Suniyyah Ala Fawaid al-Bahiyyah pg.50)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi did rebuke Amir al-Itqani for this horrendous opinion but in reality the hanafis over later years realised the Sunnah was overwhelming and have since had a more placid attitude. However this was not an isolated opinion as many other Hanafi scholars of that era, later and before also held similar opinions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For example the author of Khulasatul Kaidani mentions, if someone does Raf ul-Yadain, says Bismillah loudly in the prayer, says Amin loudly in the prayer and points his finger in the tashahud, then all of these affairs are from those which are haram ie unlawful (ie invalidate the prayer.). (Khulasatul Kaidani pg.15-16).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It must also be noted on the title page of Khulasatul Kaidani it says, </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“How do you know how to pray if you do not know Khulasatul Kaidani.”</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly others have said raising the hands ie Raf ul-Yadain is makruh in the prayer ie is it prohibitively disliked (refer to Radd ul-Mukhtar 1/654 and at-Tatarkhaniyyah 1/562).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Other said it is makruh tahrimi and according to the Hanafi principles this means it is haram, ie it is haram to do raise your hands in the prayer ie Raf ul-Yadain whilst going and rising from ruku. (Refer to Badai as-Sanai 1/548 and Sharh al-Muniyyah pg.347 and Faidh al-Bari 2/257)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">During the time of Shaikh Abu Hafs Kabeer the well known Hanafi scholar, a Hanafi man prayed behind someone and recited the Fatihah (in opposition to the hanafi madhab) behind the imam and he also raised his hands ie Raf ul-Yadain. When Shaikh Abu Hafs found out he went and complained to the ruler of the time, who in turn ruled for the Hanafi man to be publicly lashed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some people feeling sympathy for the Hanafi man approached Shaikh Abu Hafs and intervened and plead on his behalf. The Hanafi man eventually repented and hence was spared the publish lashing. (at-Tatarkhaniyyah 5/145)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Raising the hands was also the reason why the hanafis had animosity and hatred for Imam Bukhari. Imam Dhahabi mentions when Imam Bukhari began teaching the people, they would come to him and say the takbir for the iqamah once and also raise their hands ie Raf ul-Yadain according to the way of Ahlul Hadeeth. One of the Hanafi jurists Hareeth bin Abee al-Warqa thought this was causing discord and dissension in the community and hence began to oppose Imam Bukhari. (For more details refer to Siyar A’lam an-Nabula 12/465)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Then we have Isa bin Abu Bakr bin Ayub who died in the year 624H, he was considered to be a scholar and prolific orator, he was also the ruler of Damascus for 8 years. Shaikh Mulla Ali Qari Hanafi said about him that he was of virtuous faith and a blessing upon the deen. Isa bin Abu Bakr was also responsible for writing a refutation of Imam Khatib al-Baghdadi and he falsely attempted to prove that Imam Ibn al-Jawzi was a Hanafi. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is said about him that he was so staunch and bigoted that his father said to him one day, “How have you adopted and accepted the madhab of Abu Haneefah when all of your family are Shafis. He replied, “Do you not wish that at least one member of your family becomes a Muslim!!!!” (al-Fawaid al-Bahiyyah pg.152) of Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And how about the scholar of the sub continent, Muhiy ud deen Muhammad bin Muhammad who died in the year 789H who was a staunch and bigoted Hanafi. It has been said about him that when he went on Hajj, he would do an umrah daily and finish the recitation of the whole Quran on a daily basis. However he would shun, criticise and abuse Imam Shafi and he would consider this to be a form of worship. (Shudhrat udh-Dhahab 6/310)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">All of these disgareements, quarrelling, argumentation, bigotry, staunchness, animosity and enmity all in the name of madhabs and blindly following them. It is these traits that led to the 4 separate musallahs in the first house of Allaah ie Ka’aba. Dear Muslims how is it conceivable that based on our pristine and beautiful religion about which the people of the book would envy us led to such sects and factions in the first house of Allaah whilst making the most important aspect of worship ie the prayer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are also other differences in which they have shown extreme bigotry and scare monging tactics and thereby strongly refuting and rebuking the opinions of the other madhabs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For instance the one Hanafi elder and scholar, ie Shaikh Abdullah Balkhi said, </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whoever recites Fatihah behind the Imam, force soil into his mouth, and if not then break his teeth.” He also issued an edict that the one who recites fatihah behind the Imam then his is a fasiq and someone who does something haram. (Refer to Darr al-Mukhtar 1/544 and Fath ul-Qadeer 1/240) </em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What impression and understanding does this give to the hanafi muqallid with regards to the other madhabs and people who believe one must recite fatihah behind the Imam, how comfortable would they feel if they prayed in their masjid!!!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Also what do we do about the positions of the other Imams and madhabs like for example Imams Shafi, Ibn Mubarak, Ishaq ibn Rahawaihah, Awzai, Abu Thawr, Bukhari and many others who heled the opinion that Fatihah should be recited behind the Imam. Are they worthy of soil being put in their mouths, their teeth being broken and fire put into their mouths??? Subhanallah, The Imams Bukhari and Baihaqi even wrote books on this topic obligating the reciting Fatihah behind the Imam.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Unfortunately this is the result of blind bigoted partisanship and such opinions lead to this level of sectarianism which ultimately lead to discord, chaos and dissention in the Ummah and the end goal of all of this is that a Muslim is prohibited and restricted from following and obeying the Book and the Sunnah. May Allaah keep us upon the Quran and Hadeeth. Ameen.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The well known historian and traveller of Spain ie Andalus Ibn Jubair who died in the year 614H. In the year 579H he travelled to Makkah and said, “From the Imams of Ahlus Sunnah (meaning some people were not from Ahlus Sunnah) the Shafis would pray first and they were the followers of the Abasid Imams and their place was at Muqam Karim, thereafter the Malikis would pray. However at the time of Maghrib due to the constraints of time all of them would pray with their own perspective Imams all at the same time (ie 4 imams all leading the Maghrib prayer.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This was very difficult as each individual would be very attentive to the sound and voice of their own mu’adhain and Imam. This is because they would hear 4 takbirs from the 4 Imams and the worshippers would get very confused and lost. Sometimes they would do ruku and sujud according to the takbirs of the hanafis, malikis, shafis and hanbalis and sometimes their own imam and sometimes they would say the Salam at the end according to another imams salutation etc.” (End of Ibn Jubairs words) (Rihlah Ibn Jubair 78)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers can you imagine what confusion and disorientation there would have been whilst trying to pray in such an atmosphere. In our daily lives it becomes difficult enough based on the background noise can you imagine what the atmosphere would have been like. What can be more of an example of partisanship and bigotry than this in the house of Allaah, this is what sectarianism and madhabism always eventually leads to and this is also the situation in our times. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What is even more disturbing and worrying can you imagine what level of Khushu, Khudhu and concentration some of these worshippers must have had when they were praying in such an atmosphere, knowing very well the prayer would be the first thing to be judged on the day of judgement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In part of this series in relation to question no.4 where the questioner asks about hundreds and thousands of scholars refining and correcting a madhab from within. Indeed then this is nothing but a fallacy as most often the scholars continued to defend their madhab irrespective of the positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For example the issue of 4 imams leading prayers in a single masjid, an emiment Hanafi scholar Shaikh Mulla Ali Qari said in defence of this, </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If there is an Imam for every madhab like there is in our time, then it is better to pray behind the Imam of your Madhab (only) whther he prays earlier or later. This is because the general Muslims and the majority of the believers from the Harmain, Quds, Misr and Sham have adopted and preferred this way and no attention is paid to those who oppose this.” (Radd al-Mukhtar 1/564) and Allamah Shami even goes onto give evidence for the permissibility of numerous jamahs in the Haram. (Radd al-Mukhtar 1/553)<br />
</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And we have not even began to talk about the current day issues of bigotry and staunchness and if this was the case we would run into volumes. There have been cases of severe physical abuse upon people who changed from hanafis to Ahlul Hadeeth, masjids being destroyed and burnt, scholars being shot and injured, houses being burnt and destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Masjids banning the Ahlul Hadeeth, washing the places where an Ahlul Hadeeth prayed Salah, breaking the Ahlul Hadeeths fingers whilst they supplicated with them in the tashahud etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In Egypt an Imam did not recite the Bismillah loudly so someone during the prayer said your prayer is Baatil, so repeat your prayer. So the prayer was started again. Similarly the Shafis once prayed the fajr prayer behind the Hanafis and Malikis on jumuah and then they repeated the prayer only because the Hanafi imam did not recite Soorah Sajdah in the prayer. (Refer to the monthly journal al-Furqan April issue no.44 pg.55, 1994)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise Allamah Rashid Ridha mentions that, </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“A Hanafi from Afghanistan heard that a man whilst praying recited the Fatihah behind the Imam, so a person punched him so hard in this chest or stomach that he fell down in sheer agony, pain and nearly died from it. I have also been informed that someone broke a persons finger just because he was moving it during tashahud. In the last century the people of Tarbulus were engrossed in so much partisanship and sectarianism to such an extreme level that some of the Shafis went to the main mufti and asked him to divide the masjid into 2 halves one for us and one for the Hanafis because their jurists (ie the Hanafi faqihs) consider us to be Ahludh-Dhimmah. The issue of a Hanafi man marrying a Shafi woman also arose. Some argued that he cannot marry her because the Shafi woman says I am believer inshallah therefore she doubts her imam and others said he can marry her by reasoning and say she can be understood to be from the people of Dhimmah.” (End of his words) (Refer to Muqaddimah al-Mughni 1/18)<br />
</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The late indian Hanafi scholar, Sayyid Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi has also cited the breaking of the finger whilst moving it during Tashahud by some the afghani tribes and he concludes the people only did this because this what they were taught ie that Khulasatul Kaidani teaches that is haram to move the finger in tashahud. (When The Waves of Iman Came pg.213-214 in the footnotes.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sha’arani said,</span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Most of the Muqallideen have very evil thoughts about the other Imams. It has been relayed to us that the Hanafis and Shafis of Wara Nahr abandon fasting in the month of Ramadhan so that they maintain their energy whilst refuting each others evidences and proofs.” (Meezan al-Kubra 1/43)</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This way of bigoted staunchness was not the way of the salaf, they still had mutual respect for each other and differing opinions. There are numerous examples from during the times of the companions who despite differences would still respect, listen and pray behind each other. Likewise and similarly if they saw or found someone from amongst their companions they would advise them by giving them evidences from the Quran and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So, despite the claim the refutation of those who do not follow the 4 madhabs, where is the refutation of some of the grave and misguided notions as cited above!!!</span></p>
