				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Jalal al-Din Ahmad Hashimi Ja’fari Banarasi (d.1279/1863)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was born in 1221H/1806 and hailed from the surrounding area of Banaras. He was born into a family of learned scholars and his father Shaykh Abdul A’la (d.1274) was also a learned man. A year after the Shaykh’s birth his mother passed away. His lineage as an Hashmite can be traced back. (Tazkirrah al-A’la, 3)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He sought knowledge from his father and also from Shaykh Ahmadullah Muhaddith Banarasi. He then travelled to Delhi and sought knowledge from the scholars, which included the well known scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith, Shaykh Shah Muhammad Isma’il Shahid (InshaAllah) (d.1246/1831) and Shaykh Abd al-Haq Muhaddith Banarasi (d.1286/1869). He studied important texts as well as the books of hadith with the aforementioned scholars of hadith and also received his ijazah from them. It was these two scholars who instilled the love of Amal bil-Hadith and following of the Sunnah in him. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 345)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Abd al-Hayy al-Hasani said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He received sanad in hadith from Shaykh Abd al-Haqq bin Fadhalullah al-Uthmani al-Niyutayni and he followed his way in rejecting taqlid and acting on the apparent texts. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir, 7:136)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had a powerful memory, as such that he would memorise a Juzz during the day in Ramadhan and then recite it in the evening in Tarawih. He also participated in the 1857 mutiny war but evaded capture. (Tazkirrah Ulama Hindh, 41; Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 346; Marqa’a Banaras, 244).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Despite being a scholar of the Din, he was an exceptional debater. He was a defender of the Sunnah and subdued innovations, and as such he didn’t tolerate anything contradicting the Sunnah. He debated with Mawlana Khurram Ali on the issue of reciting Fatihah behind the Imam and also authored the book, Fatihah al-Sawab Fi Qir’ah Fatihah al-Kitab in 1256H, which he translated into Urdu as, Zubdah al-Bab. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 345).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also authored, Zubdah al-Qawanin, Inbasat Ibarah al-Kafiyyah bil-Bayan al-Shafiyyah, Farahing Ikhwan al-Safa, Qawa’id Urdu, al-Qawl al-Mansur, Rakah Tarawih. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 346).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This outstanding scholar of the Ahl al-Hadith died in 1279H/1863CE.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(See, Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 345+; Tazkirrah al-A’la, 3+; Tazkirrah Ulama Hindh, 41; Marqa’a Banaras, 244; Tarajim Ulama Hadith Banaras, 71)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the existence of a remarkable scholar of the Ahl al-Hadith who died over 150 years ago, which again repudiates the tedious claim that the Ahl al-Hadith have only been around for 100 years. Likewise, it also answers the modern day understanding that Salafiyyah is a movement that started in the early 1900’s by Shaykh Muhammad Rashid Ridha and Muhammad Abduh, when we clearly have a scholar of the Ahl al-Hadith who died in the middle 19<sup>th</sup> century.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi says in Ma&#8217;yar al-Haq, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Taqlid for the layman which is wajib is taqlid mutlaq i.e. the taqlid of a mujtahid from amongst Ahl al-Sunnah without specification&#8230;&#8221; Then he goes onto to say the second form of taqlid; Qism thani, Mubah (permissible) which is taqlid of a specific madhab.&#8221; </em>(p.75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a huge difference between this and Taqlid Shakhsi which is taqlid of a specific individual unrestrictedly whether an Imam or a mujtahid this is the first thing to be noted. Shaikh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi in his Fatwa answers for both the first and second type because taqlid Shaksi is encompassed both what which he declared wajib and mubah. this was the first indicating factor. Let us assume his retraction was for the second type and let us also assume this was and is taqlid shakhsi.  However we presented the first question from the chapter from Kitab al-Taqlid wal-Ijtihad where in Shaykh Muhaddih Mian Nazir Hussain was asked,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Question: Some scholars says taqlid is FARDH and they present the ayah Fasalau Ahl al-Zikr&#8230; and he replied this statement is incorrect also due to their understanding of the ayah. He further said, some of the scholars using this ayah to mean the Imams and proving taqlid is FARDH from this ayah is is EXTREMELY WRONG and a GROSS ERROR</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here is where it gets interesting, the very same people who promote taqlid of the mujtahid of Imam use this very ayah Fasalau Ahl al-Zikr for the layman to make taqlid of an Alim, but here Shaikh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi is categorically saying it is wrong. Furthermore, he says these scholars using the ayah Ulil Amr to mean MUJTAHIDS and saying taqlid of the mujtahidin is FARDH is totally incorrect (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So he refute both types of Qism Awwal and Qism Thani, specifically using the word mujtahid of Ahl al-Sunnah in Qism al-Awwal!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we cited the conclusion of Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain to this answer wherein he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In summary taqlid is not evidenced from any ayah of the Quran nor from any hadith and neither did any Imam permit anyone from doing taqlid of them. Numerous beneficial treatises have been authored in the censure and rebuking of taqlid and if anyone wishes to refer to the reasons of its futility in detail, then they can refer to these treatise.”</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Upon reading the words of the Shaykh he refutes taqlid and saying it is not evidenced. How can it be claimed that he said one form of taqlid was wajib. We also mentioned the language of the people of taqlid was used to explained to them as the example cited in the first Qism is in actual fact Ittiba as Shaykh Muhammad Nazir himself refutes the notion of taqlid being wajib due to it being evidenced from the ayah Fasalu Ahl al-Zikr. Then he goes onto a cite a beautiful passage from Shaikh Abd al-Aziz Dehlawi from his Tafsir Azizi refuting taqlid and their deductions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The taqlid he says is wajib,  he cites the words of Shaikh Shah Waliullah from Iqd al-Jid are essentially ittiba i.e. ittiba or the narrations, but he uses the word taqlid to define this method, which was again the common language as we know very well that asking a scholar a question or a fatwa etc is not understood or considered taqlid of the scholar, and it is therefore sometimes of utmost importance to have lateral understanding based on the overall view of the scholars of hadith. It is like Imam Juwayni defining taqlid to follow the reports from the Prophet being taqlid in his Waraqat!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh further defines this taqlid mutual which is wajib that if the ruling conforms to the Sunnah it is accepted and if it opposes it, it will be rejected, then is precisely what the Ahl al-Hadith do even in this day and age and none of the Scholars of hadith have called this taqlid? As for the Shaykh&#8217;s statement on (1:179) that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The ignorant and the one who does not know, the shariah has made it obligatory and mandatory upon him to ask and learn the issues, meaning that he should ask Ahl al-Zikr, whether the scholar is well learned, whether he is a graduate or an undergraduate because Ahl al-Zikr here is general. So when he has an issue he should ask, whether it is from one scholar or from two scholars from amongst Ahl al-Zikr, in summary he should ask the one who he is satisfied and content with. Then when he has asked one or two (scholars) he excludes himself from a problematic position which does not leave anything upon him from the shariah and there is absolute ijma on this.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is perfect where the Shaykh clearly explains a lay person can ask one or more scholars and this is contrary to taqlid Shakhsi, or Qism Mubah (for arguments sake) as this is proceeds from the recantation and then the Shaykh explains the above without saying it is the permissible or wajib form of taqlid. The Shaykh then quotes from Mussalim al-thabut and his saying a muqallid acting on the SAYING of a scholar has fulfilled his research. He goes onto explain and answer this himself. Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain avidly cites this as a proof adjacent the ardent muqallids who were engrossed in Taqlid Shakhsi and not Ittiba.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here is another point, if the recantation is not from the Qism Awwal i.e. taqlid of a mujtahid then what sense does it make for him to say on (1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Some of the scholars using this ayah to mean the imams and proving taqlid is FARDH from this ayah is is EXTREMELY WRONG and a GROSS ERROR&#8221;</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;and using this ayah to say taqlid of the Aimah Mujtahidin is FARDH is totally wrong.&#8221;</em> (1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">bearing in mind he has already recanted from the Mubah type i.e. of taqlid Shakhsi i.e. taqlid of a specific madhab, as there are Qism Awwal and Qism Thani???</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">lastly the last part of the answer the Shaykh left general i.e. taqlid as just taqlid without specifying it, if anyone attempts to specify this fatwa of the Shaykh Fatawa Naziriyyah they must do so with clear, precise words of the Shaykh and the general must be left general if unless specified and not fom before a recantation. as a reminder he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In summary taqlid is not evidenced from any ayah of the Quran nor from any hadith and neither did any Imam permit anyone from doing taqlid of them.”</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be noted we cited the view of the direct student of Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain denying any form of taqlid being wajib, quoting the view of people way later who are no where near the stature of the students of Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain is misrepresentation of the view of the Ahl al-Hadith, none of the major scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith say this form is taqlid and that it is wajib they simply call it Ittiba, they done so for centuries. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It would interesting to note what Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi said in his other books, <em>Thabut Haq al-Haqiq, Daf&#8217;e al-Balwa </em>and<em> Falah al-Wali Ba-Ittiba al-Nabi</em> all three refuting the idea of taqlid and promoting Ittiba, inshAllah if time allows more discussions will be cited from them. There also some general words non specific in the sheikhs <em>Makatib Naziriyyah</em>, again not much direct significance to this discussion. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">more to follow inshAllah.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1326H &#8211; 1908c</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Muhammad Tanzil al-Siddiqi al-Hussaini</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Dr. Abu Nasr Fazal Hussain bin Qadi Farakh Hussain bin Qadi Wahid Ali bin Shah Ramadan Ali Ja’fari Mehdawani was a great scholar, an accomplished Doctor, writer and poet.

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Farakh Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Farakh Hussain possessed a lot of knowledge and was an expert in Arabic, Persian and Urdu. He was born in 1242H in the Mehdawans. He would indulge in Persian and Urdu poetry. He married three times, his first marriage was to the daughter of Shaikh Ja’far Faruqi of Bhawalpur. He had a son from this marriage and he was Shaykh Fazal Hussain. Qadi Farakh Hussain died in 1306H. (refer to, Kulliyat Fakhar: p.59, Tazkirrah Mehdawanu: p.34 and Tazkirrah Ulama Bihar: 2:204)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Birth of Shaykh Fazal Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Fazal Hussain was born on the 27<sup>th</sup> of Muharram 1271H corresponding to 1854H in the Mehdawans.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Seeking Knowledge</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He sought knowledge from Shaykh Muhammad Arif Peshawari and Shaykh Abdul Hamid Bihari. He later travelled to Delhi and sought knowledge from the Musnad of the time Shaikh al-Kul Mian Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi and studied hadith and tafsir with him. He also learnt medicine from Hakim Abdul Majid Dehlawi whilst in Delhi.  </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">After Seeking Knowledge</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He started to practise as a Doctor and was counted from amongst the accomplished Doctors of Bihar. He continued to reside in Muzaffarpur and and also set up his clinic there. He was also an avid writer and was a weekly columnist in the Weekly newspaper, ‘Taj’ which would be published in Patna.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Poet</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was very interested in poetry and would recite poems in both Persian and Urdu. He would use the poetic name of Hashr</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">His Books</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain wrote books on different disciplines some of them were,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(1) al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a biography of Shaykh al-Kul Sayyid Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi. This is considered to be Shaykh Fazal Hussains most important and famous work. It is approximately 367 pages and printed by Matba’a Akbari in Agra in 1326H/1908c and it has been reproduced a number of times thereafter. Dr. Muzaffar Iqbal said concerning this book, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This biography was authored based on modern principles and is worthy to be considered from the foremost of biographies in the Urdu language. The wording and presentation is highly reverential and the passages are clear, simple and continuous.”</em> (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857c until 1914c: p.200)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(2) al-Sufiyyah wal-Tasawwuf</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh mentioned this book himself in ‘Hayat Ba’dal Mamat’ when he wrote, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Sufiyyah wal Tasawwuf’ is a specific treatise I wrote wherein I discuss Tasawwuf in detail. The avid reader can thus distinguish and differentiate every claimant of Tasawwuf whether they are even actuals Sufi’s or not.”</em> (al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat: p.144).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the words of the Shaykh it is indicative this book was already published before al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat was authored. However, we have not seen this book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Tamaddun Arab Aur Hadith Afak (Arab Civilisation and the Hadith of Afak)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is a substantive and detailed answer to the well known French orientalist Museo Layban’s book, ‘Arab Civilisation’ wherein he attempted to misrepresent the hadith of Afak and other doubts. The columnist who reviewed the book in the newspaper, ‘Taj’ of Bankipur of Patna on the 27<sup>th</sup> of October 1902 said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is our view that such a work should be translated and spread in the Arab world.”</em> (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.68)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Risalah Fiqh Wa Hadith</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh briefly outlines the knowledge of jurisprudence and hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Kitab al-Kuhl</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh discusses and debates in detail, the great evil, catastrophic harm and unlawfulness of alcohol. It is 177 pages and was published in 1902c. Dr. Muzaffar Iqbal wrote, “The reality of alcohol and its unlawfulness are scrutinised in detail. The editor of ‘Taj’ of Bankipur Patna, Allamah Fazal Haq Azad has published a review of the book in the issue dated 13<sup>th</sup> October 1902c. (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.216)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(6) Qunut Fi’l Nazila</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is concerning making Qunut at times of calamities and disasters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was a brief overview of the writings of the Shaykh and there are perhaps other works we do not know about.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Children</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain married the daughter of Muhammad Akram Faruqi. He had five children, 3 sons and 2 daughters. The sons were Ali Akbar, Ahmad Hussain and Ghulam Muhammad.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">His Death</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Dr. Abu Nasr Fazal Hussain spent his life based on knowledge and its practical example. He spent time practising medicine as well as poetry. He died at the age of 55 in 1326H / 1908H in Lucknow and he was also buried there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat, Nuzhatul Khawatir: 8:360-361, Hadiqah al-Insab: 1:78-88, Ashab Ilm Wa Fadal: p.110, Tazkirrah Ulama Bihar: 1:224, The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.68, 199-200, 216, Kulliyat Fakhar: p.151-152, Tazkirrah Mehdawanu: p.11-40, 70, 177, Hayat Nazir: p.199)</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Muhaddith Abdur-Razzaaq</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(Rahimahullah)</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Part 11</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">By</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Shaikh Irshad ul-Haq al-Athari (Hafidhahullah)</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Series compilers, Translated and Annotated </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">The hanafee’s say Imaam Abdur-Razzaaq, the author Musannaf of Abur-Razzaaq was a shee’ah just because narrated a weak hadeeth of Jaabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) in which he mentioned the Messenger if Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) was created from light.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Shaikh Irshaad ul-Haqq said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">We need to look at what shee’ah means in the terminology of the Salaf as according to the Mutaqaddimeen (earlier scholars) shee’aism meant just giving precedence to Alee over Uthmaan and Alee was correct in his wars and those who opposed him were wrong and according to the terminology of the mutakhireen (later scholars) shee’aism is pure and clear rafdh (ie rejection of the companions). (Tahdheeb ut-Tahdheeb (1/94).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">The scholars of hadeeth have also mentioned the period the time of the earlier scholars (the mutadaqqimeen) finished in 300H and Imaam Abdur-Razzaaq died in 211H (Tahdheeb (6/314) so he was from amongst the earlier scholars. The shee’ism according to scholars of this period was understood to mean giving precedence to Alee over Uthmaan (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) and the details of this can be seen in Tahdheeb, as-Siyar, Meezaan and Tadhkirratul-Huffaadh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">This type of shee’ism was found amongst the earlier scholars. Allaamah Dhahabee has mentioned from Haafidh Abul-Fadhal Suleimaanee that the people who considered Alee to be more superior, were from the likes of Imaam A’mash, Imaam Abu Haneefah, Imaam Shu’bah, Imaam Abdur-Razzaaq, Imaam Abdur-Rahmaan bin Abee Haatim the author of al-Jarh wat-Ta’deel and also Ubaidullaah bin Moosaa. (Meezaan (2/588),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Furthermore, the reality of the affair is that Imaam Abdur-Razzaaq retracted from this earlier form of Shee’ism (of just giving Alee superiority over Uthmaan). Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal did not accept the narrations of Ubaidullaah bin Moosaa al-Absee who was a narrator of the six books of hadeeth and who was also trustworthy (see Taqreeb (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.227</span>) on the basis of this shee’ism. So when Imaam Ahmad was asked, ”Why do you take narrations from Abdur-Razzaaq yet to do not take narrations from Ubaidullaah bin Moosaa?” So Imaam Ahmad replied,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Abdur-Razzaaq retracted from this (ie. This shee’ism) (See Tahdheeb (7/53) as narrated by Haafidh Abu Muslim Baghdaadee)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">From this we find Imaam Abdur-Razzaaq retracted from this earlier form of shee’ism. For further details see Kitaab al-Ellal Wa Ma’arifatur-Rijaal (1/256) of Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal. (TN:- This book has been checked and printed by Shaikh Waseeullaah Abbaas.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Haafidh Dhahabee addressed Imaam Abdur-Razzaaq as Haafidh al-Kabeer (the Major Preserver).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Imaam Yahyaa ibn Ma’een said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Even if Abdur-Razzaaq was to apostate, I would not abandon taking ahadeeth from him.” (Tahdheeb (6/314)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Imaam Abdur-Razzaaq himself said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “Ar-Raafidhee Kaafir (The Raafidhee’s are disbelievers) and my heart has ever been satisfied or inclined to give Alee precedence over Abu Bakr and Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma).” (see Tahdheeb and Meezaan)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Imaam Abdur-Razzaaq after narrating a hadeeth of Mu’awiyyah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “And we act upon this.” (Musannaf Abdur-Razzaaq (3/249)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">The hanafee scholar Dhafar Ahmad Uthmaanee mentions the following chapter heading in his book Inhaa as-Sakan also known as Qawaa’id Uloom al-Hadeeth, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The shee’ism of Abdur-Razzaaq and his retraction from it.” (Qawaa’id (pg.385)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">To bury this false claim of Imaam Abdur-Razzaaq being shee’ah The Imaam himself said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“I swear by Allaah my heart has never been satisfied in giving Alee precedence over Abu Bakr and Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma). May the mercy of Allaah be upon Abu Bakr, May the mercy of Allaah be upon Umar, May the mercy of Allaah be upon Uthmaan and May the mercy of Allaah be upon Alee (Radhiallaahu Anhuma). The one who does not love them is not a believer and I in action, love all of them.” (al-Ellal Wa Ma’rifatur-Rijaal (1/256) (NOTE:- the Imaam swore by Allaah)</span></em></p>
