<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the greatest blessings and favours of Allaah upon his creation is that he instils a lot of love in their heart for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). The people of iman have a great desire and fervour to know and understand the ways and means they can achieve the love of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and that it remains continuous</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With the aid of Allaah, the attempt is to know such means and ways in loving Allah and then to convey this to others, so that they benefit from them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One should not forget the obligation of loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). It is obligatory upon every Muslim that he loves the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) more than anything from amongst his love for anything from the creation. An evidence for this is what we find from the hadith which Imam Bukhari has transmitted from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;Verily the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, &#8220;I swear by the one in whose hand my soul is in, none of you is a believer up until I am more beloved to you than your father and child.&#8221; </i>(Sahih al-Bukhari, The Book of Iman, Chapter Loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is part of Iman no.14 1/58)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith which elucidates this point is what Imaam Muslim has transmitted from Anas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><i>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, &#8220;No one is a believer until I am more beloved to him than his family, wealth and the whole of mankind.&#8221; </i>(Sahih Muslim, The Book of Iman, Chapter The obligation of loving the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) more than ones family, father, child and more than mankind, no.69 (44) 1/68)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the Quran warns us of the punishment for every individual who loves his father, child, brothers, wives, tribe, wealth, business or houses more than jihad and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). Allaah the most high said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>&#8220;Say, [O Muhammad], &#8220;If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jihad in His cause, then wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.&#8221; (Soorah at-Taubah:24)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafidh Ibn Kathir said in explanation of this ayah, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;If these things are more beloved to you, more than Allah, the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and doing jihad in the way of Allah, then await for the type of punishment that will befall you.&#8221; (Tafsir Ibn Kathir 2/378)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Qurtubi said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;This ayah elucidates the obligation of loving Allah and his Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and there is no difference of opinion in that, furthermore this love has precedence over loving anything else.&#8221; (Tafsir Qurtubi 8/95)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When a person understands this and he places before him the reality that his iman will be incomplete up until he loves the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) more than anything from the creation. In such an instance with the aid of Allah love and passion for the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will increase further in its intensity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This reality is clearly proven from a Hadith which Imam Bukhari has transmitted from Abdullah. </span><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to always remember Allah and also seek the fruits and merits of loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is not in need of our love at all. Allaah the most merciful has excluded him and exalted him from this. We attain and achieve great blessings and fruits in this world and in the hereafter by loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). Loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is from the means of tasting the sweetness of Imam in this world.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim have transmitted a narration from Anas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;There are three things which if a person possesses are from the sweetness of Iman, that one loves Allaah and his Messenger more than anything, whoever he loves he does so for the sake of Allaah and he dislikes returning to disbelief just as he would dislike be thrown in the fire.&#8221;</i> (Sahih al-Bukhari 1/60 no.16, Sahih Muslim 1/66 no.67 (43)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore from the mercy of Allaah is that the one who loves the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will achieve a great reward due to being neighbour in Paradise which has everlasting and eternal bounties.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim have transmitted a narration from Abdullah ibn Mas&#8217;ood (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;A man came to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and said, &#8220;Oh Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) what do you say about a man who loves a nation but he is not able to meet them?&#8221; The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) replied, &#8220;A person will be with who he loves.&#8221; (Sahih al-Bukhari 10/557 no.6169, Saheeh Muslim 4/2034 no.165 (2640)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The saying of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;will be with who he loves.&#8221; means he will be with him in Paradise.</i> (Refer to Umdah tul-Qari 22/197)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When a person is aware and knows the great benefits and blessing of loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) he will always remember him and never forget him. With the grace of Allaah, showers of love for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will emanate from his heart which will expand and increase because the human disposition is such that it loves beneficial things and so it will attempt to attain and achieve this as much as possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One should never neglect the favours of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).</span> <span style="color: #000000;">It has been instilled in a humans nature that he loves the individual who shares his times of sadness, sorrow, and pain and who also tries to help him in this regard and also tries to benefit him with good. It is famous from olden times that, &#8216;Love has been instilled in the hearts for those who do favours.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in attempting to inform and highlight every beneficial and good thing to the Muslim Ummah he would emphatically struggle. Allaah the most high himself has testified to this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>&#8220;Th</b></span><span style="color: #000000;"><b>ere has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. Grievous to him is what you suffer; [he is] concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful.&#8221; (Soorah at-Taubah:128)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) wishing good and looking out for the Ummah was to such an extent that he would be sad and upset due to the people not accepting the truth (about Islaam) and he would be so engrossed in this it was feared he would end up losing his life. The Lord of all knowing himself said about this</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>&#8220;Then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them, [O Muhammad], if they do not believe in this message, [and] out of sorrow.&#8221; (Soorah al-Kahf:6)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to this Allaah has also prohibited us from being severely upset over someone not accepting Islaam, he said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Then is one to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive so he considers it good [like one rightly guided]? For indeed, Allah sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So do not let yourself perish over them in regret. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what they do.&#8221; (Soorah al-Faatir:8)</span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I clarified this in the previous parts this method, of asking a reputable scholar of the Sunnah a question and following it based on evidence is not taqlid and this is undoubtedly the mainstream view of the Ahl al-Hadith and inshallah we shall bring further names to support this claim. In comparison to the senior, well known and famous scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith, the younger students who are virtually unknown have little significant value. Let us look at what Shaikh Abdullah Rawpari (d.1384/1964) said. However before we progress and present Shaikh Abdullah Rawpari&#8217;s words let us look at some of the other members of his family said and again we shall keep this brief.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Wahhab Rawpari, who is is from the Shaykhs grandson cousin said in the introduction Taqlid or Ulaa Deoband,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This group only follows i.e. does ittiba of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and does not do taqlid of any specific Imam or Mujtahid because all taqlidi methodologies were formulated in later years and this is why, when the concept of taqlid shakhsi reached its peak that is when divisions and sectarianism took hold.&#8221;</em> (Taqlid Aur Ulama Deoband p.11)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Although he talks and refers to taqlid shakhsi, it shows 2 things, the non existent of the concept of this taqlid wajib idea and he also further clarifies this in a footnote in the book which we shall cite later inshAllah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdullah Rawpari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;On this basis accepting the Quran and Hadith is is not taqlid nor is accepting Ijma taqlid..(he goes onto say) accepting the statement of a companion is also not taqlid because it is similar to the hadith. accepting the statement of Imam Abu Hanifah or Imam Shafi&#8217;i without the knowing the evidence if taqlid (this is exactly like taking the statement of a mujtahid without evidence). So we have two possibilities the first is, an issues arises and the individual himself is a scholar, then he should research the Quran, Hadith and the statement of the companions for an answer and if he finds it, it is good. If he cannot then he should retort to the view of the Imams and the scholars of the Salaf which is prominent from the angle of the evidence and take it. If at times he has to do ijtihad and deductions then he should not go outside of the view of the salaf. If he is a lay person then according to the command in the ayah, Fasalau Ahl al-Ziki In Kuntum la ta&#8217;lamun, as the people of zikr if you not know. </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">The second type or possibility is to hold the inherent mindset to follow and accept the statement of only one Imam and that he would seek out and only search for his statement in every issue. If he is a scholar he does the same i.e. to find the statement of that particular imam and if he is a lay person he ask the scholars of his madhab as well as others what is the view of the imam in such and such statement,</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The first type is the methodology of the Ahl al-Hadith and this was also the way and mindset of the salaf, hence Shah Waliullah has detailed this discussion in his treatise Insaf and i have also mentioned this in detail in my book, Ta&#8217;rif Ahl al-Hadith part 1, and also in this treatise and in a summarised form in other works, whether anyone calls this way TAQLID OR ITTIBA.&#8221;</em> (Taqlid Aur Ulama Deoband p.13-14)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Wahhab Rawpari puts a footnote at the end at the bottom of page 14,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Some people call this taqlid however what is correct is that this is ITTIBA because this methodology is on the basis and in accordance with evidence and following based on evidence is ittiba and not taqlid.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">More can be cited from Shaikh Abdullah Rawpari&#8217;s work and the scholars of this learned family highlighting the concept of Ittiba and not taqlid as we ascertained is the mainstream of the elders of the Ahl al-Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If one looks at the books of Shaykh Abdul Karim Zaydan, both in Jam&#8217;e al-Usul and al-Wajiz Fi Usul al-Fiqh we will find he cites both views and says in both books that this issue is very simple and that Allah has obligated the believer to to Ittiba of Allah and his Messenger and the lay person asks a mujtahid if he does not know. There is no mention of the latter form being taqlid. This is what the Ahl al-Hadith are upon and also the view of the mainstream scholars of Ahl al-Hadith</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">more to follow inshAllah</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi says in Ma&#8217;yar al-Haq, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Taqlid for the layman which is wajib is taqlid mutlaq i.e. the taqlid of a mujtahid from amongst Ahl al-Sunnah without specification&#8230;&#8221; Then he goes onto to say the second form of taqlid; Qism thani, Mubah (permissible) which is taqlid of a specific madhab.&#8221; </em>(p.75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a huge difference between this and Taqlid Shakhsi which is taqlid of a specific individual unrestrictedly whether an Imam or a mujtahid this is the first thing to be noted. Shaikh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi in his Fatwa answers for both the first and second type because taqlid Shaksi is encompassed both what which he declared wajib and mubah. this was the first indicating factor. Let us assume his retraction was for the second type and let us also assume this was and is taqlid shakhsi.  However we presented the first question from the chapter from Kitab al-Taqlid wal-Ijtihad where in Shaykh Muhaddih Mian Nazir Hussain was asked,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Question: Some scholars says taqlid is FARDH and they present the ayah Fasalau Ahl al-Zikr&#8230; and he replied this statement is incorrect also due to their understanding of the ayah. He further said, some of the scholars using this ayah to mean the Imams and proving taqlid is FARDH from this ayah is is EXTREMELY WRONG and a GROSS ERROR</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here is where it gets interesting, the very same people who promote taqlid of the mujtahid of Imam use this very ayah Fasalau Ahl al-Zikr for the layman to make taqlid of an Alim, but here Shaikh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi is categorically saying it is wrong. Furthermore, he says these scholars using the ayah Ulil Amr to mean MUJTAHIDS and saying taqlid of the mujtahidin is FARDH is totally incorrect (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So he refute both types of Qism Awwal and Qism Thani, specifically using the word mujtahid of Ahl al-Sunnah in Qism al-Awwal!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we cited the conclusion of Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain to this answer wherein he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In summary taqlid is not evidenced from any ayah of the Quran nor from any hadith and neither did any Imam permit anyone from doing taqlid of them. Numerous beneficial treatises have been authored in the censure and rebuking of taqlid and if anyone wishes to refer to the reasons of its futility in detail, then they can refer to these treatise.”</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Upon reading the words of the Shaykh he refutes taqlid and saying it is not evidenced. How can it be claimed that he said one form of taqlid was wajib. We also mentioned the language of the people of taqlid was used to explained to them as the example cited in the first Qism is in actual fact Ittiba as Shaykh Muhammad Nazir himself refutes the notion of taqlid being wajib due to it being evidenced from the ayah Fasalu Ahl al-Zikr. Then he goes onto a cite a beautiful passage from Shaikh Abd al-Aziz Dehlawi from his Tafsir Azizi refuting taqlid and their deductions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The taqlid he says is wajib,  he cites the words of Shaikh Shah Waliullah from Iqd al-Jid are essentially ittiba i.e. ittiba or the narrations, but he uses the word taqlid to define this method, which was again the common language as we know very well that asking a scholar a question or a fatwa etc is not understood or considered taqlid of the scholar, and it is therefore sometimes of utmost importance to have lateral understanding based on the overall view of the scholars of hadith. It is like Imam Juwayni defining taqlid to follow the reports from the Prophet being taqlid in his Waraqat!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh further defines this taqlid mutual which is wajib that if the ruling conforms to the Sunnah it is accepted and if it opposes it, it will be rejected, then is precisely what the Ahl al-Hadith do even in this day and age and none of the Scholars of hadith have called this taqlid? As for the Shaykh&#8217;s statement on (1:179) that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The ignorant and the one who does not know, the shariah has made it obligatory and mandatory upon him to ask and learn the issues, meaning that he should ask Ahl al-Zikr, whether the scholar is well learned, whether he is a graduate or an undergraduate because Ahl al-Zikr here is general. So when he has an issue he should ask, whether it is from one scholar or from two scholars from amongst Ahl al-Zikr, in summary he should ask the one who he is satisfied and content with. Then when he has asked one or two (scholars) he excludes himself from a problematic position which does not leave anything upon him from the shariah and there is absolute ijma on this.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is perfect where the Shaykh clearly explains a lay person can ask one or more scholars and this is contrary to taqlid Shakhsi, or Qism Mubah (for arguments sake) as this is proceeds from the recantation and then the Shaykh explains the above without saying it is the permissible or wajib form of taqlid. The Shaykh then quotes from Mussalim al-thabut and his saying a muqallid acting on the SAYING of a scholar has fulfilled his research. He goes onto explain and answer this himself. Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain avidly cites this as a proof adjacent the ardent muqallids who were engrossed in Taqlid Shakhsi and not Ittiba.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here is another point, if the recantation is not from the Qism Awwal i.e. taqlid of a mujtahid then what sense does it make for him to say on (1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Some of the scholars using this ayah to mean the imams and proving taqlid is FARDH from this ayah is is EXTREMELY WRONG and a GROSS ERROR&#8221;</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;and using this ayah to say taqlid of the Aimah Mujtahidin is FARDH is totally wrong.&#8221;</em> (1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">bearing in mind he has already recanted from the Mubah type i.e. of taqlid Shakhsi i.e. taqlid of a specific madhab, as there are Qism Awwal and Qism Thani???</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">lastly the last part of the answer the Shaykh left general i.e. taqlid as just taqlid without specifying it, if anyone attempts to specify this fatwa of the Shaykh Fatawa Naziriyyah they must do so with clear, precise words of the Shaykh and the general must be left general if unless specified and not fom before a recantation. as a reminder he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In summary taqlid is not evidenced from any ayah of the Quran nor from any hadith and neither did any Imam permit anyone from doing taqlid of them.”</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be noted we cited the view of the direct student of Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain denying any form of taqlid being wajib, quoting the view of people way later who are no where near the stature of the students of Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain is misrepresentation of the view of the Ahl al-Hadith, none of the major scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith say this form is taqlid and that it is wajib they simply call it Ittiba, they done so for centuries. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It would interesting to note what Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi said in his other books, <em>Thabut Haq al-Haqiq, Daf&#8217;e al-Balwa </em>and<em> Falah al-Wali Ba-Ittiba al-Nabi</em> all three refuting the idea of taqlid and promoting Ittiba, inshAllah if time allows more discussions will be cited from them. There also some general words non specific in the sheikhs <em>Makatib Naziriyyah</em>, again not much direct significance to this discussion. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">more to follow inshAllah.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A few brothers sent us emails asking for clarification on Taqlid and whether a form of it is Wajib. They also asked if this was the position of the Ahl al-Hadith and the stance and view of Shaykh Muhaddith Muhammad Nazir Hussain Dehlawi, as it has been alleged that he help a form of Taqlid to be wajib and mubah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith do not hold a view that there is a form of taqlid which is wajib. This very point contravenes and contradicts the core essence and methodology and way of the Ahl al-Hadith. The scholars from amongst the Ahl al-Hadith who have cited this, have done so with a specific explanation and reasoning. Most of these statements retort back to the last 100-150 years when the intense intercourse between the Ahl al-Hadith and ardent hanafi muqallids reached a peak and other extreme sectarianism was unleashed by the latter group with episodes of violence and dire vilification. They said to the ardent hanafi muqallids if you mean by taqlid that a lay person refers back to a scholar, mujtahid, mufti and then asks him a question, then he must do this as per the command of Allah, which is wajib by default. However, naturally the other group was referring to taqlid Shaksi which are worlds apart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then the scholars of that era continued to used this form of explanation in their books and would often cite the same points verbatim. A testimony to this point is that none of the staunch hanafi muqallids have ever claimed the Ahl al-Hadith also say taqlid is wajib as a point of refutation against us as rhetorical answer because they understood and knew very well what the Ahl al-Hadith meant. This is also the reason why some current day Ahl al-Hadith authors also say there is a permissible form of taqlid. The terminology in the later point is by default incorrect as understood by the scholars of Usul who uphold this to be Ittiba and this can be incorporated as word polemics.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In their day discussions were regarding taqlid shakhsi and the Usul al-Fiqh definition of taqlid and to extrapolate this to refer to generic general lumen taqlid is a misrepresentation of what their actual view was.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secondly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The citation from Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Muhaddith Dehlawi&#8217;s Ma&#8217;yar ul-Haq on his view of some forms of taqlid being wajib and mubah (p.75 old edn, p.80 &#8211; New edn) and later scholars subsequently citing this from Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Muhaddith Muhaddith Dehlawi is incorrect due to the reasons cited above. Only one student according to my knowledge has cited this from Shaykh Mian Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi and even that was verbatim. This understanding and writing of the Shaykh in Ma&#8217;yar ul-Haq was for the proponents of Taqlid Shakhsi, clarifying by using the language of the people of taqlid but essentially meaning ittiba. This is further clarified with the next point which is to follow inshAllah. To say this was the view of the majority of the Ahl al-Hadith is a gross error and a major deficiency in research of the designated view of the scholars of Ahl al-Hadith. The latter notion is easy rebuked by mentioning the views and positions of the eminent scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith which are well established and citing all of them will lengthen the discussion, however it is pertinent to mention a few points regarding this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi retracted from this expression and stated in not as much words that using such terminology was not correct after research. It is indeed negligent and grossly erroneous to attribute a view to a scholar when the scholar himself has cited a retraction and clarification, if this is not the case i.e. of negligence it certainly is tantamount to poor research and understanding of the view of the Ahl al-Hadith. If we open Fatawa Naziriyyah (1:172)-Delhi Edn) we find in clear words Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi saying,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This humble simpleton although did say a form of taqlid Shakhsi was permissible in Ma&#8217;yar ul-Haq, however after research and investigation it cannot be permissible because something permissible is the right of the legislator and taqlid shakhsi is excluded by the legislator by default&#8230;.&#8221;</em> Then the Shaikh goes on to cite statements explaining this up until (1:180). It should also be noted this is dated by the Shaykh as 1281H</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is then followed by affirmations of over 25 scholars, scholars in their own right and the students of Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhadith Dehlawi&#8217;s student who thus agree with this view. The avid reader may refer to it openly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fourthly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are other indicative factors in which Shaykh Muhaddith Muhammad Nazir Hussain rebuked the notion of taqlid being wajib i.e. obligatory. He reprimands this view when answering a question when asked, that some scholars say taqlid is wajib. He answers and says,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This saying of some of the scholars is incorrect&#8230;.. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then he goes on to answer the claim in detail and concludes his answer by saying</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;In summary taqlid is not evidenced from any ayah of the Quran nor from any hadith and neither did any Imam permit anyone from doing taqlid of them. Numerous beneficial treatises have been authored in the censure and rebuking of taqlid and if anyone wishes to refer to the reasons of its futility in detail, then they can refer to these treatise.&#8221;</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:163-164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Fifthly</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain&#8217;s student were actually of this view contrary to the statement that most of the scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith held a form of taqlid permissible, this is perhaps indeed an oversight by the claimants, again which warrants further detailed research on this issue as well as the view of the Ahl al-Hadith. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Instead of citing all of the names and statements of the scholars of the Hadith refuting the alleged notion it would be more pertinent to just cite a generic overview. Thus the illustrious scholar of Ahl al-Hadith, Shaikh Muhammad Shah Jahanpuri (d.1338H), a direct student and who had ijazah from Shaikh Muhaddith Muhammad Nazir Hussain Dehlawi said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;In this era the people have began claiming taqlid is wajib or fardh and sometimes they say doing taqlid is a sign of the people of Ahl Al-Sunnah. Then a time came when the scholars of Ahl al-Hadith openly refuted this and engaged in debates and discourse. When they failed to provide evidence for their claims ie the legitimacy of taqlid they were forced to say taqlid is not wajib and they were restricted to say this due to a greater benefit and their limitations&#8230;&#8221; </i>(al-Irshad ila sabil al-Rashad p.161-162)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As mentioned a whole array of statements can be presented from many books endorsing and clarifying this as the valid view and position of the Ahl al-Hadith. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Was it The Norm to Only Follow the Four Madhabs in the 7th and 8th Century<br />
&amp; The Existence of Other Madhabs</span></strong></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">PART 4</span></strong></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us look at why this is an shadh position (i.e Refutation of Those Who Do Not Follow The Four Schools) we will see in light of the statements and understanding of the scholars who were around the time of Hafiz Ibn Rajab who died in the year 795 after the Hijra.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Rajab allegedly says in the opening pages that he authored the book in answer to someone&#8217;s rebuke to. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Someone&#8217;s rebuke has reached me: a rebuke for my censuring people today who affiliate with the school of Imam Ahmad or another famous Imam, yet depart from their school in issues&#8230;&#8221; (Hafiz Ibn Rajab, Al-Radd &#8216;ala man Ittiba ghayr al-madhahib al-arba ? (Refutation of Those Who Do Not Follow The Four Schools) trans. Musa Furber (?: Islamosaic, 2003/2012/2015) p.1)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(**The dates of the translated publication are somewhat confusing, where the copyright is cited as 2003, 2012 but the translators introduction is dated 30th June 2015 in Abu Dhabi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is interesting to note how Hafiz Ibn Rajab did not restrict such affiliations to just the four Imams as the passage above shows but yet it is strange how the title of the book suggests and is restricted only to the four Madhabs!!! This is from amongst many reasons why some researchers have failed to accept this as Hafiz Ibn Rajab&#8217;s book. Some researchers accepted it to be his treatise with great difficulty but rejected the title. This will be discussed later In Sha Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Musa Furber, in his short biography of Hafiz Ibn Rajab cites al-Subki as one of his teachers, ie Shaikh Taqi al-Din. (Refutation of Those Who Do Not Follow The Four Schools, p.vIII)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, Shaikh Taqi al-Din al-Subki&#8217;s son, Shaikh Taj al-Din Subki (771H) who died just 24 years before Hafiz Ibn Rajab and was therefore from his era, he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“It is unacceptable to Allah, the forcing of people to accept one madhab and the associated partisanship (tahazzub) in the subsidiary issues of the Din and nothing pushes this fervour and zealously except partisanship and jealousy. If Abu Haneefah, Shafi, Malik and Ahmad were alive they would severely censure these people and they would dissassociate themselves from them.” (Mu’eed an-Na’am Wa Mubeed an-Naqam pg.76)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The later Hanafi scholars way after the time of Hafiz Ibn Rajab, even differed with the view of &#8220;only the four madhab&#8221; approach and they said if a muqallid Qadhi (judge) issues a verdict in opposition to the fatwa of the imam of the madhab, it is unworthy to be acted upon. Similarly when the Qadhi issues a verdict based on a weak statement of the madhab it will still not be worthy to be acted upon, so therefore how is it correct to act upon a statement of another madhab. (Refer to Durr ul-Mukhtar with Radd al-Mukhtar 1/76)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Others however on the other hand have shown some leniency and said if the Qadhi is a Mujtahid then his verdict which opposes the madhab can be acted upon based on ijtihad. (Refer to Durr al-Mukhtar 1/85 and 5/404)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the later scholars themselves differed with this even after the era of Hafiz Ibn Rajab and we have already shown the same from Hafiz Ibn Rajab&#8217;s era already, as for the time before, let&#8217;s not even go there!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Kamal ud Din Hanafi said that an individual referring to another madhab based on evidence and ijtihad is sinful and worthy to be reprimanded, then how about the individual who refers to another madhab without evidence or ijtihad, then he will be more worthy of sin and punishment. (Refer to Tahawi 2/417)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Dhahabi (748H), another contemporary of Hafiz Ibn Rajab extorts some beneficial points, his profound words are, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Oh Muqallid and oh you who think ijtihad has finished and there is no Mujtahid now! Then there is no benefit in your learning and studying the principles of Fiqh as learning the principles of Fiqh only benefits the Mujtahid. When an individual knows the principles of Fiqh and he still abstains from freeing himself from the shackles of taqlid, he does not achieve anything. Rather by studying it further he pushes himself into more difficulty and establishes proofs against himself.. ” (cited by Suyuti in Ar-Radd Ala Min Akhlad Ilal Ardh pg.153)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also further expounded on this and said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“A person who only follows one specific madhab is the one who is deficient of firm knowledge, just as the situation was with most of the scholars of our times who are mutassab (ie bigoted)” (Siyar A’lam an-Nabula 14/491)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Izz ud deen Ibn Abdus Salam (660H) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“There is great amazement at the blind following (Muqallid) jurists (fuqaha) who know the weak sources of their imams which they can not clarify or rectify, yet they are still adamant and continue to do taqlid of their Imams and they abandon and leave the position which is supported by the Quran and Sunnah. In doing so they formulate and concoct major false interpretations in defence and in promotion of their Imams.” (Qawaid al-Ahkam 2/135, also cited by Shah Waliullah in his Hujatullah 1/155, in his Ittihaf pg.110 and in his Iqd al-Jeed, Suyuti in his ar-Radd Min Akhlad pg.140, and Allamah Fulani in Iqaz al-Humam pg.108)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Salah (643H) the author of Muqaddimah Uloom al-Hadith) says in summary </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“When a lay person seeks a fatwa or asks concerning an issue from a scholar, he should emphasis on the answer and say was this the ruling of the Nabi (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). If the mufti says yes, he can act on the fatwa and nothing more is required from in terms of him being a lay person. However if the mufti says this is my opinion, or the opinion of Malik, Qasim, Abu Haneefah, Abu Yusuf, Shafi, Ahmad or Dawood Zahiri, or if he says it is the statement of a companion or tabi, or if he just remains silent, then it is haram to take the fatwa. Unless it specifies it is from the Nabi Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam), thereafter it becomes obligatory to take this and it is also obligatory for him to say to you to go and ask other scholars.”(Kitab al-Fatwa pg.280 of Ibn Salah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows even before Hafiz Ibn Rajab&#8217;s time the people and the scholars had an understanding beyond the four Madhabs and followed the methodology of referring back to the evidences, even if it was outside of the four Madhabs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Suyuti (911H), who was over a 100 years after the time of Hafiz Ibn Rajab, he also alludes to the existence of other Madhabs in the fifth century ie up to the 600H. So what changed so dramatically in 150 years or so until the time of Hafiz Ibn Rajab? Imam Suyuti said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Numerous mujtahids have passed through the various eras in addition to the numerous mujtahids after the time of the tabieen. There were 10 madhabs that were prevalent. So in addition to the four madhabs we have the Madhab Sufyan ath-Thawri, Madhab Awzai, Madhab Laith ibn Sa’ad, Madhab Ishaq ibn Rahawaihah, Madhab Ibn Jarir and the Madhab of Dawud. However after thr 5th century due to the lack of fervour, motivation and rejuvenation these other madhabs dimished.” (al-Hawi Lil-Fatawa 2/156 of Imam Suyuti)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (728H) has further expanded on this and asserted the other madhabs did exist, he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Imam Sufyan ath-Thawri who was an Imam of the people of Iraq and according to most of the scholars was greater in rank that the scholars of his era like Ibn Abi Layla, Hasan bin Saleh and Abu Haneefah. His madhab is present today in Khurasan. Likewise the madhab of Imams Ishaq ibn Rahawaihah and Dawud (adh-Dhahiri) is also prevalent today, in fact in the east and the west you will find that most of the followers are of the Dawudi madhab.” (al-Fatawa al-Kubra 2/374, it is also cited in his Majmu Fatawa)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also remember, Imam Ibn Taymiyyah died in 728H and he is saying that you will find people upon other madhabs, so this shows the people were not confined to these madhabs even in the 8th century of Islam, precisely during the era of Hafiz Ibn Rajab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people have even mentioned the different lands who were on different madhabs just before the time of Hafiz Ibn Rajab. For example Mas’ud bin Shaybah Sindhi, who was a staunch author and from amongtst 7th century hanafi scholars mentioned most of the people of Rauzrawar, Yazjard, Juzbazkan (central asia) and some of the people Hamdan are upon the madhab of of Thawri. (Muqaddimah Kitab at-Ta’lim pg.331)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The student of Shaikh Balqaini asked him what prohibits Shaikh Taqi ud deen as-Subki from doing ijtihad (and here it means of the Mustaqil or mutlaq type) whereas he has the capability and knowledge. The student also thought that Shaikh Balqaini was also of the same level and so whatever answers he gives I will also assume that to be his own reasons also.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However Shaikh Balqaini remained silent. So the student himself said, may be he thought it was inappropriate and this ijtihad was restricted to the 4 madhabs and those who left these 4 madhabs and performed ijtihad, they would not achieve anything because the people would abandon and not take Fatawa from them and at the same instance label them to be innovators. Then Shaikh Balqaini smiled upon my clarification and agreed with me. (Refer to Shaikh Shah Waliullahs al-Insaf Fee Bayan Sabab al-Ikhtilaf pg.60-61)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In summary dear readers we find, the scholars did not restrict the people only to the four madhabs and this was from scholars during the time of Hafiz Ibn Rajab, slightly before and well after. This also shows the existence of other madhabs during the same era in the different lands. There were other mitigating factors why scholars resorted to sicking to one of the well known madhabs as the student of Baqilaini highlighted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What must be added here, there is no legislated evidence in the Quran or Sunnah whatsoever that restricts a Muslim to only one of the four madhabs, this is huge milestone from restricting a Muslim to only one madhab.</span></p>
