				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="center"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Compiled &amp; Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 align="center"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">I compiled a biography of &gt;&gt;&gt; <a style="color: #003300;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/biography-imam-qatadah-ibn-diaamah-sadusi-basri-118h/"><strong>Qatadah b. Di’amah Sadusi Basri [d.118H</strong>]</a> which was published many years ago. A number of people commented he was a Qadari. The orientalists have been at the forefront of this in trying to undermine the hadith corpus and rijal reliability and they have been quick to run with this. Some have presented the argument of the permissibility of taking knowledge from innovators while pursuing this line of argument and using Qatadah as an example.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imam Qatadah strongly adhered to the Sunnah and sought knowledge from the Successors and Companions. He took the tafsir of the Quran from them and the transmission of hadith and he was an astounding and prolific preserver of hadith. He was particularly a formidable expert in the tafsir of the Quran and is on record for saying, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“There is not an ayah except that I have heard something concerning it”.</em> (Shadhrat adh-Dhahab (1/154)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The innovation of rejecting and denying Qadr ie the belief of the Qadariyyah was rampant in Iraq and the likes of the misguided innovator Ma’bad al-Juhani, the founder of the Qadariyyah were based around that region and in this regard some good authorities were accused of inclining towards that view where as that was not the case.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Qatadah Affirming Qadr</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imam Ibn Battah (d.387H) adds a chapter heading in his book, <strong>“The First Chapter – What has Been Transmitted from a Group of Tabui’in (Successors) Concerning Having Iman in al-Qadr and Affirming it”</strong> and then transmits this report,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">A man came to Qatadah and said to him. <em>“Oh Abul Khattab what do you say concerning al-Qadr”? Qatadah replied, “Do you like of the Arabs or non-Arabs”? He replied, “The Arabs”. He replied, “The Arabs did not believe in this during the time of ignorance whereas Islam affirms al-Qadr” and then he read some couplets of a poem.”</em> (al-Ibanah An Shari’yyatil Firqatin Najiyyah Wa Mujanabatil Firaq al-Mazmumati, (Kitab ath-Thani, al-Qadr (2/219 no.1792) (Dar ur-Rayyah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imam Ibn Abi Hatim in his tafsir under <strong>Surah Tawbah: 51</strong> transmits through an Mu’allaq (disconnected chain) from Qatadah an affirmatory statement on al-Qadr from his Shaikh Muslim b. Yassar who said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“al-Qadr are two expansive valleys in which people are destroyed and its extent cannot be comprehended. So perform righteous deeds like the deeds of the man who knows there is no salvation except through his deeds. Have tawakkul like the tawakkul of the man who knows nothing will harm him except what Allah wrote for him”.</em> (Ibn Abi Hatim, Tafsir al-Quran al-A’zim (8/454 no.1182), al-Ibanah (Kitab ath-Thani, al-Qadr (2/310-311 no.1990), as-Suyuti, Durr al-Manthur (3/249)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">From Sa’id b. Abi Aruba from Qatadah who said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“I asked Sa’id b. al-Musayyib about al-Qadr”. He said, “Whatever is (written for you) from Qadr will be your Qadr and whatever is not (written for you) in your Qadr will not be from your Qadr”.</em> (al-Lalaka’i, Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnati Wa’l Jama’ah (4/774 no.1295)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The report above from Sa’id Ibn Abu Aruba contradicts what adh-Dhahabi transmits from him and ad-Dastawa’i when they said Qatadah said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“Everything is from al-Qadr except sins”.</em> (Tazkirratul Huffadh (1/124)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Abdur Razzaq as-Sanani mentions in his tafsir from Ma’mar from Qatadah from al-Hasan who said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“Whoever rejects al-Qadr he has indeed rejected the Quran”.</em> (Abdur Razzaq as-San’ani, Tafsir al-Quran (2/240 no.1391), Musannaf (9/21 no.21102), Abdullah b. Imam Ahmad, as-Sunnah (2/83 no.984) (ar-Riyashi), al-Ibanah (Kitab ath-Thani, al-Qadr (2/180 no.1666), Muqbil, al-Jam’i as-Sahih Fi’l Qadr (p.524 no.543)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">From Abdur Razzaq from Ma’mar from Qatadah who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“I asked Sa’id b. al-Musayyib concerning al-Qadr, he replied. “Whatever Allah decreed (al-Qadr) then that is Qadr”.</em> (Musannaf Abdur Razzaq (9/26 no.21018), Abdullah b. Imam Ahmad, as-Sunnah (2/48 no.927) (ar-Riyashi), al-Ibanah (Kitab ath-Thani, al-Qadr (2/221 no.1799), al-Jam’i as-Sahih Fi’l Qadr (p.524 no.541)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The Accusation of Denying al-Qadr</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Hanzalah b. Abi Sufyan reports Tawus would flee from Qatadah due to his views on al-Qadr. (Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnati Wa’l Jama’ah (4/704 no.1143), Siyar A’lam an-Nabula (5/275), Tahdhib ul-Kamal (23/509)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Ibn Sa’d said he had something by the way of al-Qadr (Tabaqat al-Kubra (9/228 no.3957)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Al-Ijli said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>&#8220;He was accused of al-Qadr and he would not call to it nor speak about it …”</em> (Ma’rifah ath-Thiqat (2/215 no.1513)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Abu Musa Ishaq al-Juzjani also levied a charge against Qatadah (adh-Dhahabi, Tarikh al-Islam (6/201), Mukhtasar Tarikh Dimashq (25/116)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Ibn Shawzab said Qatadah would openly express his view on denying al-Qadr. (al-Fusawi, al-Ma’rifah wat-Tarikh (2/277), (Siyar A’lam an-Nabula (5/275), Tazkirratul Huffadh (1/124)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Others have also reported some affairs of negation of al-Qadr where in Qatadah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"> <em>“Everything is from al-Qadr except sins”.</em> (Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnati Wa’l Jama’ah (4/774 no.1296), Siyar A’lam an-Nabula (5/275), Tazkirratul Huffadh (1/124 no.107)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">However al-Lalaka’i directly after this report transmit Qatadah’s statement contradicting the view in the report above. It reads, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“Hakam b. Umar sent Khalid b. Abdullah to Qatadah to ask him some questions on some issues and at the time he was in al-Hiyarah. I asked him about Allah’s statement “</em><em>Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians, and the Majûs, and those who worship others besides Allâh (Surah al-</em><em>Hajj:17) does this refer to the mushriks of Arabia? He replied, “No, rather the detractor Zindiqs (heretics) who associated partners (i.e. shirk) from Allah’s creation with him and they would say Allah created good and shaytan created evil and Allah does not have power over shaytan”.</em> (Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnati Wa’l Jama’ah (4/774 no.1297), Tarikh Dimashq (15/33)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Another charge by Abu Dawud against Qatadah was that he would remain silent and not speak about al-Qadr; indicating his denial of it (al-Ibanah (Kitab ath-Thani, al-Qadr (2/25 no.1810)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">However, Abu Dawud also said, <em>“Nothing is authentic about Qatadah regarding al-Qadr (denying it)”.</em> (Mu’ajam Ibn al-Muqri (2/45 no.183)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Adh-Dhahabi also repeats the charge and said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“He was accused (denying) al-Qadr”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and in Siyar transmits a report from al-Hasan al-Basri which is transmitted from Qatadah that,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em>“The good is from al-Qadr and evil is not from al-Qadr”. Adh-Dhahabi then said, “Qatadah was accused of (denying) al-Qadr”.</em> (Tazkirratul Huffadh (1/124), Siyar A’lam an-Nabula (4/583), respectively)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">adh-Dhahabi presents his summary on Qatadah in Tazkirratul Huffadh when he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"> <em>“I say: despite this foul belief no one held back using his hadith as evidence, may Allah forgive his errors”.</em> (Tazkirratul Huffadh (1/124)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Adh-Dhahabi clearly changes his view and this statement abrogates his previous views when he said Ahmad b. Hanbal said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“Qatadah and Sa’id spoke about al-Qadr while they both concealed it. I say (adh-Dhahabi): They both repented and retracted just as their Shaikh repented”.</em> (Siyar A’lam an-Nabula (5/275)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Yaqut al-Hamawi said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“He (Qatadah) spoke of something of al-Qadr and then he retracted from it”</em>. (Mu’ajam al-Adba (5/2233 no.914)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Dr. Ahmad b. Sa&#8217;id b. Hamdan al-Ghamidi also mentions in his footnote in his checking of Sharh Usul al-I’tiqad under (no.1297), </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“The author (al-Lalaka’i) transmitted two contradictory statements of Qatadah with the first one saying everything is from al-Qadr except sins and in the second that (denying) al-Qadr is the view of the Zanadiqah (heretics), Allah knows best which view is authentic from him. Indications have preceded that Qatadah had a view on al-Qadr and then he repented from it”.</em> (Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnati Wa’l Jama’ah (4/774)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Abdul Hamid Bakhit said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"> <em>“Qatadah is trustworthy according to the majority scholars of hadith, the accusation of al-Qadr regarding sins needs investigating and this did not prevent numerous scholars of hadith transmitting hadith from him, they relied and authenticated his narrations since he was hafiz and hujjah. The accusation of al-Qadr is not proven and if it is, it will be explained with that which does not oppose clear Iman and Islam”.</em> (Dirasat Tarikhiyyah Fi Rijal al-Hadith, p.48)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Dr. Abdullah Taha Abdullah as-Salmani has also favoured the view that denial of al-Qadr like the Qadariyyah has not been proven regarding Qatadah and all the scholars of hadith took his hadith. (Majallah Ibhath Kulliyah at-Tanziyyah al-Asaiyyah vol.8 no.2 p.203-207)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">In summary, If Qatadah was accused with Qadr and the reports are authentic then his repentance and retraction is established and thus absolved of such accusations. We must also consider some of the accusations are without supporting evidence and therefore questionable. What also supports the previous statement are the statements of Abu Dawud where he said Qatadah would remain silent and not speak of al-Qadr and his saying nothing is authentic from Qatadah denying al-Qadr. Similarly, adh-Dhahabi repeating the charge of al-Qadr and then affirming his retraction from it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Lastly, another perspective is that he was known as a caller to al-Qadr and this is why the scholars of hadith took his narrations otherwise their rule was very stringent in not taking reports from those wo called to their innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">In the words of adh-Dhahabi himself, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“Indeed Qatadah is Hujjah with consensus when he clarifies he heard hadith…” </em>(Siyar A’lam an-Nabula (5/271)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We the Ahlul Hadith have learnt the Quran, Aqadah, Hadith and Fiqh as part of our Islamic responsibility so that we can serve this Deen in a manner that best suites this Ummah. In response to our dedication and efforts the hanafis deobandis of Bury and Dewsbury decided to setup Tablighi organisations against the Salafi Dawah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The efforts of Ahlul Hadith was spreading by Allahs mercy and in the year of 2000-2001, the elder generation of the deobandis felt the need to arrange emergency meetings to discuss ways of creating counter measures in an attempt to curb the Salafi Dawah. Such meetings or conferences were held in India and the UK to address this situation. It is therefore intriguing to contemplate if Mr Yasir is aware of this history but decided to conceal it just like Mohammad Ilyas sahib concealed the true founder of the 6 principles of the deobandi Manhaj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a historical fact that the people of truth are always less in number but their Dawah is very effective and consequently the deobandi contingency become very fearful of this threat. In a desperate and cheap attempt, the Deobandis decided to approach the masses and make false statements against the Salafis, such as <em>“oh the Salafis will drive you away from the taqleed of the imams and the burzugh… how can we allow our children to abandon the Deen of our forefathers of Deoband.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was at this point this these people promoted the term <em>ghair muqalid </em>in reference to Ahlul Hadeeth.  It was light of these crocodile tears that the deobandis had the apparent justification in setting up institutions around the UK.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this one may ponder how the Salafi Dawah is gaining strength if they lack the Madaris as Mr Yasir claims. A further point to note is to ponder how is it that Hanafis are embracing the Salafi Dawah and not the reverse? We can conclude that Mr Yasir is a victim of the inferiority complex, to make statements such as “<em>they hardly have any proper madaris</em>” shows he has no intelligence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a known fact that the Salafis have always propagated their Manhaj with small quantities of people but the large number of deobandi and hanafis from the subcontinent along with their kosher money have led to their institutions. This followed with an influx of migrants from the subcontinent who are mainly hanafi and heobandi who have contributed to the numbers in the UK. This has now become a point of argument by those who lack in concrete proof in defence of the deobandi hanafi sect which is corrupted with Shirk and Bid’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be noted here that the vast majority of these migrants are the laymen and do not possess a concrete understanding of the correct Aqidah and it is very cunning of Mr Yasir in using this to promote a false argument highlighting that the Salafis are weak in number. We should also emphasise that if success is judged by numbers then the Sahaba would have been on the brink of failure during the battle of Badr, but it was because of their correct Aqidah and firm Iman that won the battle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir further states </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“<em>it’s funny how they chant one word salaf when they have no link to the pious salaf as salaf means that came before us.”</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have addressed this comment previously and revisiting this would be unnecessary. It is very ironic that Mr Yasir uses the word chant as this is a term his Sufi Manhaj promotes in their circles of zikr, this is because the deobandis are essentially Naqshabandi who are well known for their methods of worship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It seems Mr Yasir was excluded from these circles of remembrance where they CHANT like individuals intoxicated with harmful substances. In light of this we do not follow the Salaf and if we choose to, then it needs to be substantiated with evidence and this is easy for us. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi as his name suggests claims to be hanafi, therefore please attempt to highlight the current day deobandi belief &amp; practices from the manhaj of Imam Abu Hanifah. This is a challenge which will be met with certain failure. Meanwhile we the Salafis can bring forward our proofs which emphasises that our Manhaj and Aqidah has not been diluted but rather it is a mirror reflection of the Companions, Tabieens and Taba-Tabieens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have previously stated examples such as books of Aqidah i.e creed issues as Mr Yasir phrases it. Furthermore, he has misunderstood the word Salaf in terms of what it denotes, and the meaning that it draws. This is a further example demonstrating the ignorance of Mr Yasir who embarrasses himself by spitting at himself whilst attempting to spit at the sun in the presence of his deobandi devotees.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One may contemplate how an overly enthusiastic deobandi is capable of such diabolical profanities whilst his senior counterparts would seek refuge in such foolish statements. Mr Yasir should realise that the term Salaf cannot be restricted to an era but rather it must align with the principles of the Quran and the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore any individual whose beliefs, madhab and opinions do not conform and agree with the Quran and Sunnah or that they oppose the people of truth will be upon misguidance. A manifestation of this situation can be understood in the case of Ma’bad al-Juhani 70H, the leader of the Qadiriyyah, Ghilan Dimashqi 105H, the head of the Jahmis, Jahm ibn Safwan 128H, Ja’d ibn Dirham 124H and Wasil ibn A’ta 131H, the head of the Mu’tazilah (Refer to Qadiyah Way-Ta’weel).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The aforementioned individuals were from the leaders of the Salaf of Mr Yasir. We urge him to investigate his own Salaf, the likes of Jahm, Wasil to name a few. Mr Yasir is a very confused individual who claims to be an Ashari but in reality he and his sect are Kullabis which is derived from the Jahmi’s. In light of this we cannot consider Mr Yasir a serious student of knowledge from whom knowledge can be taken from (this is for those who belong to his sect).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Safarini has stated that the Salaf must be upon righteousness and truthfulness so that knowledge can be sought from them. Their character must be of good conduct and individuals who strongly oppose the people of innovation. He further states in regards to the Salafis,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“They are labelled or titled with names that are not linked by the people like the Khawarij, Rawafidh, Qadariyyah, Murjiah, Jabariyyah, Jahmiyyah etc”</em> (Lawamah Al Anwar 1/20)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir further states </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Yes they do follow the misguided Salaf”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Only one needs to read the books of rijal and history to understand the Salaf within the deobandis and hanafis. For instance we can study the example of Abu Mute’a al-Balkhi and his beliefs (Refer to Lisan ul-Mizan Vol. 2, Mizan ul-E’tidaal Vol. 1 and Kitab al-Kunna Vol. 2 of ad-Daulabi).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A further example to look at is the E’tizaal and Irja and their respective origins. Al-ikmaal (1/252-253) of ibn Makaula is yet another example to look at wherein it provides information on the individual who pulled the reigns of the horse of the wife of Jahm Ibn Safwan. Much more can be stated about Mr Yasir’s Salaf and therefore he needs to address the matters of his own house before he chooses to attacks others with foolish remarks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir further states </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“By changing your name, the reality doesn’t turn into gold.”</span> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ironically this is the very point Ahlul Hadith have been driving forward. To label oneself as a hanafi does not imply that one is now amongst the hanafi scholars of the classical era who were free of the deviant beliefs as those hanafis of today. The same principle can be applied when choosing to label oneself as an Ashari or Maturidi who also did not share the deviant practices as Mr Yasir, such as seeking aid from the deceased or from the souls of the righteous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It only takes one to study the statements of their respective hanafi deobandi scholar to realise that he has more right to ilm to label himself a hanafi, and claims that he is a muqallid of Imam Abu Hanifah in trivial matters of the deen. Whilst in matters of Manhaj and Aqidah they choose to acknowledge Imam Abul Hasal al-Ashari and Imam Abu Mansur Maturidi (Muhannad Ala Mufannad Page 22).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore we ask Mr Yasir to present his sufi beliefs from these scholars i.e. their elders from whom they take their knowledge from and emulate. In light of this if Mr Yasir is not fully versed with Muhannad Ala Mufannad then this a clear sign of ignorance in his knowledge and a classical example of someone to have some shame and regret.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However if on the other hand My Yasir is completely unware of this book then we would highlight that this book does not fall short in being the ultimate reference guide for the Sufi deobandi forefathers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir should be familiar with the calibre and the number of the deobandi elders who satisfied the beliefs and the fundamental principles of this book. Nonetheless, addressing the original point, labelling oneself a hanafi whilst the heobandi doctrines are derived heavily from the Greeks and Hindus and in addition to having the ideas of Jahm Ibn Safwan, Ja’d Ibn Dirham and Wasil Ibn Alta is a matter that needs to be reflected upon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is intriguing to see that Mr Yasir has the audacity to present himself in front of an audience to critique Ahlul Hadith whilst the state of his own affairs is a disgrace. If he truly believes that he is surely upon truth then we ask him to highlight the concepts of wahdatul wujood, seeking aid from the deceased, seeking aid from the living in a manner that is beyond the capacity of a person, holding the belief that calamities can be alleviated from the creation of Allah and so forth from the works of Imam Abu Mansur Maturidi and Imam Abul Hasan al-Ashari. This is a challenge that he will fail miserably.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the final tirade then it amounts to nothing but an overly excited child with sweets. We eagerly await your response. With regards to the flapping, then we say that once Ahlul Hadith have dealt with Mr Yasir al-Hanafi, he will not be able to crawl back to deoband let alone flapping, that is if he is not disowned by the real academics amongst them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the very deoband which was established in a Hindu city where their respective goddess would be worshipped and venerated. It is also the very deoband which was formed through the donations of Hindus and the British East India Company.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our advice for Mr Yasir before he chooses to undertake his long journey back to Deoband where the goddess of Durga was worshipped i.e. Devi van, Devi gan or Devi Vandan is to equip yourself with pen and paper so that you can actually acquire the knowledge of your forefathers in Devgand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also a JazakAllah Khair to Abu Hashim for his diligence and efforts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Written by the two weak slaves of Allah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise be to Allah lord of the worlds to whom we praise and seek his aid and assistance without any intercessors. May there be abundant salutations upon the noblest messenger, his family, his companions and all those Muslims who follow until the last day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Very recently some proponents and ardently staunch followers of the Hanafi Deobandi Madhab under the guise of the Hanafi Fiqh  have made some slanderous remarks which were based on bigoted ignorance, deliberate opposition of the true reality, state of affairs and malicious misrepresentation of the facts through social media platforms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The perpetrator of these remarks were carried out by neonate, new kids on the block with new found levels of testosterone, namely Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi. Our aim is not to entertain the mind-set of this individual or his scathing remarks as this will lengthen this brief response. Rather we wish to highlight some key points to show the slanderous lies and ignorance of this individual.     </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I also like to request our Sunni brothers to refrain from uploading any youtube videos, creating articles against the likes of the Hanafi and Deobandi sect including their overly exaggerated teachers such as Maulana Qasim Nanautwi, Ashraf Ali Thanvi and Rashid Ahmad Gangohi who are not well versed with this sect and their school of thought. The brothers should understand that attempting a refutation against the aforementioned individuals, the Deobandis and Hanafis will result in a subsequent response from them which may be difficult for those brothers to rebut and thereby causing embarrassment on behalf of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah. It is indeed easy quoting what Ashraf Ali Thanvi said etc but when accusations are levied against us these brothers are no where to be seen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The effects of this scenario will make our brothers look weak and defeated. In summary, it is very simple to upload videos which make criticism of the Deobandi Manhaj by our zealous brothers however any response from the opposition is met with silence. Therefore our brothers should realise their respective limits when dealing with such matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us proceed and analyse the confused statements of Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi. He stated the following…</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>“Salafis” </em><em>Who are very new to this ummah, maybe a hundred years or so, though they take many of their creed issues from Hafiz Ibn Taymiyyah, bin Baz, Uthaymin et al who were nowhere near the salaf</em>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Response: We do not know if we are to laugh at this statement or cry at the Jahala of this individual. Such statements have become so monotonous or repeated that it is deemed as ignorance to even raise such a point. This statement has demonstrated the childish and immature behaviour and pathetic mind-set of this person</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If we are to accept his statement that the Salafis existed for no more than 100 years or so then consider the following.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir died in 1164H (approximately 272 years ago). He wrote in his refutation of the Ashari’s which mentions Allahs Kalam Nafsi (i.e. the incorrect Aqidah),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“(They say) Allah does not speak but they are internal sounds!!! Then you cannot even find the smell of this in the Quran and Sunnah” (Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqaid an-Hadithiyyah (also referred to as Athariyyah pg.21). </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this Mohammad Yasir has either demonstrated his poor mathematical skills or he has shown poor understanding of the Salafis and Ahlul Hadith. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir died in 1164H refuting the Asharis but also the fact that he was a bona fide scholar of the Salafis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be noted critically here that during this period Deoband was not even in existence and therefore we should redirect the statements of Muhammad Yasir on the forefathers of the Deobandi sect which did not exist over 100 years ago until the intervention of the British Empire through the East India Trading company.  (Refer to our treatise, The Deobandis &amp; The British Government. At the following link <a href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-deobandis-the-british-government/">http://www.salafiri.com/the-deobandis-the-british-government/</a>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is clearly apparent from this short analysis that Mr Yasir is having a hard time grasping basic mathematics, books of the Salaf and History. What reliance can we have in his short outburst?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He states</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Salafis”, <em>who are very new to this ummah, maybe a hundred years or so</em>”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">in this case we him to consider the following.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Sam’ani (562H) said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Salafi, they are those who are attributed to the Salaf and following the Madhab of the Salaf, as I HAVE HEARD FROM THEM” (al-Insab 7/723)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Ibn Athir (630H) adds to the statement of Allamah Sam’ani and says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“A group (of people) are well known with this Nisbah (i.e. attribution of being a Salafi)” (al-Ikmal (4/471-470) of Ibn Makaula, al-Tashabha Fir Rijal (1/364) and al-lubab (2/126).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If we accept Mr Yasir’s statement that the Salafi’s are a century old then please explain with your amazing mathematical mind, how Allamah Samani stated he heard from the Salaf that they followed the Madhab of the Salaf during the 6<sup>th</sup> century Hijri? And that Allamah Ibn Athir stated that he saw a group calling themselves Salafi during the 7<sup>th</sup> century Hijri?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not wish to invest too much time educating Mohammad Yasir of the definition of Salafi, however we ask him to refer to his own Ashari Scholar Ibrahim bin Muhammad Baijauri (1277H) in regards to the definition of Salaf (Refer to his Tuhfatul Murid).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known to most people that the Salafi’s are the ones who adhere to the way of the Salaf and their Madhab and it is for this reason that we label ourselves as Salafis. We should emphasise here that being a prerequisite of being a Salafi is NOT to follow Shaikh Bin Baz, Shaikh ibn Uthaymin and Imam Ibn Taymiyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather Allamah Safarini has explained that the later scholars who adopted the way of the companions, Tabieen and Taba Tabieen are known as the Salaf (Lawameh al-Anwar (1120).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taimiyyah (728H) and Hafidh ibn Rajab (795H) have included Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal (241H), Imam Shafi’ee (204H), Ishaq Ibn Rahawaihah (221H) and Imam Abu Ubaid (224H) to be from amongst the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some authorities have stated that the first three generations was the period of the Salaf. This can be confirmed within at-Tahaf Fi Madhab  as-Salaf (pg.117-118), Lawameh al-Anwar (1/20), Dar Tarudh an Aql Wan Naql (1/207 &amp; 7/134) of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Fadhal Ilm as-Salaf Alal Khalaf (p.60) of Hafidh Ibn Rajab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Ajurri superseded them in this and included Imam Ahmad and the scholars of his era from amongst the Salaf (ash-Shariah (p.14)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this, the intelligent reader will acknowledge with certainty that we take our creed issues </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">from Imam Ahmad (241H) from his Usul us-Sunnah and as-Sunnah as narrated by his sons and students</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Kitabut-Tawhid and ar-Radd Alal Jahmiyyah both of Ibn Mandah (395H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and the list continues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this, the slanderous accusations highlighting that we take our matters of creed from the likes of Shaikh Bin Baz, Shaikh Ibn al-Uthaymin and Imam Ibn Taymiyyah is a disgraceful and fabricated lie. One would contemplate as to where does Mr Yasir take his issues of creed from?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Does he take them from his Imam Abu Mansur al-Maturidi or the Ashaa’irah? Further to this, one would ask to what extent did the former of these individuals understood their creed with respect to the Salaf. Mr Yasir labels himself as an Ashari but yet he has not been able to substantiate the origins of his Aqidah, whether this be early or late Ashari or the Kullabiyyah. Furthermore, your Deobandi Church forefathers have stated in their respective books such as Maulana Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri, Qari Tayyab and Maulana Yusuf Binnori that they adopt and follow the Aqidah of Abu Hasan al-Ashari and Abu Mansur al-Maturidi however they choose to follow Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahimahullah) in fiqh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is astonishing to see that they abandon the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah in favour of their Deobandi forefathers, we ask you, what is wrong with the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah? Whilst you follow the Aqidah of the Khalaf? Also can you explain which book of the Salaf or their teaching did the Deobandi’s acquire the Sufi tariqah, Chistiyyah or the Naqshbandiyyah from?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is difficult to fathom as to how Mr Yasir chooses to follow a diluted Aqidah and yet have the audacity to claim that the Manhaj of Ahlul Hadith is no more than 100 years old. An intelligent student of knowledge would come to terms with the fallacy and fictitious nature of My Yasir’s baseless statements and his corrupted diluted Madhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> At the very least he could have adopted the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah as cited in Fiqh ul-Akbar or in his Wasiyyah Al-Imam Abu Hanifah. It is clear that Mr Yasir evidently has no shame in labelling himself as a Hanafi whilst he follows the Aqidah of his Deobandi forefathers. So either deny the attribution of these books to Imam Abu Hanifah and the Aqidah contained therein or accept the words of your own Imam, the same Imam you spend your lives defending his fiqh and yet on the other hand you turn a blind eye to his beliefs, this is the most hypocritical manipulation of the worst dimension.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We therefore stress that he should spend some useful time in reading Imam Abu Hanifah’s Aqidah in Wasiyah (p.38) (We would be surprised to say the least if he has even heard of this book) or Imam Abul Hasan al-Ashari’s Al-Ibanah (p.55). In light of these references we would expect Mr Yasir to revert to making claims that Imam Abul Hasan Al-Ashari’s Al-Ibanah has been tampered when he fails to provide an educated response.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further states in his allegations</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“<em>Also the fact that in this country they have hardly any proper madaris, except for a few crash course “Halaqas”</em>”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a further lie, the Salafis and Ahlul Hadith have been teaching in their respective madrassahs for years well before Bury and Dewsbury appeared on the scene. Madrassah’s were and are well established throughout the United Kingdom with names like Madrassah Salafiyyah. We would surely know as we studied in them in the early 80’s and the teaching was regular and consistent from the mid 70’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The level and methods of teaching were evident and widespread where students would deliver lectures and sermons as training in the annual conferences. The evidence is in your face yet due to his vehement bigoted and staunch animosity for the Ahlul Hadith he is so blind to the truth when it is right in front of him and even if it was to slap him in the face, he would still be upon his farcical and slanderous absurdities. The videos are on Youtube, may be when he has time from his repugnancy he might have a look!!! All this when deoband was still in deoband on paper!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also a JazakAllah Khair to Abu Hashim for his diligence and efforts.</span></p>
