				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">The one that curses the Sahabah is categorised as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The first category: If he curses all of them or accuses the majority of them of disbelief and apostasy, except for a small group¹, then this indeed constitutes an act of disbelief due to him rejecting the testimony of Allah (Mighty and Majestic) as expressed in His Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>&#8220;Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you ˹O Prophet˺ under the tree.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Fath, 48:18]</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And surely it has been established that those that pledged allegiance under the tree were numbered one thousand and four hundred, with some narrations mentioning them to be one thousand and five hundred.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The second category: As for those that curse some from amongst them, then this issue has details; If he curses some from amongst them due to a belief, i.e., perceiving that they had erred, that they were negligent, and that they were afflicted with whatever had befallen them, from the angle of belief (I&#8217;itiqad) &#8211; similar to the beliefs held by the Khawarij, then verily this is from the major sins, and it does not constitute an act that removes one from the Religion. If one curses some of them out of rage and hatred for them, then verily this is disbelief and apostasy. The People of Knowledge say, &#8216;Allah (Mighty and Majestic) has said in description of the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;&#8230;that He may enrage the disbelievers with them.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Fath, 48:29]</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hence, anyone who harbours rage in his heart for the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is characterised as being among those whom Allah (Mighty and Majestic) has identified as disbelievers.&#8217;²</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Regarding the Mothers of the Believers, then the ruling on cursing them is the [same] ruling on cursing the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them all). As for slandering the Mothers of the Believers, or one from amongst them, such as &#8216;A&#8217;isha (may Allah be pleased with her) or other than her, by claiming she was not chaste, then this constitutes an act of disbelief in Allah. Thus, whoever slanders a wife from the wives of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has disbelieved due to rejecting the statement of Allah (Mighty and Majestic) and what He has decreed for his Prophet ﷺ. However, this differs from the state of those that slandered [&#8216;A&#8217;isha (may Allah be pleased with her)] during the time of the Prophet ﷺ, as the Ayat vindicating her innocence were revealed after the famous incident of Al-Ifk. As for after the Ayat declaring her innocence were revealed, after the revelation of His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;Allah forbids you from ever doing something like this again, if you are ˹true˺ believers.&#8221;<br />
[An-Nur, 24:17]</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Then He made that a condition of Al-Iman, so whoever slanders a wife from the wives of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ after that has surely disbelieved by that, as the People of Knowledge have established.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>[Sharh Lum&#8217;atu&#8217;l-I&#8217;tiqad of Shaykh Salih Aal Ash-Shaykh, may Allah preserve him,<br />
</em><em>p. 145-146]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> The Rafidhi Iranian scholar, &#8216;Ali An-Namazi Ash-Shahrudi, said, &#8220;The sixth benefit: The large number of narrations necessitate the apostasy [of the Sahabah] other than three or four after the Prophet ﷺ, <strong>and it is the &#8216;asl [i.e., default ruling] for every Sahabi that remained after the Prophet ﷺ </strong>and did not die as a martyr during his time ﷺ, due to giving precedence to [Abu Bakr] in the matter of leadership over [&#8216;Ali].&#8221; <a href="https://ar.lib.eshia.ir/12156/1/67">[Mustadrakat &#8216;Ilm Ar-Rijal Al-Hadith, p. 67]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:]</strong> Al-Baghawi in Tafsir of this Ayah narrated, <strong>&#8220;Malik bin Anas said, &#8216;Whoever wakes up with hatred in his heart towards the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, then this Ayah surely applies to him.&#8221; </strong>[Tafsir Al-Baghawi, under 48:29]

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated by</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Hanafi Fiqh is the Origin of all Deviated Sects</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say with conviction and insight all the present day religious deviated movements, for example Christian missionaries, the communist movement, Chakralwi and other hadith rejectors like them, Qadiyani (Mirzai’s), and the shi’a sect, their origins can be found in the (books) of Hanafi fiqh, and this is further endorsed through the Hanafi fiqh issues and origins. Although they all appear to be separate and independent, their true origins lie within Hanafi fiqh. If anyone wants to substantiate this, they can take any deviated sect and they will find their issues rooted in Hanafi fiqh.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(at-Tafsil al-Jalil (p.60) Shaikh Badi ud-Din Shah ar-Rashidi as-Sindhi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Foundation of the Issues of Deviated Sects and Hanafi Fiqh</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Oh detractor, you proved deceptive in your point against us, you claimed we said, “all deviated sects are from the Ahnaf.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We did not write it in this manner nor what he intended to portray. The Ahlul Hadith and Hanafis in their own place, many Muslims apostate. A few people became Muslims and apostated during the lifetime of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, does this now mean we malign Islam? We seek refuge in Allah from such a thing. We did not say this at all that Chakralwis, Shi’a, Qadiyanis and others are from the Ahnaf. What we intended is that the origins of several issues related to deviated sects, or their support can be found in the book of the Hanafis.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from ‘Fadail As-Sahabah Sahih Riwayat Ki Roshni Mein’  (p.40-43)<br />
Tahqiq and Takhrij by Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said on the Day of Khaybar, <strong>&#8220;Tomorrow, I will surely give this flag to a man by whose hands Allah will grant victory, he loves Allah and His Messenger, and Allah and His Messenger love him.&#8221;</strong> So [the Companions] stood up, hoping that they would be granted that flag. So the next day came and all of them were hoping that they would be granted [the flag] &#8211; then [the Messenger of Allah ﷺ] said, <strong>&#8220;Where is &#8216;Ali?&#8221;</strong> So it was said to him that he was suffering from pain in his eyes, so he ordered and he (&#8216;Ali) was called for him. Then, [the Messenger of Allah ﷺ] spat in his eyes, and he became cured from his ailment until it was as if he had never been afflicted by anything. &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said, &#8220;<strong>We will fight them until they become like us (i.e., accept Islam).&#8221;</strong> So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ replied, <strong>&#8220;Slowly, until you reach their battlefield, then call them to Islam, and inform them of what is obligatory upon them, for by Allah! That one man is guided is guided through you is better for you than the red camels.&#8221;</strong> (Sahih Al-Bukhari #2942, Sahih Muslim #2406)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Allah (The Most High) granted victory to the Muslims by the hands of Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) during the Battle of Khaybar &#8211; what a lofty status it is for Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali that Allah and His Messenger love him!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Famous Companion of a great rank, the Conquerer of Al-Qadisiyyah<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, Sayyiduna Sa&#8217;d bin Abi Waqas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to &#8216;Ali, <strong>&#8220;You are, to me, in the position Harun was to Musa, except that there is no Prophet after me.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3706, Sahih Muslim #2404)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">From this Hadith, a great position is established for Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), however, one must remember that this has no relation to the Caliphate. Additionally, it is proven from this Hadith that after the Noble Prophet ﷺ until the Day of Ressurection, no Prophet will be born.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated, <strong>&#8220;By The One Who split the seed, and created the breathing, verily the Unlettered Prophet ﷺ gave me a promise that no one will love me except for the believer, and no one will hate me except for the hypocrite.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #78)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It has now become apparent that the Believers love Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali, and those that hate him are Hypocrites &#8211; all of Ahlus Sunnah love Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali and have affection towards him. [However], one must remember that to love him does not mean that a man raises the status of Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali to the likes of &#8216;Mushkil Khusa (The Solver of Difficulties)&#8217; or &#8216;Hajat Rawa (Fulfiller of Needs)&#8217;, or that he starts attacking the rest of the Noble Companions due to his great status, rather Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali has already spoken about these types of people:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>&#8220;Two [types of] men are destroyed [in regards to me]: The one who goes to extremes in exaggeration (in his love), and the one who is hateful in his speech.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Fadha&#8217;il As-Sahabah of Imam Ahmad 2/571 #964 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In another narration, Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali said, <strong>&#8220;Surely a group of people will love me until they enter The Fire due to their love for me, and surely a group of people will hate me until they enter The Fire due to their hatred for me.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Fadha&#8217;il As-Sahabah of Imam Ahmad 2/565 #952 and its chain is Sahih, Kitab As-Sunnah of Ibn Abi &#8216;Asim #983, and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Due to these statements being related to the Knowledge of the Unseen, they take the ruling of raf’ (being attributed directly to the Prophet ﷺ) – i.e., that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ informed ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) about these matters, and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is now known that two groups of people are headed for destruction:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>Those who inadvertently, out of their [extreme] love, take Sayyiduna ‘Ali to be a deity, ‘Mushkil Khusa’, ‘Hajat Rawa’, and other than these, or those that insult others from the Noble Companions, such as the extreme Rawafidh.</li>
<li>Those who insult Sayyiduna ‘Ali, such as the Khawarij and the Nawasib, and other than them.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">Note: The Ahlul-Hadith are completely free from Hakim Faiz Alam Siddiqui (the Nasibi) and other than him that attack the status of Sayyiduna ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), the Ahlul-Hadith have no connection whatsoever to the Nawasib or the Rawafidh. The way of the Ahlul-Hadith is the Kitab (Qur’an) and Sunnah and this is the way of Ahlus-Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Amir Al-Mu’minin (Chief of the Believers) ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said [as part of a lengthier narration], <strong>“I do not find anyone more deserving of this matter (leadership) than this group with whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was pleased with when he passed away.”</strong> He then named ‘Ali, ‘Uthman, Az-Zubayr, Talha, Sa’d and ‘Abdur-Rahman. <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3700)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Sa’d bin Abi Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that when the following Ayah was revealed:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">نَدْعُ أَبْنَاءَنَا وَأَبْنَاءَكُمْ</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“Let us summon our children and your children.”</strong> (Surah Ali &#8216;Imran, 3:61)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>“The Messenger of Allah ﷺ called for ‘Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn, then said, ‘Oh Allah! This is my family.’”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #2404, Darussalam Edn. #6220)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyida ‘A’isha Siddiqa (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ went out one morning whilst wearing a striped cloak made from black [camel] hear, then Hasan bin ‘Ali came and he wrapped him under it, then Al-Husayn came and he wrapped him under it with [Al-Hasan], then Fatima came and he wrapped her under it, then ‘Ali came and he wrapped him under it, then he ﷺ recited:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيُذْهِبَ عَنْكُمُ الرِّجْسَ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ وَيُطَهِّرَكُمْ تَطْهِيرًا‏</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“Allah only wishes to remove Ar-Rijs from you, O Ahlul-Bayt, and to purify you with a thorough purification.”</strong> (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:33)<br />
<em>(Sahih Muslim #2424)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The great virtues of Sayyiduna ‘Ali have been established through these Authentic Ahadith – [It should be noted that] the Mothers of the Believers (the wives of the Prophet ﷺ) also enter into ‘Ahlul-Bayt’, Sayyiduna Zayd bin Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>“His wives are from his Ahlul-Bayt.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #2408, Darussalam Edn. #6225)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Imran bin Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said [as part of a lengthier narration], <strong>“Verily ‘Ali is from me and I am from him, and he is the ally of every believer.”</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3712 and its chain is Hasan)</em>, meaning that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ loved ‘Ali and ‘Ali loved him, and every believer loves ‘Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Zayd bin Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“For whosoever I am his Mawla, ‘Ali is his Mawla.”</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3713 and its chain is Sahih)</em>, in the [Arabic] language, a special friend can also be referred to as a ‘Mawla’ <em>(Al-Qamus Al-Wahid p. 1900) </em>– the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Sayyiduna Zayd bin Harith (may Allah be pleased with him), <strong>“You are our brother and our Mawla.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #2699), </em>and he ﷺ also said regarding Sayyiduna Julaybib (may Allah be pleased with him), <strong>“He is from me and I am from him.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #2472, Darussalam Edn. #6358)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Some of the Rafidha use the Hadith of Wilayat as evidence for the Caliphate of Sayyiduna ‘Ali (i.e., that he had the most right to leadership) and propagate this, however, on account of the previous and upcoming evidences (which will be discussed later on), their argument is invalidated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On one occasion, Sayyiduna ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was in a state of illness when the Noble Prophet ﷺ passed by and supplicated for him, <strong>“Oh Allah! Restore his health”</strong> or<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> <strong>“Oh Allah! Cure him”</strong>, and Sayyiduna ‘Ali said, <strong>“So I did not suffer from my ailment again.”</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3564 and he (Abu ‘Isa At-Tirmidhi) said, ‘This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith.’, and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Famous Tabi’i Abu Ishaq As-Sabi’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said, <strong>“I saw Amir Al-Mu’minin (meaning ‘Ali) on the pulpit, and his head [hair] and beard were white.”</strong> <em>(Kitab Al-Ma’rifah wa’t-Tarikh of Al-Farisi 2/621 and its chain is Sahih, Tarikh Dimashq 45/17, Musannaf ‘Abdur-Razzaq 3/188-189 #5267)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is now known from this narration that to apply hennah or to dye the hair (when it turns white) is not obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>“Show reverence to Muhammad ﷺ by looking after his family.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3713)</em>, meaning whoever has love for Sayyiduna ‘Ali, Hasan, Husayn and the entirety of the Noble Companions will be gathered with the Noble Prophet ﷺ on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Zayd bin Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) said,<strong> “The first to accept Islam was ‘Ali.”</strong> ‘Amr bin Murrah (one of the narrators) mentioned this to Ibrahim An-Nakha’i (a junior Tabi’i), who rejected it and said, <strong>“The first to accept Islam was Abu Bakr As-Siddiq.”</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3735, and he [Abu ‘Isa At-Tirmidhi] said, ‘This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith.’, and its chain is Sahih)</em>, meaning the first to accept Islam from the children was Sayyiduna ‘Ali, and the first to accept Islam from the men was Sayyiduna Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with them both), and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>“The first to accept Islam was ‘Ali, may Allah be pleased with him.”</strong> <em>(Mu’jam As-Sahabah of Al-Baghawi 4/357 #1810 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">‘Urwah bin Az-Zubayr (may Allah have mercy on him) said that ‘Ali accepted Islam at the age of eight. <em>(Mu’jam As-Sahabah of Al-Baghawi 4/357 #1810 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Abdullah bin Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “<strong>We used to say that the most virtuous of the People of Madinah was ‘Ali bin Abi Talib.”</strong> <em>(Fadha’il As-Sahabah of Imam Ahmad 2/602 #1033 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">During the Battle of Khaybar, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib answered the call of Marhab the Jew (i.e., in battle), saying, <strong>“I am the one whose mother named him Haydar (Lion).”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #1807) </em>Thereafter, he killed Marhab and victory at Khaybar was achieved through his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was upon [Mount] Hira’, and so were Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, ‘Ali, Talha and Zubayr – then the mountain moved (i.e., started trembling), so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“Be calm! For there is no one upon you except for a Prophet, or a Siddiq (truthful one) or a Martyr.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #2417)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“Whosoever hurts ‘Ali has hurt me.”</strong> <em>(Fadha’il As-Sahabah of Al-Qati’i #1078 and its chain is Hasan, and it has supporting evidence with Ibn Hibban in Al-Mawarid #2202, and Al-Hakim 3/123 who authenticated it, and Adh-Dhahabi agreed with him)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated, <strong>“The people were complaining about ‘Ali, so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up amongst us to deliver a sermon, then I heard him saying, ‘O People! Do not complain about ‘Ali, for by Allah, he is the toughest (i.e., he does not make concessions for anyone) regarding Allah or in the path of Allah (Jihad).”</strong> <em>(Musnad Ahmad 3/86, Mustadarak Al-Hakim 3/134 and he authenticated it, and Adh-Dhahabi agreed, and its chain is Hasan.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>“Verily I hope that I, ‘Uthman, Talha and Zubayr are from those that Allah, Mighty and Majestic, said [regarding]:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِمْ مِنْ غِلٍّ إِخْوَانًا عَلَىٰ سُرُرٍ مُتَقَابِلِينَ</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>‘And We shall remove any bitterness from their hearts, [so they will be like] brothers facing each other on thrones.’ [Al-Hijr, 15:47]”</strong><br />
<em>(Fadha’il As-Sahabah of Imam Ahmad #1057, and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Abu Ishaq As-Sabi’i narrated, <strong>“I saw ‘Ali, so my father said to me, ‘Stand and look at Amir Al-Mu’minin (the Chief of the Believers)!’ So I stood up and I did not see him dye his beard, his beard was large and great.”</strong> <em>(Tabaqat Al-Kubra of Ibn Sa’d 3/25, and its chain is Sahih, Yunus bin Abi Ishaq is innocent from Tadlis)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Imam of Ahlus-Sunnah, Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal (may Allah have mercy on him), said,<strong> “No number of virtues has been narrated for anyone from the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ as has been narrated for ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him.”</strong> <em>(Mustadarak Al-Hakim 3/107,108 #4572 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In summary, Sayyiduna ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was a veteran of Badr, from the Sabiqun Al-Awwalun (the foremost to embrace Islam), Amir Al-Mu’minin (Chief of the Believers), a Rightly-Guided Caliph, his virtues are endless and this short article is incapable of covering all of them, Imam Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Al-Husayn Al-Ajurri (d. 360H, may Allah have mercy on him) said, <strong>“So know, may Allah have mercy upon us and you, that Allah Al-Karim has honoured Amir Al-Mu’minin ‘Ali bin Abi Talib with the most lofty eminence, his precedence’s in goodness are great, his virtues are many, his merit is immense, his importance is revered and his rank is noble. He is the brother of the Messenger ﷺ, the son of his uncle, the husband of Fatimah, the father of Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, the Knight of the Muslims, the one that would remove anguish from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, the killer of the enemies, the just and ascetic Imam in this worldly life longing for the next, the follower of the truth fleeing from falsehood, and the one that possesses every noble character. Allah (Mighty and Majestic) and his Messenger ﷺ both love him, and he loves Allah and the Messenger, he is the one who is not loved except by a pious believer and is not hated except by a miserable hypocrite, [he is] a treasure of intellect, knowledge, gentleness, and manners, may Allah be pleased with him.”</strong> <em>(Kitab Ash-Shari’ah p. 714, 715) </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">O Allah! Fill our hearts with a complete love for Sayyiduna Abu Bakr, Sayyiduna ‘Umar, Sayyiduna ‘Uthman, Sayyiduna ‘Ali, and the rest of the Noble Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all)! Amin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> The Battle of Al-Qadisiyyah occurred in the 14<sup>th</sup> Hijri year, according to the most correct opinion chosen by Ibn Jarir At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him), and it occurred in Al-Qadisiyyah, near ‘Iraq. Sa’d bin Abi Waqas (may Allah be pleased with him) was the Commander of the Muslim Army, and with him were more than 30,000 soldiers. The Commander of the opposing army was Rustam, who had 120,000 soldiers with him, including 33 elephants, and the battle was a victory for the Muslims – see Tarikh At-Tabari 3/479.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Shu’ba, a narrator of this Hadith, doubted which wording was more correct.</p>

Tahqiq and Takhrij by Shaykh Zubair &#8216;Aliza&#8217;i</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna &#8216;Amr bin Al-&#8216;As (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that, <strong>&#8220;I asked the Prophet ﷺ, &#8216;Who is the most beloved person to you?&#8217; He ﷺ replied, &#8216;A&#8217;isha.&#8217; So I said, &#8216;And from the men?&#8217; He ﷺ replied, &#8216;Her father (Abu Bakr).&#8217; So I said, &#8216;And then?&#8217; And he ﷺ replied, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.'&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3662, Sahih Muslim #2384)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Muhammad bin &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib, famously known as Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah (may Allah have mercy upon him), narrated that, <strong>&#8220;I asked my father (Ali bin Abi Talib), &#8216;Which of the people, after the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, are the best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I said, &#8216;Then who?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Umar.'&#8221;¹</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3671)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Sayyiduna Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) has been mentioned in the Glorious Qur&#8217;an, Allah (Exalted is He) says,</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">إِلَّا تَنْصُرُوهُ فَقَدْ نَصَرَهُ اللَّهُ إِذْ أَخْرَجَهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ثَانِيَ اثْنَيْنِ إِذْ هُمَا فِي الْغَارِ إِذْ يَقُولُ لِصَاحِبِهِ لَا تَحْزَنْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَنَا ۖ</h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center">&#8220;And if you do not help him (the Prophet ﷺ) , then surely Allah has helped him when those that disbelieved drove him out, as the second of the two; when they were in the cave, he (the Prophet ﷺ) said to his companion (Abu Bakr): Do not grieve, verily Allah is with us.&#8221; <em>(Surah At-Tawbah, Ayah #60)</em></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;The person that has favoured me the most with his companionship and his wealth is Abu Bakr, and if I were to take anyone other than my Rabb as a Khalil, then I would have taken Abu Bakr as my Khalil &#8211; but the Islamic Brotherhood is superior. Close all the small doors to the Masjid [An-Nabawi] except the door of Abu Bakr.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3654, Sahih Muslim #2382)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that, <strong>&#8220;The Prophet ﷺ asked the Companions: &#8216;Is anyone amongst you fasting today?&#8217; Abu Bakr replied, &#8216;I am.&#8217; He ﷺ said, &#8216;Has anyone amongst you followed a funeral precession today?&#8217; Abu Bakr replied, &#8216;I have.&#8217; He ﷺ said, &#8216;Has anyone amongst you fed the poor today?&#8217; Abu Bakr replied, &#8216;I have.&#8217; He ﷺ said, &#8216;Has anyone amongst you visited the ill today?&#8217; Abu Bakr replied, &#8216;I have.&#8217; The Prophet ﷺ then said, &#8216;[These deeds] are not combined in a man except that he will enter Paradise.'&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #1028, #2387)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>&#8220;I was with the Prophet ﷺ in a garden from the gardens of Madinah &#8211; a man came and asked for permission to enter, so the Prophet ﷺ said, &#8216;Open [the gate] for him, and give him glad tidings of Paradise.&#8217; So I opened the gate, and it was Abu Bakr.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3693, Sahih Muslim #2403)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And it has reached us in one famous Hadith that the Prophet ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Abu Bakr is in Paradise.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3747 and its chain is Sahih, and Ibn Hibban authenticated it in Al-Ihsan #6963)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is narrated from Sayyiduna Anas bin Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that, <strong>&#8220;On one occasion, the Prophet ﷺ, Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar and &#8216;Uthman ascended Mount Uhud, and it shook due to their presence, so the Prophet ﷺ struck it with his foot, and said: &#8216;Be firm O Uhud!

<p style="text-align: justify">Umar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>&#8220;Were the Iman (faith) of Abu Bakr to be weighed against the Iman of the People of the Earth, his would have outweighed theirs.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Kitab Al-Sunnah of &#8216;Abdullah bin Ahmad #821 and its chain is Hasan, Shu&#8217;ab Al-Iman of Al-Bayhaqi #36, Aqidatus Salaf wa Ashabul Hadith of Al-Sabuni #110, and Fadhail Abi Bakr of Khaythama Al-Atrabulsi #133)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The virtues of Sayyiduna Abu Bakr As-Siddiq are so numerous that a summarised article will not be able to contain all of their details &#8211; <strong>the Imam of Ahlus Sunnah, Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal (may Allah have mercy upon him) was asked about a person that curses Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and &#8216;A&#8217;isha, so he said, &#8221; &#8220;I do not see him to be upon Islam.&#8221;² </strong><em>(As-Sunnah of Al-Khallal #779 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal said, <strong>&#8220;I asked my father (Imam Ahmad) about a man that reviles a man from the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ, so he said, &#8216;I do not see him to be upon Islam.'&#8221;</strong> <em>(As-Sunnah of Al-Khallal #782 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Faqih (Jurist), Abid (Worshipper), Tabi&#8217;i, Imam Masruq bin Al-Ajda&#8217; (may Allah have mercy upon him) said, <strong>&#8220;Love for Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and knowledge of their virtues is from the Sunnah.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Kitab Al-&#8216;Ilal wa Ma&#8217;rifatul Rijal #945 and its chain is Hasan, Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jama&#8217;at of Al-Lalaka&#8217;i #2322)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu Ja&#8217;far Muhammad bin &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husayn Al-Baqir (may Allah have mercy upon him) said, <strong>&#8220;Whoever is ignorant of the virtues of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, then he is surely ignorant of the Sunnah.&#8221; </strong><em>(Kitab Ash-Shari&#8217;ah of Al-Ajurri #1803 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Ja&#8217;far bin Muhammad As-Sadiq³ (may Allah have mercy upon him) said, <strong>&#8220;Allah is free from those that disassociated from Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar.&#8221;⁴</strong> <em>(Fadhail Al-Sahaba of Imam Ahmad #143 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu Ja&#8217;far Muhammad bin &#8216;Ali Al-Baqir⁵ (may Allah have mercy upon him) once said while ill, <strong>&#8220;Oh Allah! Verily I take Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar as allies and I love them both, and if there is anything other than this within myself then do not grant me the intercession of Muhammad ﷺ on the Day of Resurrection!&#8221;</strong> <em>(Tarikh Dimashq of Ibn Asakir 57/223 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu Ishaq As-Sabi&#8217;i (may Allah have mercy upon him) said, <strong>&#8220;Hatred of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar is from the Kaba&#8217;ir (Major Sins).&#8221;</strong> <em>(Fadhail Al-Sahaba of Abdullah bin Ahmad #385 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Oh Allah! Fill our hearts with love for Abu Bakr and all of the Noble Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them), and increase us in this love &#8211; Amin!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> This statement of Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali is mutawatir (mass-transmitted) from him &#8211;  Shaykh Al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah said, <strong>&#8220;And it has been mass-transmitted from him (ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib) that he used to say on the pulpit of Kūfa: &#8216;The best of this Ummah after its Prophet is Abū Bakr and ʿUmar.&#8217; This was narrated from him from more than 80 ways (chains of narration).&#8221;</strong> <em>(Minhaj Al-Sunnah An-Nabawiyyah 1/308) </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:]</strong> The Righteous Salaf were severe on this matter &#8211; <strong>A man asked Al-Faryābī about someone that curses Abu Bakr, he said, &#8220;Kāfir.&#8221; He then asked, &#8220;So do we pray over him (the Janāzah)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;How do we do such a thing while he says, &#8216;La ilaaha illAllah&#8217;?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Do not touch him with your hands, push him with a piece of wood until he&#8217;s buried in his pit.&#8221;</strong> (<em>Al-Ibanah As-Sughra of Ibn Battah #196)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">³ <strong>[TN:]</strong> He is Abu &#8216;Abdillah Ja&#8217;far As-Sadiq bin Muhammad Al-Baqir bin &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husayn bin &#8216;Abi bin Abi Talib, his mother was Umm Farwah bint Al-Qasim bin Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, and her mother was Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr, so he was a descendant of Abu Bakr, and due to this he would say, <strong>&#8220;Abu Bakr gave birth to me twice.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Siyar A&#8217;lam An-Nubala</em> <em>6/255)</em> He was an Imam of the Salaf, and the Rafidha took him as the Sixth Imam, and attributed thousands of lies to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">⁴ <strong>[TN:]</strong> Tabarri (or Bara&#8217;a) is a core doctrine of the Shi&#8217;a, which entails disavowal and disassociation from the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ. Muhammad Baqir Al-Majlisi summarised these beliefs as follows: &#8220;Our belief is that absolution is necessary from four idols: Yaghut, Yauq, Nasr and Hubal [Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Mu&#8217;awiyah], and the four female idols: Laat, Uzza, Manat and Shira [&#8216;A&#8217;isha, Hafsa, Hind and Umm Hakam], [&#8230;] Verily these are the worst of Allah&#8217;s creatures.&#8221; <em>(Haqqul Yaqeeen, Published by Jafari Propagation Centre 2012)</em>, and we seek refuge in Allah from such vile beliefs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">⁵ <strong>[TN:]</strong> He is the Sayyid, Al-Imam, Abu Ja&#8217;far Muhammad bin &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husayn bin &#8216;Ali, Al-&#8216;Alawi Al-Fatimi Al-Madini, son of Zayn Al-&#8216;Abidin, and was known by Al-Baqir &#8211; the one that split knowledge <em>(Siyar A&#8217;lam An-Nubala 4/402)</em>. He was an Imam, and a Mujtahid, but the Rafidha took him as the Fifth Imam, and lied upon him greatly.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><em>Taken from ‘Faḍā’il-e-Ṣaḥāba Ṣaḥīḥ Aḥadīth Ki Roshnī Mein’ (p.125-130)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Noble Prophet ﷺ said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“Paradise is obligatory (i.e. guaranteed) for the first army from my Ummah that undertakes Jihād on the Ocean.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 2924)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This Jihād occurred during the time of the Khilāfat of Sayyidunā Muʿāwiya bin Abī Sufyān (<em>Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 6282, 6283)</em>, and Sayyidunā Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān participated in that Jihād <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 2799, 2800).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Sayyidunā ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said: I was playing with the children when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ arrived, I had thought that he arrived for me so I hid behind the door, so he pat me on the back and said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“Go and call Muʿāwiya for me” and he (Muʿāwiya</strong><strong>) used to write the Revelation.</strong> <em>(Dalāi’l An-Nabuwwah of Bayhaqī 2/243, and its chain is ḥasan)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">From this we understand that Sayyidunā Muʿāwiya was a scribe of the Qur’ān, Hafiẓ Ibn ‘Asākir wrote: <strong>“[Muʿāwiya is the] uncle of the believers, and the scribe of the revelation of the Rabb of the Worlds, he accepted Islām on Yawm Al-Fatḥ (the day of conquest).”</strong> <em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/38)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The famous tābi’ī ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Ubaydullāh ibn Abī Mulaykah Al-Makkī narrated that Muʿāwiya prayed one rak’at (cycle) of witr after ‘Ishā, then Ibn ‘Abbās said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“He is correct, verily he is a faqīh.”</strong> <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 3765)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In opposition to this narration, Ṭaḥawī Al-Ḥanafī, “from Mālik b. Yaḥyā (who Ibn Ḥibbān is alone in declaring trustworthy), from ‘Abdul Wahhāb b. ‘Aṭā who said: from Imran b. Ḥadīr,,,” narrated a rejected narration using this chain <em>(Sharḥ Ma’ānī Al-Āthār 1/289)</em>. This narration is rejected on account of it opposing the narration of Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī, and Ṭaḥawīs claim that Ibn ‘Abbās said “He is correct.” by way of Taqiyyah is incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Ṣaḥābī ‘Abdur Raḥmān b. Abī ‘Umayrah narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said for Muʿāwiya: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“Oh Allāh! Make him a guiding one, and guide [others] through him.” </strong><em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhī No. 3842, and he [Imām Abū ʿĪsā At-Tirmidhī] said, “This is a ḥadīth ḥasan gharīb.”, Tārīkh Al-Kabīr of Al-Bukhārī 5/240, Tabaqāt Ibn Sa’d 7/487, Al-Āḥād wal Mathānī of Ibn Abī ‘Āṣim 2/358 No. 1129, Musnad Aḥmad 4/216 No. 17895, and it is a Ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This narration is from Marwān bin Muḥammad and other than him from Sa’īd bin ‘Abdul Azīz, and Marwāns narrations from Sa’īd bin ‘Abdul Azīz are in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim <em>(108/1043, No. 2403 [Darussalam Edition])</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It has been established that Sa’īd bin ‘Abdul Azīz’s narrations were narrated before he lost his memory <em>(As-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 1969)</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>It is narrated from Umm ‘Alqamah (Marjāna) that Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān</strong><strong> arrived in Madīnah and asked ʿĀʾishah</strong><strong> for the cloak and hair of the Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>, then he put the cloak on and dipped the hair into water and drank it and poured it over his body. </strong><em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/106 and its chain is ḥasan, and Marjāna is trustworthy according to Al-‘Ijilī and Ibn Ḥibbān.)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It is narrated from Maswar bin Makhrama that he and one delegation went to Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān and Muʿāwiya fulfilled all his needs, then Muʿāwiya called him saying, “What happened to your criticism of the rulers?”. Maswar said, “Leave this, and have good behaviour as we previously had.” Muʿāwiya said, “No, by Allāh! You have to tell me about yourself and why you are criticising me.” Maswar said that he told him every fault he saw in him. Muʿāwiya said, “No one is free from sin, O Maswar! Do you know how much I have tried to correct the people? One good deed will have the reward of ten, or will you keep counting the sins and forsaking the good actions?” Maswar said, “No, by Allāh! We only mention the sins that we see.” Muʿāwiya said, “We acknowledge every one of our sins in front of Allāh – O Maswar! Do you not have some sins that you fear that if they are not forgiven that you will perish?” Maswar said, “Yes.” Muʿāwiya said, “What has made you deserving of forgiveness that you do not hope for me? By Allāh! I try harder than you to rectify but by Allāh! In two matters, I only prefer one. Between Allah and other than him, I only choose Allah. I am upon this religion in which Allāh accepts righteous actions, He recompenses for good deeds and sins except for those who He chooses to forgive. I hope that for every righteous action I do, Allāh will recompense me many times over. I am facing great matters that neither you nor I can count – I have established the Salah, and Jihād in the way of Allāh, and have established a system that rules by what Allāh has revealed and like this there are other matters that if I told you, you wouldn’t be able to count them – ponder on this.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Maswar said that he understood that Muʿāwiya overcame him in this conversation. <strong>‘Urwah bin Al-Zubayr said, “After this we never heard Maswar censuring Muʿāwiya, he used to pray for his forgiveness.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Baghdād 48/208,209 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Ja’far Aṣ-Ṣādiq, with the following sanad: “Qāsim b. Muḥammad said: Muʿāwiya b. Abī Sufyān said:”, narrated a ḥadīth in which Qāsim bin Muḥammad (bin Abī Bakr) said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“So, the people were amazed at the truthfulness of Muʿāwiya</strong><strong>.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/115 and its chain is ḥasan)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">From this narration we understand that Amīr Muʿāwiya was truthful in the view of the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Sayyidunā ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“I have not seen anyone more befitting, meaning to rule (after the Rightly-Guided Caliphs) than Muʿāwiya.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/121 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Muṣannaf ‘Abdur-Razzāq 11/453 No. 20985)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">‘Irbāḍ bin Sāriyah narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“O Allāh! Teach Muʿāwiya Al-Kitāb and Al-Ḥisāb and save him from the Punishment.” </strong><em>(Musnad Aḥmad 6/127 No. 17152 and its chain is ḥasan, Ṣaḥīḥ ibn Khuzaymah 1938)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Amīr Muʿāwiya</strong> passed away in 60H – one should always stay silent on the battles that occurred between the noble companions due to ijtihad (i.e. they were seeking the truth). Imām of Ahlus-Sunnah Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal said, “Whenever you see a man cursing the companions of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, then doubt his Islām.” <em>(Manāqib Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal of Ibn Al-Jawzī No. 160, and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Tarīkh Dimashq 62/144)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Mu’āfa bin ‘Imrān al-Mauṣilī (d. 185H) was asked about Amīr Muʿāwiya, so he said: <strong>“Nobody can be placed next to the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>, Muʿāwiya was his companion, and he was the brother of Ummul Mu’minīn Umm Ḥabība</strong><strong>, and he was his scribe and the one entrusted [with the writing of] the Revelation of Allāh.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Baghdād 1/209 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Tarīkh Dimashq 62/143)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal said, <strong>“Whoever belittles anyone from amongst the Companions of Messenger of Allāh</strong> ﷺ<strong>, then he does not harbour anything except an affliction, and he has a hidden evil towards the best of the People, and they are the Companions of Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>.” </strong><em>(As-Sunnah of Al-Khallāl 2/477 No. 758, and the Muḥaqqiq said: its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibrahīm bin Maysarah Aṭ-Ṭā’ifī narrated that <strong>‘Umar bin ‘Abdul Azīz</strong><strong> never hit anyone except one man that cursed Muʿāwiya</strong><strong>, so he whipped him. </strong>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/145 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">163 aḥadīth are narrated by Amīr Muʿāwiya in Musnad Baqī bin Makhlad <em>(Siyar A’lām An-Nubalā 3/162)</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Those that narrated from him [from the companions] include:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="color: #000000">Jarīr b. ‘Abdullāh Al-Bajalī</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">As-Sā’ib b. Yazīd</span></li>

<li><span style="color: #000000">Abu Sa’īd Al-Khudrī and other than him from the Noble Companions, may Allāh be pleased with them all.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">[And from the successors:]</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="color: #000000">Abul Sha’thā</span></li>

<li><span style="color: #000000">Abū Salamah b. ‘Abdul Raḥmān and other than him from the tābi’īn, may Allāh have mercy upon them all. <em>(Tadhībul Kamāl 18/201,202)</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In the view of Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jama’āh, all the Companions are considered truthful in their narrations (‘Ādil) <em>(Ikthiṣār ‘Ulūm Al-Ḥadīth of Ibn Kathīr 2/498)</em>. Those differences that occurred between them out of ijtihad, and the fighting that happened, they are excused, and we should remain completely silent about them. O Allāh! Fill our hearts with a complete love for the Companions and save us from insulting and degrading them! Āmīn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">رضي الله عنهم أجمعين</span></p>
