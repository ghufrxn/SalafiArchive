<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sa&#8217;īd bin Abī Burdah brought out a letter and said: &#8216;This is the letter of &#8216;Umar&#8217; then it was (also) read upon Sufyān (as follows):<br />
&#8220;</strong><strong>From here (&#8216;Umar) to Abū Mūsā al-Ash&#8217;arī:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To proceed, Indeed judgement is obligatory, unabrogated and it is a Sunnah (from the prophet) that is followed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Therefore, </strong><strong>have insight when (a case) is presented to you for there is no benefit in a speaker of  truth without it being implemented.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Treat people equally in your gatherings, in your attention, and in your justice, so that the noble one does not expect your partiality, and the weak does not fear your injustice.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The (burden of) proof is upon the claimant and the oath is upon the one who denies.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reconciliation is permissible between Muslims, except a reconciliation that permits the Ḥarām or forbids the Ḥalāl.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Let not a judgment you passed yesterday</strong><strong> after which you reconsidered and were guided to the right course, prevent you from returning to the truth. For indeed, truth is timeless and indeed, nothing invalidates the truth. And (remember) that returning to the truth is better than persisting in falsehood.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have understanding, Have understanding regarding what stirs doubt in you and resort to that which is dearest to Allah and most resembles the truth, in your view.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Grant the claimant a fixed period that ends. If he brings proof, (judge accordingly); otherwise, direct the judgment against him. For that is clearer in removing blindness (ambiguity) and more conclusive for the justification (in judgement).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Muslims are considered reliable witnesses for or against each other, except for one who has been flogged for a Ḥadd, one proven to have given false testimony, or one accused (of bias) due to allegiance or kinship.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Indeed Allah has taken charge of the secrets amongst you and averted (judgment based on suspicion) from you by means of clear proofs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Then, beware of weariness, anxiety, causing harm to others, being hostile to opponents in situations where upholding truth guarantees reward (from Allah) and honorable mention (afterwards).</strong></li>
<li><strong>For whoever purifies their intention between themselves and Allah, Allah suffices them in their dealings with people. But whoever deceives people with what Allah knows to be false, Allah will expose them.&#8221;</strong><em>[Sunan al-Dāraquṭnī 4472 with Ṣaḥiḥ Isnād]</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left">Shaykh al-Albānī said in Irwā al-Ghalīl 8/241: <strong>&#8220;And it is a Ṣaḥiḥ Wijādah (narrating from someone through their writings), from the most authentic Wijādāt and it is an evidence.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ahmad Shākir said in his ta&#8217;leeq on al-Muḥallā (1/60):<strong> &#8220;This is a Ṣaḥiḥ Wijādah given the strength of the Ṣaḥiḥ Isnād&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>A number of scholars have explained this letter or parts of it such as <strong>al-Suy</strong><strong>ūṭī</strong> (al-Ashbāh wa al-Naẓāir p. 7 onwards), <strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> (I&#8217;lām/A&#8217;lām al-Muwaqqi&#8217;īn 1/187), <strong>Ibn al-Qāsim</strong> (al-Iḥkām sharḥ uṣūl al-Aḥkām 4/506 onwards) and <strong>Ṣiddīq Ḥasan Khān</strong> (Ẓifr al-Lāḍī p. 77 onwards)</p>
<p style="text-align: right">قال البيهقي:ـ<br />
وَهُوَ ‌كِتَابٌ ‌مَعْرُوفٌ ‌مَشْهُورٌ ‌لَابُدَّ ‌لِلْقُضَاةِ مِنْ مَعْرِفَتِهِ وَالْعَمَلِ بِهِ [معرفة السنن ١٤/ ٢٤٠]
<p style="text-align: left">al-Bayhaqi said:<br />
<strong>&#8220;And it is a well-known letter, it&#8217;s incumbent on the judges to be familiar with it and act upon it&#8221; </strong><em>[Ma&#8217;rifat al-Sunan 14/240]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">ابن تيمية:ـ<br />
وَرِسَالَةُ عُمَرَ الْمَشْهُورَةُ فِي الْقَضَاءِ إِلَى أَبِي مُوسَى الْأَشْعَرِيِّ ‌تَدَاوَلَهَا ‌الْفُقَهَاءُ، ‌وَبَنَوْا عَلَيْهَا وَاعْتَمَدُوا عَلَى مَا فِيهَا مِنَ الْفِقْهِ وَأُصُولِ الْفِقْهِ [منهاج السنة ٦/ ٧١]
<p style="text-align: left">Ibn Taymiyyah said:<br />
<strong>&#8220;The famous letter of &#8216;Umar in judiciary to</strong> <strong>Abū Mūsā al-Ash&#8217;ari has been widely circulated amongst the Fuqahā, they built upon it (principles) and they relied upon it what it contains of Fiqh and Uṣūl al-Fiqh&#8221;</strong> <em>[Minhāj al-Sunnah 6/71]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">قال ابن القيم:ـ<br />
وهذا كتاب جليل تلقَّاه العلماء بالقبول، وبنَوا عليه أصول الحكم والشهادة. والحاكمُ والمفتي أحوجُ شيء إليه، وإلى تأمُّلِه، والتفقُّهِ فيه</p>
<p>Ibn al-Qayyim said:<br />
<strong>&#8220;And this is a great letter which has been accepted by the scholars, they built upon it principles of rulings and witnesses. The ruler and the Muftī are in greatest need of it as well as pondering over it and gaining understanding through it.&#8221; </strong><em>[I&#8217;lām/A&#8217;lām al-Muwaqqi&#8217;īn 1/187]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right">قال ابن كثير:ـ<br />
هذا أثر مشهور [مسند الفاروق ٢/ ٤٣٧]

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated by</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
[Translated in 2001, but published for the first time now]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Anas RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Straighten your rows as straightening the rows is part of establishing of the prayer.” </em>(Sahih al-Bukhari no.723).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The wording of the hadith through another chain of transmission is,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Straighten your rows, as the straightening of rows is from perfecting the prayer”</em> (Sahih Muslim no.124/433, Abu Dawud no.688, Ibn Majah no. 993, Musnad Abu Awanah 2/38, Sunan ad-Darimi no.1266, Musnad Ahmad 3/177, 253, 273, 279, 291).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We learn from this hadith straightening the rows is from establishing and the completion of the prayer. This would mean uneven rows or rows that are not straight would lead to deficiency of the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“</em><em>Straighten the rows in the prayer, as the straightening of the rows is from the perfection of the prayer.”</em> (Sahih al-Bukhari no. 723, Abdur-Razzaq no.2424).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu also narrates Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Perfect the straightening of the rows in prayer.”</em> (Musnad Ahmad 2/485). The narrators of this hadith are of the Sahihayn. Allaamah al-Albani graded it authentic (Sahih at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib 1/271 no.496, Sahih Ibn Hibban, Mawarid no.384, Majma’ az-Zawa’id 2/92).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We learn from these hadith straightening the rows is from perfecting and beautifying the prayer and this is what Allah’s Messenger ﷺ ordered. If the rows are not straight, it will lead to deficiency in the prayer. The straightening of the rows applies when standing and when in ruku and it is obligatory. In fact Allah’s Messenger ﷺ would first perfect the straightening of the rows and then commence the prayer. If the rows were not straight he would straighten them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Nu’man b. Bashir RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“The Messenger of Allah </em><em>ﷺ used to straighten the rows until he made them like a spear or an arrow. Once he saw a man’s chest (sticking out) so Allah’s Messenger </em><em>ﷺ said, make your rows straight or Allah will create division among you.”</em> (Ibn Majah no.994, Abu Dawud no.663, Sahih Muslim no.128/436, Sahih al-Bukhari no.717 summarised)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Bara b. A’zib RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Allah’s Messenger ﷺ used to pass through the row from one side to the other; he used to set out chests and shoulders in order, and say, and do not differ in case your hearts also differ.. And he would say: Allah and His angels bless those who are near the first rows.”</em> (Abu Dawud no.664, Nasa’i no.810, Ibn Majah no.997. Zawa’id Ibn Majah mentions the chain is authentic and its narrators are trustworthy).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We learn from these authentic hadith, the rows should be straightened before the prayer. We also learn another duty of the Imam is to straighten the rows and to correct any shortcomings. It is a shame the Imams nowadays do not dispense this duty and they begin the prayer as soon as the iqamah is announced.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Worshippers should stand in the rows ensuring their feet and shoulders touch the feet and shoulders of those praying next to them without any gaps between them. Allah’s Messenger ﷺ ordered to fil the gaps in the row.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abdullah Ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhum said The Prophet ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Straighten the rows, stand shoulder to shoulder, fill the gaps, be gentle in the hands of your brothers, and do not leave gaps for shaytan. If anyone connects a row, Allah will connect him, but if anyone breaks a row, Allah will cut him off.”</em> (Abu Dawud no.666, Nasa’i no. 818, summarised, al-Bayhaqi 3/101, Ibn Khuzaimah no.1549, Mustadrak al-Hakim 1/213. Iman Hakım and adh-Dhahabi authenticated it according to the conditions of Imam Muslim. Allamah Al-Albani authenticated it in Sahih Targhib wa’t Tarhib no. 492, Musnad Ahmad 2/98).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Mundhiri explained the word ‘Farjat’, <em>“It is the plural of farjah and it refers to the gap and space between two people.”</em> We learn from this hadith we should close the gaps in the rows and there should be no space of gap between two worshippers who are praying. The action of the people who leave a gap of four fingers or more is incorrect and they should rectify this.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Anas RadhiAllahu Anhu RadhiAllahu Anhu,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“I saw each of us joining our shoulder with the shoulder of our companion and our feet with their feet, but if you were to practice this today, a person would flee from you like a restless mule.”</em> (Ibn Abi Shaybah 3/308 no. 3524, Dar al-Taj, Beirut, Fath al-Bari 2/211, Umdah al-Qari 5/260).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Nu’man b. Bashir RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“The Messenger of Allah </em><em>ﷺ</em> <em>turned to the people and said three times; straighten your rows, by Allah, you must straighten your rows, or else Allah will create disagreement between your hearts. I saw each man join shoulder to shoulder with that of his companion, knee to knee with that of his companion, and ankle bone to ankle bone with that of his [companion]”.</em> (Abu Dawud no.662, Sahih al-Bukhari in note form, Musnad Ahmad 4/276, Ibn Hibban no.396, ad-Daraqutni 1/282-283, al-Bayhaqi 3/100-101).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Uthman an-Nahdi said</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>&#8220;I was from the people whose feet Umar RadhiAllahu Anhu hit in order to straighten the row”</em> (al-Muhalla of Ibn Hazm 4/58, Mawsu’ah Fiqh Umar b. al-Khattab, p.445, Ibn Abi Shaybah 1/30 no.3530, Fath al-Bari, 2/210).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Salih b. Kaysan narrates Abdullah b. Umar RadhiAllahu Anhum said</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s more beloved to me that two of my teeth break that I see a gap in the row and I don’t fill it.&#8221;</em> (Abdur-Razzaq 2/57 no.2473, Ibn Abi Shaybah 1/333, al-Muhalla 4/59).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So, we learn from these authentic hadith that we should straighten the rows before we start praying and to close any gaps in the row, and this is an obligation. Every worshipper should join shoulder to shoulder and feet to feet with his brother in a gentle way. The Imam should begin the prayer once the row is straight in the beginning. Similarly, the row should be not be straightened once in ruku but rather before when everyone stands to commence the prayer. Similarly, the complete feet should join and not just a one toe as the Companions did and no one should run like a restless mule. The worshippers who fill the gaps will receive reward from Allah. May Allah give us tawfiq to do righteous actions and save us from exaggeration and leniency. Amin  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">By</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Aqeel al-Hindi</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the charges against the people of hadith is that their role within Islamic scholastics is one of compilation and transcription of the Sunnah for its benefit as a legislative source for those with the tools who fully understand it and can use it. Those who follow this line of thought argue that the one-dimensional role of the scholars of Hadith can be juxtaposed with the more complex, intricate and cognitive role of the Fuqaha. While it is true that it <em>can</em> be the case that a memoriser of Ahadith may not have complete understanding of what they convey<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, to tar the people of hadith in their entirety with such a brush is an injustice at best and libellous at worst. As will be demonstrated in this article, the well-known scholars of Hadith were individuals whose faculties for memorisation <em>and</em> understanding of the narrations they conveyed were gifts from Allah, as their works attest to.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another result of this fallacy is the assertion that the books of Ahadith are purportedly too complex for anyone other than a scholar of fiqh to benefit from and the layperson is to be warned against reading them, for fear of misunderstanding and going astray. This categorisation of the books of the Sunnah as such lowers their status to one of repositories of information, to be accessed by the elite few who have understanding. While it is true that the people of knowledge will appreciate and gain more from the books of hadith than the layperson, the success that Allah has granted the scholars of hadith in their works, in terms of their practical abilities to compile their works, as well as the thought that went in to their works, means that their books are far more than stores of Ahadith and that the layperson can pick up one of these books and learn about the religion of Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As demonstrated in the article in issue no.4, &gt;&gt;&gt; <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/imam-al-bukhari-was-a-muwahhid-salafi-athari-not-a-muqallid-partisan-or-blind-follower-of-any-madhhab-he-was-upon-the-madhhab-of-ahlul-hadith/">Imam al-Bukhari was a Muwahhid and Salafi in his Aqidah and Manhaj</a></strong></span>. One of the sources of his Aqidah is his book, the Sahih. The oft-cited principle when reading the Sahih of Imam Bukhari is that his fiqh is understood through his chapter headings. So chapter headings and the titles of books within the Sahih give an understanding as relates to his Aqidah, which he based upon the Athar. Al-Mustamla narrated in his report of the Sahih adds to the chapter heading of the book of Tawhid, <em>‘The Book of Tawhid; a Rebuttal of the Jahmiyyah and other than them’.</em> Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar comments, under the chapter heading of Tawhid:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The intent behind the narration of al-Mustamla: and other than them” is the Qadariyyah. As for the Khawarij, that which relates to them proceeded in the Book of Fitan and the Rafidah in the Book of Ahkam. And these four groups are the heads of innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Hafiz’s words show that the Sahih of Imam al-Bukhari is rich in terms of its Aqidah-based content that rebuts the fundamentals of the major groups of deviation. This richness is not, however, restricted to Aqidah. Matters relating to the relaying of Ahadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, fiqh<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, the virtues of righteous actions<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> and other than this can be derived from the Sahih. Some of the scholars have taken this a step further by compiling works that that have been derived from the two Sahihs, al-Bukhari and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The books of Sunan, particularly Abu Dawud’s and at Tirmidhi’s, also demonstrate the understanding and the compiler’s had of the implications Ahadith carried, their relevance to the sciences of fiqh and the relative stances of the people of knowledge relating to them. Abu Dawud, for example, states in his <em>Sunan</em> after reporting the Hadith of Uthman relating the wudhu of the Prophet ﷺ,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The authentic Ahadith of Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, all indicate that wiping over the head is done once, for they (the narrators) mentioned the actions of wudhu thrice and mentioned the wiping of the head without mentioning the number of times, as they did for the other actions.</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also clarifies some meanings contained in Ahadith; <em>‘…give her food when you eat, clothe her when clothe yourself, do not strike her on the face, do not revile her or leave her except in the house’</em> Abu Dawud stated:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The meaning of ‘Do not revile her’ is to say [to her] ‘May Allah revile you.’</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to fiqh-based intricacies and clarifying meanings, he also explains the meanings of terminology that is not often used in Arabic (Ghara’ib) in numerous Ahadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholastic weight of Imam at Tirmidhi is equally evident in his Jam’i, as attested to by Ibn al-Athir, where he mentions its distinguishing features among the books of Ahadith, namely: its ordering and lack of repetition; mentioning the views of the fiqhi Madhahib and how they respectively deduce rulings; explanation of the Ahadith, in terms of their grade of authentic, sound, weak, gharib and mu’alal; explaining the names of the narrators, their monikers and kunyas, and additional points of benefit that pertain to the sciences of rijal and the book of Ellal at the end of the Jami<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Having established the richness of the books of Hadith, we can now focus on how to benefit from them. This has been outlined by countless scholars when discussing the Manhaj of the student of knowledge in acquiring knowledge. A fitting example here would be the Muhaddith of Yemen, Shaykh Muqbil b. Hadi al-Wadi’, a scholar whose call to the Quran and the Sunnah, and particular emphasis on Ahadith, caused changes on a societal level in his native lands. He states:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fact that some beginner seekers of knowledge in the field of Ahadith err [in their endeavours] is taken up by their antagonists, who use the errors to justify driving them away from their Manhaj [that of the people of hadith]. However, I advise my brothers to acquire what they can from the books of Ahadith and dedicate themselves to reading them – and as for the one who says that whoever’s Shaykh is a book will err more than they are correct, this is only if they do not choose the most fitting book and do not refer to the statements of the scholars relating to the hadith – and acting upon knowledge that has been found [al-Wijadah] is permissible. They should refer to the explanations that the people of the Sunnah have given and if they see in the books of Hadith something that contradicts what the people around them are upon, they should look to see what the people of knowledge have said about the Ahadith in terms of its authenticity and in terms of its meanings. If the Hadith is authentic and the meaning has been understood correctly, it has not been abrogated and you have checked in the explanations that it is not a general hadith that has been made specific elsewhere, or an unrestricted hadith that has been restricted elsewhere, do so if you can. If they are in an environment in which the community have an acceptance of the Sunnah and have trust in them, they should teach them with statements and actions. If they are in an environment in which the community do not have acceptance of the Sunnah, nor do they have trust in them, they should strive to encourage them to act in accordance to the Sunnah and request evidences [for practices].<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question:</strong> Can a menstruating woman touch the deceased or does she have to be in a state of Wudhu to touch the dead person?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer:</strong> A woman who is menstruating can touch the deceased’s body because in principle she is clean and pure. It is transmitted from Anas RadhiAllahu Anhu in Sahih Muslim, the customary norm of the Jews was to separate from their menstruating women even while eating and drinking. Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said it was permissible to maintain all relations with wives except sexual. The Qur’an says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“…</strong><strong>Keep away from women during menses…” (Surah al-Baqarah, 2:222)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is what the ayah means, i.e. to stay away from your wives when they are on their menses. In the same manner Ai’shah RadhiAllahu Anha said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He (The Prophet </em>ﷺ<em>) ordered me to wear an izar (lower garment) and he would fondle me while I was on my menses.”</em> (Agreed upon, Sahih al-Bukhari, Chapter: Fondling a Menstruating Woman, no.300)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith is an evidence that a woman’s body is in of itself clean even while she is menstruating, therefore it is permissible for a menstruating woman to touch a deceased’s body. We learn from these proofs, a woman, in of herself is pure and therefore it is not necessary to be in a state of wudhu to touch the deceased.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Fatawa Thana’yyah Madaniyyah, 3/79-80).</span></p>
