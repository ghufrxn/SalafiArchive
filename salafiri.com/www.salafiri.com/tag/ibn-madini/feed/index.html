<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">READ</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-reality-of-the-madhab-of-ahl-al-hadith-part-1/">PART 1</a></span></strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, when Allah has not commanded something how is it even conceivable that the companions or their students could be upon that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, pay attention to the following Ahadeeth and the Salafs commentary upon them demonstrating that the Ahlul Hadeeth are not an innovated group but the opposite stands true.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>In an authentic report the prophet said: “There will cease to be a <strong>Group</strong> from my Ummah<strong> “victorious upon the truth,“</strong> not being harmed by those who oppose them until the command of Allaah comes about, and they are like that.”</em> (Related by Muslim (6:52-53) and Abu Dawud [2:202]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">It was reported from ‘Awf ibn Maalik who said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Jews were divided into seventy-one sects, one of which is in Paradise and seventy are in the Fire. The Christians were divided into seventy-two sects, seventy-one of which are in the Fire and one is in Paradise. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, my Ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects, one of</span> which will be in Paradise and seventy-two will be in the Fire.” It was said, O Messenger of Allaah, who are they? He said, <strong>“Al-Jamaa’ah.”</strong></em> (Sunan Ibn Maajah, no. 3982)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>It was narrated from Mu’aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood among us and said: “Those who came before you of the people of the Book split into seventy-two sects, and this ummah will split into seventy-three: seventy-two in Hell and one in Paradise, and that is the <strong>“Jamaa’ah”</strong></em>  (Narrated by Abu Dawood (4597) and others; classed as Saheeh by al-Haakim (1:128), who said: it is an important hadeeth that represents a basic principle. It was classed as hasan by Ibn Hajar in Takhreej al-Kashshaaf (63). It was classed as Saheeh by Ibn Taymiyah in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (3:345), al-Shaatibi in al-I’tisaam (1:430), and al-‘Iraaqi in Takhreej al-Ihya’ (9:133)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described the saved group as the<strong>jamaa’ah,</strong> i.e.,<strong> “Al-Taifah Al-Mansoorah OR Firqatun Naajiyah” (Victorious Group OR Saved Group</strong> )..…</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The salaf have commented upon these narrations connecting them to the Ahlul Hadeeth which shows their existence amongst the salaf and their legitimacy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>1)</strong> Regarding the Victorious Group</span><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> Imaam al-Bukhaaree (d.256H)</span> </strong><span style="color: #000000;">said in the explanation of the Hadeeth which mentions at-Taifah al-Mansoorah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“(it) means<strong> “Ahlul Hadeeth…”</strong></em> (Mas’alatul Ihtijaaj Bishaf’ee Lil Khateeb Page 47 and Authentic Chain, Al Hujjatu Fee Bayaanul Muhajja 1:246)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2) Abdullah Bin Mubaarak (d.151H</strong>) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>According to me, they are<strong> “Ashaabul-Hadeeth</strong>” (the Followers of Hadeeth).</em> (Sharaf Ashaabul-Hadeeth] of al-Khateebal-Baghdaadee (d.468H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>3) Imam Ahmad Bin Hanbal (d.241H)</strong> said about the Victorious Group:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If the Victorious Group are not the“<strong> Ashaabul Hadeeth”</strong> then I don’t know who are they”</em> (Ma’rifatu Uloom Ul Hadeeth Lil Haakim (pg 2), Fath ul Baari (13:250)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4) Ibn Muflih (763 H</strong>) said<em>:</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><strong style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ahul Hadeeth</em></strong><em><span style="color: #000000;">, they are the Victorious Group, established upon the Haqq (Absolute truth)”</span> </em><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Adab al-Shari’ah (1:211)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>5) Imam Sufyaan Thawri (d.161H) </strong>rahimuallah about <strong>Ahlul Hadeeth,</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Angels are the guardians of the heavens and <strong>“Ashabul Hadeeth”</strong> are the guardians of the earth.”</em> (Sharf Ashabul Hadeeth (38)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>6) Imam Shaf’ee (204 H)</strong> Said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Whenever I see a person from the </span><strong style="color: #000000;">Ashaabul Hadeeth</strong><span style="color: #000000;"> (People of Hadeeth), then it is as if I have seen the Prophet Sallahu Alehi Wassallam “Alive”</span> </em><span style="color: #000000;">(Sharf Ashaab Ul Hadeeth Lil Khateeb (pg.94), Authentic Chain)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and Also Imaam Ash-Shaafi’ee (d.204AH) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>”Stick to the<strong> Ahlul-Hadeeth,</strong> since they are the most correct of the people”</em> (Siyaar (14:197)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also Abu Naeem al-Asbahani (430 H) Said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“And Ash-Sha’fee was upon the Madhab of “Ahlul Hadeeth”</span> </em><span style="color: #000000;">(Hilyatul Awliyaa (9:112)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>7) Ali bin Abdullah Al Madeeni (d.234H</strong>), who was the Teacher of Imam Bukhari, said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“They are the “Ahul Hadeeth”</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>8) Shaykh Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee (d.561H)</strong> said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“</span><em><span style="color: #000000;">As for al-Firqatun- Naajiyah (the Saved-Sect) it is</span><strong style="color: #000000;"> Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah,</strong><span style="color: #000000;"> and there is no name for Ahlus- Sunnah except one – and that is</span><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> Ashaabul-Hadeeth (the People of Hadeeth).</span> </strong></em><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Ghuniyatut-Taalibeen (pg.212)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>9) Khateeb Baghdadi (d.463H)</strong> has written a Book on the Virtues of the Ahlul Hadeeth, titled: Sharf Ashaab al-Hadeeth, and also refer Tareekh ul-Baghdad (1:224)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>10) Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (d.728H) </strong>said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>Hence it is clear that the people who most deserve to be called the<strong> victorious group are “Ahl al- Hadeeth wa’l-Sunnah”,</strong> who have no leader to follow blindly apart from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). They are the most knowledgeable of people concerning his words and deeds, the most able to distinguish between what is sound and what is not [of hadeeth]. Their imams have deep knowledge of that, they are the ones who understand its meanings and are the most sincere in following it. They accept it and believe in it, and act upon it. They show love to those who adopt it and they show enmity to those who oppose it. They are the ones who measure any idea against that which is proven in the Qur’an and Sunnah, so they never adopt any idea and make it one of the basic principles of their religion unless it is proven in that which the Messenger brought. Rather they make that which the Messenger brought, the Qur’an and Sunnah, the foundation and basis of their beliefs. With regard to the issues concerning which people dispute, such as the attributes of Allah, the divine decree, the threat of Hell, the names of  Allah and the principle of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, etc., they refer that to Allah and His Messenger. They examine the general ideas concerning which the different groups dispute, and whatever of these ideas is in accordance with the <strong>Qur’an and Sunnah</strong>, they approve of it, and whatever goes against the Qur’an and Sunnah, they reject it. They do not follow conjecture or whims and desires. For following conjecture is ignorance and following whims and desires without any guidance from Allah is wrong doing.” </em>(Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (3:347-348)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The explanation of Ibn Taymiyyah Rahimahullah proves that Ahlul hadeeth means 2 types of people: The Muhadditheen and those who are upon the book and sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"> يَوۡ<strong>مَ</strong> <strong>نَدۡعُوۡا</strong> <strong>كُلَّ</strong> <strong>اُنَاسٍۢ</strong> <strong>بِاِمَامِهِمۡ</strong><strong>‌</strong><strong>ۚ</strong> <strong>فَمَنۡ</strong> <strong>اُوۡتِىَ</strong> <strong>كِتٰبَهٗ</strong> <strong>بِيَمِيۡنِهٖ</strong> <strong>فَاُولٰۤٮِٕكَ</strong> <strong>يَقۡرَءُوۡنَ</strong> <strong>كِتٰبَهُمۡ</strong> <strong>وَلَا</strong> <strong>يُظۡلَمُوۡنَ</strong> <strong>فَتِيۡلًا</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“(And remember) the Day when We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) Imam [their Prophets, or their records of good and bad deeds, or their Holy Books like the Quran, the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), etc.]. So whosoever is given his record in his right hand, such will read their records, and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least.”</strong> <strong>[Surah Al-Isra 17:71]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ibn Katheer (d.774H)</strong> said in the Tafseer of this Verse in his Most Famous Tafseer ibn Katheer:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“And Some Salafs said: This (verse) is the Greatest honour for the <strong>Ashaabul Hadeeth</strong> because their Imaam is the Prophet MUHAMMAD ”</em> (Tafseer Ibn Katheer Surah al-Isral ayah 71).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Jalal Ud Deen Suyuti (d.911H)</strong> recorded a Similar Tafseer of this ayah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is not a Greater honour than that (verse) for the <strong>Ashaabul Hadeeth</strong> because they Do Not Have an Imaam other than Him.”</em> (Tadreeb al-Raawi (2:126)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a plethora of texts and evidences alongside those stated above which establish the existence of Ahlul Hadeeth right from the companions and to discuss all evidences would be a very lengthy task.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fourthly, the books of the Ahlul Hadeeth are many and we have already listed some books of aqaaid above but the entire ummah relies on the sihah al-sittah, six books of authentic hadeeth as an authority. These books by themselves establish the existence of Ahlul Hadeeth in the first three centuries as all these books were authored by the first three centuries. There is not a single authentic report from any of these authors to establish that they were blind followers of any madhab or that even any of the four schools existed as madhabs in their time. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is not hidden to the detractors that the likes of Imam Bukharee, Tirmidhee and others held the way of salvation to be the way of Ahlul Hadeeth as has been explained above. This stance is also reflected in the books of hadeeth they referenced. Taking Sunan Tirmidhee as an illustration Imaam Tirmidhee throughout the sunan mentions the Ashaabul Hadeeth, Ahlul Hadeeth as a distinct separate juristic way upon the truth. The illustrations are too many to note here.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, Tirmidhee throughout the sunan establishes that the Ahlul Hadeeth were the Imaams of the science of Jarh wa tadeel, an example is when he said “Ibn La’ihah is weak according to Ahlul Hadeeth. Yahya ibn Qattan and others weakened him because of his memory.”  He also mentions the way of Ahlul Hadeeth as the way to follow in matters of creed when he narrated in the chapter: “What is narrated about the Khulud (staying forever) of people of Paradise and Hell” a Hadeeth mentioning the vision of Allah and Allah putting His foot in the hell, and then Imam Tirmidhi wrote:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Hadeeth is Hasan Saheeh, and it has been reported from the Prophet a lot of narrations similar to this mentioning the topic of the vision of Allah, that people will see Allah, and the mention of the Foot and matters similar, and the Madhab of people of knowledge from Imams like Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Malik ibn Anas, ibn Al-Mubarak, ibn ‘Uyaynah, Waki’ and others is that they mention these matters and they say: “These Ahaadeeth are narrated, and we believe in them and it is not said “How?” and this is what is chosen by <strong><u>Ahlul Hadeeth</u></strong>, that these matters should be narrated as they came, and there should be belief in them, and there should not be any Tafsir (other than literal meaning) and one should not cast any doubt, and it should not be asked: “How?”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tirmidhee also mentions Ahlul Hadeeth as a reference point for truth whilst refuting various sects who had incorrect beliefs in the first three centuries as follows when he refuted the Jahmiyyah sect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> It should be noted that Tirmidhee uses the terms Ahl us Sunnah to mean the same thing as Ahlul Hadeeth as follows below. Hence, for Tirmidhee it was the Ahlul Hadeeth Ahl us sunnah which were upon the correct way in affairs of Aqeedah. He said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“More than one person of knowledge said on this Hadeeth and similar narrations about the Attributes, the ascending of the Lord every night towards the heaven of this world, they said: These narrations are established, and we should believe in them and not have any doubt, and not say: “How” and this is narrated from Malik, Sufiyan ibn ‘Uyaynah and ‘Abdullah ibnul Mubarak, and they said concerning these AHadeeth: “Quote them without (asking and mentioning) “How” and this is the saying of the people of knowledge among the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah. As for the <strong>Jahmiyah,</strong> they rejected these narrations and said that it is Tashbih (establishing a similarity between Allah and His creation). Allah (‘Azza wa Jalla) has indeed mentioned in many places of His Book the hand (Al-Yad), the hearing (As-Sam’), the sight (al-Basar) and the Jahmiyah interpolated these verses and explained them (did its Tafsir) contrary to what the people of knowledge have explained (did Tafsir), and they (Jahmiyah) said: “Allah did not create Adam with His hand” et they said: “The meaning of hand is the power”. And Ishaq ibn Ibraheem said: “Tashbeeh is only when we say that the hand is like my hand or similar to it, or hearing is like my hearing or similar to it, so if someone says: He hears like I hear or similarly to my hearing, this is Tashbeeh (establishing a similarity between Allah and the creation), and if we say as Allah (Ta’ala) said: a hand, hearing and seeing, and we do not say “How” and we do not say: “Like my hearing or similar to it” this is not Tashbeeh.” </em>(Tirmidhee (2:38)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Dawūd as-Sijastānī in his Kitāb as-Sunan 2/290 Kitāb as-Sunnah, Bāb Fil-Khulāfa no.4646), Imām Abū Eesā Tirmidhī in Kitāb as-Sunan 2/46, Abwāb al-Fitan Bāb Mā Jā Fil Khilāfah no.2226), Imām Abū ʿAbdur Rahman Nasā’ī in Kitāb as-Sunan al-Kubrā 5/47 no.8155, Kitāb al-Manāqib Bāb 5, Imām Abū Ḥātim bin Ḥibbān Bastī in as-Ṣaḥīḥ (al-Ehsān no.6623, 6904, Mawārid az-Zamān no.1534,1535 and many other scholars of ḥadīth via various chains from Saʿīd bin Jamhān from Safīnah Abū ʿAbdir Rahman the servant of the Messenger of Allāh narrates</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Messenger of Allāh said “The Prophetic khilāfah will remain for 30 years and the Allāh will give power to whom He Wills. Saʿīd said Safīnah said to me “count the years, 2 years of Abū Bakr and 10 years of Umar and 12 years of Uthmān and Alī so on (i.e. 6 years). Saʿīd said “I said to Safīnah these people say that Alee was not a khalīfah to which he replied “The backs of Banū Zarqā and Banū Marwān have lied.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the wording of Abū Dawūd which differs slightly from the others  however the meaning is the same.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Ḥadīth Imām Tirmidhī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth is Ḥasan.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Ḥadīth of Safīnah concerning the Khilāfah is authentic and it is my position regarding the Khulāfa.”</em> [Jāmʿe Bayān al-ʿIlm Wa Faḍilihi [2/225], see also Kitāb as-Sunnah of ʿAbdullāh bin Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal [2/590 no.1400]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Abī ʿĀṣim said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth in terms of being written is </em><em>established. Saʿīd bin Jamhān narrates from Ḥamād bin Salamah, a-ʿĀwām bin Ḥaushab and Ḥashraj (bin Nabātah)”</em> [Kitāb as-Sunnah [2/549-550 no.1181,1185]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Ibn Taymīyyah has also graded this narration to be authentic [as-Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/744] of Shaikh al-Albānī]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ḥākim also graded it authentic [al-Mustadrak [3/71]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The narrator Saʿīd bin Jamhān was declared to be trustworthy Imam Yaḥya bin Maʿīn, Imam Nasā’ī, Imam Ibn Ḥibbān and Imam Aḥmad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abū Dawūd also declared him to be trustworthy</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdīyy said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“According to me there is no harm in him”</em> [Tahdhīb ut-Tahdhīb [1/14]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ḥāfiẓ Dhahabī said</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Truthful from the middle (level of narrator).</em>” [al-Kāshif [1/282].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Truthful individual”</em> [Taqrīb ut-Tahdhīb no.2279]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In contrary to these Imāms, Imām Abū Ḥātim ar-Rāzī said, <em>“Write his ḥadīth but he cannot be used evidence.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This criticism is rejected due to a number of reasons:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] This opposes the praise of the majority</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] Zailaʿī’s Naṣb ur-Rāyah mentions [2/439]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abū Ḥātim’s saying “He is not evidence” is not harmful because he has not mentioned the reason for this criticism, he has used these words for many of the trustworthy and established narrators of the authentic books of ḥadīth without mentioning the reason, e.g. Khālid al-Ḥada and others, and Allāh knows best.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Dhahabī said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When Abū Ḥātim declares someone to be trustworthy, then hold onto it because he only declares someone trustworthy who is in the Ṣaḥīḥ Ḥadīth. Similarly when he declares someone to be weak or if he he says “he cannot be used as evidence” then hold back until you know what others have said. If someone says they were trustworthy then do not take Abū Ḥatīms criticism as he was firm with regards to the narrators. He has said about a group of narrators from the Ṣaḥīḥs they were not evidence and not strong and other similar statements.”</em> [Siyar Āʿlām an-Nabūla [3/260]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence this criticism is rejected.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Some scholars have alleged Imām Abū Ḥātim was harsh hence his statement is rejected compared to Imām Aḥmad bin Ḥanbals statement who was balanced and investigative.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Sājī&#8217;s statement, <em>&#8220;His Ḥadīth have no supports.&#8221;</em> Is also general and it is rejected because it is not detailed neither is it severe jarḥ. When someone’s honesty is established not being supported does not affect him. As it has already been established that Saʿīd bin Jamhān is trustworthy with definitive evidences, him being alone in reporting this Ḥadīth does not affect it it anyway.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Deceit of the Ḥadīth Rejecters.</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The real aim and objective of the Ḥadīth rejecters through their deceitful plots and treachery it to show the authentic Ḥadīth of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) are fabricated. This is to lead the general Muslims away from the fundamentals of the dīn and to create doubts so that the people begin to think the dīn as unreliable and then they eventually stray from the straight path.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With this they then want to express and impose their deficient opinions amongst the people, which will eventually lead to no one acting on the Qurān or Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One person from amongst the rejecters and deniers of Ḥadīth is Tamannā ʿAmādī Phalwārī, he writes in his fabrication of a book, &#8216;Intizār Mahdī Masīh&#8217; [Awaiting The Mahdī Messiah] whilst vilifying and rebuking this very same Hadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;You have seen the name of Ḥashraj bin Nabātah Al-Kūfi with regards to these narrations. He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl, he is not evidence and rejected in Ḥadīth and you do not generally find any supports for his Hadīth.&#8221;</em> [pg.57]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like to say regarding Hashraj bin Nabātah Imām Ahmad said, <em>&#8220;Trustworthy.&#8221;</em> And Ibn Ma&#8217;īn said, <em>&#8220;Good, trustworthy and there is no harm in him.&#8221; </em>Abū Zurʿah said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him and he is grounded in Ḥadīth.&#8221;</em> Ibn ʿAdīyy said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him.&#8221;</em> Tirmidhī graded his Ḥadīth Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the other hand Abū Ḥatīm said, <em>&#8220;Good write his Ḥadīth but he is not used as evidence.&#8221;</em> as-Sājī said, <em>&#8220;Weak.&#8221;</em> Ibn Ḥibbān said, <em>&#8220;He has a few Ḥadīth, his narrations are rejected and it is impermissible to use his reports as evidence when he is alone in reporting them.&#8221;</em> Nasā‘ī said he is not strong and criticised him another time he said there is not harm in him and praised him. [Summarised from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥākim and Dhahabī authenticated one of his Ḥadīth. [Mustadrak [3/606], ʿAlī (I think Ibn Al-Madīnī) also declared him to be trustworthy [Mizān Al-‘Eitidāl [1/551]. Hāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr said, <em>&#8220;Truthful but errs.&#8221;</em> [Taqrīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The conclusion is, this narrator is trustworthy and truthful according to the majority of the scholars of Ḥadīth. Hence, Tamannā ʿAmādī is a liar in his claim that, <em>&#8221; He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are so many lies in Tamannā ʿĀmādī’s book that a collation of them would result in a book. For example in the same book on [pg.54] this individual writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Muʿammar bin Rāshid of Yemen was a freed slave who died in the year 154H. He was active in compiling and collating Ḥadīth, he would narrate from the well known liar Ābān bin ʿAbbās. Whilst narrating from him he would put forward the name of Thābit al-Banānī instead [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101] yet the scholars of Ḥadīth still considered him to be trustworthy.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say let us look at the referenced page from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb and it clearly says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Khalīlī has transmitted in in al-Irshād with an authentic chain from Aḥmad that he said to Yaḥya ibn Maʿīn when he was copying the manuscript of ʿAbdur Razzāq from Muʿammar from Ābān, “You are writing this when you know Ābān is a liar?” He (Ibn Maʿīn) replied, “May Allāh have mercy on you Oh Abū ʿAbdullāh, I am writing it in order to memorise it so that when a liar (like Tamannā ʿĀmādī) narrates on Muʿammar from Thābit from Anas, I will say to them you have lied the chain is via Ābān (and not Thābit).”</em> [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask the readers now, why is Muʿammar to blame here and what is his fault? What he heard he narrated it in the same way, when he heard from Ābān he would say Ābān and when he heard from Thābit he would say Thābit. If he scholar of Ḥadīth do not consider him to be trustworthy what should they consider him (meaning he was honest)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of Tamannā ʿĀmādī are liars whose tongues and pens are free, if they want to, they can try to prove the day as night and night as day but they must remember a day will come when there will most definitely be punishment. On that day one will be taken to account for every deed big or small.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this was the research into the correct position of Ḥashraj bin Nabātah, it must be remembered here that he is not alone in reporting the Ḥadīth, rather the following individuals support him</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] ʿAbd al-Wārith [Abū Dawūd no.4646]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] al-ʿAwām bin Ḥūwshab [Abū Dawūd no.4647]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Ḥamād bin Salamah [Musnad Aḥmad [5/220-221]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus the criticism against Ḥashraj is rejected from every angle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islām Ibn Taymīyyah said concerning this Ḥadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth is well known from the narrations of Ḥamād bin Salamah, ʿAbd al-Wārith bin Saʿīd and al-ʿAwām bin Ḥūwshab and others on the authority of Saʿīd bin Jamhān. Imām Aḥmad relied on this narration for evidence for the Khilāfah of the four Khulāfa ar-Rāshidīn and he also authenticated it. He would also use it as evidence against those people who would remain silent with regards to the Khilāfah of ʿAlī as the people began to differ. To the extent that Aḥmad said, “Whoever does not consider ʿAlī as the fourth Khulāfa is more astray than is domestic donkey.” He also forbade in establishing wedlock with such people. This issue is agreed upon by the jurists, scholars of the Sunnah, the people of knowledge and insight and the righteous people, this is also the position ie madhab of the general people. Some of the people of desires have opposed them in this, from them are the people of theological rhetoric and like them the Rāfidah who rebuke and censure the first three Khalīphs. Likewise, the Khawārij who abuse the Khilāfah of two son in laws ie Uthmān and ʿAlī (of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) or like some of the Nāṣibīs who attack the Khilāfah of ʿAli or like some of the ignorant ones upon the Sunnah who remain silent of the Khilāfah (of ʿAlī)”</em> [Majmūʿa Fatāwa [35/18-19]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The following scholars graded the Ḥadīth to be authentic and strong,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] at-Tirmidhī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Ibn Jarīr at-Ṭabarī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4] Ibn Abī ʿĀsim</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5] Ibn Ḥibbān</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6] al-Ḥākim</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7] Ibn Taymīyyah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8] ad-Dhahabī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9] Ibn Ḥajr al-ʿAsqalānī (Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/745 no.459] All praise be to Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some scholars have mentioned two supporting narrations for this Ḥadīth</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[1] On the authority of Abī Bakra (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) as transmitted by Baihaqī in Dalail an-Nabūwwah [6/342] the chain is weak due to ʿAlī bin Zaid bin Jadʿān</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[2] On the authority of Jābir bin ʿAbdullāh (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) [al-Wāhidī in al-Wasīṭ cited from as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/745] and its chain is weak.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Benefit</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the later people claim this Ḥadīth of Safīnah opposes the Ḥadīth of Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim which Jābir bin Samurah (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) narrates from the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This affair will not cease until there are 12 Khalīphs…. And all of them will be from the Quraish.”</em> [Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, Kitāb al-Imārah, Bāb an-Nās Tabʿa Li-Quraish Wa Khilāfah Fil Quraish [no.1821] and its origin is in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī [no.7222-7223]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is lack of knowledge on the part of the claimants because both authentic Ḥadīth can be reconciled. The Ḥadīth of Safīnah refers to the Khilāfah of the Khulāfa Rāshidīn and the Khilāfah on the Prophetic Manhaj and the Ḥadīth of Jābir refers to the unrestricted Khilāfah. Thus the first Ḥadīth restricts and negates any more years than the 30 years of the Khilāfah of the Khulāfa ar-Rāshidīn and the second Ḥadīth establishes the Khilāfah of the non Rāshidīn hence there is contradiction between the two Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr has alluded to this reconciliation in Fath al-Bārī [13/212 under Ḥadīth no.7223] as well as Hāfiẓ Ibn Taymīyyah in Majmūʿa Fatāwa. This is what is correct and for further details refer to Shaikh Muḥammad Nāṣir ud Dīn al-Albānī’s book Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/742-749 no.459] as he has discussed this issue in great detail.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Zubair ʿAlī Zai</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">23-7-1993  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[JazakAllāh Khair to brother Shehzad Anwar Sattar for his help]</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[The following is an extract from a longer article of Shaikh Zubair Ali Za&#8217;i on the verification of the ḥadīth of Khilāfah for 30 years.] </span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Deceit of the Ḥadīth Rejecters.</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The real aim and objective of the Ḥadīth rejecters through their deceitful plots and treachery it to show the authentic Ḥadīth of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) are fabricated. This is to lead the general Muslims away from the fundamentals of the dīn and to create doubts so that the people begin to think the dīn as unreliable and then they eventually stray from the straight path.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With this they then want to express and impose their deficient opinions amongst the people, which will eventually lead to no one acting on the Qurān or Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One person from amongst the rejecters and deniers of Ḥadīth is Tamanna Amadi Phalwārī, he writes in his fabrication of a book, &#8216;Intizār Mahdī Masīh&#8217; [Awaiting The Mahdī Messiah] whilst vilifying and rebuking this very same Hadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;You have seen the name of Ḥashraj bin Nabātah Al-Kūfi with regards to these narrations. He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl, he is not evidence and rejected in Ḥadīth and you do not generally find any supports for his Hadīth.&#8221;</em> [pg.57]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like to say regarding Hashraj bin Nabātah Imām Ahmad said, <em>&#8220;Trustworthy.&#8221;</em> And Ibn Ma&#8217;īn said, <em>&#8220;Good, trustworthy and there is no harm in him.&#8221; </em>Abū Zurʿah said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him and he is grounded in Ḥadīth.&#8221;</em> Ibn ʿAdīyy said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him.&#8221;</em> Tirmidhī graded his Ḥadīth Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the other hand Abū Ḥatīm said, <em>&#8220;Good write his Ḥadīth but he is not used as evidence.&#8221;</em> as-Sājī said, <em>&#8220;Weak.&#8221;</em> Ibn Ḥibbān said, <em>&#8220;He has a few Ḥadīth, his narrations are rejected and it is impermissible to use his reports as evidence when he is alone in reporting them.&#8221;</em> Nasā‘ī said he is not strong and criticised him another time he said there is not harm in him and praised him. [Summarised from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥākim and Dhahabī authenticated one of his Ḥadīth. [Mustadrak [3/606], ʿAlī (I think Ibn Al-Madīnī) also declared him to be trustworthy [Mizān Al-‘Eitidāl [1/551]. Hāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr said, <em>&#8220;Truthful but errs.&#8221;</em> [Taqrīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The conclusion is, this narrator is trustworthy and truthful according to the majority of the scholars of Ḥadīth. Hence, Tamanna Amadi is a liar in his claim that, <em>&#8221; He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are so many lies in Tamanna Amadi’s book that a collation of them would result in a book. For example in the same book on [pg.54] this individual writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Muʿammar bin Rashid of Yemen was a freed slave who died in the year 154H. He was active in compiling and collating Ḥadīth, he would narrate from the well known liar Ābān bin ʿAbbās. Whilst narrating from him he would put forward the name of Thābit al-Banānī instead [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101] yet the scholars of Ḥadīth still considered him to be trustworthy.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say let us look at the referenced page from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb and it clearly says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Khalīlī has transmitted in in al-Irshād with an authentic chain from Aḥmad that he said to Yaḥya ibn Maʿīn when he was copying the manuscript of ʿAbdur Razzāq from Muʿammar from Ābān, “You are writing this when you know Ābān is a liar?” He (Ibn Maʿīn) replied, “May Allāh have mercy on you Oh Abū ʿAbdullāh, I am writing it in order to memorise it so that when a liar (like Tamannā ʿĀmādī) narrates on Muʿammar from Thābit from Anas, I will say to them you have lied the chain is via Ābān (and not Thābit).”</em> [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask the readers now, why is Muʿammar to blame here and what is his fault? What he heard he narrated it in the same way, when he heard from Ābān he would say Ābān and when he heard from Thābit he would say Thābit. If he scholar of Ḥadīth do not consider him to be trustworthy what should they consider him (meaning he was honest)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of Tamanna Amadi are liars whose tongues and pens are free, if they want to, they can try to prove the day as night and night as day but they must remember a day will come when there will most definitely be punishment. On that day one will be taken to account for every deed big or small.</span></p>
