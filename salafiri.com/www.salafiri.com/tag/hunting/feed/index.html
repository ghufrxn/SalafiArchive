<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Kitāb al-Aṭʿimah &#8211; The Book of Eating</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated Abu Ubaydah</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Checked &amp; Additional Notes</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Hunting With Trained Dogs and Arrows</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[378]<span style="color: #000080;"> Narrated </span></strong><strong>Hamam Ibn Harith from &#8216;Adi ibn Hatim (Radi Allahu Anhu) reported:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> </strong><strong>I said: Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam), I set off trained (hunting) dogs and they catch for me (the game) and I recite the name of Allah over it (I slaughter the game by reciting Bismillah-i-Allah-o-Akbar), whereupon he said: When you set off your trained (hunting) dogs, if you recited the name of Allah (while setting them off), then eat (the game). I said: Even if they (the trained (hunting) dogs) kill that (the game)? He (the Holy Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said: Even if these kill (the game), but (on the condition) that no other dog, which you did not set off (along with your dogs), participates (in catching the game). I said to him: I throw Mi&#8217;rad, a heavy featherless blunt arrow, for hunting and killing (the game). Thereupon he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said: When you throw Mi&#8217;rad, and it pierces (the game), then eat (it), but if it falls flatly (and beats (crushes) the game to death), then do not eat that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>And the hadith of Sha’bi from Adi is with the same meaning and in this hadith it is stated that “provided (the hunting dog) has not eaten (any part of the game). If it has eaten (the game), then you don&#8217;t eat it as I fear that it might have caught for its own self. And do not eat it if other dogs have joined your trained dogs.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>And in (another narration) it is stated, “When you let off your dog, recite the name of Allah, and if it catches (game for you) and you find it alive, then slaughter it; if you find it killed and that (your dog) has eaten nothing out of that, (even then) you may eat it; because what the trained hunting dog catches (and kills) is equivalent to sacrificing it”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>And in (another narration) it is stated, “If you shoot with your arrow then mention the name of Allah” and in it “and if the game disappears from you for one or two days”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>And in another narration, “If the game disappears for two or three days and you do not find on that but the mark of your arrow, then eat that it you so like, but if you find it drowned in water, then don&#8217;t eat that for in that case you do not know whether it is water that caused its death or your arrow.”</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1) If a trained hunting dog catches a game and the owner released it by saying the Takbir (bismillah Allahu Akbar) and it brings it back dead then it is allowed to eat it. If it brings it back alive then you need to sacrifice it in order for it to be halal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2) If an owners trained hunting dog carries out a hunt and other dogs become part of the hunt and they bring back the game meat then it is not allowed to eat it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3) If an arrow (bullet) was shot at the game and at that moment the Takbir was said and you find it after two or three days and it only had the mark (wound) from the arrow and no other mark is present then you can eat it if you want to.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4) If you find the game sunk in water then you shouldn&#8217;t eat it because you don&#8217;t know if it died because of the arrow you shot or because of being drowned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) If a trained hunting dog or falcon (eagle, hawk) catches a game and the owner released it by saying the Takbir (bismillah Allahu Akbar) then it is allowed to eat it whether it brings it back dead or alive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) If an owners trained hunting dog carries out a hunt and other normal dogs become part of the hunt and they bring back the game meat then it is not allowed to eat it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) During hunting you should say the Takbir at the time of shooting the arrow, firing the bullet or releasing the hunting dog.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) It is not allowed to eat the game meat that is left over after being eaten by the hunting dog.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) If a hunting dog brings back the game animal alive to the owner then it is necessary to sacrifice it in the halal manner (if you want to eat it)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10) If a game animal gets wounded and sinks into the water then it is not allowed to eat it because there is a doubt if it died because of the wound or because of drowning. However if the amount of water it fell in is small (such as a puddle) and the hunter clearly knows it died because of the arrow (bullet) wound then it&#8217;s meat is halal to eat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">11) If you hunt using a wide spear to strike (the game) then it is allowed to eat it if the spear pierces the game however if it dies because of a small strike (that doesn’t pierce it’s body) then it is not allowed to eat it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[377] </strong><strong>Narrated Abu Tha`laba Al-Khushani (Radiullahu Anhu):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>I came to the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! We are living in a land ruled by the people of the Scripture (i.e. Jews and Christians); Can we take our meals in their utensils? In that land there is plenty of game and I hunt the game with my bow and with my hound (dog) that is not trained and with my trained hound (dog). Then what is lawful for me to eat?&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for what you have mentioned about the people of the Scripture, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat out of theirs, but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash their utensils and eat out of it. If you hunt an animal with your bow after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it. and if you hunt something with your trained hound after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it, and if you hunt something with your untrained hound (and get it before it dies) and slaughter it, eat of it.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1)  During hunting if you shoot your arrow and say Bismillah Allahu Akbar and the game (animal) has fallen and died then its meat is halal </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2) If the hunting dog catches the game (animal) and brings it back to you then its meat is halal on the condition that when you released the hunting dog to carry out the hunt you said Bismillah Allahu akbar. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3) If you release an untrained hunting dog to carry out a hunt and it catches the game meat alive then you sacrifice it in a halal manner it is allowed to eat it. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4) This hadith clearly shows the virtue and superiority of the one who has knowledge compared to the one who is ignorant i.e. the trained (knowledgeable) dog compared to the untrained (ignorant of hunting skills) dog. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) It is allowed to use the kufars utensils and clothes on the condition that you can’t get hold of other utensils and clothes. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Before using these type of utensils or clothes they should be washed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) It is necessary to clean used utensils or clothes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) It is allowed to hunt with a trained (hunting) dog and bow and arrow (in this era it’s equivalence such as a gun).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) The takbir should be said at the time of hunting when shooting the arrow, firing the bullet or letting the hunting dog loose. The wording for the takbir is Bismillah Allahu Akbar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) It is allowed to have game meat that has been hunted by a non trained (hunting) dog on the condition that it brings the game back alive and you slaughter it in a halal manner. If the game animal is brought back dead then it is not allowed to eat it.</span></p>

We chased a rabbit at Mari-al-Zahran and the people ran after it but were exhausted. I got close and caught it, and gave it to Abu Talha who slaughtered it and sent it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) accepted that.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[RULINGS FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) The rabbit meat is halal and is an excellent type of (meat). It can either be wild or tame as a household animal.  In either situation it is lawful to eat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) accepted gifts even if the amount was small.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) It is the Sunnah of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) to give gifts to each other. The people of faith should adhere and commit to doing this.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) A rabbit can be slaughtered. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) Eating it is lawful without a doubt and some narrations mention that the thigh was presented to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and he ate it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) Whoever hunts an animal; he can give the meat to his friends or leader.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) The animal that is caught during hunting belongs to the one who hunted it and he may do whatever he wishes with it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) Some scholars have cited consensus in rabbit (meat) being lawful and permissible to eat and Abdullah ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu), Ikrimah and Ibn Abi Layla said it was makruh [Fath al-Bari [11:98].</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center"></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[53] And from the same chain of narration from Abdullah Ibn Abas, that as-Sab Ibn Jaththama al-Laythi once gave a wild ass (donkey) to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) while he was at al-Abwa, or Wadan, and the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) gave it back to him. However, when the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) saw the expression on the man&#8217;s face he said, &#8220;We only gave it back to you because we are in Ihram.&#8221;  </strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Ubaydullah Ibn Abdullah Ibn Utba Ibn Mas’ud) in Bukhari (no.2592)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/353 hadith no.801, book 20, chapter 25, hadith no.83) at-Tamhid (9/54) al-Istidhkar: (no.751)    </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.1825) and Muslim (no.1193) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">1) In the state of Ihram it is not permissible to hunt on land, or get someone to hunt, or buy a land hunted (animal). See at-Tamhid (9/58) and Sura al-Ma’ida (ayah: (no.96))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2) Whoever is not in Ihram if he hunts for himself and then afterwards gifts (the hunted animal) to those who are in Ihram then eating it is permitted. See this book hadith (no.492)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">3) Abdullah Ibn Amir Ibn Rabi’a said, “I once saw Uthman ibn Afan in Ihram on a hot summer&#8217;s day at al-Arj,and he had covered his face with a red woolen cloth. Some game-meat was brought to him and he told his companions to eat. They said, &#8216;Will you not eat then?&#8217;, and he said, &#8216;I am not in the same position as you. It was hunted for my sake.&#8217; &#8220;(because of this reason I don’t eat it) (al-Muwatta Abu Mus’ab az-Zuhri’s narration (1/452) hadith (no.1147), and its chain is authentic, and the hadith in another form Muwatta Yahya’s narration (1/354) hadith (no.802))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">4) A’isha (Radi Allahu Anha) said, “If (in the state of Ihram) you get an urge to do something (meaning to eat the meat of the hunted animal), leave it,&#8221; by which she meant eating game-meat (al-Muwatta Yahya’s narration (1/354) hadith (no.803) and its chain is authentic)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">5) If there is a fear of another brother falling into misunderstanding because of a certain task, then it should be clarified so that the heart stays clean and happy for each other.</span></p>
