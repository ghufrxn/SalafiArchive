<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Difference Between The Salafi’s and The Ashari’s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Herein lies the difference, the usool of the salafee is that “ we read the ahadeeth so that our intellects, opinions, desires and other than that are to be in conformity with the hadeeth leaving off everything and accepting the hadeeth” whereas the asharee says “we read the hadeeth so that it can be in conformity with our intellects and our madhab and if it does not then we either make taweel of the hadeeth to make it agreeable with our madhab, and if this is not possible then we leave the hadeeth” A great calamity indeed!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Hayaat Sindhee in Iqaz al-Humam (pg.81) whilst he was discussing the methodology of the Hanafee Ahlur  Rai said that they were engrossed in giving precedence to opinion over the text of the prophetic traditions.  This matter would be incomplete if we did not therefore mention here that the above innovated principles and other than it are not something that the modern day Asharees have established but they borrowed this from their forefathers the Hanafee, maturidee Jahmees, that is,  the current day Deobandee and Barelwis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus we find from the classical hanafee books of Usool and jurisprudence such as Talweeh’ pg.17 and ‘Usool Bazdawee’ pg.34, Usool Karkhee pg.12 stating that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“any ayat or hadeeth which is contradiction to our Madhab then we will either make taweel of it and if we cannot make taweel of it to fall within our madhab then we shall leave it”    </em>and,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“any ayah of the quran which is against our madhab then we shall either say it is abrogated or give precedence to our madhab, but it is better that we make taweel of the ayah to make it in accordance with the saying of the madhab”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Icing on the cake is that which has been said by the grandfather of the Barelwis Muftee Ahmed Yar Khan Naeemi (Jaa al Haqq, Chapter on blind following) says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“we accept the Quran and hadeeth if it is accordance with our Imaam and leave it if it contradicts the saying of our Imaam, even if it is an authentic hadeeth. To take the Quran and hadeeth upon its apparent meaning is the root of Kufr”.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So to take the attributes on their apparent meanings as accepted by the Ijmaa of the salaf is Kufr!  So here we see the deep rooted relationship between the Ashaaiarah and Hanafee Madhab, a dangerous cocktail indeed!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, if one looks carefully at the Qur’an one can clearly see that especially in relation to all of the aspects of Islaam and the aqeedah one must have just as much reliance on the Qur’an as one has on the Sunnah and one cannot suffice without the other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So concerning the Ashaa’irah, how is it that they can say that the Qur’an is to be relied upon because the ahadeeth which talk about the Names and Attributes of Allah and which clearly state that the Attributes are to be taken literally are in contradiction with various ayaat of the Qur’an. We say to them have they not read in the Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Do you not ponder over the Qur’an? And if it had been from any other than Allah then in it you would have found much conflict and difficulties.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous tabi’ee and explainer of the Qur’an Imaam Ibn Jareer at-Tabari said concerning this verse of the Qur’an,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“No doubt the revelation which would come to the Prophet of Allah would come in a clear way so that the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam could explain its meanings and tell the people about the obligations from it. Had these orders or had these revelations to the Prophet been from any other than Allah then the orders that were given by the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam in his sunnah would have differed, the meanings would have differed and the whole religion would be in conflict, but this is not the case.”(</em>Tafseer Tabaree vol.5 pg.189)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> So one can clearly see from this that had any of the sunnah been in conflict with the Qur’an then the whole religion would be something which would be unrecognisable and full of conflicts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Shafi’ee Rahimahullah said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It should be known that there is no difference to what Allah has revealed in the Qur’an and the obligations that the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam has told us about from his Sunnah, they have both come in the same manner.” (</em>ar-Risaalah ash-Shafi’ee pg.183)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Allaamah Ibn Hazm Rahimahullah says in his tremendous book ‘al-Ihkaam’:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We have clearly substantiated that there is not a single ayah of the Qur’an which is in opposition to the authentic hadeeth and no authentic hadeeth which is in opposition to any ayah of the Qur’an, there is no separation or conflict. Whoever says that there is a conflict between an authentic hadeeth and an ayah of the Qur’an then his saying is rejected and based upon falsehood.” (1/112)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Qayyim Rahimahullah said in his book A’laam ul-Muwaqqi’een:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“From the principles of the Sharee’ah it is not possible to say that any ayah of the Qur’an differs or has a conflict with a hadeeth of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam or an obligation emanating from it. In fact the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam has forbid people to claim there to be such a distinction, what is upon us is to affirm and accept that which has been revealed, for all of this is proven from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam and the revelation that Allah has sent upon him. Anyone who says other than this is upon clear misguidance and mistaken”. (</em>A&#8217;laam ul Muwaqqi&#8217;een vol.2 pg.38)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning the verse of the Quraan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And those people who have bought faith upon that which the messengers have bought and make no distinctions between them&#8230;.” (</strong>Soorah an-Nisa 4:152)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa&#8217;dee said in his tremendous Tafseer Tayseer al Kareem,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“This verse of the Qur’an clearly shows that Allah </em><em>Subhanahu wata’ala is informing us that which he has told us about concerning himself and those narrations which have been brought by the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam by way of obligations then it is mandatory for us to have belief upon it all!” (</em>Tayseer al-Kareem ar-Rahmaan Fee Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan vol.2 pg.210 with the checking of Muhammad Zuhree an-Najjar)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>In Sooratul Nahl ayah 44 it says,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“With clear signs and Books (We sent the Messengers). And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the reminder and the advice (the Quran), that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought”.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Imaam Shafi’ee said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allah Subhanahu wata’ala in His Book and religion has given the status to the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam which has been mentioned in the Qur’an itself. Therefore it is obligatory upon mankind that they accept the revelation which has been revealed to the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam by way of the Qur’an and that which has also been revealed to him by the way of the hadeeth with which he speaks. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam when he spoke he made no contradictions with the Qur’an and in fact it is just an explanation of that which Allah had already revealed upon him by way of the Qur’an.” (</em>Jaami ul-Ilm pg.118)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore it is clear that there is no hadeeth whether it is concerning the Names of Allah or his Attributes , calling upon Allah alone, worshipping only Allah or any other Ahkaam concerning the Aqeedah or other than it in contradiction to the Qur’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah has said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The sunnah was revealed upon the Prophet just as the Qur’an was also revealed upon him.” (</em>Majmoo’a al-Fataawa of Ibn Taymiyyah vol.13 pg.364)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Shawkaani says whilst explaining the hadeeth ‘I have been given the Quran and something similar to it’:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This means he has been given the Qur’an and similarly the sunnah has also been given to him by way of revelation, and this is revelation {hadeeth} which has not been mentioned in the Qur’an.” (</em>Irshaad Al Fuhul of Shawkaani pg.33)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This clearly shows that it is a fallacy for any deviant sect including those such as the ashaa’irah to claim that ‘where in the Qur’an does it say that the Hand of Allah is to be taken literally or Allah has two Eyes or that Allah has a foot which is to be taken literally having a meaning?’. In essence, the Ashaairah ask the Salafees for evidence of the existence of the principles concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah as upheld by the salaf from within the Qur’an only and this shows that they have left the way of the Ahlul Ilm and the way of the salaf in this matter also. We reply,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah Subhanahu wata’ala says in the Qur’an <strong>An Nisaa 59,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger ), if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination”.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Imaam Shaatibee says </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This ayah clearly shows that there is no conflict in the sharee’ah because Allah Subhanahu wata’ala has told those that are in conflict to refer to the sharee’ah i.e. the Qur’an and the sunnah in order to finish the conflict. So it is clear that conflict will only seize once one can refer to that which can make the conflict end. Thus, if that which is commanded to refer back to {quran and sunnah} were to have in itself conflicts then there is no point in referring to it and those who say this are upon a way which is misguided”. (</em>Al-Muwafaqaat of Shaatibee vol.4 pg.119 and Al-I’tisaam of Shaatibee vol.2 pg.309-310)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a tremendous saying of Imaam Shaatibee and more or less sums up what is to be said. How can the ashaa’irah reject certain ahadeeth because it does not fit in with their minds or they say it opposes the Quran? Not all principles concerning aqeedah are found solely in the Quran but we look also to the hadeeth with the understanding of the salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Qayyim says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If the Book of Allah and the authentic sunnah of the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam did not have the quality of resolving conflicts then Allah Subhanahu wata’ala would not have told people who are in conflict to refer to them both. For verily he would not tell the people to refer to the Book and the sunnah of the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam had there been a conflict between them two in the first place”. (</em>I&#8217;laam ul Muwaqqi&#8217;een vol.1 pg.49)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Asharis for hundreds of years have not understood what the Sahaaba and tabi’een understood thousands of years ago. For example, concerning the conflicts that the people talk about between the authentic hadeeth and the Qur’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Imaam Maymoon bin Mehraan who was born in the year 40A.H. and passed away in the year d.118A.H having met many companions said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“To refer back to Allah Subhanahu wata’ala is to refer to his Book and when the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam was alive then the people would refer to him in person and now that he has passed away then one must refer to his blessed sunnah.” (</em>Tafseer Tabari vol.5 pg.96, Mushkilul Athaar of Tahawi vol.1 pg.484, al-Faqeeyah of Imaam Khateeb al-Baghdadi vol.1 pg.144 with a hasan isnaad.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Shawkaani says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Verily there is a consensus of all of the muslims from the salaf and those after them in the present times from the companions and other than them that in the affairs of the religion where there is a conflict between the sayings of the scholars then it is obligatory for the person to refer back to the Book of Allah and the sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad sallalahu alaihi wasallam and this has been mentioned in the Qur’an in Soorah Nisa ayah 59:</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>‘O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.’</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And this is to refer to Allah Subhanahu wata’ala meaning to refer to His Book and to refer to the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam means to refer to the Sunnah after his death. There is no one that has differed concerning this, from amongst the muslims.”</em> (Sharh as-Sudoor pg.1)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Difference Between The Salafi’s and The Ashari’s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So one of the modern Barailwi Sufis Mawlana Hashmi Mian of India says in one of his speeches entitled <em>“ who are the saved sect”</em> (available to see on you tube. Hashmi Mian is one of the so called imams and muftees of the breylwee sect in India and beyond. He has on numerous occasions said in his talks that his aim in life is to “humiliate the wahaabees, ahlul hadeeth. May allah guide him or humiliate him with that which he desires for others. Ameen.) that</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Ahlul Hadeeth say that Allah has a hand so we reply, how can we say Allah has a hand for if we accept that then every hand is naturally connected to an arm, and every arm has a shoulder, and every shoulder has a neck, and every neck has a face, and every face must have a head thus they say Allah is a man!!”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Observe, the fallacy and foolishness of this caller to the gates of hellfire who has no shame in uttering such nonsense about the creator. He uses his intellect {or lack of} and lets his imagination run wild and in doing so leaves the principle of the Ahlul Hadeeth that “<em>we make no tashbeeh, resembelance between any of the attributes of Allah and those of the creation”</em> based upon the verse <strong><em>“there is nothing like unto him, and he is the all hearing and all seeing”</em></strong> (Ash Shura 42:11). This in one of the humiliated ones who left the creed of the Salaf as recorded by the Ahlul Hadeeth as is evident in his speech.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed Hashmi Mian Baralwi did not pluck his principle of precedence to qiyas, analogy and opinion over the text but it is with regret that we say such principles are the corner stone of the Hanafi Usul and Jurisprudence, it is not a coincidence therefore that the bulk of the modern day Ashaa’irah have their roots with the Hanafi madhab, Allah’s aid is sought. For example, the famous Hanafee book of Principles Husaami, a book which is a foundational book read as mandatory in the sub continent as part of the dars Nizami course says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If a narrator of hadeeth is of sound memory, just and upright but not a faqeeh {one who understands fully what he narrates} then if his narrations are in accordance with analogy and intellect  they are taken otherwise the narrator will be left such as the likes of the companions ABU HURAYRAH AND ANAS” </em>(Husami Ma Sharh an-Nami pg.152)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The book regarded as one of the most impressive texts on Hanafi Usul, Nur ul-Anwar also mentions the same as does another fundamental text of Hanafi Usul, namely Usul ash-Shashi. (Refer to Nur al-Anwar pg.181 and Usul ash-Shashi pg15)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Glory be to Allah, how those who have left the Ahlus Sunnah have even gone beyond the bounds and not left in criticising and rejecting ahadeeth from our masters like Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) and Anas (RadhiAllahu Anhu), may Allah be pleased with them saying that they were not faqihs ie jurists as those who understood the benefits of what they narrated. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has been expounded in some detail concerning the Ashaa’irah, and many Scholars of the past before, have raised their pens concerning the Ashaa’irah? Are there not more important matters to discuss like all the various troubles, famines and issues that are occurring in the world today?, Then the answer is simple, verily the knowledge about Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and His Names and Attributes is from the most important of knowledge and through it we get to know our lord and those who oppose this must be opposed and clarity must be made, for the people will never be able to worship Allah the way he ought to be worshipped if they do not even know about their lord and deny and explain away his attributes as mentioned by our prophet Muhammad Salalahu Alayhi Wasalam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, due to the Ashaa’irah having innovated principles, contra to the Sunnah which remains the same whereas bidah continues to evolve and change from time to time, then, the modern day Asharis have continued their attack upon the way of the Salaf by using newly innovated principles, different from many of the Asharis before them in many respects, thus it is of utmost importance to answer the allegation as and when they are made. It is a very important issue and one that extremely relevant today pertaining to the principles of having correct Aqidah as to the names and attributes of Allah.  One can refer to an excellent discussion on the importance of such a topic by referring to the great book of Imam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah entitled ‘Madarij us-Salikin’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another one of the great Imams of the past al-Allamah Abul Muzaffar as-Sam’ani who passed away in the year 489H said as quoted in the tremendous book <em>al-Hujjah fee Bayanil Mahajjah lee Abee Qasim al-Asbahani</em> Rahimahullah said concerning Ahlus Sunnah and who they are and the differences between Ahlus Sunnah and the various sects which have gone away from Ahlus Sunnah that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Know O Reader that one of the main differences between Ahlus Sunnah and the Ahlul Bid’ah is the issue of the intellect (aql). The Ahlul bid’ah have made the basis of understanding this religion based upon their intellects therefore any ayah of the Qur’an or any Hadeeth which goes against the intellects they try to explain it away by way of ta’weel or reject it whereas the Ahlus Sunnah say that the foundation of the deen is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the blessed Prophet Muhammed </em><em>sallalahu alaihi wasallam and it is the intellect which must be in line with that, for verily if the basis of the deen was upon intellect then Allah Subhanahu wata’ala would have had no need to send the revelation or the Prophets and the whole subject of enjoining the good and forbidding the evil through these Prophets would have been left futile and baseless based upon everyone’s own ideas and thoughts. No doubt, it is sufficient to show the fallacy of giving precedence to one’s intellect over the texts established from the Qur’an and the authentic sunnah for one to see that if the basis of the deen was based upon intellect then the believers would have had a choice to leave obeying the ahkaam and obligations set down by Allah and His Messenger up until they did not understand them. However, this is not the case and has never been the case concerning the religion of al-Islaam. So we can see that when we look at many aspects of the religion for example the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and various other issues of aqeedah then one thing that becomes clear is that we cannot understand or explain away or even reject the Names or Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala based upon our intellects for if we did this, then no doubt we would be extremely misguided and the punishment of Allah would be made mandatory for us.” (</em>al-Hujjah fee Bayanil Mahajjah Li Abi Qasim al-Asbahani vol.1 pg.348-349)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Praise be to Allah, we can see here from the salaf another way concerning the methodology that the likes of the ashaa’irah have leading them to split away from Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah and this is by them using their intellects as a basis to misunderstand and distort the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala. And it is the basis of their intellects which has made them become one of the misguided sects away from the Ahlus Sunnah and Ahlul Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reader ought to pay particular attention to the Imam’s words in that the intellect is something which is weak and there is no space for it over and above the textual evidences from the quran and Sunnah generally in the deen and specifically concerning the meaning of the names and attributes of Allah. So we see many of the people using their intellects to say <em>“ How can we accept Allah has a face because the we as humans have faces therefore Allah does not have a face but when he mentions the word face in the book and Sunnah in the Quran it must mean the pleasure and bounty of Allah”</em>. This is exactly the type of intellectual rhetoric that the Salaf have forbid from and it leads to rejecting the attributes of Allah, thus rejecting a part of Tawhid. Allahs aid is sought.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lets look further, al-Imam al-Hafiz Qawam as-Sunnah Abul Qasim Ismail bin Muhammad al-Asbahani Rahimahullah said in al-Hujjah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Some of the scholars have said that the reasons people have split away from the Ahlus Sunnah are based upon seven premises for which the sects have become misguided:</em></span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Their position regarding the essence {dhaat} of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala. </em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Concerning Allah’s Attributes and Names. </em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Concerning the actions of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala. </em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Concerning their position about Iman (belief). </em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Concerning their position on punishment for those who sin. </em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Concerning their belief and position about the Qur’an. </em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Concerning their position about the Kheelafah and Imamate. </em></span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Ahlus Sunnah is the saved sect which opposes the various other sects in these 7 categories and it takes that which has come from the Qur’an and the authentically proven Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam. For verily Allah Subhanahu wata’ala has said in His Qur’an Soorah Shura Ayah 11: “There is none like him and he Sees and Hears everything.” So we can see from this ayah that there is none like unto Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and we only give the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala which he has given for Himself in His Book and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam and the people have a consensus upon this. So any individual who goes against the Names and Attributes of Allah which have been mentioned in the Book and Sunnah then he is misguided. We say, that Allah has free will, He is Alive, He Hears, He Sees, He Speaks, He gives life and death, amongst various other Attributes and He has been with these Attributes from the very beginning, eternally. Even though many sects claim that they are upon this way concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah but in reality they have invented innovations into the deen and have fallen into the trials and tribulations of ta’weel (figurative interpretation of the Ashaa’irah) going and following the mutashaabihah (that which is ambiguous from the shariah) whereas, Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah cling to the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam and the Ijmaa’ of the Salaf us-Saliheen and they do not go outside of this, nor do they try to find a way to make figurative interpretations and ta’weel so that they fall into that which is unclear. The belief which is based upon figurative interpretations against the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the Salaf is an innovation and falls into the saying of the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam, “that which is not from our command, deen is rejected.” </em>(al-Bukhari no.255, Muslim no.1817, al-Hujjah fee Bayanil Mahajjah li Abi Qasim al-Asbahani volume 2 pgs.409-411)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One can clearly see that the likes of Imaam Asbahani who passed away in the year 535A.H. had a clear understanding at that time, that the groups like the Ashaa’irah and the mu’tazilah and other than them who fell into figurative interpretations outside the understating of the Qur’an, Sunnah and Salaf concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah, in reality, left the fold of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah and fell into making Bid’ah (innovation) in Aqidah and for this reason the likes of Imam al-Asbahani and various other Ulama made it clear regarding the distinction between Ahlus Sunnah and Ahlul Bid’ah such as the Ashaa’irah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here we see from the above that another reason for the destruction of the Aqidah and methodologies of the Ashaa’irah is that they fell into that which was ambiguous and left that which was clear from the Book and the Sunnah and the consensus of the blessed Salaf. If one looks at the seven categories it is as clear as the day that almost all sects that left the Ahlus Sunnah have faltered in at least one of the areas, thus leaving the Jama’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Turning to some of the doubts that the Ashaa’irah and other then them raise then from amongst them is that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“if the Attributes are taken, the way the Ahlul Hadith take them, that is literally with a clear meaning as was intended in the Arabic language, without any ta’weel without any tasheebh without any distortions {taghayyur} or ilhaad {rejections} in any of the meanings or acceptance, then this would be in contradiction with the Qur’an because it says in Surah Ash-shuraa ayah 11, “There is nothing like Him” yet various ahadeeth confirm for Allah eyes, the Seeing, the Hearing and the Hands and the Coming and the Foot and so on concerning Allah. Therefore we leave that which has come in the narrations concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala since they are in contradiction with the Qur’an, and the Qur’an would therefore take precedence”. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Of course this principle of theirs as stated above is an innovated principle that has no basis. For the sake of brevity we will keep the answer to this false principle very brief and just mention some of the sayings of the Salaf past and present to show that in the generality of Islam there is absolutely no contradictions between the authentic Ahadith and the Qur’an and there certainly is no contradiction when it comes to the blessed Aqidah concerning the Names and Attributes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">  Baqiyyah bin Waleed Rahimahullah says that he heard Imaam Awzaa’ee Rahimahullah say to him concerning the people who do not take the authentic narrations when in contradiction to their opinions and own analogies, say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whenever you read an authentic narration to a person of bid’ah against his bid’ah then he will see this as something evil.”</em> (Sharf Ashabul Hadeeth of Khateeb Baghdadee who said the chain is authentic.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ajuree Rahimahullah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“That the people who are of knowledge and intellect, whenever they mention an authentic narration from the Messenger of Allah </em><em>sallalahu alaihi wasallam so it is only the ignoramus who will then say that I only accept that which has come in the Qur’an. It will be said to him ‘you are an individual who has an illness and concerning the likes of you the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam has warned us’.”</em> (ash-Shariah pg.49)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Imaam Ash-Shafi’ee Rahimahullah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is no instance in which a Sunnah (hadeeth of the Messenger of Allah </em><em>sallalahu alaihi wasallam) will be in contradiction to the Book of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala” (</em>ar-Risaalah of ash-Shafi’ee pg.546)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muhaqqiq Imaam Shaatibee said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Contradiction is generally of two types, one is an actual contradiction and one is the one that the scholar perceives to be a contradiction. As for the actual and true contradiction then this is impossible between the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam.” (</em>al-Muwafaqaat vol.4 pg.294)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So how about the ignorant Ashari of today or past who would say that he does not take Allah Subhanahu wata’ala having Hands or Allah Subhanahu wata’ala having Eyes as established from the authentic ahadith because this is in contradiction with Sooratul Ikhlaas where it says that, there is none like Allah or that Allah Subhanahu wata’ala has no example?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> So in using his aql over the texts of the hadith and in thinking that when the salaf say “Hand of Allah” it means hand like the hand of any of the creation or it means the bounty of Allah he began first by rejecting the hadith and this then lead him to inevitably reject numerous ayaat of the Qur’an which mention Allah’s hand. Therefore, it is clear that those that twist the meaning of an authentic narration so that they can make it fit with their intellects and make it conform to their madhabs have chosen a calamitous path and it is these people that the Salaf warned about.</span></p>
