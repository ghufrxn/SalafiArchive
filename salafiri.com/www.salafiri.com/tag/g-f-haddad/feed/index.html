				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haddad on <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.51</span> mentions the issue of thse who affirm that Allaah can lie, ‘Imkaan al-Kaadhib’ and claims Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel Dehlawee was the first of the Wahhabis of India to forward this heresy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto to say, “Refutation were published by Mulla Saahib Baghdadi and Mawlana Fadl al-Haqq Khayrabadi…” (Albani and his Friends <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.51</span>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the affair is that in about 1240H<span id="more-268"></span> some of the opponents of Ahlus- Sunnah started to raise some false allegation regarding the book Taqwiyyatul-Eemaan. Mulla Baghdaadee became influenced by them, that resulted in him writing a letter which he then sent to Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel in Kaanpoor So as soon as the objection was received by Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel, he immediately answered it and returned it back to him in Delhi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the people who witnessed this reply and also heard it were the grandson of Shaikh Abdul-Azeez Muhaddith Dehlawee Maulana Muhammad Ya’qoob, also Maulana Naseer ud deen, Maulana Mahboob Alee and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alhamdulillah, all praise be to Allaah the Rabb of everything that exists, we have this response of Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel and inshallaah if possible will present the full response later. So the opposers created doubts and confusion regarding Taqwiyyatul- Eemaan in the mind of Mulla Baghdaadee, as Taqwiyyatul-Eemaan was written initially written in Arabic as the book ‘Radd al-Ashraak’ which was later translated into Urdu, as the first chapter and was titled as the famous work of Taqwiyyatul-Eemaan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel sent the Arabic edition to a handful of people but the edition that became well known was the Urdu one and Mulla Baghdaddee did not understand the language and relied on translation and interpretation of others, the ones who caused the confusion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the response of Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel the doubts and confusion of Mulla were cleared and later Mulla Baghdaadee met Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel and personally apologised for his false allegations and admitted that his confusion was based upon what was incorrectly conveyed to him by the opposers of Ahlus-Sunnah. (refer to Tadhkirrah Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.235-236</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel mentions in his response that Mulla Baghdaadee himself praised the book Taqwiyyatul-Eemaan but argued that a particular statement was correct and from the aspects of Belief but mentioning it was disrespectful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“..All praise be to Allaah that he guided many a man and woman by this treatise and no one looked at it with doubt or revilement except a handful of ignorant opposers. I have also come to know this treatise of mines was read to you and you praised it. Also with this you said that from the creation of Allaah, he creating the idols and making them equivalent to the Prophets is something true and from the aspects of belief but it is a form of disrespect and dishonour….” (The Response to Mulla Baghdaadee’s Letter <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.1-2</span>).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel then goes onto answer this claim in great detail. So this is the affair of the “refutation” that WAS NOT published as falsely claimed by Haddad, by Mulla Baghadadee and his position regarding Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What follows, is a series of articles in response the work of the rabid soofee G F Haddad titled ‘Albani and his friends’ similarly this series is also part of the ongoing and continuous series of Answeing the Rabid Soofee’s series, Inshallaah. We have and will named <span id="more-265"></span>our series in this regard to be titled ‘The Hanafiyyah and their muqallids” Haddad the rabid soofee quotes from one Fadl al-Rasul al-Badayuni in ‘Albani and his Friends <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.51-55</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However as mentioned in part 4, al Badayuni said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Making idols for the purpose of being worshipped is not disbelief (Kufr).” (Fataawa Maulana Fadl Rasool Badayooni <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.14</span>, Mufeed Khalaa’iq Press ShaahjahaanAbaad 1228H).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this is the one who Haddad saw fit to quote from, in order to rebuke Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel Shaheed, this Badayuni the one who promoted and allowed idol worship. We seek refuge in Allaah from the disease of Shirk</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sayyiyd Abdul-Hayy Husainee said about him, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“He was a trouble maker, bigoted, a debater, a strong exposer of the Sunnah and a caller to innovations, an enemy of the people of the Haqq and a friend of worldly affairs. He worked for the british government and used to receive money (ie on the payroll) from the leaders of rural states and in addition to this his writings (books, and treatises and articles) would be printed by the British government from their presses.” (Nazhatul-Khawaatir 7/377-378, Akmal at-Taareekh, this is the biography of Fadl ar-Rasul al-Badayuni authored by Munshee Muhammad Ya’qoob Hussain Badayuni and refer also to Tadhkirrah Ulama Hindh <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.381</span> printed from Karachee)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As mentioned above, the biographer of Maulana Fadl al-Rasul al- Badayuni, Munshee Muhammad Ya’qoob Hussain Dhiyaa al-Qaadiree Badayuni (a soofee) also mentioned that he used to work for the British government and was on their payroll and receive money from the leaders of rural states and provinces. (see his Akmal at-Taareekh 2/372, 380, 512 printed in 1331H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would also receive money from the leaders of Hydraabaad and they would look after him, give him sittings in their gatherings and the rest of the affair and they would help him financially. (Fuqaaha Of Paak and Hind 3/133-134.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was very bigoted and staunch, reaching the realms of extremism and in this he refuted and rebuked Mujaddid Alf Thaanee and Shaah Waleeullaah Dehlawee and in their affair he would go beyond bounds. (Fuqaaha Of Paak and Hind 3/134.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haddad says on the other hand shows some respect and reverence for Shaah Waleeullaah Dehlawee and Mujaddid Alf Thaanee yet al Badayuni did not even spare them, so what hope could have been expected when it came to Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel Shaheed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Badayuni also wrote some books against Ahlus-Sunnah, ie al-Bawaariq al- Muhammadiyyah, Tas-heeh al-Masaa’il, Sayf al-Jabbaar, al-Mu’taqad al- Muntaqad and others. This enemy of Ahlus-Sunnah and the muslims also wrote an explanation of Fusoos al-Hikam, the book of the Kaafir, disbeliever Ibn Arabee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fadl al-Rasul al-Badayuni worked for the british government, first he was a muftee for them and then moved to being a clerical worker, he also worked for Raajah Nawaab Singh. Later when his home town of Badayun fell out of the hands of the Britsh government during the war of independence in 1857ce, he helped the british, saving their wealth and lives just to maintain their control. (Fuqaaha Of Paak and Hind 3/134)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A bareilwee historian Doctor Muhammad Ayoob Qaadiree wrote, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“When the control of british government finished in Badayun there was chaos everywhere but Moulwee Fadl Rasul Badyuni restored some order (for the british) and tried to save the lives of the people (And whose lives he tried to save is clarified further).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence the newspaper Jabeeb of Badayun 25th June 1857ce corresponding to 3 Dhul-Qadah 1273H mentions, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“And because the Holy scholar and Soofee Moulwee Fadl al-Rasul had organised things very well, there were no major incidences. He by risking his life from the hooligans and mob and attempted to save the people and the people were the soldiers of the british government and he tried fully to restore peace and order.” (The War of Indepedence 1857ce, Events and Personalities <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.140</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another british government worker Bihaaree Laal the deputy inspector of Badayun also said the same about Moulwee Badayuni and his affair and connection with the british government. (The War of Independence 1857ce, Events and Personalities <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.140-141</span>, The Freedom Struggle 5/318)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The bareilwee historian Ayoob Qaadiree also mentions that some of the followers, close associates like the biographer of Moulwee Fadl al-Rasul Badayuni attempted to brush this aside and hide the reality of this affair but the reality is apparent and well known to those who consult the books of the history of India. (The War of Indepedence 1857ce, Events and Personalities <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.141</span>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to this, for his work and his support of the british government he was rewarded substantially and the British Commissioner of Muradabaad gave him a piece of land for this feat. (Fuqaaha Of Paak and Hind 3/136) refer also Tadhkirrah Ulama Hindh <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.380-383</span>, Qamoos al-Mashaheer 2/127 and Nazahatul-Khawaatir 7/377-378)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haddad on <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.55</span> of ‘Albani and his friends’ mentions 2 books of Badayuni but none of these were a direct refutation of Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the works of Badayuni one was Tas-heeh al-Masaa’il which was a refutation of Shaikh Muhammad Ishaaq Dehlawee’s two treatises, Arbaa’een al-Masaa’il and Mi’yatul-Masaa’il.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Badayuni attacked Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel in most of his books but the work which he authored specifically in refutation of Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel’s Taqwiyyatul-Eemaan was his al-Bawaariq al- Muhamamdiyyah and in it he does not only attack Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel, but he unlawfully makes takfeer of him, he also attacked Ahlus- Sunnah, refuted the works of Shaah Waleeullaah Dehlawee, in specific his Izaalatul-Khafa Ann Khilaafatul Khulafaa and his Durratul-Aynayn and others and concluded these books were against Ahlus-Sunnah. (refer to Badayuni’s al-Bawaariq <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.27-32</span>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alhamdulillah, all praise be to Allaah, the scholars of Ahlul-Hadeeth answered all of his allegations and despicable lies and errors. So Shaikh Qadhee Basheer ud deen Qanoojee answered Badayuni’ al-Bawaariq  and obliterated its contents in his ‘as-Sawaa’iq al-Aalhiyyah Lee-Radd Shayateen al-Lahbiyyah’ and in answer to Badayuni’s Tas-heeh al Masaa’il Qaadhee Basheer ud deen authored ‘Tafheem al-Masaa’il’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also in answer to Badayuni’s works, Shaikh Muhammad Taqee Khaan Dehlawee authored ‘an-Nashr’ and Shaikh Siraaj Ahmad Sehsawaanee (d.1279H) authored ‘Siraaj ul-Eemaan’ in support of Taqwiyyatul Eemaan and answered all the allegations levied by Badayuni and other soofee’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to this Shaikh Haider Alee Taunkee (d.1272H) authored his monumental ‘Siyaanatul an-Naas Ann Waswasatul-Khannaas’ in refutation of Badayuni’s allegations, which he raised in his books and much more, so this is the affair of al-Badayuni</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The rabid soofee Gibril Fouad Haddad in his born again soofee book, ‘Albani and his friends’ quotes from one Fadl al-Rusul Badayuni the soofee church father and what a great history he had.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will mention his affair in detail in this series when we get to the stage of answering his book in great detail, but for now look at what this Badayuni said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Making idols for the purpose of being worshipped is not disbelief (Kufr).” (Fataawa Maulana Fadl Rasool Badayooni <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.14</span>, Mufeed Khalaa’iq Press ShaahjahaanAbaad 1228H).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this is the one who Haddad saw fit to quote from in order to rebuke Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel Shaheed, Fadl ar-Rusul the one who promoted and allowed idol worship, need we say anymore.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khaan said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Our peer (holy men) can be present in every place in 10,000 places in 10,000 cities at one time” and he gives an example, “it was possible for Sayyidee Fathe Muhammad Quddus to be present in  10 different gatherings at once.” Then Ahmad Raza gives an evidence for this which was, “Look at Krishan Kehnayyah, he was a disbeliever and he would also be present in a number of places at once.” (Malfoozaat (1/141-142).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khaan said in another book, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Shaikh Abul-Fath Jaunpooree was invited 10 times by the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was- Sallam) on Rabee ul-Awwal to come after the Dhuhr prayer, so he accepted his invitation from every place. So someone asked him, “Oh sir you accepted the invitation from all 10 places and agreed to be (in all 10 places) after the Dhuhr prayer, but how is this possible.” He replied, “Krishan who was a disbeliever, would be in different places at one time, so Abul-Fath can be present in 10 places, so then what is the amazement in this.” (Ahkaam Sharee’at 2/192).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If someone is in the land of the disbelievers residing in a village, for example if there are only hindus there and this person is unable to leave the place for some reason. So then tell us if a situation arises then who will he immediately ask (ie ask for a fatwa)? Then it will be said to him, “Ask the Pandit (a Pandit is a hindu priest).” (Fataawa Rizwiyyah 3/253)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly on one hand Ahmad Raza Khaan held the nikah (marriage) of a Wahhabi to be invalid yet on the other hand he says if a Brahaman (A high form of Hindu) performs the nikah, the nikah will be valid!!!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His exacts words, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The nikah will be valid as a nikah is the accepting of the vows, even if a brahaman performs it.” (Ahkaam Sharee’at 2/225)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So with the rabid soofee bareilwee’s, the church fathers of Haddad, the nikah if performed by a hindu brahaman priest is valid and what does a hindu priest recite, they recite nothing but from their holy books the Ashlook from the Vedas and Pauthiyah, because they do not know the Qur’aan and yet on the other hand if a follower of the Qur’aan, Sunnah, Hadeeth and aathaar, a Wahhaabee performs the nikah it is invalid!!!!! It is not just marriage that is allowed, he Ahmad Raza Khaan allows their food which they distribute on their holy days.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khaan said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Question, the sweets and other foods the kaafirs distribute on Haulee and Diwalee (Hindu and Sikh Festivals), is it permissible for the muslims to accept this or not? He replied, “Do not accept it on the day but if they give it to you the next day then you may take it.? (al-Malfoozaat 1/115).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An emiment soofee bareliwee scholar, Moulwee Ghulaam Jahaaniyyah said in a poem, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Having Ishq (love (of sexual nature) for Muhammad is not specific to the muslims, the Kautharee hindus also call upon the Muhammad.” (Hafat Aqtaab <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.123</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this bareliwee soofee is trying to say the hindus will be at the Pool of Kauthar because they call upon Muhammad (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was- Sallam) and are his true lovers!!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khaan was influenced so much by the hindu religious books that his poetry full of shirk is written based on the hindu sanskrit. (refer to his despicable book Khadaa’iq Bakhshish 3/70)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khaan’s faithful disciple, Ahmad Yaar Khaan Na’eemee Gujraatee the author of Jaa ul-Haqq said concerning Ibraaheem Alayhis-Salaam, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The mushrikeen (polytheists) show him respect by calling him Krishan.” (Noor al-A’rfaan <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.492</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said in another place, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The mushriks of Hindh praise him by calling him Krishan and the mushrikeen of Arabia refer to themselves as Ibraaheemee.” (Noor al-A’rfaan <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.590</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this Ahmad Yaar Khaan Na’eemee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“A religious hindu said to me, “The person you call Ibraaheem we call him Krishan Jee and we call Ismaa’eel, Arjun.” (Noor al-A’rfaan <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.492</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So all the above shows the influence of the hindu religion upon the bareilwee religion and this duality is much deeper than we have mentioned here</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is not a single example from the Prophet life that by passed the Muslim Ummah. The act of worship such as the Adhaan is done five times a day which was legislated 10 years after Hijraa and it was done In front of the prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) in Madeenah, and in the books of ahadeeth we have its history and the Mu-adhdhin. But it is not in a single narration that one should kiss his thumbs on hearing the Adhaan, if we do want to kiss something then we might as well as kiss the Muadhdhin lips who utters the A’dhaan five times a day. This action of kissing the thumbs on hearing the Adhaan was never practiced during the time of the pious predecessors.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Their Evidences</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> The narration is that which is attributed to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that when he heard the Mu-adhdhin say “Ashhaadu anna muhammadur rasoolullah” he would kiss his thumbs and fingers (Index) and then touch his eyes and the prophet saw said whoever does this like my beloved has done then my intercession will be compulsory for him.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has been narrated in Musnad Firdaus by Daylamee Tadhkirrah al-Mawdhoo’aat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.36</span>, al-Mawdhoo’aat Kabeer <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.75</span>, Ahmad Yaar khaan Bareilwee in Jaa ul-Haq pg 378 from Maqaasid Hasanah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.384</span>, Mukhtasar al-Maqaasid <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.174</span>, Muhammad Umar Bareliwee in Maqyaas Khaafiyat pg. 603, also al-Lulu Wal-Marsoo’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.505</span>, at-Tamayyiz <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.154</span>, al-Khisf 2/269-270, al-Asraar al-Marfoo’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.306</span>, al-Masnoo’ah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.168-169</span>, al-Fawaa’id <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.19</span>, Asnee al-Mataalib <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.276</span> and Nukhbah al- Baheeyyah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.112</span>)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Muhammad Taahir writes </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Wa Laa Yasaheeh” not Saheeh (Tadhkirrah al-Mawdhoo’aat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.36</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mulla Alee Qaaree from Allaamah Sakhawee that this narration is not Saheeh (al-Mawdhoo’aat Kabeer <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.75</span>) Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Tarbulusee Hanafee (d.1305) said, “Sakahwee has rejected it and said this is not authentic.” (al-Lulul al-Marsoo’ah Feemaa al-Asal Lahu WaBaa Asli Mawdhoo <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.505</span> <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.168</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the hadeeth is not Saheeh then how can you act upon it. Ahmad Yaar khan Bareilwee quotes Sakhawi that he said “wa lam yasaheeh” and translates it as “its level of authenticity does not reach a high level”. What Muhammad Umar did was even more strange, he mentions the hadeeth from Tadhkirrah al-Mawdhoo’aat and al-Mawdhoo’aat Kabeer and does not mention “la yasaheeh” deliberately.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to this, it opposes the established Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) where he informed us to repeat the words of the A’dhaan when the mu’adhin says the a’dhaan and then send salutations upon me and Allaah will shower 10 blessing upon him. (Saheeh Muslim 1/166, Abu Dawood 1/77), in another hadeeth he said, ‘Whoever says these words (of the A’dhaan) with sincerity then he enter Paradise.” Saheeh Muslim 1/167, Abu Dawood 1/78).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Answering the A’dhaan has been narrated by a number of companions, Abu Hurairah, Abee Raaf’e, Umm Habeebah, Abdullaah bin Rabee’a, A’ishah, Mu’adh, Mu’awiyyah and others (Radhiallaahu Anhuma). (refer to Tirmidhee with Tuhfah 1/183, Talkhees al-Habeer 1/211, Tamheed 10/134, Irwaa ul-Ghaleel 1/258, Baihaqee 1/409)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Mistake of Ahmad Yaar Khaan Na’eemee Bareliwee.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He writes </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Not reaching the level of Saheeh does not necessarily mean that it is Da’eef because the rating of Hasan is after Saheeh, and if this is Hasan then it is enough” (Jaa ul-Haq <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.382</span>). But he should know that when the Muhaditheen say “la yasaheeh” mutlaq (absolutely) it means nothing else except that it is Da’eef. If it was Hasan they would have explained and said Ya laisa bissaheeh bil hasanun,</span></em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Removing a Doubt.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mulla Alee Qaree says </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If this hadeeth is Saheeh up to Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) then it is enough to act upon it because the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) said “my Sunnah and the Sunnah of my rightly guided Khulapha is obligatory upon you” (al-Mawdhoo’aat al-Kabeer <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.65</span>]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Yar khaan (Jaa ul-Haq <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.382</span>) and Muhammad Umar (Maqyaas Khaafiyat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.602</span>) also use the same reasoning. But this is Mulla Alee Qaaree’s conscious because if this hadeeth was Mauqoof up to Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) then it would have been a Hujjah but the narration that is attributed to Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is Marfoo and its Sanad is not Saheeh all the way so then to say that the Marfoo hadeeth is not Saheeh and the mauqoof is Saheeh then how is it enough to say that this is sufficient.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Ruling On Acting Upon Weak Ahadeeth</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Yaar Khaan writes </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“That if it is accepted that this hadeeth is Da’eef, then in virtuous actions Daeef hadeeth are enough.” (Jaa ul-Haq <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.383</span>]. </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is also his incorrect understanding, that every Da’eef ahadeeth is accepted in actions of virtue, this is totally wrong.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Qadhee ibn al-Arabi al-Maliki (d.543H) and others have said regarding Da’eef ahadeeth</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “{La ya’mal bihi mutlaqan), it is Absolutely incorrect to act upon them.” (al-Qawl al-Badee’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.165</span>]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Those who act upon them have conditions so Imaam ibn Daqeeq al-Eed (d.702h) writes </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Acting on Da’eef ahadeeth has conditions.” (Imaam 2/171)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What are those conditions, Imaam Sakhawi (d.902h) writes by quoting his Shaykh Haafidh ibn Hajr, “Acting upon Da’eef ahadeeth has three conditions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1.That all the Muhaditheen agree that the hadeeth is not extremely Daeef ie the hadeeth in which the narrators are not kadhaabs, who may be suspected or accused kadhaabs, or any such narrator who is munfarid (alone), who made a lot of mistakes then his Daeef hadeeth will not be a normal Daeef ahadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. That the Hadeeth is not present under baseless principles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. While acting one has the belief that the hadeeth is not proven from the</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Prophet (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) so that something is not attributed to him that he did not say. (al-Qawl al-Badee’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.195</span>, Tadreeb ur-Raawee 1/298-299, Fath al-Mugeeth 1/268)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find that if anyone of the criteria above are missing, then in any circumstances the hadeeth does not need to be acted upon. Especially the 3rd condition because the that which is not proven from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) and if one tries to attribute it to him and then to accept it as proven from him is a major crime indeed because it totally opposes the Mutawatir Narration of “He who intentionally attributes a lie to me, then let him take his seat in the Fire of Hell”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maulana Abdul Hayy Lucknowee writes </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The claim that acting upon Da’eef ahadeeth in the issue of virtue without difference is Baatil, Yes this is the opinion of the majority but the condition is that the Hadeeth is not severely Da’eef otherwise it will also not be accepted in the issues of virtues actions” (al-Aathaar al-Marfoo’aah Fee al-Akhbaar al-Mawdhoo’aah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.310</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It’s a pity the innovators put heels on end to prove such Ahadeeth. What beautiful words said a Bareilwee (Which is extremely rare) who said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“To accept Ahadeeth and attributing it to the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was- Sallam) needs proof, an attribution without proof is not permissible. (Arfaan Sharee’at 3/27)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As A result acting on Da’eef Ahadeeth pertaining to virtues actions must comply with the 3 conditions and acting upon them is Mustahab on the condition that it is not Mawdoo. If the narration is Mawdoo then there is no action upon it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Daqeeq writes </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If the Hadeeth is Da’eef on the condition that it is not Mawdoo, then acting upon it is permissible. But if by it a new custom arises or is born in the Deen as a result then it also forbade from.” (Ahkaam al-Ahkaam 1/51)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So here another point has been resolved and that is that the Da’eef ahadeeth is only acted upon when it is not Mawdoo (Fabricated) or forged bearing in mind that any Da’eef hadeeth which leads to a custom in the Deen, will be stopped. The people of innovation try to make such actions as the Sunnah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Sakhawee writes, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“That it is permissible and Mustahab to act upon Da’eef Ahadeeth which Command virtues actions and encouragement, but the condition is that the Ahadeeth are not fabricated or forged.” (al-Qawl al-Badee’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.195</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“However The Mawdoo Hadeeth, Then it is not permissible to act upon them in any circumstances.” (al-Qawl al-Badee’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.196</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The summary is that it permissible to act upon Da’eef Ahadeeth in actions of virtue and this has some conditions set by the Muhadditheen and the Ahadeeth which are Mawdoo or forged then there is no action upon them neither in the issue of virtues or encouragement. Not only are the Ahadeeth concerning the kissing of the thumbs Da’eef but infact it is mawdoo ie fabricated and forged.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Jalaal ud Deen Suyootee writes, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Those ahadeeth which mention the kissing of the fingers and then placing them on the eyes when the Mu’adhdhin mentions the name of the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was- Sallam), all of them are fabricated.” (Tayseer al-Maqaal Lil Suyootee from E’emaad ud-Deen <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.123</span>]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is another narration from Khidr (Alayhee Wassalaatu Wasalaam) which mentions the thumbs in Tadhkirrah al-Mawdhoo’aat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.36</span>, al- Mawdhoo’aat al-Kabeer <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.75</span>, Ahmad Yaar khaan Bareilwee in Jaa ul-Haq <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.378</span> from Maqaasid al-Hasanah, Muhammad Umar in Maqyaas Khaafiyat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.601</span>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Muhammad Taahir and Mulla Alee Qaaree write, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“There are a lot of Majhool (Unknown) Narrators in the chain and it is also Manqat’a (Disconnected).” (Tadhkirrah al-Mawdhoo’aat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.36</span>, al-Mawdhoo’aat al-Kabeer <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.75</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then how can we insert this narration in the Deen, Imaam Baihaqee writes in one place, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“That in this chain there are a number of unknown narrators, and Allaah has not made us responsible that we take our Deen from unknown narrators.” (Kitaab al-Qir’ah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.127</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Muhammad Naasir ud Deen al-Albaanee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“This hadeeth is not Saheeh and has been attributed to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeque (Marfooan) by Daylamee in Musnad al-Firdaus. But ibn Taahir says in at-Tadhkirrah that it is not Saheeh and Imaam Shawkaani also says the same in al- Hadeeth al-Mawdhoo’aah (pg.9) and Sakhawee has also said that it is not Saheeh in al-Maqaasid.” (Silsilah Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah Wal-Mawdhoo’ah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.73</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Imaam al-Allaamah al-Faadhil Muhammad Nazeer Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawee was asked about this and other similar ahadeeth that mention the wiping of the eyes upon hearing the A’dhaan, he replied, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“All of the ahadeeth in this regard are not authentic not a single one nor is a single one established nor can they be found in any reliable book. The investigators and criticisers of hadeeth spoke about all these ahadeeth and concluded they and not authentic and are infact fabricated.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Shams ud deen Abul-Khair Muhammad Wajeeh ud deen Abdur- Rahmaan as-Sakhawee in Maqaasid al-Hasanah, shaikh ul-Islaam the translator of Bukhaari, Hasan bin Alee Hindee, Ibn Rabee’a ash-Shaafi’ee, Zarqaanee Maalikee and Muhammad Taahir Fitnee Hanafee all said said about this hadeeth, “Laa Ya-Sahah.” and La Ya-Sahah means the hadeeth is not established.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Muhammad Taahir Patnee wrote in his Tadhkirrah, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Our words La Ya-Sahah are used when something is not established.”  Shaikh ul-Islaam wrote in his translation of Bukhaari, “After mentioning the hadeeth for wiping the eyes after hearing the words of the A’dhaan) These ahadeeth are established at all.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hasan bin Alee Hindee, the author of Sabeel al-Janaan wrote in his notes (Ta’leeqaat) to Mishkaat al-Masabeeh,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “That which has been narrated about wiping the eyes when hearing the words of the A’dhaan, then they are not established.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mahmood Ahmad Aynee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“It is obligatory upon everyone who hears the A’dhaan to stop anything they are doing and to answer the A’dhaan.” and he goes onto further explain. Muhammad Ya’qoob Nabnaanee mentioned in Khair al-Jaaree Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari the statement of Aynee and said, “From those things that are prohibited are the wiping of the eyes when hearing the words of the A’dhaan.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Abu Ishaaq bin Abdul-Jabbaar Kaabulee wrote in Sharh Risaalah Abdus-Salaam Lahooree, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The ahadeeth mentioing the wiping of the eyes when hearing the words of the A’dhaan are not established and they are weak narrations and this is why the scholars of hadeeth have clearly said all such ahadeeth are fabricated.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Abul-Hasan Abdul-Ghaafir Faarsee, the author of Mufham Sharh Saheeh Muslim and Majma’a al-Gharaa’ib, has written in Kitaab Aqwaal al- Aakazeeb after mentioing the hadeeth from Daylaamee’s Musnad al- Firdaus, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“There are many narrations mentioning the kissing of the thumbs when hearing the words of the A’dhaan, but they have no basis, nor with a weak chain and Haafidh Abu Nu’aym Asfahaanee said all that which has been narrated in this regard, then all of them are fabricated.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Suyootee wrote in Kitaab Tayseer al-Maqaal, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Those ahadeeth which mention the kissing of the fingers and then placing them on the eyes when the Mu’adhdhin mentions the name of the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam), then all of them are fabricated.” The Imaam has also mentioned this in his book ad-Durar al-Muntathirah Fee Ahadeeth al- Muntashirah.” (and much more refer to Fataawa Nazeeriyyah 1/248-251)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Allaamah Muhammad Abdul-Jaleel Saamroodee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Issue: the issue of wiping the eyes with the thumbs when hearing the A’dhaan, Shaamee <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.413</span> mentions from Jarhee who said nothing of this is established from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam). Allaamah Lucknowee writes in Sa’ayah 2/46, “The haqq is is that there is no hadeeth or report (authentic) from the Prophet concerning the wiping of the eyes when hearing the A’dhaan.” So whoever says this is correct is indeed a big liar and this is a despicable innovation, which has no basis in the books of Sharee’ah and whoever does bring any evidences, then it is just for argumentation. Allaamah Muhammad Taahir Fitnee said in Majma’a Bahaar al-Anwaar <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.511</span>, “The hadeeth that mentions the kissing of the thumbs is not authentic.” Similarly that which has been narrated from Khidr (Alayhis-Salaam),Shaah Abdul-Azeez said in his Fataawa this action is not mentioned in any reliable hadeeth nor has it been reported from the rightly guided khulafa, nor is this Sunnah or something recommended rather it is an innovation and one should refrain from doing this and that which has been mentioned in the books of jurists is not reliable and so on…” (Zahrah Riyaadh al-Abraar Maa Ya’anee an-Naas Ann Hamal al-Asfaar <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.76-77</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the following scholars held this narration to be fabricated</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Taahir in Tadhkirrah al-Mawdhoo’aat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.36</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Khaleel Tarbulusee in al-Lulu Wal-Marsoo’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.505</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mulla Alee Qaaree in al-Asraar al-Marfoo’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.306</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mulla Alee Qaaree in al-Masnoo’ah Fee Ma’arifah al-Mawdhoo’ah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.168-169</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Shawkaanee in al-Fawaa’id al-Majmoo’aah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.19</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam al-Albaanee in Silsilah Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah Wal-Mawdhoo’ah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.73</span>. and others</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and finally we conclude with the position of the leader and Imaam of the bareilwee soofee sect, the Imaam of Gibril Haddad and others,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khaan Bareilwee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“When hearing the name of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) and then kissing the thumbs and rubbing them on the eyes is not established from any marfoo hadeeth and that which is narrated concerning this is not free from any speech, so whoever considers such an evidence (ie one that has speech concerning it) or considers (the action) to be practiced or considers the abandoning of this practice to be worthy of censure, then indeed he is upon error.” (Abar al-Maqaal Fee Qiblatil Ajlaal <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.12</span>)</span></em></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By: The Hanafee Shaikh Abil-Hasanaat Abdul-Hayy Lucknowee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Source: Majmoo’a al-Fataawaa (1/45-46)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abul-Hasanaat Abdul-Hayy Lucknowee is well respected with the Hanafiyyah and there is no doubt concerning this. The rabid soofee Gibril Fouad Haddad has even accepted the eminence of Abdul-Hayy Lucknowee and titles him with the title of ‘Imaam’. So now we will see what his Imaam has to say concerning his beliefs. So by the time we have finished with Haddad and his pack the hanafiyyah will have no choice but to abandon this and other illegimate children of theirs. “Imaam”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abul-Hasanaat Abdul-Hayy Lucknowee was asked</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>QUESTION</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">It is the habit of the people of this city that during a calamity they call upon the prophets and awliyaa for help and they believe they are haadhir naadhir (omnipresent and watching), and that when they call upon them, they listen and supplicate for their needs, so is this permissible or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">This is unlawful rather it is clear and manifest shirk because in this someone other than Allaah is considered to have knowledge of the unseen and such a belief is clear Shirk. According to the Sharee’ah of Islaam shirk is to give and consider someone other than Allaah to have Allaah’s attributes and qualities and having knowledge of the unseen is one such attribute, as the books of Aqeedah have clearly mentioned. As a summary we will just mention one quote,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mulla Alee Qaaree wites in the Explanation of Fiqh ul-Akbar, “Knowledge of the unseen is such affair which is for Allaah alone and humans are informed by means of insights miracles or signs in order to bring evidence, from those things in which this is possible and doing this in way that is not possible for them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the reason why the books of verdicts mention that if someone by looking at the clouds, claims to have knowledge of the unseen and says today it will rain, then this is disbelief and the hanafiyyah have declared the people to be disbelievers who believe the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) had knowledge of the unseen because it contradicts the saying of Allaah, “Say no one knows the unseen of the heavens and the earths, except Allaah” this is how it is mentioned in Masaa’irah (a hanafee book of aqeedah).”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So believing that the prophets and the awliyaa are haadhir naadhir and to believe they hear our calls of need all the time in every situation, even if they are far away, is clear Shirk because this attribute is specific and solely for Allaah and no one is equal to him in this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fataawa Bazaaziyyah mentions, “Someone married (ie did a nikah) without witnesses and said, “I make Allaah, his Messenger and his Angels my witnesses” then he becomes a disbeliever (Kaafir) because he held the belief that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) and the Angels know the unseen.” Bazzaaziyyah also mentions. “Similarly our scholars (ie the hanafee scholars) said about those people who believe the souls of the Maashaykh (ie Soofee shaikhs) are haadhir, then they are disbelievers (Kaafirs).” And Allaah knows best, Abul Hasanaat Muhammad Abdul-Hayy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>QUESTION</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">What is the ruling concerning the person who believes the souls of the Maashykh are haadhir (present) and know everything?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">He is a kaafir, (disbeliever). Bazzaaziyyah mentions. “Whoever said the souls of the Maashaykh (ie Soofee shaikhs) are haadhir and they know (the unseen), then they are disbelievers (Kaafirs).” and Allaah knows best. (refer Abul-Hasanaat Abdul-Hayy Lucknowee’s al-Majmoo’a al-Fataawa 1/85)</span></p>
