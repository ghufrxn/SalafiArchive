				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>By Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Umar Bazmol</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful And May His Peace and Blessings be on His Prophet [peace be upon him],</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After which [I say]:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Al-Albani [May Allah shower him with mercy] the [great] Scholar of Hadith of this time, known as Muhadith Al-Shaam (Syria/Damascus), and if it was said that he is the Muhadith of the Dunia [during his life], we wouldn’t be far of. He [May Allah shower him with mercy] faced, like many other scholars, many false accusations and allegations. These lies and allegations can be summarized in the following nine points:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1 – That he is a Muhadith not a Faqeeh</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2 – That he has no knowledge of the Usool [of Fiqh]</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3 – He has no Shyookh (He did not learn under Scholars)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4 – Takes strange opinions, contrary to what people are on</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5 – He has no respect for scholars, and does not know their status</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6 – He is Zahiri (Dhahiri) in his Mazhab</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span id="more-397"></span>7 – He is lenient in authenticating traditions</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8 – He is self-contradictory when evaluating traditions</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9 – He does not give consideration to evaluating the Matn (Text of the tradition)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These issues are, to the most part, what Ahl Alhdeeth (People and Scholars of Hadith) of all time were accused of, and I saw it beneficial to present these accusations and refute them and give a reply to all of them, defending the People of Hadith of all time. This is the least I can do for them [May Allah have Mercy on them all].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>1 – Their claim: That he is a Muhadith not a Faqeeh</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> If what is meant by this statement is to just describe him as one of Ahl Alhdeeth (the People of Hadith), who have excelled and surpassed others in it, and it did not consist of stripping him of any of the blessing of Fiqh, then we would have no objection in that. That is because Al-Imam Al-Albani [May Allah shower him with Mercy] is truly from the [great] scholars of hadith of our time, who was commended for his deep knowledge in this field, and many have attested to this. That – by the Grace of Allah – is something no two can dispute about as far as I am concerned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If, however, what was meant by this statement is to devalue the Fiqh and understanding of [Shaykh] Al-Albani to Prophetic traditions, and devalue his explanation of its meanings, and his choices and preferences in issues pertaining to knowledge [and Fiqh], then this is a false and rejected meaning, that we can reply to by the following:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask them: What is Fiqh according to you? If what you mean by Fiqh is the memorization of different rulings, Mutoon, and dwelling in possibilities, without returning back to the authentic proofs, then this is what we say that Imam Al-Albani [May Allah have mercy on him] is furthest away from.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, if what you meant by Fiqh is: the [proper] understanding and application of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah in accordance to the understanding of the companions [May Allah be pleased with them and those that followed them] without bias to anyone except to the authentic evidence, then we ask for any proof that shows that the Imam [May Allah have mercy on him] was not like this!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That word: “Muhadith and not a Faqeeh”, with that false meaning is a devilish statement, the purpose behind it is to devalue the status and rank of Ahl Alhdeeth, and [to attempt to establish] that a Faqeeh (Jurist) can do without Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That statement in its beginning is a flaw and an innovation, and at its end is Zandaqah (heresy/disbelief) and complete rejection of all Islamic rulings. As for it being an innovation is because we did not hear any such statements from the Salaf (Righteous Predecessors of the Ummah). As for it ending in disbelief and heresy is because it can lead to the rejection of all the works and teachings of the people of knowledge, thus the rejection and the dissociation from all Islamic rulings, where someone could say: “that ruling was stated by so-and-so and he is a Muhadith (scholar of hadith) and not a Jurist, thus it can’t be accepted”, and another time it would be said: “that ruling was stated by so-and-so, and he is a Jurist not a Scholar of Hadith thus it can’t be accepted”. Leading finally to the dissociation from and the rejection of all the rulings of the Religion!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2 – As for their claim that: he has no knowledge of the Usool [of Fiqh]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> That is an allegation, that we ask where is the proof for it? On the contrary, what can be seen in the books of the Shaykh is a strong proof against this claim. That and what is known from the life of the Shaykh [May Allah have mercy on him] is that he used to give two lectures every week, which students of knowledge as well as University professors used to attend, and among the books that he used to teach in his lectures is the book of: “Usool Al-Fiqh” by ‘Abdulwahab Khalaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That lie – which is denying the knowledge of the Usool of Fiqh – might be used by some of them to defame Ahl Alhdeeth altogether.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To those we say: It is important here to note the following issues:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> 1 – The Prophetic Sunnah [and tradition] is the guide to the proper understanding of the Quran, as was mentioned by Imam Ahmad [May Allah shower him with mercy] in his treatise on the Sunnah, the narration of ‘Abdous. Every ruling in the Quran was guided to by the Sunnah, it clarifies it and indicates what is the purpose behind it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2 – The Science of the Usool is built on the overall guidance [derived from] the Holy Quran, and the Noble Sunnah, in accordance to the Arabic tongue, with the observation of the circumstances present in the time of revelation and the reasons behind the revelation, and that is something that was delivered and observed first hand by the companions, and no one else shared this [knowledge] with them except through them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If this is established, then know that Ahl Alhdeeth (the people of Hadith) are the happiest of people with all of this, since there is no one that is more knowledgeable than them in what has been transmitted from Prophet Muhammad [peace be upon him], and there is no one with more knowledge about what was transmitted from the companions [May Allah be pleased with them] then they are. So in reality they are the People of Usool, and from there manners is to make the Texts of the Quran and the Sunnah a foundation on which they built [everything else], and isn’t this what the Scholars of the Usool aimed for?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From that you should realize that the Scholars of Ahl Alhdeeth are the Scholars of the Islamic Usool and the Scholars of the basis of derivation [of rulings]. They attained this by following and looking after what came and was delivered from the companions and their followers (the Tabi’een).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>3 – As for their claim that: He has no Shyookh (He did not learn under Scholars)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> That is a haste unfound statement, Shaykh Al-Albani [May Allah have mercy on him] learned under his father some sciences (‘Uloom Al-Ala like Sarf), as well as some books of the Hanafi Fiqh (Mukhtasar Al-Qadouri), and he learned from him the Holy Quran, and completed it under him by the recitation of Hafs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also learned under Shaykh Sa’eed Al-Burhani the books “Maraqi Al-Falah” in Hanafi Fiqh, and “Shuzoor Al-Zahab” in Nahw, and some books of Balaghah. He also used to attend the sittings of Al-‘Alamah Muhammad Bahjat Al-‘Ataar [May Allah have mercy on him] with some of the teachers of Al-Magmaa’ Al-‘Ilmi in Damascus, and among those that used to attend these sittings are: ’Izz Al-Din Al-Tanoukhi [May Allah have mercy on him] where they used to read “Al-Hamasah” by Abu Tammam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Albani [May Allah have mercy on him] met during his beginning with Shaykh Muhammad Raghib Al-Tabaakh [May Allah have mercy on him], where Al-Shaykh Al-Tabaakh showed his admiration with Shaykh Al-Albani and gave him “Al-Anwaar Al-Ghaliya fee Mukhtasar Al-Athbaat Al-Hanbaliyah”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So once you know this, you would realize how baseless their saying that: He had no Shyookh, and how far away from reality it is.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> It does not even harm the Shaykh if he did not have a large number of Shyookh. How great a number of Scholars had only a few Shyookh, and that did not affect their knowledge. Rather, even among the narrators of hadith you will see among them narrators that did not narrate except from two or three Shaykhs, [and some] even one, and yet this did not stop the Imams from attesting and declaring their Dabt (ability to preserve the knowledge they gained), Hifz (memorization), and Itqaan (precision), and that did not prevent from listening to them and taking from their knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From this category is, Abu ‘Umar Ahmad ibn Abdullah ibn Muhammad Al-Lakhmi who is known as ibn Al-Baghi (died 400 H) from the people of Ashbilia. He was described as the most unique scholar of his time, and the most knowledgeable scholar of his age, he gathered Fiqh, Hadith, and Virtues. He memorized several books of Sunnah, as well as books of Gharib in a good manner.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4 – As for their claim that he: Takes strange opinions, contrary to what people are on.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> That is a very incoherent claim, rather Ahl Alhdeeth and Al-Albani [May Allah have mercy on him] are among the Ghuraba’, who revive what the people abandoned from the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad [Peace be upon him].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Their saying: “So-and-so is alone in that opinion” does not negate from him Fiqh, and does not attribute him to Shuzooz. Abu Muhammad ibn Hazm [May Allah have mercy on him] said in “Al-Ihkam fee Usool Al-Ahkam” (5/661-662): “The boundary [and meaning] of Shuzooz (oddness) is going astray from the Truth, thus everyone that went against what is right in whatever matter then he is the Shaaz in it, whether they were all the people of this world, or a few of them. The Jama’ah are the people of Haqq (Truth), even if there wasn’t among them from the people of the world except one, then he is the Jama’ah. And Abu Bakr and Khadija [May Allah be pleased with them] entered Islam alone, and were at that point [in time] the Jama’ah, and all the other people of the world, apart from them and the Messenger [Peace be upon him], were people of Shuzooz (Strangeness/Oddness) and Firqah (division)”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus Shuzooz is not when someone from amongst the scholars go against what the other group are on. Similarly, Shuzooz is not to go against what is commonly acted on, or what is popular among the people. How many matters did the great Imams Abu Hanifa, Shafi’i, Malik, and Ahmad take a lone stance on, and that was not counted as something that shames them, and did not take away from their Fiqh, or negate it, or was not a reason to class them [May Allah shower them with mercy] to Shuzooz and loneness (Tafarud)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How can someone be described as Shaaz and strange when he has restricted his following and imitation to the Ma’soum [peace be upon him]. Rather some great scholars have taken some opinions that were later found to be against the Sunnah and Athar, and no one from the people of knowledge said about them, that they are Shaaz or odd.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And here you see Al-Hafiz Ibn Abi Shaybah (died 235 H) writes a chapter in his Musanaf and titles it “A Reply on Abu Hanifa”, and starts his chapter by saying: “This is where Abu Hanifa went against the traditions that came from the Prophet [peace be upon him]”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And here is Al-Layth ibn Sa’d [May Allah have mercy on him] saying: “I have counted for Malik seventy issues, all of which are against the Sunnah of the Prophet [Peace be upon him], where Malik gave his own opinion”, and Al-Layth then says: “… and I wrote to him about them”, and that narration is mentioned in “Jami’ Bayan Al-‘Ilm wa Fadlih” (2/148).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then when were people’s actions an ultimate balance and an absolute criterion in knowing the rulings of Allah, that we can leave the Texts because of it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What sin did Ahl Alhdeeth and Albani [May Allah have mercy on him] commit when they took by a tradition that they saw its authenticity, and did not find anything that goes against it, so they acted upon it, and called the people to act upon reviving this Sunnah that was found in this tradition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Subhan Allah!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather then being thanked for what they have done they are criticized and blamed, and attributed to Shuzooz (taking strange and odd opinions) and that they are being alone in their opinions!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>5 – As for their claim that: He has no respect for scholars, and does not know their status</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> That is a false claim that is lacking any evidence, and the reality is to its contrary. All what is in this matter is that some people got the delusion that since Al-Shaykh Al-Albani [May Allah shower him with mercy], decided to act upon the authentic tradition that has nothing opposing it [or preventing from acting upon it], that he by this wasted and neglected all the scholars who did not act upon this tradition, and did not respect their ranks and status. That is a delusion that has no basis because of the following:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">– There is a difference between: setting your imitation solely to the Ma’soum Prophet Muhammad [Peace be upon him] and wasting the teachings and words of scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Having your imitation set to Prophet Muhammad [Peace be upon him] means not to favor anyone else’s words or actions over his own, whoever that might be. Rather, you look at the authenticity of the tradition first, if it happens to be authentic you then look at the meaning, [understanding, and proper application that came with it].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When that is made clear to you, you should not abandon it, even if those between the East and West opposed you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the precious words of Al-Albani [May Allah have mercy on him] in “Al-Silsilah Al-Sahihah” commenting on tradition number 321:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> “Hold on to it [i.e. the Prophetic tradition], and grip/bite on it with your teeth, and leave the views of men, since once [an authentic] tradition appears, one’s own view and opinion [in the matter] will be void …”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now for your knowledge: There is not – as far as I know – any matter or issue that Al-Imam Al-Albani [May Allah have mercy on him] chose a view that no one from the scholars before him were on (i.e. he has a predecessor in all the views he holds), and he is always careful to mention who was his predecessor, in what he chose to act upon from the words [and views] that he saw that they are in agreement to the Texts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh [May Allah have mercy on him] returns back to what scholars have said, and considers what they said and benefits from it, without intolerance [to others] or blind imitations. He said in the introduction of his book “Sifat Salat Al-Nabi [Salah Allah ‘Alaihi wa Salam]”:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“As for returning back to their (i.e. the scholars) words, benefiting from it, and using it to assist us in properly understand the truth that they differed in, in the cases where there is no Text from the Quran or the Sunnah, or to [go back to their words] to understand what needs explanation, this is a matter that we do not reject. Rather, we order [others] to this, and encourage others to it, since the benefit from it is hoped, for those who took the Quran and the Sunnah as their source of guidance”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is left to comment on, is the issue of the roughness attributed to the Shaykh [May Allah have mercy on him] in his replies to his Mukhalifeen. In reality, this is a relative issue that differs from one to another. Some might call it subjectivity in research, and solely seeking what is the Truth without giving compliments, while others call it harshness and a lack of gentleness. In any case, you should always remember the following:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1 – Some ask from the Shaykh to be lenient when replying on them and refuting them, while they do not abide by what they asked the Shaykh to do when replying on and refuting others [that differed with them].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2 – Harshness when declaring the Truth does not mean that it is falsehood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3 – Gentleness when stating falsehood does not mean that it is the Truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4 – Roughness might be in some cases the wiser way in Da’wah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the Shaykh [May Allah have mercy on him] gave a comment about the Harshness that was attributed to him, so refer back to “Al-Silsilah Al-Da’eefah” 1/27.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>6 – Their claim that: He is Zahiri (Dhahiri) in his Mazhab</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> That accusation too is lacking any evidence. The reality is that describing the People of Hadith (Ahl Alhdeeth) as people of Zahir, is from the words that we hear from time to time, which is why describing Shaykh Al-Albani by it is not that surprising since he is from Ahl Alhdeeth!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And to get rid of the confusion that might be stuck to the minds of a few, we have to raise the following questions:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Did the Shaykh declare in any of his books that he is a follower of the Zahiri Mazhab?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is just the fact that the Shaykh references the books of Ibn Hazm enough to mean that he is a Dhahiri?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That and Shaykh Al-Albani [May Allah have mercy on him] in many instances would blame [and refute] Ibn Hazm Al-Dhahiri [for holding certain opinions]. In “Tamam Al-Minah” for example, p. 160, [Shaykh Al-Albani] said: “Contrary to what Ibn Hazm clattered around …”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in the same book p.162, he said: “And Ibn Hazm took an odd stance as he usually does by clenching to his Dhahiria”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And from the books of Al-Albani [May Allah have mercy on him] is a book where he replies and refutes Ibn Hazm in the matter of musical instruments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That is why Ahl Alhdeeth – and Al-Albani from amongst them – are the furthest away from all the flaws that the scholars have recorded on the Dhahiria.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, as the Shaykh [May Allah have mercy on him] stated in many occasions, among them in his book “Sifat Salat Al-Nabi” that part of his methodology is that he follows the Hadith and the Athaar, and does not abandon them, while having respect for all the scholars and benefiting from their Fiqh and understanding.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>7 – Their claim that: He is lenient in authenticating traditions.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> That too is something relative, which differs depending on people, so whoever was strict would view others as being lenient, and whoever was lenient would view others as being strict. The reference to arriving to the Truth [in this matter] is Istiqraa’ (comprehensive reading and research), and comparing [him] to others. As for the matters that led to attributing the Shaykh [May Allah have mercy on him] to leniency [in authenticating]:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1 – Tahseen (Ranking as Hasan) the weak tradition that came through multiple ways (T’adud Al-Turuq).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2 – Accepting the narrator whose reliability is unknown (Majhoul Al-Hal), and depending on the declaration of reliability of Ibn Hiban.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3 – Accepting some weak narrators.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> All the different types of weak traditions are acceptable for consideration and mending, and can be strengthened if they came through multiple ways, with the exception of those whose chain contains a narrator who is a liar (Kazab) or a fabricator (Wadaa’), the narration of he who is accused of lying (Mutaham Bi Al-Kazib), the narration of a narrator whose in the rank of those who are left (Fee Martabat Al-Tark), like those whose memory worsened a lot, and the Shaaz and Munkar tradition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now as for accepting the narration of a narrator of unknown reliability (Majhoul Al-Hal), and depending on the declarations of reliability given by Ibn Hiban, that is one of the issues that were attributed to Al-Albani [May Allah have mercy on him] without a correct proof on it! Since, in reality the shaykh replied in many places on those who depended on Ibn Hiban’s declaration of reliability, and described them as being too lenient! He also set in the introduction of his book (Tamam Al-Minah) p.20-26 a rule that he called: “Not depending on the Tawtheeq (Declaration of Reliability) of Ibn Hiban”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Finally,] as for him accepting some weak narrators, then that is [only] a claim, since they cannot produce one narrator that there is an agreement that he should be left, and then Al-Albani [May Allah have mercy on him] came and accepted him!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>8 – As for their claim that: He is self-contradictory when evaluating traditions</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> This claim came either from ignorance or from ignoring the reality of the matter. Know – my respected brother [&amp; sister] [May Allah preserve you] – that from the basics according to Ahl Al-Sunnah wa Al-Jama’ah that ‘Ismah (infallibility) is not for anyone of this Ummah apart from the Prophet of Allah [Peace be upon him], and we – By the Grace of Allah – are followers to that basic foundational principle, and do not believe in or even say that Al-Albani [May Allah have mercy on him] is infallible, just as we do not declare it to any other from the People of Knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is the fact that a mistake was done by a scholar, or a contradiction occurred a reason to drop him and a reason to strip him from the description of knowledge?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I do not think that anyone unbiased would say such a thing!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, whoever his mistakes were too much, and what he got wrong was more than what he got correct, we would not use him as a reference, and we would drop from him the attribute/description of Dabt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once this has been established, know that all the traditions that Al-Albani [May Allah have mercy on him] was attributed to contradiction in his ruling over, does not by the Grace of Allah affect his reliability or knowledge, to whoever was unbiased, since the percentage of traditions that Al-Albani was attributed to contradiction because of, when compared to those that he was not attributed to contradiction because of is very small, that are not worth noticing, since it does not affect his ocean of knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now this accusation of contradiction is an envious allegation, and an evil deception for its most part, and does not even pass after proper examination except for very little, rather very very little, it is usually one of the following cases:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1 – Traditions that the Shaykh’s ruling on changed after new circumstances and stipulations appeared, that he was unaware of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2 – Traditions that the Shaykh ruled on by looking at one way (chain), and then he discovered a different way (chain).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3 – Traditions that he ruled on based on what he believed the reliability of the narrator was, and then he renewed his Ijtihad in the status of that narrator, so he changed his ruling.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4 – A Tradition that he was unaware of the ‘Ilah (hidden flaw or defect), which he later became aware of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5 – Traditions that he was unaware of another Mutabi’ or Shahid, and then became aware of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And I wish to reference you, O dear reader, to the book: “Al-Anwar Al-Kashifah Li Tanaqudat Al-Khasaf Al-Zaifah, wa Kashf Ma Feeha min Al-Zaygh wa Al-Tahreef wa Al-Mughazafah”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>9 – As for their claim that: He does not give consideration to evaluating the Matn (Text of the tradition)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> This claim as they say has horns and is a void [claim] that has no basis, and what can be seen in his books [May Allah have mercy on him] contradicts it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Which is why I will just deliver one tradition and point out how the Shaykh [May Allah have mercy on him] evaluated the Text of the tradition, after evaluating the Chain. From that is the second tradition in “Silsilat Al-Ahadeeth Al-Da’eefa” (Whosoever Prayer does not prohibit him from the excessive and the disapproved, has no increase from Allah except of distance), after evaluating the Shaykh the chain of this tradition, he [May Allah have mercy on him] started evaluating the Matn (text), and said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“As for the Text of the tradition, it is not correct either, since its apparent meaning also includes those who prayed a prayer fulfilling its conditions and pillars, in such a way that it is acceptable. So if that worshipper is in anyway still committing some disapproved act, how can it be said that because of it he will not increase because of that prayer except of distance? That is from what does not make sense, and cannot be proven in this religion etc …” to the end of what he said [May Allah shower him with mercy].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And with this, the purpose behind [why we wrote] this has been fulfilled, and All Thanks is due to Allah who by His Grace righteousness is completed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Taken from <strong>Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Umar Bazmool </strong>explaination of Prophet&#8217;s Prayer Described.</em></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Ma’ayar ul-Haq Fi Tanqid Tanwir ul-Haq</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh al-Kul al-Allamah Nazir Hussain Muhadith Dehlawi (1320H)</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Muqallid Excuse Of Not Being Able To Act On The Quran and Hadith</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence it is proven a scholar upon the way of Hadith (non muqallid) whilst making knowledge based deductions should not make Taqlid of a Mujtahid in the texts of an issue, even though the mujtahids statement is in accordance with the Hadith. Yet the people who prohibit us from acting upon ahadith and even though clear manifest truth does not concur with them, one of the lame excuses they put forth in their defence is that acting upon ahadith in current times is extremely difficult.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They say the Quran and Hadith is an ocean of knowledge without any shores and hence understanding and acting on them is the duty of a Mujtahid only (ie not the common people). They say it is not in their permit to understand the Quran and Hadith and even if they were to read and understand the literal translation, they would not know whether a particular Hadith was abrogated or not, what the actual meaning of a text is or if there were any conflicting ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we say we answer this excuse from two angles</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first angle is that the Quran and Hadith is not as difficult, such that no one other than a Mujtahid mutlaq can understand them. On the contrary it is indeed very easy and whoever knows arabic especially and particular the scholars, who will easily and compressively understand the intent and meaning of the Quran and Hadith as is the saying of Allah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And We have certainly made the Quran easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?” (Soorah al-Qamar:17)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His ayaat and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom – although they were before in clear error.” (Soorah al-Jumu’ah:2)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient.” (Soorah al-Baqarah:99)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So whoever says we do not understand the Quran and Hadith despite being a scholar will fall under the punishment mentioned in the aforementioned ayah just as Mawlana Muhammad Ismail Shahid (InshaAllah) has mentioned in the treatise ‘Taqwiyat ul-Iman’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ma’ayar ul-Haq Fi Tanqid Tanwir ul-Haq (pg.70-71)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Is it permissible to venerate the dead on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 40<sup>th</sup> day after the demise of the deceased and what is the ruling on the food that which is prepared for such occasions? [Trans note: known as Khatams]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Venerating the dead by preparing food and transferring the reward to the deceased on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 40<sup>th</sup> day is an innovation. There is no evidence or even trace of this in the first 3 generations, hence this is an innovation and the Muslims should warn against this. Allah said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى ٱلۡبِرِّ وَٱلتَّقۡوَىٰ‌ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى ٱلۡإِثۡمِ وَٱلۡعُدۡوَٲنِ‌ۚ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ‌ۖ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلۡعِقَابِ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">       But help ye one another unto righteousness and pious duty. Help not one another unto sin and transgression, but keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is severe in punishment. [al-Maidah:2]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The food should not be consumed as this is also a type of veneration although the food is in and of itself not haram. An evidence which alludes to venerating the deceased and preparing for them on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 40<sup>th</sup> and other days are innovations and impermissible in the Shari’ah are the following statement of the Prophet ﷺ which are clear evidences that veneration on set days are innovations: “Whoever does an action which we have not sanctioned will be rejected (Mardud)” [<i>Trans Note: Bukhārī [no.2697], Muslim [no.1718], Musnad Aḥmad [6:146].  </i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus based on this hadeeth all of the aforementioned actions are innovations and heresies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ also said “The worst of the affairs are the innovations and heresies” [Trans Note: Muslim [no.867], Musnad Aḥmad [14:126], Abū Dawūd [no.4608], Tirmidhī [no.2676] and Mishkāt [no.16] and <em>Bukhari 7277</em>] with slight differences in the wording.]   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We pray that Allah saves our Muslim brothers and sisters from innovations. Upon us is to convey and Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Source: Fatawa Naziriyyah [1:277 – 278] of al-Muhadith Shaikh Sayyid Muhammad Nazir Hussain Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Agreed upon by the [following Shuyukh]:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sayyid Muhammad Abdus Salam</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ibrahim</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Abdul Aziz</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Jazakallahu Khair to Abu Hashim for his assistance</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The dar ut tahqiq website have published a few articles on the proficiency of Imām Abū Ḥanīfah in Ḥadīth, sure they have the prerogative as they are his ardent, muʿtassub and bigoted blind followers. This is a brief response to it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As the readers knows, we are currently publishing Shaikh Irshad ul-Ḥaqq al-Athari’s book ‘Asbāb Ikhtilāf al-Fuqahā’ which is an answer to Shaikh Muḥammad Awwamahs ‘Athar al-Ḥadīth Sharīf.’ Whilst translating this many years ago, at the time I added some detailed notes to the proceeding narration which is what you will be reading insha’Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, this narration will be uploaded again without the notes in the series of the book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Irshād ul-Ḥaqq al-Atharī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Ḥanīfah’s own statement has been transmitted from him by his student, Imām Abū ʿAbdur Rahmān ʿAbdullāh bin Yazīd Muqrī who said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;I heard Abū Ḥanīfah say the Ahadīth he generally narrates are incorrect.&#8221; [Tārīkh Baghdād [13:402]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, [al-Kāmil [7:2473]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The chain of this statement from the Imām is authentic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Khaṭīb Baghdādī transmitted this statement with the following chain, “I was informed by <strong>Ibn al-Faḍal</strong> who was informed by <strong>Da</strong><strong>ʿ</strong><strong>laj bin Aḥmad</strong> who was informed by <strong>Aḥmad bin </strong><strong>ʿ</strong><strong>Alī al-Ābār</strong> and it was narrated to them by <strong>Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān</strong> and <strong>Ibn Muqrī </strong>narrated to them saying he heard <strong>Abū Ḥanīfah </strong>say&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the narrators are trustworthy and upright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Muqrī is Muḥammad bin ʿAbdullāh bin Yazīd. Hafiẓ Khalīlī said, “Trustworthy with agreement.” [Tahdhīb [9:284], Taqrīb [pg.456]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān is also trustworthy and a preserver, he is also a narrator of Ṣaḥīḥ Bukhārī and Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim [Tahdhīb [10:64], [Sīyar ʿAlām an-Nabulā [12:223]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, [Tadhkirah ul-Ḥuffāz [2:475]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Aḥmad bin ʿAlī al-Ābār is also a trustworthy Imām and a preserver ie Ḥāfiẓ. [Tārīkh Baghdād [4:306], Sīyar [13:443] [Tadhkirah ul-Ḥuffāz [2:639]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dʿalaj bin Aḥmad is a well known trustworthy scholar of Ḥadīth and a jurist. Imām Ḥākim said he was an Imām of the Ahlul Ḥadīth of his time. [Sīyar [16:30]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>, Tārīkh Baghdād [8:387]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>, Tadhkirah ul-Ḥuffāẓ [3:881]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Faḍal is Muḥammad bin al-Ḥussain bin Muḥammad bin al-Faḍal al-Baghdādī al-Qaṭṭān. He is a well known teacher of Imām Baihaqī and Imām Khaṭīb Baghdādī. Imām Dhahabī said that he was trustworthy with agreement. [Siyār [17:331],<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> Tārīkh Baghdād [2:246]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> others. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, the narrators of this chain are all trustworthy; however, Ibn al-Muqrī hearing from Imām Abū Ḥanīfah is debatable. Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy has transmitted the same statement from ʿAbdullāh bin ʿAbdul ʿAzīz via the chain of Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān from al-Muqrī. In fact Imām Tirmidhī has also transmitted it from Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān and said he heard it from al-Muqrī [al-ʿEllal al-Kabīr [2:966].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What this means is that Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān did not narrate from Ibn al-Muqrī but rather from his father whose name is ʿAbdullāh bin Yazīd al-Muqrī. As for ʿAbdullāh bin Yazīd he is the famous Muhaddith, Imām Bukhārī’s teacher as well as a trustworthy Imām. [Tahdhīb [6:83]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>, Sīyar [10:166]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy also transmitted the same statement via Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Saʿīd from Muḥammad bin ʿAbdullāh bin Suleimān from Salamah bin Shabīb from al-Muqrī-and this chain is also Ḥasan. Salamah bin Shabīb al-Nīsābūrī is trustworthy [Tahdhīb [4:146]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> and others. Also note Al-Kāmil mentions Maslamatah which is incorrect and needs to be corrected.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muḥammad bin ʿAbdullāh bin Suleimān is the famous trustworthy scholar of Ḥadīth from Kūfa. [Sīyar [14:41] and others. Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Saʿīd is Ibn ʿUqadah who is a famous Hāfiẓ of Ḥadīth however, some have spoken against him whereas others declared him to be trustworthy. [Sīyar [15:340], Tārīkh Baghdād [5:14], Līsān [1:263]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> and others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However he is not alone in this narration, nonetheless this narration is authentically established from Imām al-Muqrī and Allah knows best.)</span></p>
