				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">The author replies to these doubts with a general answer, and he gives an example of a doubt with the Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;There will certainly be no fear for the close servants of Allah, nor will they grieve.&#8221;<br />
</strong></em>[Surah Yunus, 10:62]
<p style="text-align: justify">and that the Shafa&#8217;ah (Intercession) is true, and that the Prophets have a high rank with Allah.¹ The author then answers every doubt with a specific answer, or two answers, or more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The First Doubt:</strong> That those that affirm Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah, believing that only Allah creates, provides sustenance, and controls affairs, also assert that Muhammad ﷺ, as well as &#8216;Abdul-Qadir [Al-Jilani] and other than him, do not have the capacity to cause harm nor confer benefit, and they only intend intercession from the righteous due to their esteemed status, so they are not Mushrikin (polytheists).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The Messenger of Allah ﷺ fought those [Mushrikin of Quraysh] that affirmed what was mentioned [i.e., Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah], and they intended what you intend [i.e., seeking intercession through their idols].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Second Doubt:</strong> That the Ayat were revealed regarding those that worship idols and the likes thereof, and we do not worship the idols.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer</strong><strong>:</strong> From amongst the disbelievers are those who worship idols, worship saints, invoke &#8216;Isa bin Maryam and his mother (peace be upon them both), and worship the angels. There is no difference between these objects of worship², all such practise constitutes Shirk (polytheism), and everyone that worships them are Mushrikin. Allah has denounced those that worship idols to be disbelievers, and similarly He denounced those that worship the righteous and angels to be disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Third Doubt:</strong> Seeking intercession from them is not polytheism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> This is the exact statement of the disbelievers, when they said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;&#8230;&#8217;We worship them only so they may bring us closer to Allah&#8217;&#8230;&#8221;</strong></em><br />
[Surah Az-Zumar, 39:3]
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">They did not intend anything except seeking intercession from the Rabb Al-&#8216;Alamin, and verily He denounced them as disbelievers due to that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fourth Doubt:</strong> Their denial of worshipping the righteous whilst simultaneously invoking them and slaughtering for them, despite affirming that these are acts of worship, and these acts align with the practises of the earlier Mushrikin. Whether they refuse to recognise that these are acts of worship, or are unaware of the fact, the Ayat and Ahadith elucidate the truth of the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fifth Doubt:</strong> That whoever rejects [the polytheistic manner of] seeking intercession from the Messenger and the righteous effectively rejects the Intercession of the Messenger and is a disparager of the righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The matter is the opposite, for verily intercession belongs to Allah, and does not occur except after His permission, and Allah does not give permission except to the People of Tawhid. Seeking intercession from other than Allah constitutes Shirk, and this is the underlying reason behind its prohibition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Sixth Doubt: </strong>That the Prophet ﷺ is given intercession, thus it is sought from him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> This intercession was given to him in a restricted manner (Muqayyid), not unrestricted (Mutlaq). Furthermore, his intercession is for the sinners, not for the Mushrikin. Additionally, intercession was granted to other than the Messenger, and it does not indicate that he can give it to whoever asks for it, nor to those who seek it from him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Seventh Doubt: </strong>Seeking refuge with the righteous is not considered polytheism, thus he is not a polytheist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer by Challenge: </strong>He is asked, &#8216;what is Ash-Shirk?&#8217; and, &#8216;what is &#8216;Ibadah of Allah?&#8217;, for verily he does not know what At-Tawhid is, nor what Ash-Shirk is, that which he has fallen into.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Eighth Doubt:</strong> His statement: Ash-Shirk is worshipping idols, and we do not worship idols.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>So it is said to him:</strong> Did they [i.e., the idol-worshippers] believe that the [idols] created and provided sustenance? If he replies: &#8216;The one that directs his worship to wood, stone, structures on graves, or other than these, invoking it and slaughtering for it says: It draws us nearer to Allah in rank, and Allah bestows upon us His blessings.&#8217; Then this explanation of idol-worship is correct, and it is exactly what you do, underlining Ash-Shirk is not specific to idol-worship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Ninth Doubt:</strong> Their statement: Verily they make Takfir of the Muslims, and they equate us to the earlier Mushrikin [of Quraysh], whilst we declare &#8216;La ilaha illAllah&#8217;, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and we affirm the Resurrection, and we pray and fast, and we perform Hajj and &#8216;Umrah, whilst they were the opposite &#8211; how can you make those that have these divisive characteristics like those who do not possess anything from them?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>So he responded to them with nine answers:</strong> He clarified that these characteristics have no effect on the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah, nor Ijma&#8217;, rather these characteristics are what makes their Kufr (disbelief) more severe! Whoever commits an act of Kufr, in affirming something from the Messenger [of Allah] whilst disbelieving in something else, or raising the creation to the level of the Creator, or exaggerating regarding one from the righteous until he claims divinity for him, or opposing the Shari&#8217;ah in some matters, such as Istihlal (declaring the permissibility) of the Nikkah of two sisters, or a branch from the branches of apostasy are found from him, or he mocks Allah or his Ayat, then he is an apostate &#8211; and it is not a condition in his apostasy to combine all types of apostasy, or combine all types of Shirk, or giving all the rights of the Rabb of the &#8216;Alamin to his object of worship. Verily apostasy is two types:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 60px">Unrestricted apostasy: To turn away from everything that the Messenger [of Allah] ﷺ came with.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 60px">Secondly: To disbelieve in some parts of what the Messenger [of Allah] came with.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Tenth Doubt: </strong>That whoever says, &#8216;La ilaha illAllah&#8217;, cannot be declared a Kafir nor killed, whatever he does, and they use some Ahadith as evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> These Ahadith are not evidence for what this person is claiming, in that the sole utterance of &#8216;La ilaha illAllah&#8217; is a preventative for Takfir, rather many people say it whilst they are disbelievers, either due to a lack of knowledge regarding its meaning, or a lack of action of what it necessitates, or the existence of that which nullifies it. An example of that is the Jews who used to say it, and the companions of Musaylimah whom the Sahabah [of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ] fought, likewise those that &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) burnt to death, so the statement of it [i.e., the Shahadah] by the tongue does not suffice in protecting ones blood and wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Eleventh Doubt:</strong> Their statement: That Al-Istigatha (seeking relief) by other than Allah is not Shirk, due to Al-Istigatha by the Prophets on the Day of Resurrection being permissible, and verily the author clarified their ignorance in not differentiating between the two different types of Al-Istigatha.<b>³</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Twelfth Doubt: </strong>Their justification that Al-Istigatha by the dead and absent is not Shirk, due to Jibril offering to help Ibrahim (Peace be upon them both).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Answer:</strong> That verily this Al-Istigatha is one type, and that is another type, so whoever equates them has equated two different matters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In clarification that At-Tawhid must exist by the heart, tongue and actions of the limbs, and if one of these are missing, then a man is not a Muslim, and we ask Allah to make these actions sincerely for His Dignified Countenance, verily He is All-Hearing, The Most Near, The One who responds to supplications, and may His Praise be upon Muhammad, his family and his companions.</p>

<p style="text-align: left"><strong>¹ [TN:]</strong> i.e., These are used as doubts to justify seeking the prohibited and polytheistic intercession by way of the righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>²</strong> In that they do not possess any divinity [and are not befitting for worship].</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h4><span style="color: #000080">The Author (Shaykh Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhab, may Allah have mercy on him) said,</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #800000">&#8220;The Fourth Principle: That the Mushriks (Polytheists) of our time are more severe in their Shirk than [those Mushriks] that came before, for verily those that came before would commit Shirk in times of ease, whilst dedicating [their worship] solely to Allah in times of difficulty, whereas the Shirk of the Mushriks of our time is constant, in ease and in difficulty. The proof is the statement of the Most High:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #800000"><strong><em>&#8216;And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allâh, making their Faith pure for Him only: but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others.&#8217; [Al-Ankabut, 29:65]</em>&#8220;</strong></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080">The Explainer (Shaykh Salih Al-&#8216;Usaymi, may Allah grant him success) said,</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">&#8220;<strong>And the objective of this Principle is: </strong>To clarify the severity of the Shirk of the people during the time of the author, and whoever is after them is from the latecomers (Muta&#8217;akhirin), and verily they are more severe in Shirk than the ones that came before (Al-Awwalin).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>And the benefit of establishing its severity is: </strong>Realising that that the state they (i.e., the Mushriks of our time) is more worthy of Takfir (excommunication) and fighting than the Mushriks that came before, and this was declared by the author in another book of his, &#8216;Kashf Ash-Shubuhat&#8217;, and the Mushrikun were mentioned with the disbelief with which they were described previously in the initial statement of the author, <span style="color: #800000">&#8216;Verily the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ fought&#8230;&#8217;¹</span>, so they disbelieved by Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b>And a collection of Shari&#8217;i (legislative) evidences and events which have occurred due to the Divine Decree indicate that the Shirk of the later Mushriks is more severe than the Shirk of the earlier Mushriks in ten aspects:</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The First Aspect: <span style="color: #800000">&#8216;For verily those that came before would commit Shirk in times of ease, whilst dedicating [their worship] solely to Allah in times of difficulty.&#8217; </span></strong><span style="color: #800000"><br />
</span>As for the later Mushriks, then they commit Shirk in times of ease and difficulty alike. The author mentioned this aspect here in &#8216;Qawa&#8217;id Al-Arba&#8217; and additionally in &#8216;Kashf Ash-Shubuhat&#8217;, and he used the aforementioned Ayah as evidence from Surah Al-Ankabut, for travelling in the ocean on &#8216;Al-Fulk&#8217; &#8211; i.e., a ship &#8211; is a time of difficulty, for their hearts would be filled with fear and they would call on Allah alone sincerely. Then, when they would set foot on land and be in a state of ease, due to their safety from the harm which they had feared, they would return to their Shirk, calling upon other than Allah, and a group [of scholars] after the time of the author mentioned this, from them: his grandsons Sulayman bin &#8216;Abdillah and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Hasan, and &#8216;Abdullah Aba Butayn, and Sulayman bin Sahman.<br />
The aforementioned Ayah clarifies the state of the earlier Mushriks between times of difficulty and ease, as for the state of the latecomers, then they are continuous in their Shirk, rather they increase in it when calamities befall them and when their fear intensifies! So the matter has been clarified by those that have witnessed their condition, and the writings of their pens attest to their (i.e., the Mushriks of our era) precedence over the [earlier Mushriks] in Ash-Shirk with the Rabb of Al-&#8216;Alamin. Meaning: That the Ayat are evidence regarding the reality of the condition of the [earlier Mushriks]; For verily they would commit Shirk in times of ease whilst dedicating [their worship] solely to Allah in times of difficulty.<br />
As for the latecomers, then if you wish to know their reality with regards to them committing Shirk in both times of ease and difficulty, then upon you is to witness their condition if you are from the countries which have been afflicted with this [i.e., widespread Shirk], or to read into what has been written regarding them, and you will find their Shirk in every case, whether in ease or in difficulty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Second Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would call upon the Muqarrabun (those brought near to Allah) from the Prophets, Angels and Righteous besides Allah, or they would call upon trees or stones that are not sinful, and these later Mushriks call upon the Fussaq (wicked evildoers) and Fujjar (criminals) besides Allah. The author mentioned this aspect separately in &#8216;Kashf Ash-Shubuhat&#8217; as well, and Muhammad bin Isma&#8217;il As-San&#8217;ani attested to the actualisation of these events during his time in &#8216;Tathir Al-I&#8217;tiqad.&#8217;²<br />
The root cause of their supplications, whilst witnessing their sins, is fear of their evil, for verily they believe they have influence and control [over the creation] such that they can cause harm to them, despite them being in such a repulsive condition.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>The Third Aspect</strong><strong>:</strong> That the earlier Mushriks affirmed that what they were upon was in opposition to the call of the Prophets and Messengers, for verily they said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong> &#8216;Has he made the âlihah (gods) (all) into One Ilâh (God &#8211; Allâh). Verily, this is a curious thing!&#8217; [Surah Sad, 38:5]</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the later Mushriks, then verily they claim that their actions are in accordance to the call of the Prophets and Messengers, and &#8216;Abdul-Latif bin Abdur-Rahman mentioned this by meaning in his refutation on Dawud bin Jarjis, and likewise his student, Sulayman bin Sahman, mentioned it.<br />
So the earlier Mushriks denied the statement, &#8216;La ilaaha illAllah&#8217;, whereas the later Mushriks claimed to be from its people and did not deny its statement, so the earlier Mushrikun rejected it by wording and meaning, whereas the later Mushriks affirm its wording whilst rejecting its meaning. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Hasan brought this benefit in &#8216;Fath Al-Majid&#8217;, and Ibn Qasim in &#8216;Hashiyah Kitab At-Tawhid&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fourth Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would not commit Shirk with Allah in anything from the Dominion, nor in a completely unrestricted ability to dispose of affairs (At-Tasarruf Al-Kulli Al-&#8216;Am), rather they would say in their Talbiyah, <em>&#8216;Labbayk Allahumma Labbayk! (Here I am Allah, Here I am), Labbayk La Sharika Labbayk (Here I am, you have no partner), Except the partner that You have, You control him and that which he controls.&#8217; </em><br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they ascribed complete sovereignty and disposal of affairs of the cosmos to those whom they venerate, and they invoke them due [to their belief] that they have control of the creation and that which occurs in it, and this is Shirk which was not known in the time of Al-Jahiliyyah (Ignorance). &#8216;Abdullah bin Faysal bin Su&#8217;ud mentioned this aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fifth Aspect: </strong>That many of the later Mushriks invoke their objects of worship besides Allah whilst believing they are independent (i.e., not dependent on Allah). As for the earlier Mushriks, then they would invoke their objects of worship in order to seek nearness to Allah, and they believed them to be intercessors and intermediaries, as opposed to many of those Mushriks that came after &#8211; even if they claim otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Sixth Aspect</strong>: That, generally, the Shirk of the earlier Mushriks was restricted [generally] to Al-Uluhiyyah (Worship), and would rarely occur in other than it. As for the later Mushriks, then their Shirk is much, in &#8216;Uluhiyyah, Rububiyyah (Allah&#8217;s actions), and Asma&#8217; w&#8217;as-Sifat (Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes). Rather, Sulayman bin Sahman declared [this] to be one of the differences between the Mushriks of our times who are in a far more evil state than the Mushriks of Al-Jahiliyyah; that the earlier Mushriks affirmed Tawheed of Rububiyyah, for verily their Shirk was only in Al-Uluhiyyah, and this confirms what we mentioned previously.³</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Seventh Aspect:</strong> That the later Mushriks claim that intending [acts of worship], invoking, and devoting [acts of worship] towards the Righteous is from their rights, and to abandon this is to loathe and disregard them, and the earlier Mushriks did not mention this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Eighth Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks used to affirm their Shirk, just as was mentioned previously in their Talbiyyah, and they used to call their Raghbah (Fervent Desire) towards those that they venerated &#8216;Ibadah (Worship)&#8217;.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they claim that they do not commit Shirk with their Rabb, and they call their Raghbah towards those that they venerate &#8216;Mahabbah (Love)&#8217;, and they are liars in this claim of theirs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> <strong>The Ninth Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would only ask their false-deities to fulfil their worldly needs, such as returning a missing person, and they would not take them as preparation for the Day of Judgement (Yawm Al-Din), due to their rejection of the Resurrection, or due to their belief that they will be rewarded with wealth and children after the Resurrection on account of their favour with Allah.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they desired from their objects of veneration fulfilment of their needs in this world, and in the Hereafter. Hamad bin Basir bin Mu&#8217;ammar mentioned this aspect, may Allah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Tenth Aspect:</strong> That the earlier Mushriks would venerate Allah and His symbols, so they would venerate oaths taken by Allah, and they would protect those that sought refuge by Allah and His House (i.e., the Ka&#8217;ba), and they would believe that Al-Bayt Al-Haram is greater than the houses of their idols.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then verily one of them may take an oath by Allah, truthfully or falsely, whilst he would not dare to falsely take an oath by the one he takes as an object of worship and veneration, nor would he protect the one that seeks refuge by Allah and his House, whilst protecting the one who seeks refuge by the one whom they venerate, or by his grave, and they believe that staying at the tombs of the saints is greater than staying in the Masjid. The majority of them believe that Istighatha (seeking aid) by their false-deities, by their graves, is more beneficial and more successful than Istigatha with Allah in the Masjid! And this aspect was derived from the various speech of Sulayman bin &#8216;Abdullah in &#8216;Taysir Al-&#8216;Aziz Al-Hamid&#8217;, and some of it from the speech of Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandson (Taqi&#8217;uddin), and the author [himself], and As-San&#8217;ani, and Hamad bin Nasir bin Mu&#8217;ammar, and &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Aziz Al-Husayyin, and &#8216;Abdul-Latif bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Hasan, from the scholars of the Rectifying Da&#8217;wah, may Allah have mercy on them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>(Sharh Qawa&#8217;id Al-Arba&#8217; of Shaykh Salih Al-&#8216;Usaymi, may Allah preserve him, p.29-33,<br />
</em><em>Transcribed from his lesson on the 29th of Rabi&#8217; Al-Awwal, 1436H, in Masjid An-Nabawi)</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: left"><span style="color: #000080">[TN: The Shaykh, may Allah preserve him, added two more aspects in his lesson the following year:]</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">&#8220;<strong>The Eleventh Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would not seek from their false-deities everything which they sought from Ar-Rahman, for they had requests which they would seek from their false-deities, and requests they would seek from none other than Allah, out of veneration for Allah (Perfect and Exalted He is), so they made the most lofty requests specifically for Allah.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they would seek from their false-deities that which they do not [even] seek from Allah, and made their greatest requests for those that they deify, and would not seek them from Allah, Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandson, mentioned this aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Twelfth Aspect:</strong> That within the later Mushriks are those that claim that Allah manifests in the image of their objects of worship from the creation, so they worship them for verily [they believe] that Allah manifests in them, and not a single one from the earlier Mushriks believed that Allah manifests in an image other than His Self from the creation. Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandson, also mentioned this in meaning. His companion, Ibn Al-Qayyim, relayed this from him in &#8216;Rawdhatul Muhibbin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> The Author, may Allah have mercy on him, said, <strong>&#8220;The First Principle: That you know that verily the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ fought would affirm that Allah, Exalted is He, is the Creator and the One who controls all affairs, and that [this belief] did not enter them into Islam.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Qawa&#8217;id Al-Arba&#8217;)</em></p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:] </strong>Imam Amir As-San&#8217;ani, may Allah have mercy on him, said, <strong>&#8220;Rather, it has reached such a state that they flee to the graves of the oppressors&#8230;&#8221; </strong><em>(Tathir Al-I&#8217;tiqad p.99, Matkabah Al-Wadi&#8217;i edn.)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan expained, <strong>&#8220;When oppression and injustice occurs from the rulers or other than them, they would seek refuge with [the occupants of] these graves to spare them from the injustice and oppression, so this is seeking refuge with other than Allah, to the extent that a poet said:</strong></p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: center"><strong><em>&#8216;O those who fear the Tatar, seek protection by the grave of Abi &#8216;Umar<br />
</em></strong><em><strong>Seek refuge by the grave of Abi &#8216;Umar, he will save you from harm.'&#8221;<br />
</strong></em><em>(Sabil Ar-Rashad fi Sharh Tathir Al-I&#8217;tiqad p.191)</em></p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: left">³ <strong>[TN:]</strong> Allah, Most High, says,</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;Who provides for you from the sky and the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs?&#8221; They will say: &#8220;Allâh.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Will you not then be afraid of Allâh’s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allâh)?&#8221;&#8221;<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 class="entry-title">The Advice of King Abdul-Azeez Aal as-Sa’ood to Jamaa’ah Ahl Al-Hadeeth of India</h1>
<div class="entry-content">
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Reference</strong>: Ahl al-Hadeeth Newspaper, Published in Amritsar, India. Edition 18, December 1931</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">From Abdul-Azeez bin Abdur-Rahmaan al-Faisal Aal as-Sa’ood to all our brothers of Ahl al-Hadeeth – May Allaah (the Most High) preserve them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">May peace be upon you, the mercy of Allaah and His blessings. Thereafter:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Indeed I praise Allaah, besides whom there is no deity truly worthy of worship except Him; I supplicate for peace and blessings upon the best of His Prophets and I ask Allaah (the Most High) – for us and yourselves – guidance to all that He loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You all know – may Allaah preserve you – that to cooperate upon enjoining the truth and being patient is from the characteristics of the believers. You also know that Allaah (may He be glorified) described the believers as being merciful towards each other. Our emphasis therefore, on trying to unite your ranks is in order to raise the status of Tawheed all over the world, and this is the reason compelling us to write to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Indeed it hurts us that we see your Jamaa’ah suffering from any loss of vigour or weakness, just as it pains us when you are harmed by any affliction for whatever reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">After following the news of your affairs, we have realised how the other sects have become united and organised in order to defend their interests, and yet you are not concerned with becoming united in order to preserve the status of your Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I therefore call upon you to unite your ranks, for the sake of Allaah. I also call upon the people of authority amongst you to become one and work together in order to spread Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">[You must be] patient and diligent in this regard; in the path that Allaah will reward greatly, by which much good will be established both in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When other people become united and yet your unity is dispersed, weakness will occur among your ranks and the status of your Jamaa’ah will be lost. We hope that this does not occur between you.I ask Allaah – for you – guidance to all that raises His status and is pleasing to His noble Face.</p>

<p dir="RTL" style="text-align: justify"><strong>المرجع</strong>: صحيفة أهل الحديث الصادرة في أمرتسر بالهند ، العدد 18 ديسمبر 1931 م</p>
<p dir="RTL" style="text-align: justify">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم : من عبد العزيز بن عبد الرحمن الفيصل آل سعود إلى كافة إخواننا أهل الحديث – حفظهم الله تعالى – . السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته ، وبعد :</p>
<p dir="RTL" style="text-align: justify">فإني أحمد إليكم الله الذي لا إله إلا هو ، وأصلي وأسلم على خير أنبيائه ، وأسأله تعالى لنا ولكم التوفيق لما يحبه ويرضاه</p>
<p dir="RTL" style="text-align: justify">تعلمون – حفظكم الله – أن التواصي بالحق والصبر من خصائص المؤمنين ، وتعلمون أن الله – سبحانه – وصف المؤمنين بأنهم رحماء بينهم ، وإن حرصنا على جمع كلمتكم لإعلاء شأن التوحيد في سائر الآفاق هو الذي يدعونا للكتابة إليكم</p>
<p dir="RTL" style="text-align: justify">، وإنه ليؤلمنا أن نرى في جماعتكم أي خور أو ضعف ، كما أنه يؤلمنا أن يصيبكم أي أذى بأي سبب من الأسباب .</p>
<p dir="RTL" style="text-align: justify">وقد رأينا من تتبع أخباركم أن غيركم من الفرق جمعوا كلمتهم ونظموا صفوفهم للذود عن مصالحهم ، وأنتم غير مبالين في جمع كلمتكم لحفظ شأن جماعتكم ، لذا أدعوكم لله لشمل جماعتكم ، وأدعو قادة الرأي منكم للاجتماع والعمل لما فيه نشر التوحيد والمثابرة على العمل في هذا السبيل الذي يعظم الله فيه الأجر ليكون بذلك الحسنى من صلاح الدنيا والدين ، وأن اجتماع كلمة الناس وتفرق كلمتكم فيه الوهن لصفوفكم والحط من مقام جماعتكم ، وهذا ما نرجو أن لا يكون بينكم .</p>
<p dir="RTL" style="text-align: justify">واسأل الله لكم التوفيق في كل ما يعلي شأنه ويرضي وجهه الكريم .</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Three Categories of Tawheed and Shirk &#8211; Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Aziz ibn &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Baaz Rahimahullaah</strong></p>
<p>(This is) a clarification of the categories of Tawheed, and they are three:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah (Lordship)</li>
<li>Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah (Worship)</li>
<li>and Tawheed al-Asma` was-Sifaat (Names and Attributes)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As for Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah:</strong> Then it is to believe that Allah, the Most High, is the Creator of everything, and is the Disposer of Affairs of everything, and He has no partners besides Him in that.</p>
<p><strong>And as for Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah:</strong> Then it is to believe that Allah, the Most High, is the One worshipped in truth, and He has no partners besides Him in that. And this is the meaning of Laa Ilaaha Illa Allaah, and the meaning of this is: <strong>there is no deity worshipped in truth except Allah.</strong></p>
<p>So all the acts of worship from Salaah (prayer), Sawm (fasting), and other than them, then <strong>they must be (done) sincerely for Allah alone and it is not permissible to associate, anything from these acts of worship, with anyone other than Allah.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And as for Tawheed al-Asma` was-Sifaat:</strong> Then it is to believe in everything that has been revealed in the Noble Qur’an and the authentic ahadeeth, from the names of Allah and His attributes. And affirming them for Allah alone, at the level that is befitting the Most High, <strong>without Tahreef (perverting the texts), without Ta`teel (denying their meanings), without Takyeef (seeking after their specific details), and without Tamtheel (likening Allah to His Creation).</strong>Complying with the statement of the Most High:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad): He is Allah, (the) One. Allaah-us-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks). He begets not, nor was He begotten; And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Surah Al-Ikhlas (112):1-4</p>
<p>And His (subhana wa ta’aala) statement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>“There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Surah Ash-Shura (42):11</p>
<p>And some from the people of knowledge (Ahlul ‘Ilm), have divided it in to two types and have entered Tawheed al-Asma` was-Sifaat in to Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah. And this does not fall short in that, since the purpose is clear in both divisions.</p>
<p>And the categories of Shirk are three:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shirk Akbar (major Shirk)</li>
<li>Shirk Asghar (minor Shirk)</li>
<li>and Shirk Khafee (hidden Shirk)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As for Shirk Akbar:</strong> It requires the futility of the deeds (of an individual) and the eternal existence in the Fire for the one who died upon it.</p>
<p>As the Most High said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>“But if they had joined in worship others with Allah, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Surah Al-An’aam (6):88</p>
<p>And the Most High said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>“It is not for the Mushrikoon (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah), to maintain the masaajid of Allah (i.e. to pray and worship Allah therein, to look after their cleanliness and their building, etc.), while they witness against their own selves of disbelief. The works of such are in vain and in Fire shall they abide.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Surah At-Tawbah (9):17</p>
<p>And whoever died upon that, Allah will not forgive him, and Paradise is forbidden for him.</p>
<p>As Allah (subhana wa ta’aala) said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Surah An-Nisa (4):48</p>
<p>And the Most High said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>“Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Dhaalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Surah Al-Ma`idah (5):72</p>
<p><strong>And from the types of Shirk Akbar are:</strong> calling upon the dead and the idols, seeking rescue from them, swearing by them, offering animal sacrifices to them, and similar to that.</p>
<p><strong>And as for Shirk Asghar:</strong> then it is what has been established from the texts of the Book or of the Sunnah, as being designated as Shirk, but it is not from the types of Shirk Akbar. Such as riyaa` (performing a deed only to be seen by others) in (the performance of) some deeds, swearing by other than Allah, saying: What Allah willed (Maa shaa` Allaah), and so and so willed, and similar to that.</p>
<p>Due to the statement of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p><em><strong>“What I fear for you the most is the minor shirk.”</strong></em></p>
<p>So he was asked concerning it, so he said:</p>
<p><em><strong>“‘ar-Riyaa’.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Reported by al-Imaam Ahmad, at-Tabaraani, and al-Bayhaqee from Mahmood ibn Lubayd al-Ansaari (radiallaahu ‘anhu) with an authentic chain. And it was reported by at-Tabaarani with authentic chains from Mahmood ibn Lubayd, from Raafiya` bin Khadeej, from the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p>And his (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saying:</p>
<p><em><strong>“Whoever swears by other than Allah, then he has indeed committed Shirk.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Reported by al-Imaam Ahmad with a saheeh chain from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (radiallaahu ‘anhu) and reported by Abu Dawood and at-Tirmidhee with a saheeh chain from the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (radiallaahu ‘anhu) from the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p>He (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p><em><strong>“Do not say: ‘What Allah willed, and so and so willed’, rather say: ‘What Allah willed, then so and so willed.’”</strong></em></p>
<p>Reported by Abu Dawood with a saheeh chain from Hudhayfah bin al-Yamaan (radiallaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p>And this type (of Shirk) does not dictate apostasy, nor does it necessitate eternal existence in the Fire <strong>but it makes deficient the perfection of Tawheed, which is an obligation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As for the third type: and it is as-Shirk al-Khafee</strong> and the proof of this is the statement of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p><em><strong>“Shall I not inform you of what I fear for you more than the Maseeh ud-Dajjaal (the false messiah)?”</strong></em></p>
<p>They (the companions) said: ‘Of course, O Messenger of Allah!’</p>
<p>He (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p><em><strong>“It is the hidden Shirk (Khafee). A man stands for prayer and beautifies his prayer for those who are watching him.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Reported by al-Imaam Ahmed in his Musnad from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudree (radiallaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p><strong>And it is more befitting that Shirk be divided in to two types: Akbar (major) and Asghar (minor). As for the hidden Shirk, then it is contained in them both.</strong></p>
<p>So it is found in the major (Shirk), like the Shirk of the Munafiqoon (hypocrites). Because they hide their false aqa’id (creeds), and show Islam outwardly with duplicity and fear for their own selves.</p>
<p>And it is in the minor Shirk, such as riyaa`, as is related in the hadeeth of Mahmood ibn Lubayd al-Ansaari that was presented and the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed that was mentioned.</p>
<p>And Allah is the One with Whom is success.</p>

<p>The Imaam, Aboo Ja’far at-Tahaawee (d.321H) – rahimahullah – said in the introduction of his text concerning ‘aqeedah (belief), commonly-known as, at-Tahaawiyyah, “We say concerning the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah, whilst believing in the guidance of Allaah: that Allaah is One without any associate, and there is nothing similar to Him, and nothing can render Him incapable and there is no deity besides Him…”</p>
<p>Refer to al-’Aqeedatut-Tahaawiyyah (p. 5), with notes of ‘Abdul-’Azeez Ibn Baaz.</p>
<p>So his statement, ‘Allaah is One without any associate,’ comprises the three categories of<em>Tawheed</em>. So He (Subhaanahu wa Ta’aala) is One without any associate in His<em>Ruboobiyyah</em>, One without any associate in His <em>Uloohiyyah</em> and One without any associate in His Names and Attributes.</p>
<p>And his statement, ‘and there is nothing similar to Him,’ is from <em>Tawheedul-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat</em>.</p>
<p>And his statement, ‘and nothing can render Him incapable,’ is from <em>Tawheedur-Ruboobiyyah</em>.</p>
<p>And his statement, ‘and there is no deity besides Him,’ is from <em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah</em>.</p>
<p>So these three categories of <em>Tawheed</em> are clear and elucidative in the text of the Imaam (rahimahullah). Indeed, he has mentioned in his aforementioned text that it encompasses, “an explanation of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</em> upon the madhhab of the<em>fuqahaa’</em> (jurists) of the Religion: Abee Haneefah an-Nu’maan Ibn Thaabit al-Koofee (d.150H), Abee Yoosuf Ya’qoob Ibn Ibraaheem al-Ansaaree (d.182H) and Abee ‘Abdullaah Muhammad Ibnul-Hasan ash-Shaybaanee (d.189H) – RadiyAllahu ‘anhum – and what they believed from the foundation of the Religion and what they worshipped the Lord of the worlds with.”</p>
