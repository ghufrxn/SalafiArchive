<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [MUSLIM]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/952, 953 hadith no.1841, book 51, chapter 5, hadith no.14), at-Tamhid (2/279) and al-Istidhkar (no.1777) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Muslim (no.1031) from the hadith of Malik, and al-Bukhari (no.6806) from the hadith of Khubaib Ibn Abdurahman al-Ansari from Hafs Ibn Hashim with the same hadith.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Hafidh Ibn Abdul Bar took the word &#8220;Dhilla&#8221; (shade) and understood it to mean mercy. If the meaning of the word literally means shade then this would mean the shade of Allah&#8217;s Throne as it is mentioned in another hadith that, &#8220;&#8230;seven people will be given shade under Allah&#8217;s Throne&#8230;&#8221; (Mushkil al-Athar of at-Tahawi, new edition 15/69 hadith no.5844, Tuhfatul Akhyar 7/195 hadith no.5117 and it&#8217;s chain is [Sahih] authentic). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Whosoever is lenient with with the loan of someone who owes them (i.e. allows them a longer time to pay back, or reduces and forgives them part of the loan or pays of their debt etc.), &#8220;&#8230;Allah will shade him on the Day of Judgement under His Throne&#8230;&#8221; (Sunan at-Tirmidhi no.1302, and he said, &#8220;Hasan Sahih Garib&#8221; and it&#8217;s chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The wording in a hadith of Mu&#8217;adh Ibn Jabal (Radi Allahu Anhu) are, &#8220;&#8230;Allah will put them under the shade of His Throne&#8230;&#8221; (al-Mustadrak of al-Hakim 4/169 hadith no.7315, and it&#8217;s chain is [Sahih] authentic and al-Hakim authenticated it on the conditions of Bukhari and Muslim and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) This hadith points towards many important matters such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of a just leader</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of a youth who spends their youthful days in the worship of Allah</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who is connected to the Masjid and loves it and gives it preference over and above worldly matters </span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who loves and hates someone for the sake of Allah only and not because of a worldly or personal gain </span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who remembers Allah and cries whilst they are alone</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who fears Allah when a noble and beautiful woman invites him to a sinful act of relationship </span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who gives charity in Allah&#8217;s path secretly </span></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a very brief response to the video of Muḥammad Yāsir Ḥanafī Deobandī Ashʿarī Maturidī Jahmī. His sidekick, Ibn Nūr al-Shantī and some say he is this ‘Usamah Mutakkin,’ who is currently under hormone therapy as is his Shaikh Yāsir, claimed why did we chose another piece to respond to and why not this issue of where Allāh is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So in order to show the readers more examples of their intellectual Jahmite fraud, we decided to compile this short piece. It was compiled in late October and early November 2015 but due to other commitments it is being released now.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We pray this benefits the readers and also shows the avid and sincere reader the true and actual reality of these youtube and intellectual jahmite fraudsters. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These immature individuals spend most of their time causing mischief on the internet under numerous pseudonyms, guising themselves as ‘Salafis.’ This is indeed deception and immaturity from these individuals. Oh Ahl as-Sunnah beware of these people who pretend and take on the garb of Salafiyyah with the intent of causing chaos and corruption and diluting the truth in order to take you away from the worship of Allāh and the correct Islamic Creed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We pray for their guidance and May the Mighty and Majestic, who is above the Seven heavens and rises over his Throne, Guide them, Amīn.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The lies and deception of Shaikh&#8217; Yāsir Ḥanafī Deobandī Ashʿarī Maturudī Jahmī in his video &#8216;Imām Abū Ḥanīfah on Where Is Allāh&#8217;? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ashʿarī Deobandī Jaḥmī ‘shake’ Yāsir Ḥanafī has a short you tube video clip where he discusses a saying of Abū Hanīfah about where Allah is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The saying in question is that which is reported from Muṭʿe al-Balkhī that Abū Ḥanīfah is essence said that the one who does not know if the throne of Allah is in the heavens or the earth is a disbeliever.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The neo neo Ashʿarī has throughout his video clip attempted to deceive the listener by interchanging the words of Allāh being &#8216;above&#8217; with &#8216;sitting&#8217; on his throne. By doing this he has denied the &#8216;highness&#8217; and &#8216;aboveness&#8217; of Allāh upon his throne and instead justified his stance by saying that to say Allāh is High or above necessitates that he is like his creation or is in a direction and in a place thus becoming a body/jism.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In reality all he has tried to do is to persuade the listener that Allāh is not &#8216;above&#8217; his throne as this in his neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī twisted mind would necessitate that we are making Allāh like his creation and confining him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In doing this he has opposed the Salaf and instead resembled his Ashʿarī and Jahmī forefathers and contemporary Deobandīs with there belief of Wahdah tul-Wajūd. Below is a very brief critique of his words and a detailed book on this topic in response to his misguidance is being authored as we write this. Allah&#8217;s aid is sought.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī analyses this saying and by doing so make its apparent that he rejects Allah being above his throne, upon it&#8217;s apparent meaning, as was held by the Salaf. It is this erroneous belief that we critique alongside his &#8216;Sharḥ&#8217; of his Imams saying.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He says at 5:58 onwards in his recording that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;In Al Wasiyyah, Imam Abū Ḥanīfah says Allah is free from place and direction&#8221;. Then If Allah is sitting on the arsh then where was he before creating the Arsh?&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even if it were authentic it is a support against you rather than for you as detailed below from Ṭaḥāwīs words.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is clear that Yāsirs intended meaning by utilising this quote as evidence is to negate Allah being &#8216;high and above&#8217; his throne because this according to him would confine Allah to a &#8216;direction&#8217; of being high and he is saying, as all directions are created, we are therefore saying Allah is surrounded by his creation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to him it would also confine Allāh to a &#8216;place&#8217; and places are also all created. Therefore, we would be making Allah a part of the creation and resembling him to created matter [i,e, the direction and place of above/high] when we say &#8216;ALLAH IS<em> ABOVE </em>THE THRONE&#8217;. This is a futile claim and analogy by the neo neo Ashʿarī.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, no doubt such thinking and philosophy is erroneous according to the ʿAqīdah of the Salaf of this Ummah and also by way of sound aql. In fact, it is in opposition to what his own Imam Ṭaḥāwī has discussed, see below. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note, the saying of Shaykh Abdul-Qādir al-Jīlānī (d. 561H) who said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will abide forever.&#8221; (Ar-Rahman 55:26-27). <em>And He is in the direction of above (al-ʿUluww), ascended over His Throne, </em>possessing the dominion, His knowledge encompassing [all] the things. &#8220;To Him ascends the goodly word and the righteous action raises it (the goodly word).&#8221; [Fāṭir 35:10]. &#8220;He arranges (every) affair from the heavens to the earth, then it (affair) will go up to Him, in one Day, the space whereof is a thousand years of your reckoning.&#8221; [Sajdah 32:5]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Fact, Shaykh al-Jīlānī went onto mention that from amongst the distinguishing signs of the astray <em>Jahmīyyah</em> sect is that they say</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;Allāh does not have an ʿArsh (Throne) and nor a Kursī and [that] He is not above the Throne.&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A note of caution we do not ourselves use terms such as &#8216;direction&#8217; for Allah as this was not used by the Salaf in the first generations and is from generalised wording. Those that have used it in earlier times mostly did so to counter the warped understanding of the mutakalimūn who invented new terms in relation to the Ṣifāt of Allah and this is how it should be understood.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī to ponder on the words of Imām Ṭaḥāwī so maybe then he will understand how Allah being &#8216;above&#8217; his throne is not meaning that he is in a created direction or encompassed by his creation.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Saying of at-Ṭaḥāwī Concerning the use of &#8216;direction&#8217; there occurs in ʿAqīdah al-Ṭaḥāwīyyah, the saying of Imām at-Ṭaḥāwī (rahimahullaah): </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;The six directions do not enclose, contain, encompass, surround Him as [is the case with] all of the created things&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And we have used a number of English equivalents (underlined) for the verb &#8220;hawa, yahwi&#8221; (in the statement, &#8220;tahwihi&#8221;) so that the meaning is clear. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This statement has been used by the Ash&#8217;aris in order to impute their Jahmī belief, that Allāh is &#8220;neither within the creation nor outside of it&#8221; to Imām at- Ṭaḥāwī (Rahimahullāh) &#8211; free is he of them and they of him. And this creed of theirs, they learned it and acquired it from the Philosophers such as Ibn Sina (d. 429H) and the Jahmīyyah and the Muʿtazilah who are the true and real authors of this statement and creed. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for at- Ṭaḥāwī, then he was a Sunni and a follower of the Salaf, and this statement of the Imām &#8211; which is the subject of this article, along with his statements regarding the Arsh (Throne) are a decisive refutation of these Jahmites Walillahil-ḥamd. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we say: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>POINT 1: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>BEWARE OF THE TRANSLATIONS THAT SUPPORT THE DĪN OF THE JAHMITES! </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The above statement of Imām at- Ṭaḥāwī has been translated by some in a manner that allows the Jahmites to justify their falsehood that Allāh is not above all of creation, above His Throne (as is confirmed by at- Ṭaḥāwī elsewhere in his own words &#8211; see further below). So from these translations: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;The six directions do not contain Him &#8211; these are attributed to all created things&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first half is correct, but the second half is incorrect and it is a lie upon Imām at-Ṭaḥāwī to claim that this meaning of the second half, which is provided in English in such a way, is the very same meaning as that intended and contained in at-Ṭaḥāwī original. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather, the meaning of the statement of at-Ṭaḥāwī is accurately represented in English &#8211; if we just paraphrase our translation above a little: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The six directions do not enclose, encompass, contain, surround Him, as they enclose, encompass, contain, surround all of the created things &#8211; meaning that nothing encloses, encompasses, surrounds or contains Him at all. However, the Jahmī-inducing translation is: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;The six directions do not contain Him &#8211; these are attributed to all created things&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And there is a difference between saying: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Something is &#8220;surrounded, enclosed, encompassed&#8221; by the six directions (collectively) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And between saying: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;The six directions are attributed to all created things (which can leave open the meaning that six directions collectively or individually are attributed only to created things)&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The particular translation allows them to negate what Allāh has affirmed in the Book and in the Prophetic Sunnah and upon the tongues of the Companions, the Tābiʿīn and the entirety of the early Salaf, upon Ijmaʿ, that Allāh Himself s above the Heaven, above the Throne &#8211; because this equals the attribution of a direction (from amongst the directions) to them, the Mutakallimūn &#8211; and direction necessitates makān (place) and place necessitates jismīyyah. So beware, and beware again of translations that come from the Jahmites or translations that come from those who are heedless of the snares of the Jahmites! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>POINT 2: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE SAYING OF AT-TAHAAWI IS A REFUTATION OF THE JAHMITES AND DENIERS OF AL-ULUWW SO PAY HEED O YĀSIR AL-JAHMĪ! </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this is made apparently and abundantly clear by the following four points: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[A] THE UNIVERSE IS FINITE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You cannot escape from affirming that this universe is finite, meaning that it must stop somewhere and have an outer limit or boundary, otherwise it is pure atheism to claim the universe is infinite, and anyone saying such a thing has spoken with plain manifest kufr. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[B] THE NOTION OF SIX DIRECTIONS EXISTS ONLY WITHIN THE CREATION: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As the above cannot be denied then the notion of the six directions only applies to what is within the boundaries of the said universe, and the six directions are all relative to each other as it relates to whatever is within the boundaries of the universe. <em>And if anyone claims that the notion of six directions exists outside of the universe as it exists within the universe, then he has claimed that the universe is actually infinite and does not stop at any point, and he has spoken with plain manifest kufr</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this is true upon the basis of the language of the Mutakallimīn themselves, because to them &#8220;direction (jiḥah) necessitate place (makān) and place necessitates something being a body (jismiyyah)&#8221; &#8211; so if the Mutakallimūn claim the notion of six directions exists outside of the universe, they have spoken with an infinite universe.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is because if the notion of six directions exists outside the boundaries of the universe, then those six directions can only be considered directions if they are in turn surrounded by six directions and so on &#8211; and so you have to go to infinity to maintain that claim, and this is pure atheism. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is impossible for you to affirm that the creation is finite and at the same time claim the six directions that exist within it and which are relative to each other, also exist outside of the creation. <em>So either you affirm the creation is finite or you affirm it is infinite.</em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[C] ALLĀH HAS A TRUE AND REAL EXISTENCE OUTSIDE OF THE MIND, OUTSIDE OF THE CREATION: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Following on from the above you cannot escape from affirming that Allāh exists outside of the mind, outside of this universe with a true and real existence and this true and real existence is signified by an essence (Dhaat) that has a ḥaqīqah (a true existing reality that is unknown and unfathomable to us), and that this essence is established by itself (al-qā&#8217;imu bi nafsīhi) and described with attributes (Ṣifāt). If you do not affirm this, you have not affirmed a true and real existence for Allāh, and this again is kufr. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[D] ALLĀH IS ABOVE HIS CREATION BY TEXTUAL EVIDENCE AND UNANIMOUS CONSENSUS OF THE SALAF: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And once we have established the above three points &#8211; the game is already over and the fraud is demolished &#8211; that&#8217;s it. Because this leads us to the fourth point which is that in light of the above, this essence is not contained by the six directions as that is impossible, as has preceded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And by the textual ruling of the Book and the Sunnah, the relationship between the creator and the created is that Allāh is above His creation, and this establishes that there are only two true and real directions in reality, above (fawq) and below (taht) &#8211; as at-Ṭaḥāwī confirms a little later. And the sound intellect agrees with the authentic text, so all of what has been mentioned above reconciles with and agrees with and conforms to what has come in the revealed texts. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Note</strong><strong>:</strong> Direction is not an existing thing in and of itself, it simply defines the relationship between two existing entities, and Allāh in His Book has stated both explicitly and implicitly in over 1000 places in His Book, that He is above His creation &#8211; and what the Kalāmists, Aristotelian Meta physicists, and Philosophers speak of regarding &#8220;direction&#8221; (jiḥah) and &#8220;place&#8221; (makān) and the metaphysical necessities they impose through them, as it relates to what is within the bounds of the universe, cannot and does not apply to Allāh. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, Allāh sent Books and Messengers to guide us how to believe in Him and He did not leave it to the disposal of the language and terminology of the atheist and those who thought they could argue for Allāh&#8217;s existence through it, such as Jahm bin Ṣafwān [ex. 128H] and the Jahmīyyah, Abū al-Hudhayl al-Allāf [d. 235] and the Mu&#8217;tazilah, and Abū Bakr al-Baqillāni [d. 403H] and the Ashʿarīyyah.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we say to the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī that when he says, <em>&#8220;Allāh does not exist in a place&#8221; &#8220;Allāh exists without place&#8221;, </em>&#8220;<em>Allāh is not encompassed by directions&#8221;</em> and so on, all of that is just meaningless sophistry &#8211; it actually has no meaning to it at all. It is empty, fruitless, meaningless speech and it is not even applicable, because we have already established that the notion of six directions does not exist outside of the creation &#8211; upon the language of the Mutakallimīn themselves &#8211; otherwise they must affirm the universe is infinite which is kufr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They can&#8217;t do that. As we have established that it is impossible for Allāh to be encompassed by the six directions as all created things are, when they make these statements &#8220;Allāh is not in a location&#8221; and so on, its talk which has no real meaning.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In reality your words show that your real goal is to deny there is a Lord above the heaven and a deity above the Throne. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So it is clear that you are upon a path which is intended to reject the clear explicit texts in the Book and the Sunnah and the ijmāʿ of the Salaf that &#8220;Allāh is above His Throne&#8221;, but you can&#8217;t do that directly, otherwise all people will come to know of your falsehood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this is why you cannot quote from any of the Salaf prior to 300H who denied that Allāh Himself, is above the Throne, rather you can only quote the latecomers, many of whom, whilst no doubt Scholars in their own right, were affected and influenced by the language of the Mutakallimīn<em>. </em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus each of the above [four] points are undeniable. They cannot be opposed, denied, rejected, refuted. You can&#8217;t run. And you can&#8217;t make excuses O Yāsir Jahmī Ashʿarī Deobandī. Try it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask this neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī to establish the following if he is truthful in his claims: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1]</strong> That the universe is infinite. It can&#8217;t be done. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2]</strong> That six directions do exist outside of the universe as they exist within it. It can&#8217;t be done with your metaphysical language &#8211; otherwise you&#8217;ve spoken with an infinite universe. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[3]</strong> That Allāh has no true and real existence outside of the mind, outside of the universe. It can&#8217;t be done. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[4]</strong> That if Allāh exists outside of the mind and outside of the universe He must be contained by six directions. It can&#8217;t be done unless you can argue in favor of the points that have preceded. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[5]</strong> That the texts of the Book and the Sunnah as well as the innate instinct (fitrah) of people, all combined, do not amount to the saying that &#8220;Allāh is above His creation&#8221;. It can&#8217;t be done either. Even al-Juwaīnī [d. 478H] did not dispute that, rather this is what led him to bewilderment and confusion at the end of his life. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[6]</strong> Or that there are any Scholars from the Salaf from before 300H (or even 400H if we are generous) who held Allāh is not above the Throne, or who held that Allāh is &#8220;neither within the universe nor outside of it&#8221; which was given currency by kāfirs like Ibn Sina [d. 429H]. It can&#8217;t be done. The only people you are going to find are the Jahmīyyah and Muʿtazilah! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> In light of the above, the saying of at-Ṭaḥāwī (rahimahullaah): </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;The six directions do not enclose, contain, encompass, surround Him as [is the case with] all of the created things&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is a decisive, definitive proof for Allāh&#8217;s Uluww, since it establishes He is not contained by the creation (as the notion of six directions only exists within the creation and it is all relative), and this establishes that He is unequivocally outside the creation, separate and distinct from it, outside of the confines of created bodies that are encompassed by the six directions on account of them being from within the creation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>POINT 3: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ALLAHS CREATION IS INCAPABLE OF ENCOMPASSING HIM. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, at-Ṭaḥāwī also said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And He has rendered incapable His creation of encompassing Him </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning it is impossible for His creation to encompass Him in this life or the next. And this means that they cannot encompass Him in knowledge in this life, for they only know of Him what He has revealed to them. And they cannot encompass Him with their vision in the Hereafter (when the Believers will see Him), because they will see Him but cannot encompass Him with their seeing. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in this saying of at-Ṭaḥāwī is also an indication that the six directions cannot encompass Him either, as has preceded earlier on, as the six directions are notions within the universe, and as this is the case, then Allāh is above His Throne, above His creation, free of need of them, and they are in need of Him, and it is impossible for the creation to encompass Him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whether that is in the sense of knowledge or in the sense of what the Mutakallimīn speak of in terms of &#8220;jiḥah (direction)&#8221; and &#8220;makān (place)&#8221;, because all of that is below Him, and He is above all things, as at-Ṭaḥāwī said &#8211; and there are only two true and real directions, as it relates to Allāh and His creation, above and below.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Considering the words of Ṭaḥāwī and the deductions thereof we say to the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī who tried to hide behind Imam Abū Ḥanīfahs words in al-Waṣīyyah that <em>even if authentic they are are an evidence against you rather than for you </em>as to say he is free from place and direction must be understood with the contextual background of Allāh being outside of his creation and the six directions not existing outside the universe, thus not having the capability of encompassing him. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">At 7:38 he quotes a report in Bukhārī that &#8220;Allah was and there was nothing other than him&#8221;. He then says &#8216;so where was Allah when there was no throne?&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say to this ignorant one that, it amazes us how his Ashʿarī Jahmee forefathers and even Deobandīs in modern days [including the like of the sūfīs GF Haddād, Hamza Yūsuf, al-Kawtharī, Ghumārī etc] called it a vile innovation and in some places kufr to ask &#8216;where is Allāh&#8217;? in order to refute the Salafīs and Ḥadīth of the Slave girl. Yet, he asks a question such as this? This is no doubt a hypocritical stance.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We also say that, we as Muslims all believe Allah is al-Awwal, before everything, and that his throne is part of his glorious creation. We do not delve into analogy and reasoning with our weak minds in explaining this. To ask such a question as this neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī has done then this is what eventually led some of the earlier philosophers such as Ibn Sina to apostate as they eventually ended questioning the being and existence of Allah, Na’ūzubillāh.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So in answer to your question we say, the Salaf clearly understood by Allah&#8217;s names al-Awwal, al-Ākhir, adh-Dhāhir, al-Bāṭin that they showed he was before everything and is closest to everything with his knowledge whilst he is above his Throne.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Baihaqī narrates with his isnād from Muqātil bin Hayyān, [that] he said:  It has reached us &#8211; and Allāh knows best &#8211; regarding His, the Most High&#8217;s saying, &#8220;He is al-Awwal and al-Ākhir&#8230;&#8221;, that He is the first, before every thing and He is the Last, after everything, and adh-Dhāhir, above everything, and al-Bāṭin, closest to everything, and his closeness (qurb) is with His knowledge and<em> He is above </em>the Throne. This Muqātil is &#8220;Thiqah (trustworthy)&#8221;, and an Imām, a contemporary of al-Awzā’ī, and he is not &#8220;Ibn Sulaymān&#8221; for that one is a &#8220;mubdati&#8217; (innovator)&#8221; and he is not trustworthy.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī via his speech has alluded that in order for Allah to be &#8216;high/above&#8217; he must have a throne and this leads him to the conclusion that when there was no throne he [Allah] cannot have been high/above. We will not give a hukm about whether this kalām is Kufr, Bidʿah etc we will leave you to decide this for yourself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sufficient it is to say that you have through your speech made Allah&#8217;s attribute of him being high and above dependent upon his creation, that is is his throne being present!! In fact, even after his throne was created you still seek to deny that he was above it.  Aū’zubillāh.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We remind you to read the speech of Allah, The Quran, where Allah says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;And whoever strives only strives for [the benefit of] himself. Indeed, Allah is free from need of the worlds.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><strong>[4]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So know O Jahmī that you should know that Allah&#8217;s attributes are not in need of anything as you suggest.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Instead what you have uttered is just pure ignorance and you use logic to explain away the texts of the book and sunnah. This is the way of the philosophers and true anthropomorphist’s who used there intellect and reasoning’s to eventually lead to the conclusion that Allah is above nothing thus rejecting his being above the throne. The neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī is traversing a path like his forefathers from amongst the Jahmīs and Ashʿarīs some of which eventually ended up describing Allah with &#8216;nothingness&#8217; hence rejecting him.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We also ask you to consider the saying of Ibn Abbās (RaḍhiAllāhu ʿAnhu) wherein he said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Ḥasan bin Uthmān informed us, saying: ʿAlī bin Muḥammad bin az-Zubayr informed us, saying: Ibrāhīm bin Abil-Anbas narrated to us, saying: Yaʿla bin Ubayd narrated to us from Sufyān from Abū Hāshim from Mujāhid, who said: It was said to Ibn ʿAbbās, &#8220;There are some people who speak with [the rejection] of al-Qadr!&#8221;. So he said: &#8220;They reject the Book. If I was to grab the hair of one of them, I would cut it off. Indeed Allāh the Mighty and <em>Majestic was above His Throne before He created anything, then He created the creation</em>. So He wrote whatever would happen until the Day of Judgement and indeed the people proceed upon an affair that has already been concluded.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So you can see how Ibn Abbas did not delve into ridiculous philosophy concerning Allah and rather just continued to affirm that he was above his throne without using his own logic or asking how.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, know that it is from the essence of Tawhīd to believe in Allah being above the throne and not to believe so invalidates a mans belief in Allah.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī reports in al-Sīyar,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʿAmr bin Tamīm al-Makkī said: I heard Muḥammad bin Ismāʿīl al-Tirmidhī [who] said: I heard al-Muzanī saying, &#8220;The Tawhīd of any [person] is not valid, sound until he knows that Allāh the Exalted is over His Throne, with His attributes.&#8221; I said to him, &#8220;Like what?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Hearing, seeing, knowing.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ABŪ ḤANĪFAH </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī then mentions the saying in question of Abū Ḥanīfah about the one who does not know if Allah is in the heavens or earth is a disbeliever and comments that Dhahabī mentions this saying of Abū Ḥanīfah in his al-ʿUluww and al-ʿArsh with it also being mentioned in Fiqh ul-Absaṭ of Abū Ḥanīfah from Abū Muṭʿe al-Balkhī </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">10:45 onwards he says that, &#8216;Balkhī was a murjī, innovator and jahmī from muhadithīn as in meezan ul Ei’tidal of Dhahhabi&#8217;.  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">lets not forget he was also a Ḥanafī of your Madhab.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafī Deobandīs in relation to al-Balkhī pick and choose when they wish to use his narrations when it suits them, seems like a pick and mix ʿAqīdah just as we have advocated in the past, Ashʿarism and Maturidism and Allāh knows best what else. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">13:00 onwards he says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> &#8220;this narration gives impression Abū Ḥanīfah was anthrpomorphist, and also was a mujjasim, he was a person who attributed human qualities to Allāh&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The true aim of this neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī finally comes to light, that is to believe Allah is above is to liken Allah to creation.  Remember, this narration ascribed to Abū Hanīfah by his own follower al-Balkhī [let the Deobandīs sort out whether he is reliable or not as he is one of there own! We cannot be held to blame for mentioning something he himself mentions from his Imam whilst being a follower of his madhab] indicates that Allah is high above his throne and the neo Ashʿarī Deobandī has a big problem with this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In reality by negating Allah being high this neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī is saying Allah is above nothing and this was not the way of the Salaf.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note the following saying: Under the heading of Saʿīd bin ʿĀmir ad-Dabʿī, the Scholar of al-Baṣrah [d. 208H]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdur-Rahmān bin Abī Ḥātim said: My father narrated to me, saying: It was narrated to me about Saʿīd bin Āmir ad-Dabʿī, that he mentioned the Jahmīyyah and said, &#8220;Their speech is more evil than that of the Jews and Christians, for the Jews and the Christians, and the people of (other) religions, have agreed with the Muslims that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, is above the Throne. [But] they said, <em>&#8220;He is not above anything.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><strong>[7]</strong></a></em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">14:00 onwards &#8220;the correct claim from Abū Ḥanīfah is what Shaikh imam Abdus Salaam mentioned in his book Hal ur Ramuz also transmitted by Mulla Ali al-Qārī in his Sharh Fiqh al-Akbar that &#8220;Whoever says I do not know if Allah is in the heavens or earth has done KUFR&#8221;, why because this statement gives an impression that Allah has a place, and whoever believes Allah has a place is a anthropomorphist mushabih and that&#8217;s why he has done Kufr.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The huge irony is that there is very little difference between what the neo Ashʿarī denied being the saying of Abū Ḥanīfah via al-Balkhī and what he now seeks to report and explain away via Mulla ʿAli al-Qārī. This is the way of people of innovation they cannot be clear and precise in there stance or wordings, as we can see here.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once again the neo Ashʿarī Deobandī is trying to say that Allah is above &#8216;nothing&#8217; because if we believe he is &#8216;above&#8217; his throne we are giving the impression that he has a &#8216;place&#8217; and this is kufr. Auzubillāh. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We remind him once again of the sayings of the Salaf as it is clear that this neo neo Ashʿarī is saying that we are confining Allah to a place by saying he is above the throne.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In reality by describing him without his attribute of being high this neo Ashʿarī is describing him by saying that there is nothing above the heavens as who other than Allah can be above the heavens and above his throne?    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I heard Wahb bin Jarīr saying: &#8220;Beware of the opinion of Jahm, for they are trying (to say) that there is nothing above the Heaven, and this is nothing but the inspiration of Iblīs, it is nothing but kufr.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Abul-Qāsim Sulaymān bin Ahmad at-Ṭabarānī brings in ‘Kitāb us-Sunnah,’ as does al-Dhahabī in ‘Mukhtaṣar al-Uluww’ from al-ʿAbbās bin Fudayl al-Asfātī from Sulaymān bin Ḥarb who said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of Ḥammād bin Zayd [b.98H, d.179H] who said: I heard Ayūb as-Sakhtiyānī [d. 131H] when the Muʿtazilah were mentioned, he said: &#8220;The central axis of the Muʿtazilah is that they want to say there is nothing above the heaven.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And al-Dhahabi, in his ‘Mukhtaṣar al-ʿUluww’ commented on this saying, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;This isnaad is like the sun in its clarity and like a pillar in its affirmation from the head and scholar of the people of Basrah (i.e. Hammaad bin Zayd).”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These sayings of the Salaf clearly show that there is something above the heavens and that is only Allah. Yet, the Jahmīs deny this and say there is nothing above the heavens. So we ask if Allah is not &#8216;above&#8217; his throne then who other than him is the Qurān and Sunnah talking of when they say the Almighty rose over the throne? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">15:59 Ahl us-Sunnah Wal Jamaʿah we all believe in the Quranic ayat he <em>rose</em> above his throne [hand gesture of rising which is kufr according to him and from mushabih so he must repent]  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By saying this according to your own standards you have become a mujassimah, anthropomorphist. Your creed is based upon nothing but generality, confusion of speech and logic which is truly illogical as we have shown via the speech of Ṭaḥāwī above.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE CRUX OF ALL HIS SPEECH AND WHY HE NEGATES SAYING OF ABŪ ḤANĪFAH </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">At 16:38 onwards he says,  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;we believe this [istiwaa] but to interpret it that Allah is on his Arsh meaning with his being DHAAT [essence] none of the scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah have said this.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a lie upon Ahl as-Sunnah. Generally, the word &#8216;Dhāt&#8217; was used as a reaction to the philosophy of the Muʿtazilites and Ashʿarīs. Hence, terms such as this and those like &#8216;distinct from his creation&#8217; and so on were used to specify the actual ʿAqīdah of the Salaf. Nonetheless, to say as the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī has claimed we reiterate is just a pure lie upon Ahl as-Sunnah.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Below are a few sayings about the use of the word DHĀT from the salaf. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ibrāhīm Ismāʿīl bin Yaḥya bin Ismāʿīl bin ʿAmr bin Muslim al-Muzanī al-Miṣrī and he is the student of Imām al-Shāfʿī. He was born in 175H and died in 264H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This creed of al-Muzanī is taken from the printed edition of his risālah ‘Sharḥ us-Sunnah’ with Jamāl ʿĀzūn verification.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ibrāhīm Ismāʿīl bin Yaḥya bin Ismāʿīl bin ʿAmr bin Muslim al-Muzanī al-Miṣrī said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;High, over His Throne [in His Majesty, <em>with His Essence],</em> and He is close to His creation with His knowledge. His knowledge has encompassed (all) the affairs, and the preceding decree (maqdūr) has He enforced. [And He is the Generous, the Forgiving], [and] &#8220;He knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal.&#8221; [Ghāfir 40:19] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Fact, Dhahabī mentions at numerous places that the scholars of the past used the word Dhāt. He mentions: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Naṣr as-Sijzī al-Hanafī [d. 444H] said in “al-Ibānah”, “Our Imāms such as Sufyān al-Thawrī, Mālik, Ḥammād bin Salamah, Ḥammād bin Zayd, ʿAbdullāh bin al-Mubārak, al-Fuḍail bin Aʿyyāḍ, Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal, and Ishāq bin Rahawaihah, are upon agreement that Allah –Subhanahu wa Ta`ala is by His Essence (bi-ḍhatihi) above the Throne, and His Knowledge is everywhere.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also al-Ḥārith al-Muhāsibī, said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;As for His saying, &#8220;He ascended over the Throne&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;He is alQahir, above His servants&#8230;&#8221;, and &#8220;Do you feel secure that He who is over the heaven&#8230;&#8221;, and &#8220;&#8230;then they would certainly have sought out a way to the Lord of the Throne&#8230;&#8221; then these and other verses like, &#8220;To him does the goodly word ascend&#8230;&#8221;, and His saying, &#8220;Then it (the affair) will go up (yarʿuju) to Him&#8230;&#8221;, then this <em>is definitive, it necessitates that He is above the Throne, above all things, purified and absolved of entering into His creation, there is nothing from His creation hidden to Him at all. [This is] because He explained in these verses that His essence (dhātahu), with His self (bi nafsihī) is above His servants</em>, because He said, &#8220;Do you feel secure that He, Who is over (fī) the heaven, will not cause the earth to sink with you&#8230;&#8221;, meaning, [He who is] above the Throne, and the Throne is over the heaven, because whoever is above something, over the heaven, then he is [said to be] &#8220;fis-samā&#8221;, [meaning] over the heaven&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī quotes from Ibn Abī Zayd al-Qayrawānī al-Mālikī,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;And that He, the Exalted is above His Glorious Throne, with His essence (bi Dhātihi) and that He is in every place with His knowledge.&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And then comments upon this: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;And the likes of this phrase has preceded from Abū Jaʿfar Ibn Abī Shaybah and Uthmān bin Saʿīd ad-Dārimī, and likewise Yahyā bin ʿAmmār, the preacher of Sijistān, used it in his Risālah, and also the Ḥāfiẓ, Abu Nasr al-Wā&#8217;ilī al-Sijzī in his book al-Ibānah1342, for he said, &#8221; Our Imāms like Sufyān ath-Thawrī (d. 157H), Mālik (d. 179H), Ḥammād bin Salamah (d. 167H), Hammād bin Zayd (d. 179H), Sufyān bin Uyainah (d. 197H), al-Fudayl (bin ʿAyyāḍ (d. 187H), Ibn al-Mubārak (d. 181H), Ahmad (d. 241H), and Ishāq (d. 238H) are agreed that Allāh is above the Throne bi dhātihi (with His essence) and His knowledge is in every place.&#8221; And likewise Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr as will follow, and likewise the phrase of Shaikh al-Islām Abū Ismāʿīl al-Ansārī who said, &#8220;And in many diverse reports [there occurs] that Allāh is above the seventh heaven, above the Throne with His self (bi nafsihī)&#8221;. And likewise al-Hasan al-Kurjī ash-Shāfʿī who said in this poem, &#8220;Their belief is that Allāh is over the Throne with His Essence (bi dhātihī), with His knowledge of [all] the unseen&#8221;. And upon this poem is written, in the handwriting of al-Allāmah Taqī ad-Dīn bin al-Salāh, &#8220;This is the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wal Jamāʿah.&#8221; And likewise this phrase was used by Ahmad bin Thābit at-Turkī, the Ḥāfiẓ. And Shaykh Abdul Qādir al-Jīlānī, and the Muftī ʿAbd al-Azīz al-Qahītī and a group (of scholars)&#8230; And what Ibn Abī Zayd and the others meant (by this) was to distinguish between His being with us and His Being above the Throne. So He , as He said, is with us in knowledge, and that He is over the Throne, as he informed us when He said, &#8220;The Most-Merciful ascended (Istawā&#8217;) over the Throne.&#8221; And a group of the People of Knowledge spoke the aforementioned word (bi-dhatihi), as has preceded, but without doubt, to leave superfluous speech is from the better part of Islām.&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the intent of al-Dhahabī is that as the revealed texts are so apparent, manifest and clear in their meaning, that it is Allāh himself who is above the Throne, above the heavens, and this being immediately understood to anyone who understands the language of the Qurʾān and of the Arabs, without their being any doubt whatsoever in this, then the use of the phrase bi-dhātihī is superfluous and not needed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the Jahmīyyah already know the position of al-Dhahabī in that he affirms that Allāh is above the Throne, above the heavens, for he would not have compiled the book ‘al-ʿUluww’ if he did not hold this as his belief.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Dhahabī also comments upon the statement of Yaḥya bin ʿAmmār [d. 422H] who also used the phrase bi-dhātihī: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;We do not say as the Jahmiyyah say that Allāh is inside places and is merged with everything and that we do not know where He is. Rather, we say: He is, with His essence (bi dhātihī) above the Throne, and His knowledge encompasses everything.&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With the following remark, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;I say: Your saying bi dhātihī is from your kays (subtlety, intelligence), and it has a good interpretation (mahmal hasan), but there is no requirement for it because the one who interprets istawā&#8217; says that He subdued (qahara) with His essence (bi dhātihī) and that He conquered (istatwlā bi dhātihī) without any aider or assistance.&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence, it is clear Dhahabī also did not like to use the words &#8216;bi-ḍhatihi&#8217; he acknowledged this was what many of the Salaf had mentioned. He also clearly mentioned as we have said above. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We truly hope the neo Ashʿarī is paying attention to the word Ḍhāat and the Salafs use of it and can take his claim back. Or will he say that the numerous Ḥanafīs we have quoted amongst those who used this word are not Ahl as-Sunnah? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">18:58 onwards he says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dhahabī said &#8220;to Say Allah is above his throne BI-ḌHATIHI with his being there is no need to say these words [with his being] because this word with his being [ḍhāt] causes &#8220;fitnah, disturbance and trouble within people&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Here he is once again misleading the listener as he quotes from Dhahabīs Sīyar but does not give any kind of reference background about whom and why these words were said by Dhahabī. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We refer the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī to Dhahabī’s ‘Mukhtaṣar al-ʿUluww’ wherein Dhahabī explains in effect why he disapproved of the words &#8216;bi dhatihi&#8217; [with his essence] and this was because it was said by the likes of Imām Ibn Abī Zayd where he intended to refute the innovators who denied Allah being above the throne<em>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><strong>[16]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, Dhahabī said there was no need to say Bi-<u>D</u>hatihi as event they the innovators who make ta’wil of Allah being above the throne accept &#8216;he is above, meaning he conquered, bi-dhatihi with his essence&#8217;. hence, there remained no need to use the same language as them. Dhahabī says,  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;Ibn Abī Zayd and others intended to distinguish between Allāh, the Exalted being with us, and between His, the Exalted, being above the Throne. And so it just as he said, that Allāh is with us in knowledge, and that He is above the Throne where He says, &#8220;The Most Merciful ascended over the Throne&#8221; (20:5).&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the intent of al-Dhahabī is that had Ibn Abī Zayd not used this expression, he would not have been subject to hostility.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another place, al-Dhahabī says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;We have mentioned that there is no need for the phrase bi dhātihī (with His essence) and it disturbs the souls, to leave it is more befitting and Allāh knows best.&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is clear that al-Dhahabī considers it is better to leave off using this word, not because the underlying meaning intended by this phrase is false and rejected [that is Allah is above his throne] as has been imagined by the Jahmīyyah and the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask the neo Ashʿarī has he even read the books of Dhahabī and his ʿAqīdah on Allah being above his throne or is he just content in picking up a line and the showing it completely out of context? This is treachery with the Salaf and the words of Dhahabī also.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">19.20 onwards he comments on Dhahabī words by saying &#8220;and its true if I say Allah is ABOVE Sitting on his throne like this [and he shows himself sitting in his lecture chair] whats the first IMAGE that comes in your mind that nauzubillāh that Allah is SITTING on his throne like this and is sitting on his throne like this [and he touches his chair whilst sitting in his lecture chair to show the sitting].  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">we ask, why must the Ashʿarī Deobandī use his own limited knowledge and intellect in assuming that by describing Allah with being above his throne it must mean we are limiting him and likening him to creation? It is rather he who has the fikr and thought of the anthropomorphic and jumps to incorrect conclusions about Allah using his own intellect. Does the belief that Allah is above the throne lead to Tashbīh or anthropomorphisms? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we have shown throughout this response that the Salaf in the first three hundred years at least did not believe any such notion. In reality, those from the earlier generations of the Ashʿarīs and others opposed the belief of what this neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī is upon.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The views of al-Ash&#8217;ari himself regarding al-ʿUluww and al-Istiwā are also narrated from al-Ashʿarī by the likes of Ibn Fawrak and Ibn Asākir and such quotes are also collected by al-Dhahabī in ‘Mukhtaṣar al-ʿUluww.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE SAYING OF AL-ASH&#8217;ARI IN &#8220;AL-IBAANAH&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī wrote in ‘Mukhtaṣar al-ʿUluww’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;And al-Ashʿarī said in the book of his ‘al-Ibānah Fi Usūl al-Diyānah’ in the chapter of ‘al-Istiwaa’: And if one says: What do you say regarding al-Istiwā? It is said to him: <em>&#8216;We say that Allāh is ascended over His Throne, just as He said, &#8220;ar-Rahman has ascended the Throne&#8221;, and He said, &#8220;The goodly word ascends up to Him&#8221;, and He said, &#8220;Nay, He raised him (Isā) up to Himself&#8221;, and He said, quoting from Fir&#8217;awn, &#8220;And Fir&#8217;awn said: O Haman! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways, The ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the Ilah (God) of Musa but verily, I think him to be a liar.&#8221; So he (Fir&#8217;awn) disbelieved Moses in his saying, &#8220;Indeed Allāh is above the heavens&#8221;. And He, the Mighty and Majestic said, &#8220;Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven, will not cause the earth to sink with you, then behold it shakes (as in an earthquake)? Thus, the Throne is above the heavens, and when the Throne is above the heavens, and everything that is elevated is (called) &#8220;samaa&#8221; &#8211; He did not mean when He said, &#8220;Do you feel secure that He, who is above the heaven&#8221;, all the heavens, but He intended the Throne which is the highest of the heavens. Do you not see that He mentioned the heavens, and then said, &#8220;And He placed the moon therein as a light&#8221;, and He did not intend that it (the moon) fills all of the (heavens), and that it is in all of the heavens.</em>&#8216; He [al-Ashʿarī] said: &#8216;<em>And we see all of the Muslims raising their hands &#8211; when they supplicate &#8211; towards the heaven because Allāh is ascended above the Throne which is above the heavens, and if Allāh had not been upon the Throne, they would not have raised their hands towards the Throne.</em> And [some] say amongst the Muʿtazilah, Jahmīyyah and Harūrīyyah have said: The meaning of Istawā (ascended) is Istawlā (conquered), and owned and subdued, and that He, the Exalted, is in every place, and <em>they rejected that He is above His Throne as the people of truth have </em>said. And they have tended (to the view) regarding al-Istiwā that it means &#8220;al-Qudrah&#8221; (power), and if it had been as they have said, there would have been no difference between the Throne and between the seven heavens, because He is powerful (Qādir) over everything, and the earth is a thing, so Allāh is powerful over it, and also over all the hushūsh (places where people relieve themselves) and so on, and if He was over the Throne with the meaning of &#8220;Istīlā&#8221; (conquering, subduing), then it would be permissible for it to be said: Indeed Allāh is ascended over the hushūsh and akhlīyah (places where people relieve themselves). Hence, that al-Istiwā [over the Throne] should be &#8220;al-Istīlā&#8221; is invalidated.&#8217; And he mentioned evidences from the Book and the Sunnah, and intellect besides that [which is already mentioned] And the book &#8220;al-Ibānah&#8221; is from the most famous of the [works] of authorship of Abu al-Hasan, al-Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Asākir made it well known and he relied upon it, and the Imām, Muḥyi ud-Dīn an-Nawawī made a manuscript of it with his own handwriting.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>HIS OPEN MISINTERPRETATION OF DHAHABĪS WORDS  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">20:15 He [Dhahabī] himself is saying don&#8217;t say he is above his throne with his essence dhāt why becuase saying this gives the impression that Allāh has a body, that Allah is like his makhlūq [creation], a person will fall into fitnah, it creates trouble, it creates disturbance&#8221;.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">See what we have written above about this quote as Dhahabī is not negating Allah being above his throne but discusses the use of the words dhāt and there being no need for it as the opposers themselves affirm it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nor did Dhahabī say that such belief &#8216;gives the impression Allah has a body, Allah is like his makhlūq.&#8217; From where the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī ahs got this he must show us from the words of Dhahabī these words.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the entire Ummah knows Dhahabī stance via his books al- ʿUluww and Kitāb al-ʿArsh where he goes into great detail to confirm that Allah is above his throne. This short treatise shows throughout what Dhahabī and others have recorded from the Salaf.  Some of what Dhahabī has recorded in his ‘Mukhtaṣar al-ʿUluww’ is as follows: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū ʿUmar at-Talamankī [d. 429H] in his book al-Wuṣūl Ilā Maʿrifah al-Usūl, in two volumes: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;The Muslims from Ahl as-Sunnah are unanimously agreed that the meaning of His statement, &#8220;He is with you wherever you may be&#8221; and what is similar to that from the Qur&#8217;an is that it [refers to] His knowledge, and that Allāh, the Most High, is above the heavens with His Essence (bi dhātihi), ascended (mustawin) over His Throne however He wills&#8217;. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Ibn Abī Zayd al-Qayrawānī [d. 389H] said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;And He, the Exalted, is above His Glorious Throne, with His Essence (bi dhātihi) and He is in every place with His knowledge&#8217;. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Ibn ʿAbdul-Barr [d. 463H] after discussing the Ḥadīth of Nuzūl: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;This is an authentic Ḥadīth, none of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth have differed over its authenticity, and it contains an evidence that Allāh, the Exalted, is above the heaven, over the Throne, above the seven heavens, as has been said by the Jamaʿah and it is their proof against the Muʿtazilah, and this is more famous to the general and specific (folk) and more well-known for it to require frequent quotation &#8230;&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also From Ibn Abī Zayd al-Qayrawānī,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;&#8230;And He, the Exalted, is above His Glorious Throne, with His Essence (bi dhaatihi) and He is in every place with His knowledge&#8230;&#8217; <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And from Ibn ʿAbdul-Barr</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;&#8230; and within this (the Ḥadīth of Nuzūl) is evidence that Allāh, the Exalted, is above the heaven, over the Throne, above the seven Heavens, as has been said by the Jamaʿah, and it is their proof against the Muʿtazilah and the Jahmīyyah in their saying that Allāh is in every place and is not above the Throne&#8230;&#8217; <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this is exactly what the Salaf, past and present held, in opposition to the Jahmīyyah, Muʿtazilah, the Theologians and the Jahmite Ashʿarīs of later times, who claim that declaring Allāh to be &#8220;above the Throne&#8221; necessitates confinement and Tajsīm. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, in fact Dhahabī had great concern to establish Allah being above the throne. which raises the questions did he believe that to have the ʿAqīdah Allāh is above his throne will necessitate that he has  a body, or is confined in a direction or space thus causing fitnah? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In reply, In his last remarks in his al-ʿUluww Dhahabī states:  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, this is what the deniers of the ʿUluww (highness) of the Lord, Mighty and Majestic, have depended upon. And they turned away from the requirement of the Book, the Sunnah, the sayings of the Salaf and the innate dispositions of the whole of creation. What they claim to be necessitated (from affirming Allāh&#8217;s highness) is only applicable to created bodies. Yet there is nothing like Allāh and the necessities arising from the clear and evident texts (of the Book and the Sunnah) are also true. However, we do not make use of any expression except one that comes through a narration. In addition to this we say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not accept that the Creator&#8217;s being upon His Throne and above the heavens, necessitates that He is confined (in space) and in a direction, since whatever is below the Throne is said to be confined (in space) and in direction. However, what is above the Throne is not like that. And Allāh is above the Throne as the very first generation are unanimously agreed upon and as the Imāms after them have quoted from them. They said this in refutation of the Jahmiyyah, those who said that He is in every place seeking as a proof His saying, &#8216;And He is with you&#8230;&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So these are the two sayings which were present in the time of the Tābiʿīn and their successors who came after them. And they are the two sayings that can be understood in the statement.  As for the third saying which arose later which is that &#8220;Allāh the Most High is not in any of the places, nor outside of them, nor above His Throne, not attached (merged) with His creation, nor separate from it, nor is His essence (Dhāt) confined in space, nor is He separate and distinct from His creation, nor is He in any of the directions, nor is He exempt from of any of the directions, and nor this and nor that.&#8221; then this is something that cannot be comprehended nor understood, along with the fact that within it is opposition to the verses (of the Book) and the narrations (from the Salaf). Therefore flee with your religion and beware of the opinions of the Mutakallimūn (Theologians).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Believe in Allāh and what has come from Him upon the desired intent of Allāh, then submit your affair to Him and there is no power nor movement except by Allāh. The book is completed and all praise is to Allāh alone.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Subhānallāh. It is as if Dhahabī was answering the deviant claims of the forefathers of this neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī. How he can now hide behind the cloak of Dhahabī is beyond us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, is the way of Ahl al-Bidʿah exposed, they are not able to establish their doctrines through revealed texts upon the understanding of the Righteous Salaf or of the Imāms of the Muslims in the first four centuries after hijrah (before 400H), and have to resort to twisting the sayings of the Scholars, lying upon them and trying to deceive the people at large. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our final words to the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī is to repent to Allah for his incorrect ʿAqīdah and stop corrupting the ʿAqīdah of the Muslims for verily a day will be upon us when we shall all be before our Lord answering for our actions. </span></p>

<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, and what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. And Allāh is the All-Seer of what you do. </strong><strong>[Al-Hadīd:4]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ISTIWĀ’ WITH THE MEANING OF ‘IRTIFĀ’ TO BE HIGH AND ABOVE.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is recorded in the Sahīh of Al-Bukhārī in the book of Tawhīd, chapter of ‘His Throne Was Above The Water<em>’</em> from <em>Abū Ālīyah that, “His saying “He rose above the heavens” meaning ‘Irtifā’ [he rose].” Mujāhid said it means “He rose high/above’ his Throne” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Ḥajr says <em>“Abū ʿĀlīyahs report has been cited by Ibn Jarīr in mawsūl via the route of ʿAbdullāh bin Jʿafar’s from his father from Abū ʿĀlīyah and Mujāhids report has been transmitted by al-Faryābī in his Tafsīr in mawsūl via the route of Warqā from Ibn Abī Najīh from Mujāhid.”</em> [Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī [22/427] and Fath al-Bārī of Ibn Ḥajr [17/176]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Imām Ishāq Ibn Rahawaihah states that he he heard from numerous specialist explainers of the Qurān that the meaning of <strong>“</strong><strong>The Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawā) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)”</strong> <em>“is that ‘Irtifā’ he rose/above.”</em>  [Jalāl ud-Dīn al-Qāsmī, Tafsīr Maḥāsin ut-Tā’wīl [7/2703]</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>TO SAY ‘ISTAWĀ’ [HE ROSE ABOVE] MEANS ‘ISTĪLĀ’ [HE CONQUERED] IS TOTALLY INCORRECT. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ismāʿīl al-Harawī narrates in his book <em>‘al-Fārūq’</em> with a chain of transmission from Dawūd bin Khalf that he was with Muḥammad bin Ziyād al-Lughawī when a man asked him about the ayah <strong>“</strong><strong>The</strong><strong> Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawā) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)</strong><strong> [Ta-ḥa 4].” </strong><em>He replied, “We accept it as he has informed us. The man said it means “he overcame and conquered [Istawlā].” al-Harawī replied, “Istawlā would only be correct if head any competitor or challenger to overcome so this cannot be correct.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad bin Aḥmad bin Naḍr al-Azdī transmits that he heard from Muḥammad bin Ziyād Al-Lughawī who said that <em>“Aḥmad Bin Dawūd enquired of me whether I could investigate whether the word “Istawā’ [he rose] has ever been recorded in the Arabic language as “Istawlā [He conquered]? I replied, “I swear by Allāh that I searched for this and could not find it in any place.”</em> [Fath al-Bārī of Ibn Ḥajr [17/177]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, the Hāfiẓ Ibn Qayyīm has recorded in his monumental work <em>‘As-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah’</em> over 42 replies to rebut the fact that ‘Istiwā’ in this verse does not mean ‘He conquered or overcame’. From amongst these are:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The third response is that al-Khattābī mentions in his book ‘Shiʿār ud-Dīn’ that, “Some have considered that Istiwā here means he overpowered basing this on some lines of poetry and these are not such that they can be used an evidential basis. If it meant as they say that he overpowered/conquered then this would render the verse confusing as Allāh’s knowledge and power is all encompassing then why would he need to ‘conquer’ his Throne whilst this is the case? The word ‘istawlā’ he overpowered would only be used for one who was stopped from something and then through struggle he achieved success by overpowering. So what is it that they say was ‘stopping or restricting’ Allāh? So these are the words of Al-Khattābī who was from amongst those who were known as a linguist.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,<em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The fifth response is that to say as they say falls under the forbidden action of explain the Qurān based on one’s own intellect. No Companion OF Muhammad, a successor of theirs or any scholar of the Muslims [mufassirs] have explained as they have. Let them know that Muhammad the prophet said that ‘let him take a seat in the fire of hell who explains the Qurān with his own opinion.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The tenth response is that the words ‘istawā’ and ‘istīlā’ have not been considered interchangeable in use by the scholars of the Arabic language and this is due to the reason that they both have distinct and separate features and meanings. Those who claim other than this are lying. Research the Qurān, Sunnah and Arabic language and syntax and you will never find that the word ‘istawā’ has come in the meaning of or interchangeable with ‘istīlā”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The fifteenth response is that Imam Abūl Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī has recorded a consensus that to take ‘istawā’ with the meaning of ‘istīlā’ is wholly incorrect.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The twenty seventh response is that the one amongst the creation who knows most about his lord is prophet Muhammad who has described in numerous traditions that Allāh is high and above and these traditions are an evidence of the explanation of such ayat”</em> [Mukhtaṣar as-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah, Muhammad al-Mawṣalī [2/321-326]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some have figuratively attempted to explain (Tāwīl) the fourth ayah and said that ʿAla is the action (Fʿil) and ar-Rahman is the one who does the act (Faʿil) and the Faʿil of Istawa is the ʿArsh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zarkashī refutes this (Tāwīl) and says, <em>“This is refuted from two angles the first is that the mu’awil (the one who did the tāwīl) made the attribute into an action and all of the scripts of the Qurān in Shām, ʿIrāq and Ḥijāz have ʿAla as a harf and if this was Fʿil (ie action) it would have been written with a Lām and ālif like for example at another instance it says, “Walʿalā Baḍuhum ʿala Bʿaḍ. The second reasons is the mu’awil rendered ʿArsh as marfū whereas none of the reciters ie Qura recite it like this.” </em>[Zarkashī, al-Burhān Fī ʿUlūm al-Qurān [2/81]  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the third reason is that it will contradict the other ayahs.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THOSE AYAT WHICH MENTION ALLĀH BEING ‘ISTAWĀ’ ABOVE THE HEAVENS. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything. </strong><strong>[Al-Baqarah:29]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2] </strong><strong>Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: &#8220;Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.&#8221; They both said: &#8220;We come, willingly.” [Fuṣilat:11]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already recorded the narration from <em>Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī</em> from Abu ʿĀlīyah that ‘istawā means he rose high above.’ In fact Ibn Qayyīm quotes an Ijmāʿ consensus that <em>“The meaning here is he rose high above.”</em> [Mukhtaṣar as-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah [2/320]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Baghawī explains the above ayat in his <em>‘Tafsīr Muʿālim ut-Tanzīl’</em> notes on Khāzin’ states, <em>“Many explainers of the Qurān from the Salaf and Ibn ʿAbbās explain this ayat to mean he rose above.”</em> [Tafsīr Muʿālim ut-Tanzīl [1/37]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Jarīr whilst explaining the above ayāt in his Tafsīr states in his Tafsīr <em>‘Jāmʿe ul-Bayān’</em> that, <em>‘The true meaning of the verse <strong>‘</strong></em><strong><em>He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything </em></strong><strong><em>[Al-Baqarah 29]</em></strong><em>’ is that he went high and rose above. Allāh showed his wisdom in creating the heavens and the earths. It is very strange that those who oppose this go against what is understood by the language of the Arabs, that is, he rose and was high. They prefer such meanings as they themselves give thinking that they will escape giving the verse a meaning which is not befitting to Allāh according to their own intellects. In fact, if he were to consider carefully his own explanation then in it he will find that which he was trying to avoid, for example, if he says istawā means he ‘turned towards/observed’ the heavens then we reply, was he ‘not observing/turned away’ from the heavens that you say he had to then ‘turn towards’ them? And if he replies, yes to this then we ask what is it that you base this on? In reality, his explanation causes more conflict and confusion and this is the very thing that he aimed to avoid in the first place. Praise be to Allāh I this way we reply to all those who oppose the truth and deviate from the true understanding of the Qurān. Abū Jʿafar said, that if someone were to ask us whether Allāh’s istiwā towards the heavens was before the heavens were created or after? Then we reply, it was after the heavens were created but Allāh said before he created the seven heavens that ‘</em><strong><em>Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: &#8220;Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.&#8221; They both said: &#8220;We come, willingly.’</em></strong><em> [Fussilāt 11]. </em><em>So the istiwā was after the creation of the smoke but before the formation of them into seven heavens. </em><em> </em><em>In regards to the word in the verse ‘Fasawwahunna’ i.e., [he made them] then this means that he created and originated them. He made them as he willed with perfection and suitability.  In Arabic ‘taswiyah’ means to make something correct and suitable, as it is said in the language ‘so and so made such a thing suitable’. So Allāh created the heavens in a most suitable way as he willed and planned and when they close he opens them as per his will.”</em> [Tafsīr at-Ṭabarī [1/192]</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE MENTION OF THE ‘GREAT THRONE’ OF ALLĀH. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] But if they turn away, say (O Muhammad): &#8220;Allāh is sufficient for me. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), in Him I put my trust and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne. </strong><strong>[At-Tawbah:129] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2] </strong><strong>And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. [Hūd:7]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[3] Had there been therein (in the heavens and the earth) âlihah (gods) besides Allāh, then verily both would have been ruined. Glorified is Allāh, the Lord of the Throne, (High is He) above all that they attribute to Him! [Al-Anbiyā:21]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[4]   </strong> <strong>Say: &#8220;Who is (the) Lord of the seven heavens, and (the) Lord of the Great Throne?&#8221; (86) They will say: &#8220;Allāh.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Will you not then fear Allāh (believe in His Oneness, obey Him, believe in the Resurrection and Recompense for every good or bad deed)?&#8221; </strong><strong>[Al-Muminūn:86-87]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[5] So Exalted is Allāh, the True King, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne! [Al-Muminūn:116]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[6] </strong><strong>Allāh, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne! [An-Naml:26] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[7] (He is Allāh) Owner of High Ranks and Degrees, the Owner of the Throne. [Al-Ghāfir:15] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[8] </strong><strong> Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted is He from all that they ascribe (to Him). [Az-Zukhruf:82]</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[9] </strong><strong>Owner of the Throne, the Glorious. </strong><strong>[AL-Burūj:16] </strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE MEANING OF ARSH [THRONE]. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the meaning itself of Throne is the indication of Allāh being high and above as is found in the verses and narrations. Then it should be known that Allāh being above his Throne shows he is above it and ‘bāin ʿanil Khalq’ separate and distinct from his creation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Bakr al-Ājurī said in his book <em>‘ash-Sharīʿah’</em> that, <em>“It is the madhab of the scholars that Allāh is above his Throne above the heavens. His knowledge encompasses all. He knows that which is in the heavens, earth and that which is beneath it. He knows that which is open and hidden. He knows that which is concealed in the chests and the deceitful eyes. He knows the affairs of the hearts and every beat it takes before it occurs. There is not a particle in the heavens or earth except that he is aware of it. He is above his Throne. He raises the deeds of the people up towards himself and he is aware of their deeds even more so than those angels whose duty it is to record such deeds.” </em>[Imām Abū Bakr al-Ājurī, ash-Sharīʿah [pg.288]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the first ayah above, <em>“It shows he is the originator and owner and this is why he is the owner of the great Throne. His Throne is a ceiling for all of creation including all of the heavens, earth and all that is what is between them. His knowledge is encompassing everything. His decree is upon everything and he is the creator of all.” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [2/404]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Tafsīr <em>‘Madārik ut-Tanzīl’</em> of Nasafī’ considers the ayah <em>“The Lord of the mighty Throne’ that the greatest of the creation was his Throne, which is a place of where duʿā is directed by those in the heavens.”</em> [Tafsīr Nasafī [2/152]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the second ayah above, <em>“Ibn Abbās (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhuma) said that the Throne was given this title as it is something which is high/above. Ismāʿīl bin Abī Khālid said he heard Sʿād Ṭā’ī say that the Throne is red/ruby in colour. Muḥammad bin Ishāq said concerning the verse <strong>‘And</strong></em><strong><em> He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds’, </em></strong><em>that, it is as he has described. There is nothing but water, upon this is the great Throne and above this is Allāh, the owner of all majesty and great, the wisest, the ablest and the one who is most merciful, wise all bountiful. He does as he wills and wishes.”</em> [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [2/437]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Nasafī states concerning the second verse, <em>“Meaning that his Throne was above the water, that is, before the creation of the heavens and the earth there was nothing but water beneath his Throne.”</em> [Tafsīr Nasafī [2/13]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is stated in <em>‘Tafsīr al-Futūhat al-Ilāhīyah lil Jamal’</em> that, <em>“He was where he is now, that is, above the seven heavens and the water was where it is now, that is, below his Throne.” </em>[Tafsīr al-Futūhat al-Ilāhīyah lil Jamal [2/382]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the fourth ayah above, <em>“He is the lord of the mighty Throne which is a ceiling for his creation. It is mentioned in the narration transmitted by Abū Dawūd that the prophet said ‘Your Lords status is the greatest and his Throne is above the heavens’. [after recording a few more narrations] Ḍihāk narrates from Ibn Abbās (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) that ‘it is called ʿArsh [Throne] due to it being lofty/high’. Aʿmash narrates from Kʿab al-Ahbār that the heavens and earth in relation to the Throne are as if a small lamp is lit hanging in between the heaven and the earth. Mujāhid states that ‘the heavens and earth in relation to the Throne are like a small ring which are left in a vast plain.” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [3/253]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the fifth ayah above, <em>“The Throne is a ceiling for the entire creation. It is called ‘ʿArshul Karīm’ [supreme Throne] as it is the most beautiful to look at greatest presence.  As Allāh has said ‘</em><em>And We send down water (rain) from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind to grow therein.’ [Luqmān:9]” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [3/259]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Nasafī states, <em>“It is called supreme Throne as all mercy from Allāh descends from there or that the closest most supreme angels surround it.” </em>[Tafsīr Nasafī [3/130]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Khāzin records that, <em>“Karīm, that is beautiful. Others have said it means high. It is recorded as such by Baghawī in his footnotes on Khāzin.”</em> [Tafsīr al-Khāzin [5/38]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shawkāni states in his <em>‘Tafsīr Fath al-Qadīr’ </em>that, <em>“It is called the supreme Throne because Allāh descends his mercy to his creation from it or it is supreme due to the fact that the one who is above it [the Throne] is the most supreme as it is said by the Arabs ‘the noble house’, meaning that the one who resides in it is noble.” </em>[Fath al-Qadīr [3/485]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the ninth ayah above, <em>“Glorious Throne, that is, he is the owner of the great Throne which is above all of creation.”</em> [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [4/496]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nasafī states, <em>“Glorious, that is, the creator of the Throne is the most glorious and greatest. Glorious here also refers to his Throne as well as himself. Meaning, that the one who is the owner of the Throne is even more Glorious than it.” </em>[Nasafī [4/346]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in Jalālayn it says, <em>“Glorious, that is, the owner and creator of the Throne is the most glorious. Glorious, meaning that the one who is completely deserving of the attribute of being highest and it is like this in ‘Jamal’ and ‘Maḥāsin at-Tā’wīl.”</em>  [Jalalayn [12/422], Jamal [4/515] and Maḥāsin at-Tā’wīl [18/6118]  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The book was first published around 1398H/1977ce and then in 1415H /1994ce during Shaikh Badʿī ud Dīn’s lifetime and in recent times a new edition has also been published. The brothers Abū Ḥibbān and Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī first began translating this book in late 1995ce.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Over the years the translation continued sporadically and most times portion or excerpts would be given to brothers who were confused on this issue in around the city of Birmingham, England, contrary to the common desperate lies of those who claimed issues of fiqh were always discussed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We urge all those who are serious students of knowledge to study this book with great detail as in it are evidences, rebuttals, refutations and principles which the Shaikh has explained in magnificent detail. We promise those who advocate shirk and bidʿah and the so called evidences are fully answered in this book as the Shaikh leaves no stone unturned with the help and will of Allāh</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To our limited knowledge there has never been a book written in the sub continent with such detail and exposure on these topics as the one before you. May Allah accept it from these two poor servants of Allāh whose aid is sought.]</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Praise be to Allāh, we seek His help and His forgiveness. We seek refuge with Allāh from the evil of our own souls and from our bad deeds. Whomsoever Allāh guides will never be led astray, and whomsoever Allāh leaves astray, no one can guide. I bear witness that there is no god but Allāh, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islam (as Muslims) with complete submission to Allāh.’<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person, and from him He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women, and fear Allāh through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship) Surely, Allāh is Ever an All-Watcher over you.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a>’ </em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>“O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allāh and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><strong>[3]</strong></a> <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><strong>[4]</strong></a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>To proceed,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You have asked concerning two questions of fundamental importance to a Muslims creed so beginning in the name of Allāh and we ask him for guidance and we will answer both questions in great detail and clarify both issues with textual and intellectual overwhelming evidences. We supplicate to Allāh that he guides all the Muslims to tread upon the straight path and preserve us from the evilness and effect of Shayṭān. Amīn Oh creator of everything that exists.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>Question</em></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Amongst the Muslims today there are five different beliefs concerning the Tawhīd of Allāh.  [First Type] A group of scholars explains Tawhīd to mean that everything that exists is Allāhs creation and that he is separate from his creation and who is in his self and his Dhāt ie essence rises over his Throne.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Second Type] Mawlāna Rūmī who was a scholar of the Qurān and a mufassir, whose statements of poetry are often uttered by the people for years, says in his Mathnawī that it is Allāh himself in the creation and everything prostrates to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Third Type] Another Sūfī elder and an expert in poetry in the Multānī language, Khāwaja Ghulām Farīd represents another specific group in the following couplets that, He has all the right and might the one who is Ahmad, he also said, there is no difference between Aḥad (one and Aḥmad as they are one in Dhāt and Ṣifāt and he says, Aḥad is he and Aḥmad is he without any difference.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Fourth Type] The fourth type of Tawḥīd was explained a famous elder and luminary Ḥājī Imdādullāh Muhājir Makkī, who is the Pīr and Murshid ie the spiritual guide and leader of the deobandīs. He is considered to have a lofty and high status among the Sūfīs. Likewise, and similarly he is revered and venerated to be a holy elder by the Barelvīs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says in his book, ‘Shamaim Imdādīyyah’,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Man before his existence was a hidden god himself and God appears to be a human being.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><strong>[5]</strong></a>     </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fifth type of understanding of Tawḥīd is that which most of the people of Waḥdatul Wajūd often explain in their speech which was vocalised by Khawāja Ghulām Farīd who is an established representative for them, he said, “Wherever there is an image then every image is in reality his” and his saying, “See every number as one as many are lost he is in every image as their no one other than him.” Etc</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So all of the aforementioned types that have been mentioned can be summarised as follows,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1]   Allāh is above the seven heavens, above his Throne, separate from his creation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2]   Allāh breathed into Adam and became part of him and in him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3]   Allāh came to earth in the form of Muhammad,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4]   Allāh is incarnate in all humans and he is in their form</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5] Allāh is incarnate as part of his entire creation and is thus everywhere.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At one hand it is said that all of the creation is separate and in need of his sustenance as his is the creator and provider. Whereas on the other hand it is said there is no existence except for Allāhs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Would please clarify this issue because up until a Muslim does not have the correct and acceptable pure Tawḥīd based on the Qurān and Ḥadīth his Imān ie faith will not be accepted and nor will any of his actions, so would you clarify.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Creed of the Salaf of this Ummah </strong><strong>Concerning Tawḥīd.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Know may Allāh have mercy on you that the belief we should have about Tawḥīd is as you have said in one above and this was the creed of all of the Salaf of the ummah and they were all unanimously agreed upon it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad Ibn Kathīr al-Maṣiṣi narrates that he heard Imam Awzāʿī say:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;It is my creed and that of the Tabiʿūn that Allāh is above his Throne and we believe in all his attributes as has been stated in the Sunnah&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><strong>[6]</strong></a> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ismāīl Al-Anṣārī mentions in his &#8216;Dham ul-Kalām Wa Ahlihi&#8217; that ʿAbdur Rahmān Ibn Abī Hātim narrated that, I asked my father and Abū Zurʿah about the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah and all the scholars at the time. They replied,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;We have met the scholars from afar and all places. The scholars of the Ḥijāz, ʿIrāq, Egypt, Shām and Yemen all explained that there creed was that Allah was above his throne separate from his creation as he has explained himself without any similitude and his knowledge is all encompassing.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><strong>[7]</strong></a>’ </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū ʿAbdullāh Ibn Baṭṭah states in his book &#8216;Al-Ibānah&#8217; that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;The Sahabah and their successors, the Tabiʿūn along with all the people of knowledge from amongst the Muslims all had the creed that Allāh is above his throne, above the heavens separate from his creation&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><strong>[8]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abū Naṣr As-Sizjī mentions in his book &#8216;Al-Ibānah&#8217; that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;Our Imāms like (Sufyān) ath-Thawrī, Mālik, </em><em>(</em><em>Sufyān bin) Uyainah, Ḥammād bin Zayd, al-Fudayl (bin ʿIyād), Ibn al-Mubārak, Aḥmad, and Ishāq are agreed</em> <em>that Allāh is above the Throne bi Dhātihi (with His essence) and His</em> <em>knowledge is in every place&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><strong>[9]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Imam Abūl Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī has reported a ijmāʿ consensus on this creed as in Al-Ibānah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, Abū Umar Talmankī states in his book &#8216;Al-Wasūl Ila Mʿarifah al-Ūsūl that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;The Ahl us-Sunnah are agreed upon the creed that Allah is above the Throne haqiqatan [in reality] and not majazan [metophorically]&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Abū Nuʿaym, the author of Ḥilyah ul-Āwlīya says in his &#8216;Kitāb ul-Eʿtiqād&#8217; that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;Our creed and that of the Salaf who followed the Quran, Sunnah and Ijmaʿ consensus is that those narrations which mention the rising of Allāh above his throne be accepted, without enquiring how, without making any similitude and to say that he is separate from his creation and they from him. He is not within his creation. He has not made halūl [within] them and nor is he mixed within them. He is above the heavens above his throne and not on the earth [creation]&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><strong>[11]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further states from Hāfiẓ Abū Bakr Ismaʿīl who said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;It is the creed of the Ahl ul-Ḥadīth Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamāʿh is to believe in Allāh, his angels and books and Messengers. To accept that which has come in the book of Allāh and the authentic Sunnah established from the messenger without any distortion. They also believed that Allāh is to be called upon with his beautiful names and he is as he has described himself and as described by his messenger. He created Adam with his hands and his hands are open without asking how and he is above his Throne without delving into how&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><strong>[12]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū ʿAbdullāh al-Ḥākim says in his ‘Mʿarifah Ulūm ul-Ḥadīth’ that Imām Abū Bakr Muḥammad Ibn Ishāq Ibn Khuzaimah said that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“One who does not affirm that Allāh is above the Throne above the seven heavens is a disbeliever before his lord. He must be made to repent and if not so then punished and left to rot at some sewer so that the Muslims and those under there dhimmah do not even smell his stench. He will have no inheritor from amongst the Muslims as they cannot inherit from one upon disbelief&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><strong>[13]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām ʿAbdullāh bin Aḥmad narrates from Imām ʿAbdur Rahman bin Mahdī who said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“From the people of desires none is worse than the people of Jaḥm who say there is nothing in the heavens, I swear by Allāh I see that they should not be married nor inherited from. Ibn Abī Ḥātim said in refutation of the jaḥmīyyah whilst narrating from him that the people of jaḥm intend and mean Allāh did not speak to Mūsa, they intend and mean there is nothing in the heavens and that Allāh is not upon his Arsh (Throne). I hold that they should be asked to repent, if they do it is good but if they abstain, they should be executed”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><strong>[14]</strong></a> </em></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Introduction</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He is the <em>mujtahid</em> and reformer of his age, Ahmad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Halim ibn &#8216;Abdus-Salam ibn &#8216;Abdullah ibn Abu Qasim ibn Taymiyyah al-Harrani Taqi ad-Din Abu&#8217;l-Abbas ibn Shihab ad-Din. He rose the flag of the belief and understanding of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> in his time, at a time when innovation, misguidance, and corruption was widespread, being preached by even some of the People of Knowledge that became well known in later. times.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Due to Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s firm stance against all that was false and corrupt he earned the envy and hatred of all those that he opposed &#8211; who were many &#8211; and as such had many lies heaped around him. The purpose of this section is to show this scholar in his true light and expose those lies heaped around him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Al-Hafidh</em> Al-Bazzar said, depicting the opponents of Ibn Taymiyyah,<span class="salaf">&#8220;You would not see a scholar opposing him (Ibn Taymiyyah), dissuading from him, filled with hatred for him, except that he was the most greedy of them in gathering the worldly goods, the most cunning of them in acquiring them, the most ostentatious of them, the most desirous for reputation.and the most prolific of them in having lies on his tongue.&#8221;</span>[<em>Al-A&#8217;lam al-Uliyyah</em> (p. 82) of Al-Bazzar]</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Praise of the Scholars of Him</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Many of the scholars of his time and after his time praised <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em> for his knowledge, asceticism, piety, and following closely the way of the <em>salaf</em>. Many of these statements of praise were collected in a book written by <em>Al-Hafidh</em> Ibn Nasir ad-Din entitled &#8216;<em>Radd al-Wafir</em>&#8216; refuting the extreme claim of the one that said calling Ibn Taymiyyah, &#8216;<em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em>&#8216;, was unbelief.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Al-Hafidh</em> Adh-Dhahabi said:</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;It was amazing when he mentioned an issue over which there was a difference of opinion, and when he gave evidence and decided the strongest opinion &#8211; and he could perform <em>&#8216;ijtihad</em> due to his fulfilling it&#8217;s conditions. I have not seen one who was quicker than he at recalling a verse which pertained to the issue that he derived from it, nor a man who was more strong in recalling texts and referring them to their sources. The <em>Sunnah</em> was in front of his eyes and upon the tip of his tongue with eloquent phrases and an open eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;He was a sign from the signs of Allah in <em>tafsir</em> and expounding upon it. With regards to the foundation of the religion and knowledge of the differing opinions (on an issue) then he was unequalled &#8211; this alongside his generosity, courage and lack of attention to the joys of the soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;And maybe his legal rulings in the various sciences reached three hundred volumes, rather more and he was always saying the truth for the sake of Allah, not caring for the blame that came to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Whosoever associates with him and knows him well accuses me of deficiency/slackness with regards to him. Whosoever opposes him and differs with him accuses me of exaggeration, and I have been wronged by both parties &#8211; his companions and his opponents.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;He was white skinned with black hair and a black beard with a few grey hairs. His hair reached his earlobes. His eyes were eloquent tongues, and had broad shoulders and a loud, clear voice with a fast recitation. He was quick to anger but overcame it with patience and forbearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;I have not seen his like for supplications (to Allah) and seeking succour with Him, and his abundant concern for others. However I do not believe him to be infallible, rather I differ with him on both fundamental and subsidiary matters for he &#8211; despite his vast learning, extreme courage, fluid mind, and regard for the sanctity of the religion &#8211; was a man from amongst men. He could be overcome with sharpness and anger in discussion, and attack his opponents (verbally) hence planting enmity in their souls towards him.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;If only he were gentle to his opponents then there would have been a word of agreement over him &#8211; for indeed their great scholars bowed to his learning, acknowledged his ability and lack of mistakes, and conceded that he was an ocean having no limits and a treasure having no equivalent. However they harboured ill feeling against him..and every person&#8217;s saying can be taken or left.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;He used to preserve the prayers and fasts, glorifying the laws outwardly and inwardly. He did not give <em>fatwa</em> out of poor understanding for he was extremely intelligent, nor out of lack of knowledge for he was an overflowing ocean. Neither did he play with the religion but derived evidence from the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em>, <em>Sunnah</em> and<em>Qiyas</em> (analogy) and proved and argued following the footsteps of the Imams who preceded him, so he has a reward if he erred and two rewards if he was correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;He fell ill in the castle (in which he was imprisoned) with a serious disease until he died on the night of Monday 20th Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah, and they prayed over him in the mosque of Damascus. And afterwards many talked about the number that attended his funeral prayer, and the least number given was fifty thousand.&#8221;</span> [<em>Ad-Durar al-Kaminah</em> of Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani under the biography of Ibn Taymiyyah]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said:</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The <em>shaykh</em> of our <em>shayukh</em>, <em>Al-Hafidh</em> Abu&#8217;l-Yu&#8217;mari (Ibn Sayyid an-Nas) said in his biography of Ibn Taymiyyah: &#8216;Al-Mizzi encouraged me to express my opinion on <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em> Taqi ad-Din. I found him to be from those who had acquired a fortunate of knowledge in the sciences that he had. He used to completely memorise and implement the <em>Sunan</em> and <em>athar</em> (narrations). Should he speak about <em>tafsir</em> then he would carry its flag, and should he pass a <em>fatwa</em> in <em>fiqh</em> then he knew its limits. Should he speak about a<em>hadith</em> then he was the companion of its knowledge and fully cognisant of its narrations. Should he give a lecture on Religions and Sects then none was seen who was more comprehensive or meticulous than he, he surpassed his contemporaries in every science, and you would not see one like him, and his own eye did not see one like himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;He used to speak on <em>tafsir</em> and a large number of people would attend his gatherings, and an agreeable number would return (having drunk) from his sweet, rich ocean. It continued in this way until the sickness of envy crept (into the hearts) of the people of his city. The people given to fault finding gathered together and picked out anything that could be disapproved of in his beliefs, and they memorised certain of his statements with respect to this. They undermined him due to this and laid traps for him by which they could declare him to be an innovator. They thought that he had left their way, and split off from their sect. So they argued with him, and he with them, and some of them cut relations with him, and he with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Then he argued with another group who was attributed to the<em>Fuqara</em> (a group of the Sufis) who thought that they were on the minute details of the inner reality and upon its truth. And he exposed these Orders &#8230;</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Then this reached the first group and they sought help from those who cut relations with him and harboured malice towards him. So they took the matter to the rulers, each of them having decided that he was a disbeliever. And they prepared a meeting and inspired the ignorant people to spread the word amongst the great scholars. And they took steps to transfer the matter to the King of Egypt and as a result he (Ibn Taymiyyah) was arrested and put in prison. And gatherings were convened to discuss the spilling of his blood, calling for this purpose the people from the small mosques and students &#8211; those people who would argue to make others happy, and those who would argue to show their cleverness, and those who declared <em>takfir</em> and called for disassociation. And your Lord Knows what is in their hearts and what they proclaim. And the one who announced his <em>kufr</em> was no better than the one who argued to make others happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;And the sting of their plots crept up on him, and Allah made futile every plot, and rescued him at the hands of those who He chose.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;Then he continuously moved from one trial to another and in all his life he did not move from trouble except into trouble. Then there followed what followed in the matter of his arrest and he stayed there in prison until he died, and to Allah all matters return. On the day of his funeral the streets were crowded, and the Muslims came from every roadway.&#8217; &#8220;</span> [ibid]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani also said:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;I read in the handwriting of <em>Al-Hafidh</em> Silah ad-Din al-Bala&#8217;i in endorsement of the <em>shaykh</em> of our <em>shayukh</em> <em>Al-Hafidh</em> Baha ad-Din &#8216;Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Khalil: &#8216;Our <em>shaykh</em> and master and<em>Imam</em> in matters that are between Allah and us, the <em>Shaykh</em> of research (<em>tahqiq</em>), traversing, with those that followed him, the best way. Possessor of many excellent qualities and radiant proofs that all the nations have acknowledged are beyond enumeration. May Allah make us benefit from his outstanding knowledge, and make us benefit from him in this life and the hereafter. He is the <em>Shaykh</em>, the <em>Imam</em>, the <em>alim</em> who understands the affairs, the deeply devoted, the ocean (of knowledge), the pole of light, the <em>Imam</em> of Imams, the blessing to the Muslim nation, the sign of the scholars, the inheritor of the Prophets, the last of the Mujtahids, unique amongst the scholars of the Religion &#8211; <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em>, proof of the scholars, the example for the creatures, proof for the learned ones, effacer of the innovators, sword of the disputers, ocean of knowledge, beneficial treasure, the interpreter of the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em>, the amazement of the times, unique in this age and others. Indeed Taqi ad-Din (Ibn Taymiyyah) is the <em>Imam</em> of the Muslims, the proof of Allah against the creation, the joiner of the righteous, the one who is like those who have preceded, the <em>mufti</em> of the sect, helper of the truth, the sign of guidance, the pillar of the <em>Huffadh</em>, Knight of the meanings of words, cornerstone of the <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em>, originator of new sciences Abu&#8217;l-Abbas ibn Taymiyyah.&#8217; &#8220;</span> [Ibid. From this book taken on it &#8216;s own it is very difficult to discern Ibn Hajar&#8217;s own opinion on Ibn Taymiyyah was. For all he did was to gather all the material he could find on the<em>Shaykh</em> and then start off the account with all those scholars who wrote against him, and end with all those scholars who supported him. It would seem likely that Ibn Hajar&#8217;s own stance would be in line with those whom he finished off his biography with, due to their being his <em>shayukh</em>. This reasoning is supported with the next quote from Ibn Hajar. <em>Allah knows best</em>]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajar said:</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8221; &#8230; those of his stances that were rejected from him were not said by him due to mere whims and desires and neither did he obstinately and deliberately persist in them after the evidence was established against him. Here are his works overflowing with refutations of those who held to <em>tajsim</em> yet despite this he is a man who makes mistakes and is also correct. So that which he is correct in &#8211; and that is the majority &#8211; is to benefited from and Allah&#8217;s Mercy should be sought for him due to it, and that which he is incorrect in should not be blindly followed. Indeed he is excused for his mistakes because he is one of the Imams of his time and it has been witnessed that he fulfilled the conditions of <em>ijtihad</em>.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;From the astonishing qualities of this man was that he was the strongest amongst men against the People of Innovation, the<em>Rawafidah</em>, and the <em>Hululiyyah</em>, and the <em>Ittihadiyyah</em>, and his works on this are many and famous, and his <em>fatawa</em> on them cannot be counted, so how the eyes of these innovators must have found joy when they heard those who declared him to be a <em>kafir</em>! And how delighted they must have been when they saw those who did not declare him to be a <em>kafir</em> in turn being labelled <em>kafir</em>! It is obligatory upon the one who has donned the robe of knowledge and possesses intelligence that he consider the words of a man based upon his well-known books or from the tongues of those who are trusted to accurately convey his words &#8211; then to isolate from all of this what is rejected and warn from them with the intention of giving sincere advice and to praise him for his excellent qualities and for what he was correct in as is the way of the scholars.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;If there were no virtues of <em>Shaykh</em> Taqi ad-Din except for his famous student <em>Shaykh</em> Shams ad-Din ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, writer of many works, from which both his opponents and supporters benefited from then this would be a sufficient indication of his (Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s) great position. And how could it be otherwise when the <em>Shafi&#8217;i</em> Imams and others, not to speak of the <em>Hanabila</em>, of his time testified to his prominence in the (Islamic) sciences.&#8221;</span> [From Ibn Hajar&#8217;s endorsement of &#8216;<em>Radd al-Wafir</em>&#8216; contained at the end of the book]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Kathir said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;The least he would do when he heard something was to memorise it and then busy himself with learning it. He was intelligent and had much committed to memory, and he became an <em>Imam</em> in <em>tafsir</em>and everything linked to it and knowledgeable in <em>fiqh</em>. Indeed it was said he was more knowledgeable of the <em>fiqh</em> of the <em>madhahib</em> then the followers of those very same <em>madhahib</em> in his time and other than his time. He was a scholar in <em>Usul</em> and the branches of the religion and grammar and the language and other textual and intellectual sciences. No scholar of a science would speak to him except that he thought that that science was the speciality of Ibn Taymiyyah. As for <em>hadith</em> then he was the carrier of its flag, a <em>hafidh</em> and able to distinguish the weak from the strong, fully acquainted with the narrators.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Al-Bidayah wa&#8217;n-Nihayah</em>&#8216; (14/118-119) of Ibn Kathir]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He also said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;He was, may Allah have mercy upon him, from the greatest of scholars, also from those who err and are correct. However his errors with respect to his correct rulings were like a drop in a huge ocean and they are forgiven him as is authentically reported by Bukhari</span> <span class="hadith">&#8216;when a ruler makes a ruling, and he is correct then he has two rewards, and if he has erred then he has one reward.&#8217;</span> <span class="salaf">&#8220;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He also mentioned that when the scholars of his time gathered for a sitting with Ibn Taymiyyah to discuss his work <em>&#8216;Aqidah al-Hamawiyyah </em>that his replies to their accusations could not be rebutted. [&#8216;<em>Al-Bidayah wa&#8217;n-Nihayah</em>&#8216; (14/5)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly he mentioned that when the scholars sat to argue with him with regards to his <em>&#8216;Aqidah al-Wasitiyyah</em> the argument ended with them accepting all that was contained in the book as in vol. 14 of &#8216;<em>Al-Bidayah</em>&#8216; under the heading &#8216;<em>Aqd al-Majalis ath-Thalatha</em>&#8216;.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Al-Hafidh</em> Al-Mizzi said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;I have not seen the likes of him, and his own eye had not seen the likes of himself. And I have not seen one who was more knowledgeable than him of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger, nor one who followed them more closely.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Hayat Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</em>&#8216; (p. 21) of <em>Shaykh</em> Bahjatul Baytar]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Al-Hafidh</em> Ibn Daqiq al-&#8216;Eid said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;When I met bn Taymiyyah I saw a man with all the sciences in front of his eyes, he took from them what he wished and he left what he wished.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Min Mashahir al-Mujaddidayn</em>&#8216; (p. 26) of <em>Shaykh</em> Salih al-Fawzan] This after he had said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;By Allah I did not think that there remained the likes of you.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Al-Bidayah wa&#8217;n-Nihayah</em>&#8216; (14/27) of Ibn Kathir and &#8216;<em>Dhayl &#8216;ala Tabaqat al-Hanabila</em>&#8216; (2/392) of Ibn Rajab]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The <em>Qadhi</em> of Qadhis Ibn al-Huriri said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;If Ibn Taymiyyah was not Shaykh al-Islam than who is?&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Hayat Shaykh ul-Islam</em>&#8216; (p. 26)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Al-Hafidh</em> Al-Bazzar said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;I have not seen him mention any of the pleasures and attractions of this world, he did not delve into worldly conversations and he never asked for any of its livelihood. Instead he directed his attentions and conversations to seeking the Hereafter and what could get him closer to Allah.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Al-A&#8217;lam al-Uliyyah</em>&#8216; (p. 52) of Al-Bazzar]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Al-Shaykh Mulla</em> &#8216;Ali al-Qari said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;It will become clear to the one who studies &#8216;<em>Madarij as-Salikin</em>&#8216; (of Ibn al-Qayyim) that these two (Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim) are from the greatest of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wa&#8217;l-Jama&#8217;ah</em>, and from the <em>Awliya</em> of this nation.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Mirqat al-Mafatih</em>&#8216; (8/251-252) his commentary to &#8216;<em>Mishkat al-Masabih</em>&#8216;, as quoted from in &#8216;<em>Shubuhat Ahlul-Fitna</em>&#8216; (pg. 442) of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman Dimisqiyyah]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Barr as-Subki said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;By Allah no one hates Ibn Taymiyyah except for an ignoramus or the possessor of desires which have diverted him from the truth after he has come to know it.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Radd al-Wafir</em>&#8216; (p. 95) of Ibn Nasir ad-Din]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Al-Hafidh</em> &#8216;Abdur-Rahman ibn Rajab al-Hanbali said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;He is the <em>Imam</em>, the legal Jurist, the <em>Mujtahid</em>, the Scholar of <em>Hadith</em>, the <em>Hafidh</em>, the Explainer of the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em>, the Ascetic, Taqi ad-Din Abu&#8217;l-Abbas <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em>, the most knowledgeable of the knowledgeable, it is not possible to exaggerate his renown when he is mentioned &#8230; he, <em>may Allah have mercy upon him</em>, was unique in his time with respect to understanding the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> and knowledge of the realities of faith.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Adh-Dhayl &#8216;ala Tabaqat al-Hanabila</em>&#8216; (2/387-392) of Ibn Rajab]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The <em>Imam</em> of the Hanafis, Badr ad-Din (Mahmud ibn Ahmad) al-&#8216;Ayni said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;Whosoever says Ibn Taymiyyah is a <em>kafir</em> then he is in reality himself a <em>kafir</em>, and the one who accuses him of heresy is himself a heretic. How is this possible when his works are widely available and there is no hint of deviation or dissension contained therein.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Radd al-Wafir</em>&#8216; (p. 245)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As-Suyuti quotes from Az-Zamlakani that he said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;Our Master, our<em>Shaykh</em>, the <em>Imam</em>, the Scholar, the Unique (<em>al-Awhad</em>), the <em>Hafidh</em>, the<em>Mujtahid</em>, the Ascetic, the Worshipper (<em>abid</em>), the Example, the <em>Imam</em> of the Imams, the example for the Nation, the sign of the scholars, the inheritor of the Prophets, the Last of the Mujtahids, unique (<em>Awhad</em>) scholar of the Religion, the Blessing for Islam, the Proof of the Scholars (<em>A&#8217;lam</em>), the proof of the <em>Mutakallimin</em>, the effacer of the innovators, endowed with exalted and amazing sciences, the Reviver of the <em>Sunnah</em>.

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Then As-Suyuti follows this up by saying, <span class="salaf">&#8220;I have quoted this biography from the handwriting of the <em>Allamah</em>, the unique individual of his time,<em>Shaykh</em> Kamal ad-Din az-Zamlakani, <em>may Allah have mercy on him</em>, who used to say, &#8216;one who had more memorised than him has not been seen in the last five hundred years.&#8217; &#8220;</span> [&#8216;<em>Al-Ashbah wa&#8217;n-Nadha&#8217;ir an-Nahwiyyah</em>&#8216; (3/681), see also &#8216;<em>Dhayl ala Tabaqat al-Hanabila</em>&#8216; (2/392-393)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As-Suyuti said in the course of discussing his biography, <span class="salaf">&#8220;<em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em>, the <em>Hafidh</em>, the <em>Faqih</em>, the <em>Mujtahid</em>, the distinguished <em>Mufassir</em>, the rarity of his time, Scholar of the Ascetics.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Tabaqat al-Huffadh</em>&#8216; (p. 516 no. 1144), and &#8216;<em>Al-Asbah wa&#8217;n-Nadha&#8217;ir</em>&#8216; (3/683) of As-Suyuti]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We could mention many more scholars who praised him but <em>insha&#8217;Allah</em>what we have quoted above is sufficient to paint a more just and true picture of this <em>Imam</em>. As for those scholars that applied the title &#8216;<em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em>&#8216; to him then they are numerous and would require a separate volume to list them [As has been done by some scholars, from amongst them Ibn Nasir ad-Din in the aforementioned book &#8216;<em>Ar-Radd al-Wafir</em>&#8216;].</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Accusations Against Him</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From what has preceded it is clear that <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em> had many enemies, and many jealous rivalries who plotted against him together to try to make out that he was an innovator. So we advise anyone who wishes to criticise the <em>Shaykh</em> that he must make sure that his criticisms are based firmly upon the written works of Ibn Taymiyyah, not merely upon the words of other than him, as done by his opponents.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What follows is an investigation of the points of belief that Ibn Taymiyyah was accused of having deviances in. We have left out the various legal positions he had for which he was attacked for due to their relative unimportance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>On the works of Taqi ad-Din Subki and his son Taj ad-Din Subki</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Much of what is written against Ibn Taymiyyah are based upon the works of these two scholars. &#8216;<em>Rasa&#8217;il as-Subkiyyah</em>&#8216; of <em>Shaykh</em> Taqi ad-Din and the various biographical works of Taj ad-Din for example &#8216;<em>Tabaqat ash-Shafi&#8217;iyyah</em>&#8216;.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As for the works of Taqi ad-Din then Adh-Dhahabi wrote to him, censuring him for what he had written, and his erroneous claims, to which As-Subki replied saying, <span class="salaf">&#8220;As for what you say with regard to <em>Ash-Shaykh</em> Taqi ad-Din, then I am convinced of the great scope, the ocean-like fullness and vastness of his knowledge of the transmitted and intellectual sciences, his extreme intelligence, his <em>ijtihad</em> and his attainments in that which surpass description. And I have always held to this opinion. Personally, his status in my eyes is greater and more esteemed, for the asceticism, piety, religiosity, his helping the truth and standing firm on it for the sake of Allah alone, his adherence to the path of the <em>salaf</em> and his abundant taking from it, and his strangeness in this time, nay any time.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Ad-Durar al-Kamina</em>&#8216; of Ibn Hajar under the biography of Ibn Taymiyyah (1/159) and &#8216;<em>Dhayl Tabaqat al-Hanabilah</em>&#8216; (2/392) of Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As for his son, Taj ad-Din, then unfortunately, he went to extremes in criticising Ibn Taymiyyah, due to his highly partisan and sectarian attitude. Such that As-Sakhawi endorsed the following words about him, following his statement, &#8220;Did any of the Hanbalis raise their heads (i.e. become prominent)&#8221;:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;This is from the strangest of things, and the most sectarian/partisan of attitudes, and this is why the <em>Qadhi</em> of our time, and <em>Shaykh</em> of the <em>madhhab</em> Al-Izz al-Kanani wrote under this statement, &#8216;and likewise Allah did not raise the heads of the<em>Mu&#8217;attila</em>&#8216; and then he said about Taj ad-Din Subki, &#8216;he is a man having little manners, lack of scholarly integrity, ignorant of Ahlus-Sunnah and their ranks.&#8217; &#8220;</span> [&#8216;<em>Al-I&#8217;lan bi&#8217;t-Tawbikh liman Dhamma at-Tarikh</em>&#8216; (94-95) of As-Sakhawi]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A glimpse of his attacks can be seen in &#8216;<em>Albani Unveiled</em>&#8216; (pp. 114-116) and in what follows the truth of the above criticism will become clear, and a more severe and devastating reality will become apparent, and that is the amount of lies that are heaped around the pillars of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> in all ages by individuals that claim to be supporting the truth.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #000080;">On the book &#8216;Nasihah adh-Dhahabiyyah&#8217;</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A book ascribed to Adh-Dhahabi in which he launches a severe attack on Ibn Taymiyyah, but in reality was not written by him, but falsely ascribed to him, this due to many reasons:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">No one who is familiar with the works of Adh-Dhahabi mentioned this as one of his works.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Adh-Dhahabi remained the student of Ibn Taymiyyah until the latters death.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">All of the sayings of Adh-Dhahabi in the books that are affirmed to be from him, to do with Ibn Taymiyyah, revolve around praise and respect of him. (A glimpse of these has preceded).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">This letter is written in the handwriting of Ibn Qadhi ash-Shuhba, an enemy of Ibn Taymiyyah.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">We have not seen one who ascribes this book to Adh-Dhahabi after Qadhi ash-Shuhba except for his contemporary, <em>Al-Hafidh</em> As-Sakhawi, <em>may Allah have mercy on him</em>, who merely followed him. [From the book, &#8216;<em>At-Tawdih al-Jali fi ar-Radd ala Nasiha Adh-Dhahabiyyah al-Manhula ala&#8217;l-Imam Adh-Dhahabi</em>&#8216; (pp. 85-86) by<em>Shaykh</em> Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ash-Shaybani, with summary]</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Accusation that Ibn Taymiyyah held Allah to be a body, of composite parts having organs</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Amongst those contemporary, and recent writers who accused <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em> of this are: Al-Habashi al-Hurari, As-Saqqaf and his mentor Zahid al-Kawthari. In fact all the attacks that are about to be raised will find their origins with one, or all of the three personalities mentioned above, from the writers of recent and contemporary times.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As-Saqqaf says, after previously quoting An-Nawawi&#8217;s ruling of unbelief on the one who ascribes to Allah a <em>jism</em> (body):</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;Entering into this category is Al-Harrani (i.e. Ibn Taymiyyah),who has affirmed <em>tajsim</em> (Allah having a body) in many of his books. So from this is his saying in &#8216;<em>At-Ta&#8217;sis</em>&#8216; (1/101): &#8216;and there is not in the Book of Allah, nor in the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger, nor a statement from any of the <em>Salaf</em> of this <em>Ummah</em> and it&#8217;s Imams that He is not a<em>jism</em>, and that His Attributes are not bodily, consisting of organs.&#8217; I say: By Allah who originated the heavens and the Earth &#8211; your saying is ignorance and misguidance. Is not Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High&#8217;s</em>&#8211; saying, </span><span class="quran">&#8216;there is nothing like Him&#8217;</span> <span class="salaf">sufficient in negating <em>tajsim</em>and it&#8217;s reality, O Al-Harrani?!! And what about the Imams of the<em>Ummah</em> and the <em>Salaf</em> &#8211; O Al-Harrani &#8211; and their censure of <em>tashbih</em>.&#8221;</span>[&#8216;<em>Daf Shubah at-Tashbih</em>&#8216; (pp. 245-246) with it&#8217; s footnotes by Saqqaf]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Shaykh</em> Mashur Salman said in reply to this, <span class="salaf">&#8220;These words are from one who does not know what fairness is, who acts haphazardly in his rulings, and who falsely accuses the scholars of wickedness. This becomes apparent in a number of ways:</span></span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;From them: that the previously stated words are not from the writings of Ibn Taymiyyah in which he is clarifying his own views, or even stating them. Rather he is quoting the saying of the People of<em>Kalam</em> (innovated speech and rhetorics). However As-Saqqaf has conveniently omitted the beginning of the quotation from <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em> Ibn Taymiyyah, where he clearly stated: <em>Qalu</em> (they said)!!</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;From them: that Saqqaf overlooks the words of <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em> Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <em>may Allah have mercy upon him</em> &#8211; concerning the overall usage of this term in reference to Allah &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em> &#8211; and he halted where he halted upon with knowledge. However justice is very rare &#8211; and there is no movement and power except with Allah.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;<em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em> said, in the course of this topic, &#8216;indeed the term <em>al-jism</em> (body), <em>al-arad</em> (organs), <em>al-mutahayyiz</em> (extent) are newly invented terminoligies. We have mentioned many a time before that the <em>Salaf</em> and the Imams have not spoken about such things &#8211; neither by way of negation, nor by way of affirmation. Rather they declared those who spoke about such matter to be innovators, and went to great lengths to censure them.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;This is what has repeatedly been affirmed by <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em> &#8211;<em>may Allah have mercy on him</em> &#8211; in many of his books, such as: &#8216;<em>Sharh Hadith an-Nuzul</em>&#8216; (pp. 69-76), &#8216;<em>Majmu&#8217; al-Fatawa</em>&#8216; (3/306-310, 13/304-305), &#8216;<em>Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah</em>&#8216; (2/134-135, 192, 198-200, 527). Indeed in &#8216;<em>Sharh Hadith an-Nuzul</em>&#8216; <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em> has labelled ascribing Allah with the term <em>jism</em>, by saying, &#8216;an innovation in the <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em>, a corruption of the language, and a contradiction to the [sound] intellect. Rather it is repudiated by the <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em>, the language and the [sound] intellect.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;And from them: <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em> mentions the intended meaning of ascribing Allah with the term <em>jism</em>, by saying: &#8216;whosoever alleges that the Lord is a <em>jism</em> &#8211; with the meaning that he accepts division, separation and partition (for Allah) &#8211; then he is the most disbelieving of people and the most ignorant. Indeed, his statement is more evil than the one who says that Allah has a son &#8211; with them meaning that a part of Him split and thus became His son.&#8217; &#8220;</span> [&#8216;<em>Al-Asalah</em>&#8216; magazine (no. 4 pp. 54-55), see also his &#8216;<em>Rudud wa&#8217;t-Ta&#8217;qubat</em>&#8216; (pp. 21-23)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And at this point we quote from a writer of the own ranks of the accusers: Dr. Sa&#8217;id Ramadhan al-Buti who says, <span class="salaf">&#8220;And we are amazed when we see the extremists declaring Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>may Allah have mercy upon him</em>, of being an unbeliever. And also at them saying that he was one who held Allah to be a body (<em>mujassid</em>), and I have studied long and hard as to where I could find a statement or a word from Ibn Taymiyyah that he wrote or said which would indicate his holding Allah to be a body as was quoted from him by As-Subki and others</span> [This is a clear indication from Al-Buti of the injustice done against Ibn Taymiyyah by the likes of As-Subki and others]<span class="salaf">, and I have not found anything from him like this. All I found was him saying in his legal rulings, &#8216;Indeed Allah has a Hand as He said, and has risen over the Throne as He said, and He has an Eye as He said.&#8217; &#8220;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And he adds to this, <span class="salaf">&#8220;I referred to the last work written by Abu&#8217;l-Hasan al-Ash&#8217;ari, &#8216;<em>Al-Ibanah</em>&#8216;, and I found him saying exactly what Ibn Taymiyyah said [on the issue of the Names and Attributes of Allah].&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Nadwa Ittjahat al-Fiqr al-Islami</em>&#8216; (pp. 264-265) of Al-Buti]</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Claims of Ibn Battuta</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Amongst the contemporaries of Ibn Taymiyyah who accused him of<em>tajsim</em> was the travelling historian, Ibn Battuta who said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;I was present in Damascus on Friday where he (Ibn Taymiyyah) was admonishing and reminding the people from the minbar (pulpit) of the congregational mosque. During his speech he said: Indeed Allah descends to the lowest heaven of the world just as I am descending now. He then descended one step of the minbar.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Ar-Rihlah</em>&#8216; (1/110) of Ibn Battuta]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The falsehood of this can be seen from many angles:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">This contradicts the <em>madhhab</em> of Ibn Taymiyyah concerning the Attributes of Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; which was the same as the<em>madhhab</em> of the <em>Salaf</em>, being built upon the saying of Allah, <span class="quran">&#8220;There is nothing like Him, He is the Hearing and the Seeing.&#8221;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymiyyah says in &#8216;<em>At-Tadmuriyyah</em>&#8216; (p. 20), <span class="salaf">&#8220;It is a must to affirm that which Allah affirms for himself, whilst negating any likeness to Him with His creation. Whosoever says: His Knowledge is like my knowledge, His Power is like my power, or Love like my love, or Pleasure like my pleasure, or Hand like my hand, or Ascending like my ascending, or His <em>Nuzul</em> (descent) is like my descent &#8211; then he has resembled and likened Allah to the creation. Rather it is a must to affirm (Allah&#8217;s Attributes) without resemblance, and to negate (what Allah negates for Himself), without <em>ta&#8217;til</em> (divesting Allah of His Attributes).&#8221;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise he said in &#8216;<em>Majmu&#8217; al-Fatawa</em>&#8216; (5/262), <span class="salaf">&#8220;whosoever considers the Attributes to be like the attributes of the creation &#8211; such that Istawa of Allah is like the ascending of the creation, or His Nuzool is like the descending of the creation, or other than that &#8211; then he is a deviated innovator.&#8221;</span> And he repeats this principle over and over again in his works.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is not possible that Ibn Battuta witnessed Ibn Taymiyyah deliver this speech, since Ibn Battuta clearly states in his &#8216;<em>Rihla</em>&#8216; (1/102) that he entered Damascus on the 9th of Ramadhan in the year 728H. However <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em> was &#8211; before, during and after that time &#8211; in prison. Ibn Kathir states in &#8216;<em>Al-Bidayah wa&#8217;n-Nihayah</em>&#8216; (14/135) that Ibn Taymiyyah was imprisoned on the 6th of Sha&#8217;ban in the year 728H and remained there until his death on the 20th of Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 728H [These dates are endorsed in &#8216;<em>Al-A&#8217;lam al-Uliyyah</em>&#8216; (pg.84) of Al-Bazzar, and &#8216;<em>Sahdharat adh-Dhahab</em>&#8216; (6/80) of Ibn al-Amad]</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Battuta, <em>may Allah have mercy upon him</em>, did not write the book &#8216;<em>Rihla</em>&#8216; with his own hand, rather it was collected by Muhammad ibn Jazi al-Kalbi who writes in the introduction to &#8216;<em>Rihla</em>&#8216;, <span class="salaf">&#8220;and I have quoted the meaning of the words of <em>Shaykh</em> Abu &#8216;Abdullah (Ibn Battuta) with words that give the meaning that he intended &#8230; &#8220;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Battuta started his journey on the 2nd of Rajab 725H and completed it on the 3rd of Dhul-Hijjah 756H and he did not write anything down, rather after this journey he dictated to Al-Kalbi the events of his journey from memory. Hence the door is open for mistakes, and it is highly likely that Ibn Battuta did not witness what he claimed to have witnessed, but merely conveyed the accusations that were in vogue at that time against <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em>from his enemies.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Battuta himself was opposed to Ibn Taymiyyah, for he states in &#8216;<em>Rihla</em>&#8216; (1/309), <span class="salaf">&#8220;and from the great <em>Hanbali</em> Legal Jurists of Damascus was Ibn Taymiyyah, except that he was lacking in his intellect.&#8221;</span> Hence it would have been easy for him to take on board the accusations without verifying them.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymiyyah has a separate book concerning Allah&#8217;s Descending called, &#8216;<em>Sharh Hadith an-Nuzul</em>&#8216;. In it is no trace whatsoever of the anthropomorphic beliefs that he has been falsely accused of.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymiyyah was not the <em>khatib</em> of the aforementioned <em>masjid</em>, rather it was <em>Qadhi</em> Al-Qazwayni. Ibn Battuta himself says in his &#8216;<em>Rihla</em>&#8216; (1/107), <span class="salaf">&#8220;and at the time of my entering it (Damascus) their<em>Imam</em> was <em>Qadhi</em> Jalal ad-Din Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdur-Rahman al-Qazwayni from the great legal jurists, and he was the <em>khatib</em> of the<em>masjid</em> &#8230; &#8220;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymiyyah did not used to give admonitions and reminders to the people from the <em>minbar</em>, rather he used to sit upon a chair. <em>Al-Hafidh</em> Adh-Dhahabi said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;and he became very famous and well-known, and he started giving <em>tafsir</em> of the Mighty Book from his memory, on the days of <em>Jumu&#8217;ah</em>, sitting upon a chair.&#8221;</span> And Ibn Battuta states in his &#8216;<em>Rihla</em>&#8216; (1/108), <span class="salaf">&#8220;it was the habit of the scholars of<em>hadith</em> to read books of <em>hadith</em> on a raised chair.&#8221;</span> And a raised chair in the Arabic language is called, &#8216;<em>minbar</em>&#8216;. [&#8216;<em>Lisan al-Arab</em>&#8216; (5/189)] This is why Ibn Hajar mentioned in his &#8216;<em>Durar al-Kaminah</em>&#8216;, <span class="salaf">&#8220;and he used to speak on the <em>minbar</em> in the way of the explainers of <em>fiqh</em> and<em>hadith</em>, and he used to mention in an hour, what another was unable to mention in many sittings, as if the sciences were displayed in front of his eyes.&#8221;</span> Meaning by this that he sat on a chair as done by the scholars of <em>hadith</em>.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[The above discussion is taken from &#8216;<em>Min Mashahir al-Mujaddidayn</em>&#8216; (pp. 27-29) of <em>Shaykh</em> Salih al-Fawzan, and &#8216;<em>Ibn Taymiyyah al-Muftara alayhi</em>&#8216; (pp 50-60) of <em>Shaykh</em> Salim al-Hilali. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani also mentioned in &#8216;<em>Durar al-Kaminah</em>&#8216; (p. 154) quoting from At-Tufi that, <span class="salaf">&#8220;and they mentioned that he mentioned the <em>hadith</em> of Descent and he descended two steps of the minbar and he said, &#8216;Like this descending of mine&#8217; so he was imputed with <em>tajsim</em> (<em>fa nusiba ila&#8217;t-tajsim</em>).&#8221;</span> This statement is by no means an evidence against Ibn Taymiyyah as it only states &#8216;they mentioned&#8217; mentioning no eye witnesses, And in fact it only confirms, along with all that has preceded, that these were lies being spread against Ibn Taymiyyah. This is the reason that At-Tufi only said,<span class="salaf">&#8220;he was imputed with <em>tajsim</em>&#8220;</span> using uncertain phraseology.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So with the above it is clear that the account of Ibn Battuta cannot be depended upon due to his obvious confusion and the lack of coherency of his account, and due to it&#8217;s clear contradiction to the written words of Ibn Taymiyyah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And with this the gross exaggeration of Taj ad-Din Subki can also be discerned, where he said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;none of them (scholars) denied that he had said, &#8216;Allah had directions and is a composition of particles coming together.&#8217; &#8220;</span> [See &#8216;<em>Albani Unveiled</em>&#8216; (p. 116)]</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Accusation that Ibn Taymiyyah held Allah to be subject to direction (<em>jihha</em>)</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nowhere in the works of Ibn Taymiyyah has he used the word <em>jihha</em> in describing Allah. Rather the basis of this accusation arises from his following our <em>Salaf</em> and clearly stating that Allah is outside of His creation, above the heavens, over His Throne. When reading this, the misguided philosophers (<em>mutakallimin</em>) argued that this position of Ibn Taymiyyah necessitated that Allah have a direction.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Position of the <em>Salaf </em>as to Allah being distinct from creation</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Know that the verses of the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> on this issue, clear and unequivocal in their meaning, run into hundreds, and likewise the <em>ahadith</em>, that Allah is above His creation and over His Throne. These are well known so we will suffice here with stating the position of the <em>Salaf</em> on this issue as it is they who understood the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> the best. Below is a translation of some points from &#8216;<em>Khalq Af&#8217;al al-Ibad</em>&#8216; of <em>Imam</em> Bukhari, pp. 13+. All narrations quoted are authentic <em>insha&#8217;Allah</em> according to the<em>takhrij</em> done of the works quoted. The narrators are mainly <em>Tabi&#8217;i</em> and those that came immediately after.</span></p>
<div class="unordered">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Wahb ibn Jarir said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;The <em>Jahmiyyah</em> are heretics, they think that He has not risen over His Throne.&#8221;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Mubarak said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;We do not say as the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> say that Allah is on the earth, rather He has risen over His Throne.&#8221;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">And it was said to him, &#8216;How should we know our Lord?&#8217; He said,<span class="salaf">&#8220;Above the Heavens, over/upon (<em>&#8216;ala</em>) His Throne.&#8221;</span></span></li>

<li><span style="color: #000000;">And <em>Imam</em> Al-Bukhari said, <span class="salaf">&#8216;and that (i.e. his answer) was because of the saying of Allah,</span> <span class="quran">&#8220;and they cannot encompass anything of His Knowledge except what He wills.&#8221;</span> <span class="salaf">i.e. except what He explains.&#8217;</span></span></li>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">[This shows that the question &#8216;Where is Allah&#8217; was considered allowed by the <em>Salaf</em>, and how could it be otherwise when the Prophet himself asked the slave girl, &#8220;Where is Allah?&#8221; as is established firmly in the <em>sahih</em> of<em>Imam</em> Muslim. So do not be misguided by the neo-<em>Jahmiyyah</em> of today, Saqqaf and al-Habbashi and their likes who try to declare the above<em>hadith</em> of Muslim as weak, and make out that the above question is a<em>bid&#8217;ah</em>, having only the classical <em>Jahmiyyah</em> as their precedents.]</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Imam</em> Awza&#8217;i said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;We used to say, while the <em>Tabi&#8217;in</em> were many, &#8216;Indeed Allah is above His Throne, and we believe in what occurs in the <em>Sunnah</em>to do with His Attributes.&#8217; &#8220;</span> [Related by Al-Bayhaqi in &#8216;<em>Asma wa&#8217;s-Sifat</em>&#8216; (p. 408) and Ibn Hajar declared it&#8217;s chain of narration to be good as in &#8216;<em>Fath al-Bari</em>&#8216; (13/406)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Imam</em> &#8216;Abdullah ibn Ahmad quoted &#8216;Abdullah ibn Mubarak as saying, <span class="salaf">&#8221; &#8230; I bear witness that You are above Your Throne above the seven heavens and this is not as the enemies of Allah say, the heretics.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Sharh as-Sunnah</em>&#8216; of <em>Imam</em> &#8216;Abdullah]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He also quoted &#8216;Abdullah ibn Mubarak as saying, <span class="salaf">&#8220;We know that our Lord is above the seven heavens over the Throne, and we do not say as the<em>Jahmiyyah</em> say that He is here,&#8221;</span> pointing with his hand to the earth. [ibid]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hanifah said, when asked of his opinion of the one who says, &#8220;I do not know whether Allah is in the heavens or on the earth&#8221;:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;He has disbelieved, because Allah says, </span><span class="quran">&#8216;The Most Merciful rose above the Throne&#8217;</span><span class="salaf">, and His Throne is above His seven heavens.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He was then asked, &#8220;What if he said that Allah is above His Throne but he does not know whether the Throne is in the heavens or on the earth?&#8221; He said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;He has disbelieved, because He has denied that He is above the heavens and whosoever denied that He is above the heavens has disbelieved.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Al-Uluww</em>&#8216; of Adh-Dhahabi, also &#8216;<em>Sharh &#8216;Aqidah at-Tahawiyyah</em>&#8216; of Ibn Abi al-Izz al-Hanafi]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Khuzaymah (the <em>Imam</em> of the <em>muhaddithin</em> of his time) said,<span class="salaf">&#8220;Whosoever does not affirm that Allah is above His heavens, over/upon (<em>&#8216;ala</em>) His Throne and He is distinct from His creation, must be forced to repent. If he does not repent then he must be beheaded and thrown in the garbage dump so that the Muslims and dhimmi (Jews and Christians living under the Islamic State) would not suffer from his stinking smell.&#8221;</span>[&#8216;<em>At-Tawhid</em>&#8216; of Ibn Khuzaymah, also quoted by Al-Hakim in &#8216;<em>Al-Ma&#8217;rifah</em>&#8216;]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Imam</em> Abu&#8217;l-Hasan al-Ash&#8217;ari (d.290H) in &#8216;<em>Al-Ibanah</em>&#8216; brings a whole chapter on &#8216;<em>Istawa</em>&#8216; (Allah Rising over His Throne), in the course of his discussion he said, <span class="salaf">&#8221; &#8230; and some people say, from the <em>Mu&#8217;tazila</em> and<em>Jahmiyyah</em> and <em>Hururiyya</em>, about the saying of Allah,</span> <span class="quran">&#8216;The Most Merciful rose upon His Throne&#8217;</span><span class="salaf">, that he <em>istawla</em> (conquered), <em>Milak</em> (owned), <em>Qahr</em>(dominated), and that Allah is in every place, and they denied Allah being above His Throne, as the People of Truth say &#8230; &#8221; </span>[&#8216;<em>Al-Ibanah</em>&#8216; (p. 120+) containing an excellent refutation of the above claim. This also refutes clearly what Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi states in his &#8216;<em>Farq bayna&#8217;l-Firaq</em>&#8216; that, &#8220;The majority go the way of saying that the meaning of <em>Istawa</em>is establishing dominance (<em>al-qahr</em>) and victory (<em>al-ghalaba</em>), that is, the Merciful vanquished the Throne (<em>al-rahmanu ghalaba al-&#8216;arsh</em>) and overcame it (<em>wa qaharahu</em>). He mentioned the Throne specifically because it is the greatest of created things (<em>a&#8217;dhamu al-makhluqat</em>).&#8221; It should be said to him, &#8220;Establish the throne and then sit on it, what majority? When the totality of the <em>Salaf</em> held that <em>Istawa</em> meant that Allah has risen over His Throne. Not only that but the very <em>Imam</em> that Abu Mansur claims to follow, Al-Ash&#8217;ari refutes his very claim as being misguidance!]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The quotes on this run into the hundreds from the <em>salaf</em>, and the books written on this by the early scholars of Islam are many but we do not wish to lengthen the discussion beyond what is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So we say to those that accuse Ibn Taymiyyah of giving Allah a direction, because of this belief of his: Your accusation necessitates that all of the above <em>Salaf</em> also held Allah to have a <em>jiha</em>, including the two great Companions, Ibn Mas&#8217;ud and Ibn Abbas. So if you were to declare Ibn Taymiyyah as misguided due to this, then you must do the same with the Salaf. We seek refuge with Allah from such misguidance!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymiyyah said:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;And when it became established in the souls of the addressees (of the revelation) that Allah is the Highest of the High, and the He is Above everything, the understanding of His saying,</span> <span class="quran">&#8220;Indeed He is (<em>fi</em>) the Heaven&#8221;</span> <span class="salaf">became that He was High and Above everything. Likewise the slave girl when it was said to her,</span> <span class="hadith">&#8220;Where is Allah?&#8221;</span><span class="salaf"> she said, &#8220;(<em>fi</em>) the Heaven,&#8221; meaning above, without designating for Him a created body or His being contained in His Creation &#8230; Furthermore whosoever thinks that Allah being (<em>fi</em>) the Heaven means that the Heaven surrounds or encloses Him, then he is a liar if he is quoting someone else or misguided if He believes this with respect to His Lord. We have not heard anyone understand this from this word (<em>fi</em>) just as we have not seen anyone quote this from anyone else.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;Bayan Talbees al-Jahmiyyah&#8217; (1/559) of Ibn Taymiyyah]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He said in &#8216;<em>Dar at-Ta&#8217;arud</em>&#8216; (1/253), <span class="salaf">&#8220;So when the Creator, <em>the Exalted</em>, is separate and distinct from the creation, high above it, and there is nothing in existence save the Creator and created, then there is nothing that exists alongside Him which is besides Him, let alone that He &#8211; Subhanahu &#8211; should be in some existing thing which surrounds and encompasses Him.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymiyyah said:</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The people fall into three groups over the convention of the use of the word <em>jiha</em>. A group that negates it, another that affirms it, and a third that explains the issue. This difference is present amongst the followers of the Four Imams who affirmed the Attributes of Allah and the difference of the <em>Ahlul-Hadith</em> and <em>Sunnah</em>, specifically, over this is a difference in wording, not in meaning. This is why a group from the Companions of Ahmad &#8211; like the <em>Tamimiyyin</em> and Al-Qadhi in one of his two sayings &#8211; negated it yet another, larger group, affirmed it &#8211; and this is the last saying of Al-Qadhi. This is because the word <em>jiha</em> could be used to refer to that which is subject to time and space (<em>wujud</em>) or that which is not (<em>ma&#8217;dum</em>) and it is known that there is nothing present except for the Creator and creation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf"><span class="salaf">&#8220;</span>So if the word <em>jiha</em> is used to refer to something that exists other than Allah then it refers to something created by Allah and Allah is not encompassed or confined by any of his creation. If the word is used to refer to something outside time and space, i.e. above the creation, then there is nothing there except Allah.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Minhaj as-Sunnah</em>&#8216; (1/216) of Ibn Taymiyyah]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So it is clear with all of this that Ibn Taymiyyah did not believe Allah to be subject to any of the created direction, nor did he believe Allah to be surrounded in any way by His creation.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Accusation that Ibn Taymiyyah held Allah to be subject to limitation (<em>hadd</em>)</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The innovators looked into the works of Ibn Taymiyyah and saw him mentioning the word hadd with respect to Allah and immediately assumed that he held Allah to be subject to limitation and without and further research declared him as a deviant or <em>kafir</em>. The error of this accusation will become clear, by the Permission of Allah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The basis of this accusation lies with the authentic saying related from &#8216;Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak as is related in &#8216;<em>Tabaqat al-Hanabila</em>&#8216; (1/267), <span class="salaf">&#8220;I said to Ahmad: it is reported from Ibn al-Mubarak that it was asked him, &#8216;How should we know our Lord?&#8217; to which he replied, &#8216;Over (<em>fi</em>) the Seventh Heaven, over His Throne with <em>hadd</em>.&#8217; So <em>Imam</em> Ahmad said: &#8216;This is how we believe it.&#8217; &#8220;</span> [Related by Ad-Darimi in &#8216;<em>Radd ala Marisi</em>&#8216; (p. 34), &#8216;Abdullah ibn Ahmad in &#8216;<em>As-Sunnah</em>&#8216; (1/175), Al-Bayhaqi in &#8216;<em>Asma wa&#8217;s-Sifat</em>&#8216; (p. 467). <em>Imam</em> Adh-Dhahabee said in &#8216;<em>Al-Uluww</em>&#8216; (p. 152 &#8211; of the<em>mukhtasar</em>), <span class="salaf">&#8220;This is <em>sahih</em>, established from Ibn al-Mubarak and Ahmad,<em>may Allah be pleased with them</em>.&#8221;</span> Ibn Taymiyyah said in &#8216;<em>Al-Hamawiyyah</em>&#8216; (5/184 &#8211; of <em>Majmu al-Fatawa</em>), <span class="salaf">&#8220;This is famous and established from Ibn al-Mubarak via many routes, and it is also established from Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and Ishaq ibn Rahawayyah and other Imams.&#8221;</span> See also &#8216;<em>Sharh &#8216;Aqidah at-Tahawiyyah</em>&#8216; (p. 240). See also the refutation of Al-Kawthari&#8217;s feeble attempts to declare this narration<em>da&#8217;if</em> in &#8216;<em>Daf&#8217; Shubah al-Ghawiyyah</em>&#8216; (pp. 73-74) of <em>Shaykh</em> Murad Shukri]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">But was the meaning of the Imams in saying this? Was it establishing limits for Allah with the meaning of the walls of a house setting its limits, or something else? Or does Allah have an Attribute of <em>hadd</em>? What is the reconciliation between this narration from <em>Imam</em> Ahmad and the previous one mentioned above (no. 675)?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymiyyah says:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;These words that he mentioned would be applicable if they had said that He has an Attribute and it is <em>hadd</em>, as suggested by this person who tries to refute them. This has not been said by anyone and neither would any intelligent person say this, for this statement has no reality to it due to their not existing a single Attribute from the Attributes that He is described with, such as Hand and Knowledge, that has been specified as hadd. All that is meant here is what distinguishes something from something else with regards to its description and measure as is well known of the word hadd when dealing with the clearly defined things. For example it is said: the hadd of man, meaning those characteristics that distinguish him as being a man.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Talbis al-Jahmiyyah</em>&#8216; (1/442) of Ibn Taymiyyah]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So historically when the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>, denied the Attributes of Allah, and denied his being above His Throne, rather they said He is everywhere, some of the <em>Salaf</em> replied to this by saying that indeed Allah has a <em>hadd</em>with the meaning: that which distinguishes Him from anything else, in that He has Risen over His Throne and is distinct from creation. Ibn Taymiyyah said:</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;So when the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> said: Indeed the Creator is not distinguished from the creation, and they denied the Attributes which distinguish Him, and they denied His Power (<em>qadr</em>), to the extent that the <em>Mu&#8217;tazila</em> said, when we acknowledge that He is Living, Knowing and all-Powerful (only), then we have come to know His reality. They say: indeed He is not distinct from other than Him. Rather they depict Him, either with negative descriptions such as: He is not in the world, nor out of the world, and not this and not that, or they make Him to be encompassed by the creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;</span>So &#8216;Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak made clear that the Lord is over His Throne, distinct from the creation, and he mentiond <em>hadd</em> because the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> used to say: He does not have a <em>hadd</em>, and whatsoever does not have a <em>hadd</em> cannot be distinct from creation, and cannot be above the creation because that would necessitate a<em>hadd</em>. So when the <em>Amir al-Mu&#8217;minin</em> &#8216;Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak was asked: &#8216;How should we know Him?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Above His Heavens, over His Throne, distinct from His creation.&#8217; So they said, &#8216;This implies that which the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> negate, and with this negation of theirs they negate the fact that He is present over the Throne, distinct from creation.&#8217; So they asked him, &#8216;With <em>hadd</em>?&#8217; And he replied &#8216;With <em>hadd</em>.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">So this is what is understood by anyone who understands what was between the sayings of the believers of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wa&#8217;l-Jama&#8217;ah</em>and the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>.&#8221;</span> [ibid (1/443)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Then Ibn Taymiyyah discusses the statements of those from the <em>salaf</em>who negated the usage of the word <em>hadd</em>, and those who used it, and explains that in reality both groups were saying the same thing, and the difference was merely one of wording not of meaning:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;If the understood meaning of this word is that Allah is in any way enclosed by His creation, then Allah is Greater and more Mighty, rather His <em>Kursi</em> is as the expanse of the Heavens and the earth.and if what is meant by this word is that he is distinct from His creation, then He is as the Imams of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> said about Him: over His Heavens, above His Throne, distinct from creation.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>At-Tadmuriyyah</em>&#8216; (p. 46)of Ibn Taymiyyah, see also for further detail, &#8216;<em>Talbis al-Jahmiyyah</em>&#8216; (2/163)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So after all this, it becomes clear that Ibn Taymiyyah did not hold Allah to be subject to limitation, and it becomes clear that the word hadd was used by some of the <em>Salaf</em> with the meaning: distinguishing characteristics, when it became necessary to do so to refute the various deviant groups at that time.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Accusation that Ibn Taymiyyah held Allah subject to movement (<em>harakah</em>)</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The basis of this accusation is that, like the <em>Salaf</em>, Ibn Taymiyyah believed that Allah descends to the Lowest Heaven in the last third of the night, and that He has the Attribute of Coming (<em>Maji&#8217;</em>). So the opponents adduced against him that he held Allah to move from one place to another, and this resembles Allah to His creation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>A glimpse at the belief of the Salaf to do with Descent:</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Imam</em> al-Ajurri (d. 360H) says in his exposition on <em>&#8216;aqidah</em>, under the chapter &#8216;to have faith and trust that Allah descends to the lowest heaven every night.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;Faith in this is obligatory, and it is not allowed for the intelligent Muslim to say, &#8216;how does he descend?&#8217; &#8211; and none would answer this except the <em>Mu&#8217;tazila</em>. [For example the saying of some, that His command descends, and the saying of others that His angels descend etc] As for the people of truth, then they say, &#8216;faith in this is obligatory without asking how. Because the narrations are authentic to the Messenger &#8211; that Allah descends to the lowest heaven every night &#8211; and the ones who transmitted this narration to us are the ones that transmitted the rules of the lawful and prohibited, the knowledge of <em>salah</em>, <em>zakah</em>, fasting, <em>hajj</em>, and <em>jihad</em>. So just as the scholars accepted these from them then like this they accepted from them these <em>Sunan</em>. They said, &#8216;the one who opposed these is horribly misguided&#8217; &#8211; warning him and warning against him.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Ash-Shari&#8217;ah</em>&#8216; (p. 272)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Then he goes on to mention the <em>ahadith</em> that occur on this subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The great <em>hadith</em> master, Ibn Khuzaymah brings a chapter heading in his work &#8216;<em>At-Tawhid</em>&#8216;, &#8220;mentioning the narrations of Descent,&#8221; in which he mentions many <em>ahadith</em> to do with this Attribute.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Lalika&#8217;i (d. 414H) brings a chapter heading in his encyclopaedic work on <em>&#8216;aqidah</em> &#8211; <em>Sharh Usul I&#8217;tiqad</em> &#8211; , &#8220;what is related about the Descent of the Lord, Blessed and Exalted, is He&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He states that the <em>ahadith</em> that Allah descends to the lowest heaven have been reported by twenty companions and then &#8230;</span></p>
<div class="unordered">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Fudayl ibn Ayad (<em>Tabi&#8217;i</em>) said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;When you hear the <em>Jahmi</em> say, &#8216;I disbelieve in a Lord Who descends&#8217; &#8211; say &#8211; &#8216;I believe in a Lord Who does what He wills&#8217; &#8220;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Yahya ibn Ma&#8217;in said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;When you hear the <em>Jahmi</em> say, &#8216;I disbelieve in a Lord Who descends&#8217;, then say, &#8216;I believe in a Lord Who does what He desires.&#8217; &#8220;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Imam</em> Ahmad said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;He descends as He wills, according to His Knowledge and Power and Greatness. He encompasses everything with His Knowledge.&#8221;</span></span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Similar narrations occur in <em>Khalq Af&#8217;al al-Ibad</em> of <em>Imam</em> al-Bukhari and &#8216;<em>Ghunya at-Talibin</em>&#8216; of &#8216;Abdul-Qadir Jilani.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Imam</em> &#8216;Abdullah ibn Ahmad narrates in his work &#8216;<em>As-Sunnah</em>&#8216;:</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;After mentioning the hadith of Descent the people said to Sharik, &#8216;Verily there are a people who reject these <em>ahadith</em>.&#8217; He said, &#8216;What do they say?&#8217; They said, &#8216;They abuse these <em>ahadith</em>.&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Those who brought (i.e. Companions) these <em>ahadith</em>, are those who brought the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em>, and that the prayers are five, and the <em>Hajj</em> to the House, and the fast of <em>Ramadhan</em>. And we do not know Allah except by these <em>ahadith</em>.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Abad ibn al-Awam said, Sharik ibn &#8216;Abdullah came to us about fifty years ago. He said (Abad), &#8216;I said, &#8216;O Abu Abdalah, verily there is a people with us from the <em>Mu&#8217;tazila</em> who reject these <em>ahadith</em>.&#8217; He said, &#8216;So he narrated to me about ten <em>ahadith</em> to do with this (i.e. the Descent of Allah) and said, &#8216;As for us we take our religion from the<em>tabi&#8217;in</em> from the companions of the Messenger, from where do they take theirs?&#8217; &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Abu&#8217;l-Hasan al-Ash&#8217;ari (d. 294H) said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;And we believe in all the narrations that the People of Transmission have established about the Descent to the lowest heaven and that the Lord says, &#8216;Is there one who is asking? Is there one who is seeking forgiveness?&#8217; And in the generality of what they transmit and establish, at odds to what the people of deviancy and misguidance say.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Al-Ibanah</em>&#8216; (p. 60) of Abu&#8217;l-Hasan al-Ash&#8217;ari]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He also said, <span class="salaf">&#8220;And we believe in the <em>ahadith</em> that have come from the Messenger that Allah descends to the lowest Heaven and says, &#8216;Is there one who is seeking forgiveness?&#8217; &#8220;</span> [&#8216;<em>Al-Maqalat</em>&#8216; (p. 224) of Abu&#8217;l-Hasan al-Ash&#8217;ari]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So we say yet again, if by Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s affirmation of this Attribute, that Allah indeed Descends to the lowest heaven as befits His Majesty, is misguidance then so are all of the above scholars, and in fact <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> itself misguided! And so is the very <em>Imam</em> that the accusers claim to follow misguided, Abu&#8217;l-Hasan al-Ash&#8217;ari!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymiyyah says, while discussing the use of the word &#8216;<em>harakah</em>&#8216;:</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Like Harb al-Kirmani, and &#8216;Uthman ibn Sa&#8217;id ad-Darimi and others. Indeed these clearly used the word <em>harakah</em> and they made clear that this was the <em>madhhab</em> of the Imams of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> and<em>Hadith</em> from the early and the later.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Harb al-Kirmani mentioned that this was the saying of the Imams of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> that he had met, like Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and Ishaq ibn Rahawiyyah, and &#8216;Abdullah ibn Zubayr al-Humaydi and Sa&#8217;id ibn Mansur.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Sa&#8217;id bin Mansur and others said: Indeed <em>harakah</em> (movement) is from the necessary qualities of life and every living thing moves. They made out that denying this was from the saying of the<em>Jahmiyyah</em> upon whom <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> are agreed with respect to their misguidance and innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;Another group from the <em>Salaf</em>, like Nu&#8217;aym ibn Hammad al-Khaza&#8217;i, and Bukhari the author of the &#8216;<em>Sahih</em>&#8216;, and Abu Bakr ibn Khuzaymah, and others like Abu &#8216;Umar ibn &#8216;Abdul-Barr, affirmed the meaning of what they (the first group) affirmed but they named it Actions (of Allah). From these were those that forbade the use of the word<em>harakah</em> due to its not being narrated.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Dar at-Ta&#8217;arud</em>&#8216; (7/2)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The word <em>harakah</em> was affirmed by a group from <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> and<em>Hadith</em> and this is what was mentioned by Harb ibn Isma&#8217;il al-Kirmani in his &#8216;<em>Sunnah</em>&#8216; which he relates from a group of Imams that he met like Al-Humaydi and Ahmad ibn Hanbal &#8230;</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Some groups of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> negated the usage of the word<em>harakah</em> like Abu&#8217;l-Hasan at-Taymi and Abu Sulayman al-Khattabi &#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;What is narrated from <em>Imam</em> Ahmad is the rejection of the one that negates movement but neither is the usage of the word <em>harakah</em>established from him, even though he may have affirmed some types (of Attributes and Actions) that the affirmer (of the word<em>harakah</em>) would have placed within the ranks of the word <em>harakah</em>. For when he heard someone narrating the <em>hadith</em> of Descent and saying, &#8216;He Descends without movement and transmission, and without change.&#8217; So <em>Imam</em> Ahmad rejected this and said, &#8216;Say as the Messenger said, for he was more shy of His Lord than you.&#8217; &#8220;</span> [&#8216;<em>Al-Istiqamah</em>&#8216; (1/70)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So from this we learn that:</span></p>
<div class="unordered">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">From the <em>salaf</em> were those who negated the usage of the word<em>harakah</em> because it did not occur in the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> when describing Allah, but they affirmed the Attributes of Descent, Coming etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">From the <em>salaf</em> were those who affirmed the word <em>harakah</em> meaning that Allah Comes, and Descends etc. and it is not like the movement of the Creation but rather as it befits His Majesty.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em> quotes the two sayings stating that in meaning that they are the same and that there is no resembling Allah to His creation in this. He himself only affirms the Attributes of Allaah without adding anything further.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Finally Ibn Taymiyyah belonged to the first group above. So with all of this, the fourth accusation is cleared and all praise is due to Allah.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Accusation that Ibn Taymiyyah held the Hellfire to come to an end</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Another accusation by which the opponents declared Ibn Taymiyyah to be misguided due to his contradicting the &#8216;consensus&#8217; on this issue. Yet nowhere in the works of Ibn Taymiyyah does he say this, in fact what we find from him is the exact opposite, and we challenge anybody who accuses Ibn Taymiyyah of this to bring his proof.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymiyyah says:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;The <em>Salaf</em> of this nation, its Imams, and the whole <em>Ahlus-Sunnah w&#8217;al-Jama&#8217;ah</em> are agreed that there are some things from the creation that will not come to an end in their entirety like Paradise, Hellfire, the Throne, and others. No one believed that all of the creation would come to an end except for a group from the People of innovated speech (<em>Ahlul-Kalam</em>) and those who agreed with them from amongst the <em>Mu&#8217;tazila</em> and their likes. This is an invalid opinion which contradicts the Book of Allah, the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger and the consensus of the nation and its Imams.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Bayan Talbis al-Jahmiyyah</em>&#8216; (1/851)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is from one perspective, as for the other than it is over the issue of the Punishment of the Hellfire coming to an end. This is an issue over which there is a difference of opinion emanating from the <em>Salaf</em>themselves as the reader of the Tafsirs of At-Tabari, As-Suyuti and others can see under the verse 11:107 and 6:128. It is possible to explain these narrations in two ways: the first being that the saying of some of the Companions and <em>Tabi&#8217;in</em> that, <span class="salaf">&#8220;There will come a time when there will be no-one in Hellfire&#8221;</span> is to be taken literally. The second is that it is to be taken to refer only to the Muslims in the Hellfire.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">No matter how we take it, to rule someone&#8217;s deviancy or unbelief based on this is not possible, for only one who contradicts a consensus that is firmly established to exist, and unequivocal in it&#8217;s meaning can be ruled to be a deviant or a disbeliever. This is not the case here despite the efforts of some scholars to make it seem so. Even if it were so, then neither Ibn Taymiyyah or Ibn al-Qayyim held this view, so do not be deceived by what the likes of As-Subki writes in his &#8216;<em>Al-I&#8217;tibar bi Baqa al-Jannah wa&#8217;n-Nar</em>&#8216; (forming part of his &#8216;<em>Risa&#8217;il</em>&#8216;).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As-Subki says, in the course of his discussion on this point:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;I came across the aforementioned book and he mentioned in it three opinions over the Hellfire coming to an end; 1) Both Paradise and Hell will end and he said that no one from the <em>salaf</em> held this opinion; 2) that both are eternal; and 3) that Paradise remains and Hellfire will come to an end. And he inclined to this position and said that this was the <em>madhhab</em> of the <em>Salaf</em>.&#8221;</span> [&#8216;<em>Al-I&#8217;tibar</em>&#8216; (p. 201)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The opponents who read this book, thought that As-Subki was referring to Ibn Taymiyyah and hence the origin of this accusation against Ibn Taymiyyah. But in reality this is from the words of Ibn al-Qayyim and it seems that As-Subki did not even fully read what this <em>Imam</em> had to say!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Qayyim says: &#8216;<em>Al-Hadi al-Arwah</em>&#8216; (p. 429+),</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;And this is an issue over which the latter people differed over, falling into three opinions; 1) That both Paradise and Hell will come to an end and are not eternal, rather just as all created things they will come to an end; 2) That both will remain, never coming to an end; 3) That Paradise is eternal, and the Hellfire will come to an end. We will mention these opinions and their proponents along with their evidences, and we will reject what contradicts the Book of Allah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;1) As for the first saying, then it was said by Jahm ibn Safwan, the <em>Imam</em> of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>, and he did not any precedent in this from the <em>Salaf</em> &#8211; neither in the Companions, nor the <em>Tabi&#8217;in</em>, nor any of the Imams of Islam, or indeed anyone from <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em>. Rather this saying was one that was rejected by the Imams and they declared the unbelief of the ones that held to it, as is mentioned in &#8216;<em>As-Sunnah</em>&#8216; of &#8216;Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal reporting from Kharijah ibn Mus&#8217;ab that he said, &#8216;I declare the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> to be unbelievers due to three verses from the Book of Allah, <em>Azza wa Jall</em>,</span> <span class="quran">&#8216;Its (Paradise) provision and food is eternal&#8217;</span><span class="salaf"> and they say it will end.</span><span class="quran">&#8216;Verily this is Our provision which will never finish&#8217;</span>, <span class="salaf">and they say they will. </span><span class="quran">&#8216;Whatever is with you will pass away, and what is with Allah will remain&#8217;</span><span class="salaf"> &#8216;</span></span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;2) As for the saying that the Hellfire is eternal, then <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em>said, &#8216;There are two famous opinions from the <em>Salaf</em> and <em>Khalaf</em> and this difference is known to exist amongst the <em>Tabi&#8217;in</em>.&#8217; I say: and here are seven opinions on this:</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">1. That the one entering it will never leave, this being the saying of the <em>Khawarij</em> and <em>Mu&#8217;tazila</em>.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">2. That it&#8217;s inhabitants will be punished for a time but then this punishment will be changed for them and they will live in a normal manner, gaining pleasure from the Fire, due to its being in conformity to their nature. This is the saying of the <em>Imam</em> of the <em>Ittihadiyyah</em> (anthropomorphists) Ibn Arabi at-Ta&#8217;i.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">3. That its inhabitants will be punished for a time, then they will be removed from it, and another creation placed in Hell. This opinion was one that the Jews related to the Messenger and he declared them liars due to it as did Allah by saying,</span> <span class="quran">&#8216;And they (the Jews) say: the Fire will not touch us but for a few days. Say: have you taken a covenant from Allah, so that Allah will not break His Covenant? Or is it that you say of Allah what you know not. And those who believe and do righteous deeds, they are dwellers of Paradise, they will dwell therein forever.&#8217;</span><span class="salaf"> This saying is then the saying of the enemies of Allah, the Jews, and they are the shaykhs of its proponents. The <em>Qur&#8217;an</em>, <em>Sunnah</em>, and the consensus of the <em>Sahabah</em> and the <em>Tabi&#8217;in</em> and the Imams indicate this opinions invalidity. Allah says,</span> <span class="quran">&#8216;And they will not leave it&#8217;</span> &#8230;</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">4. That its inhabitants will leave it and the Fire will remain, being empty, this is related by <em>Shaykh ul-Islam</em> (Ibn Taymiyyah). And this opinion is also refuted by the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> as has preceded.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">5. That it will come to an end due to its being created. It is impossible for anything that is created to remain forever, this is the saying of Jahm ibn Safwan, and he does not distinguish in this between the Fire and Paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">6. That its inhabitants will die and lose movement and remain in there as inanimate things, and they will not be affected by pain. This is the saying of Abu&#8217;l-Hudhayl al-Alaf, the <em>Imam</em> of the <em>Mu&#8217;tazila</em>, and in this ruling he does distinguish between Paradise and Hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">7. That its Creator and Lord will cause it to come to an end, for He has given it a limited period.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Shaykh ul-Islam</em> said, &#8216;This (last) saying was related from &#8216;Umar, Ibn Mas&#8217;ud, Abu Hurayrah, Abu Sa&#8217;id and others.&#8217; Abd ibn Humayd related &#8211; and he is from the most noble of the scholars of <em>hadith</em> &#8211; in his famous <em>tafsir</em>, Sulayman ibn Harb reported to us, from Salma, from Thabit from Hasan who said, &#8216; &#8216;Umar said: If the people of Hell were to remain in the Fire to the extent of the stones in a mountain there would be a day that they would leave it.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;And he said, &#8216;Hajaj ibn Minhal, from Hammad ibn Salma, from Humayd from Hasan that &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab said, &#8216;If the People of the Fire were to remain in the Fire to the extent of the stones in a mountain there would be a day that they would leave it.&#8217; He mentioned this in the <em>tafsir</em> of His saying, &#8216;They will stay in there for periods.&#8217;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 78:23]</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;So <em>Abd</em>, who is from the Imams of the <em>Huffadh</em> and scholars of<em>Sunnah</em> relates from these two noble personalities: Sulayman ibn Harb and Hajjaj ibn Minhal, who in turn narrate from Hammad ibn Salma, and he narrates from Thabit and Humayd, and these two from Hasan. And this is sufficient to show the excellence of this<em>isnad</em>.</span></p>
<p><span class="salaf" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;And Hasan, even if he did not hear anything from &#8216;Umar, relates this also from some of the <em>Tabi&#8217;in</em>. If this was not authentic from &#8216;Umar, according to him, then why did he narrate it and designate his narration with certainty by saying, &#8216; &#8216;Umar said&#8217;? And why did those Imams narrate it from him without rejection or refutation when it is known that they rejected anything that contradicted the<em>Sunnah</em> and refuted matters less than this? So if this saying was from those that contradicted the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> and <em>ijma&#8217;</em> of the Imams then they would have been the first to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf">&#8220;There is no doubt that the one who sticks to this opinion of &#8216;Umar, and narrates it from him means a portion/type of the inhabitants of the Fire. For the people (i.e. Muslims) that are punished due to their sins, then these people would leave it and they would not stay in it the extent of the stones in a mountain. And the word, &#8216;People of the Fire&#8217; is not specific to the believers in the Oneness of Allah, rather it is specific to their enemies, as the Prophet said,</span> <span class="hadith">&#8216;As for the People of the Fire who are it&#8217;s inhabitants, then they will neither live or die in their.&#8217;</span> <span class="salaf">[<em>Sahih Muslim</em>] What has preceded does not contradict His saying,</span> <span class="quran">&#8216;They will remain in their forever,&#8217;</span> and His saying, <span class="quran">&#8216;And they will never leave it.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="salaf"><span class="quran">&#8220;</span>Ibn Mas&#8217;ud said, &#8216;There will come a time in which there will be no-one in the Fire and that is after they have remained in there for periods.&#8217; The likes of this is related from Abu Hurayrah, both being reported by Al-Baghawi in his <em>tafsir</em>. Then he says after this, &#8216;And the meaning of these according to <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em>, if they are established, is that no one of the People of faith will remain in there&#8217; &#8230; &#8220;</span> [&#8216;<em>Al-Hadi al-Arwah</em>&#8216; (pp. 429+)]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So with this it is clear that both Ibn Taymiyyah and his student did not hold the Hellfire to come to an end or that the punishment would cease for the unbelievers. Were it not for the fear of lengthening the discussion beyond what is necessary, we would quote from the <em>tafsir</em> of Ibn Taymiyyah in which he makes clear that certain types of people would remain in the Hellfire forever, for example, Pharaoh.</span></p>
