<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Saqib &#8216;Shami&#8217; delivered a talk a few years back, parts of which were uploaded on to youtube titled as, &#8220;<em>Death of Ibn Taymiyyah What Really Happened? Did (BIDDAH &amp; SHIRK) Take Place?&#8221;</em> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Saqib is based at this centre</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7457 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-1.jpg?resize=540%2C419" alt="kunz-1" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-1.jpg?resize=300%2C233 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-1.jpg?resize=768%2C596 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C795 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-1.jpg?w=1236 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It has now been revamped with a modern look,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7459 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?resize=529%2C363" alt="kunz-2" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?resize=300%2C206 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?resize=768%2C527 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C703 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?resize=110%2C75 110w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?w=1544 1544w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kunz-2.jpg?w=1236 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Apart from the disastrous distortions and misconstrued interpolations to serve the innocent listeners in the gathering, most of the points do not extend beyond comical digressions and hyped hellenistic delusions. One of the outright lies uttered by Saqib was that Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah wore a Ta&#8217;wiz or talisman (which he cleverly terms as a Dauri &#8211; a subcontinent term for a thick string attached to a type of tawiz) and hence he died with that around his neck etc, the viewers can watch the comical presentation themselves from 5:50 onwards in the video below</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JCPp8Pq4AYM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first deliberate distortion and deceptive lie Saqib utters is that he says the student of Ibn Taymiyyah, Hafiz Ibn Kathir is saying this &#8211; the reason we say a deliberate deceptive because Saqib clearly says he is reading the text and translating it directly. Hence the deliberate lie and an attempt to present such beliefs on Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and Hafiz Ibn Kathir is appalling. If we look at the text of al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah Hafiz Ibn Kathir clearly says</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (18:295+)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ed.Dr. Abdullah bin Abdul Muhsin al-Turki,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Markaz al-Buhuth Wad-Dirasat al-Arabiyyah al-Islamiyyah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">(Riyadh: Dar al-Hajr, 1419/1998) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That Shaykh Alam ud Din al-Birzali said his his Tarikh&#8230;.and then Hafiz Ibn Kathir relays the whole incident and events surrounding the death of Imam Ibn Tayniyyah from al-Birzali! Why did Saqib deliberately omit this very important detail and attempt to present Hafiz Ibn Kathir said all of this. This is surely treacherous and at the very basic level negligent in misquoting peoples names is beguiled narratives, especially when the ardent bigoted individual has animosity for the great Shaykh in question.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Saqib then proceeds to quote allegedly Hafiz Ibn Kathir, that when Shaykh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah died they recovered a &#8216;Dauri&#8217; i.e. a thick string attached to a type of Tawiz. He then offers his 10 pence worth of refutation regarding the matter. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fact of the matter is, anyone who has read the glorious history and life struggles of Shaykh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, his trials and inquisitions will know that he was imprisoned for sticking firmly to the Quran and Sunnah, something his adversaries and the likes of Saqib will have no clue about. Jail is not the most hygienic of places with little access to water and cleansing facilities, one can only but imagine the state of the prisons in those eras and the treatment of those who oppose the creed of the state. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being Imam Ibn Taymiyyah had head lice / nits and the treatment for head lice during that era was to use a string or thread around the neck soaked in mercury or quick silver. This was very common in that era and many people would often wear such strings or threads. There was no Dauri or tawiz as Saqib would like you to believe or deliberately lie to the people. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A person oft quoted by these Sufi&#8217;s Barelwi&#8217;s is their Ibn Batutta, he mentions whilst crossing the Sahara that people in the area would wear strings/threads around their necks due to the area having a lot of lice and the string would have mercury in it which would kill the lice. (Halsall P. (ed.), <em>“Ibn Battuta prepares to cross the Sahara”</em> in <em>Internet Medieval Source Book: Ibn Battuta: Travels in Asia and Africa 1325-1354</em>, (Fordham University Center for Medieval Studies: New York, 2000)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another one of their boys, Ibn Sina (Avicenna) also advocated the use of mercury to kill head lice, others extracted this and used it in a form of a string around the necks. (Carraher C.E., Jr. and C.U.Pittman C.U., Jr., Chapter 1, <em>Organometallic Compounds in Biomedical Applications</em>, Vol.3 page.3 <em>Biomedical Applications,</em> A.S.Abd-El-Aziz (ed.), John Wiley &amp; Sons: Inc. 2004)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No one says wearing, an oxygen mask, inhaler, ECG pads, wires, drips etc are tawiz because everyone is old enough and intelligent to say these are forms of medical treatments. As they were such medical treatments in the times before, furthermore, no one claims or says all the people who used such strings to treat head lice were Tawiz. Dear readers by now you would have realised how far fetched and how appaling this notion was to defame and discredit Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and the Salafi&#8217;s whereas the reality is crystal clear. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the other reports and incidences that are mentioned they have no bearing on Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah as this was done by the general people. On one hand they say we had no followers or Imam Ibn Taymiyyah had no followers except a few fringe people and at the same time they say all of these people were with Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, it is perhaps about time these Sufi Barelwis made their minds up before falling prey to their wobbling sadistic movements. The only difference is that the general Muslims had great love and reverence for Imam Ibn Taymiyyah due to this closeness to Allah via the Quran and Sunnah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the actions of the people are a litmus test, then know for sure, none of Ibn Taymiyyahs followers especially the men, wore bells on their feet and danced like women on graves (as happens in England) or exploited the sexuality of vulnerable women at the Darbars and your holy places and the list is endless if you would like us to continue, e.g. women impregnated under the guise of holy miracles at shrines, filthy naked despicable men sitting around and lets not forget the overwhelming level of Sujud to graves and the living Pirs&#8230;.. I&#8217;m sure you get the point&#8230;.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the very least they have admitted Imam Ibn Kathir was with Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and not a Sufi as some of these people claim. Furthermore, as we have mentioned Hafiz Ibn Kathir quoting al-Birzali does not use any word at all whatsoever which can be even remotely used to denote Tawiz, here are his words,</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (18:297)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As you can see dear readers, Birzali says the thread that was used had mercury in it, i.e. al-Zi&#8217;baqu. So we ask 1. why did Mr Saqib deliberately and deceptively leave this very important piece of information out, i.e. that according to you Imam Ibn Taymiyyah was wearing a taw with MERCURY in it, as you can see if he had mentioned this it would have made him look stupid and thus he would have been unable to deceive and lie to the people. Secondly we ask, if you claims this was a Tawiz, show us from your own people A SINLGE PERSON who wears a tawiz with mercury in it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Last but not least we leave you with this fantastic mind boggler which will perhaps go down very well with the Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s because they seem to be very astute at such intellectual marvels and that is if Mr Saqib claims that Imam Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah wore a Tawiz, for head lice, then show us just ONE PERSON from amongst your Sufi Barelwis who uses a Tawiz for head lice, REMEMBER JUST ONE PERSON, we will be waiting very patiently!!! It means the people do not use a tawiz for head lice and thus Imam Ibn Taymiyyah did not use a tawiz at all, let alone for head lice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers this is just one basic reply to such deceptions and disastrous distortions of these people, which they continuously utter to serve their self delusions and misguidance and misguiding others from the true facts.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated, Compiled and Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h5>
<h6 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">[This was a very moving introduction of a book by Shaikh Abdur Razzaq which he wrote over 100 years ago with regards to the afflicted state of affairs of the Muslims. The benefit of this article is that it shows the the affair and reality of the Muslims 100 years ago and that things have worsened with regards to implementing Tawhid and eradicating Shirk]</span></strong></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Anas bin Malik RadhiAllahu Anhu would cry during the era of Banu Umayyah because the deen that was revealed had been changed by the people, so what would they have said if they encountered the people from our times? Would they not have labelled us Mushriks and would we not have used bad words against them. This is because if there is anything that remains intact in our Islam today which was present before, then that is only the word Islam and some daily rituals of worship and even they are not free from innovations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The book of Allah as it was revealed from the heavens it is still preserved in exactly the same way. Even the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi wasallam is collated and preserved by the Muslims. However what a great pity and calamity that both are abandoned and neglected and are locked away in cabinets or just being being used as talismans and amulets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muslims are totally free and independent of them in their practical lives and are in fact traversing a path in opposition to obeying the command of the Quran and Sunnah. Who can say and claim after seeing the commemoration of Ajmer that they are Muslims who act and follow the Quran or are the flag bearers of Tawhid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Hindu leader of Oudh said after witnessing the events of Ajmer said <em>&#8220;Up untill now I was in doubt that Muslims and Hindus could unite, however today I am certain that today if there are any differences between us and the religion of the Muslims, then it is only in name because both in reality are the same.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He spoke the truth because if there are any difference between the shirk of the Muslims and the Hindus then it is only of name and methods. The Hindu bows to the idols and Muslims bow to the graves, the Hindu worships ram and Krishna and Muslims worship and venerate Jilani and Ajmer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For them (ie the Muslims) to say that they do not worship them or we do not consider them to be gods, is some thing that is pointless and carries no meaning whatsoever and is thus worthless because the the Hindu claims he worships one deity as well. Whereas we know they have hundreds of idols that they worship. Similarly the mushrikin of Arabia did not worship the idols thinking they were gods and deities besides Allah. However these people say that their worship is not worship like that of the idols nor do they give them different names, however changing names and differences between them does not change the true reality of the actual affairs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a great calamity for an individual to find out the thoughts, affairs and mindset of a Muslim mushrik as this group of people or sect are deficient and incapable of intelligence from following texts. On one hand they accept that Allah is the knower of the unseen, the all hearing and all seeing and not a single atom of the heavens and earth is without his knowledge and neither can it move without his permission, he is not far from us but rather close and near to us, he is the most beneficent and merciful, the most giving and forgiving and he gives without numeration. He is just and not Injust that he does not allow us to ask him he is always there and always giving with his hands outstretched and his sustenance is continuous. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people accept more of him and but yet after this, their intelligence and brains dies and the death of humanity and morality occurs because after accepting all of this these people prostrate and bow to graves, they offer vows to the deceased and it is normal for them to seek intercession and intermediateries  from those who do not even have the right. They go to the grave of Gauth Al-A&#8217;zam who is apparently still the Ghaus after his death and can steal souls from the angel of death, he is mehbub subhani, Ashiq Jan Nithar who can change the ways of stubborn people, they are gharib nawab who give sweets even after dying. These claimants of Islam and humanity emphatically go to graves and rub their foreheads on them and rub their noses and they do everything a pious human and upright individual would never be able to do in front of any of the creation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the greatest assets a human has is his own humanity whereas the others sacrifice their on the bricks and mortars of graves without any shame. If it is said to them look at what you are doing the shariah has forbidden such actions and such acts are shirk which will be punished and be in the fire of hell. They would answer with rejection and denial, distortion and false explanation. They will say it is a discussion of the shariah and what it is permissible, it is whether the inner self or outer self is evidence or the difference between the Wahhabi and hanafi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise they will present their statements and discourses Hasan Al-Basri, Shibli, Jilani and Chisti in opposition to the ayah of the Quran and the Hadith if the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi wasallam. Whereas none of the aforementioned people held any form of shirk to be permissible but who is there that can be told of this reality, who is there that listens, eyes which see and a heart that understands. As Allah said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless.&#8221; (Surah al-A&#8217;raf:179)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Unfortunately this is not only the state of affairs of the masses who can be possibly excused due to ignorance. This is also the affair of those who openly and repeatedly refer to themselves and scholars of the ummah and their inheritors of the prophecy or the prophets of Bani Israil. On one hand they say ask us questions about the shariah and yet on the other hand they claim they know the secrets of the realities and Sufi orders. The truth is that it is these people who are a trial and fitnah and the main cause for all the destruction and loss. These evil scholars are the harut and marut of this ummah and the leaders of the shayatin and they are the ones who distorted the shariah and closed the doors of the Quran and Sunnah for the Muslims. They are the ones who spread the darkness, innovation and Sufi tariqahs. They are the ones who ripped Islam away from the people under the name of Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">13 centuries of Islam have passed us and what calamity has befallen us that has not come from them, which misguidance is there which they have not shouldered the blame for. Abdullah bin Mubarak said, <em>&#8220;did anyone other than the rulers, religious scholars and priest change the din.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The words are indeed strong and inflictions on the heart and mind are serious and deep and what more than them could force someone to lament that all of these Muslims falling into destruction but yet remain silent. No Muslim will see this sad state of affairs and remain silent. How can a Muslim remain silent when things are clearly being changed and the truth is being called falsehood and the falsehood as truth. A Muslim can not see Tawhid being labelled as shirk and shirk being labelled as Tawhid and see the shariah as something that misguides and the Sunnah to be an innovation and Iman to be kufr and the coffer as Iman. It is said to a Muslim it is impossible to understand the Quran and Sunnah therefore stay away from them and rather do taqlid of people which is obligatory, therefore follow us without asking why. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So by following us build your graves higher, make tombs, ask the auliya for your needs and make the creation a wasilah for Allah, in fact do whatever you wish and you will still be forgiven because you are from the Ummah who will be interceded for therefore this is the deen, this is the shariah and this is the Sunnah. So do we not hear all of these things and remain silent or has the time not come for the reformers to arise and put a stop to the treachery of these evil scholars so that the people are able to see for themselves what Devils lie beneath their huge turbans and what darkness of kufr is entwined between their beards.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to mention of one of their respected and revered scholars who is a Sufi and is probably even a peer, during the Khilafah movement he made a suggestion that a group of scholars should go to Ajmer and tell Khawaja Sahib every single problem of the Ummah and ask for assistance. This was not only am suggestion but I have come to know this Moulvi actually went with his fellow associates and cried a lot at the shrine. However what a great shame that there was no answer and they returned. Is this the Tawhid the Quran established which these people claim they are the scholars of the din and the false pride they present in obeying and adhering to the Sunnah. If Khawaja could save the Ummah of Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi wasallam from these difficulties and calamities why do the Muslims frown on Ram and Krishna being deities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This so call visit to Ajmer was not a private affair but rather a newspaper column has publicly announced this but no scholar came forward and said this was Shirk in fact and rather most Moulvis wrote in support of the visit as the newspaper article testifies. Is this the protection of the din these so called scholars have taken the liberty upon themselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Oh and what a shame if only the scholars who promote misguidance and innovations were restricted and limited to this group only who are innovators and they were not from amongst those who claim to be reformers or alleged revivers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say these words with great sorrow and sadness and would like to present these tragic affairs to the Muslims and it has only been a few days that a great scholar (as they call him) of an educational institute of this group as well as other scholars who clearly refused to issue edicts of shirk for the Shia mourning and lamenting publicly in masses and they said such a fatwa is contrary to the greater benefit and the Khilafah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So is this the method to preserve and protect the shariah, is this the inheritance the prophets left for the scholars and their obligation and is this how our scholars fulfil their roles? Has the time still not come for the Muslims to open their eyes and and find out the reality of their religious leaders and push themselves forward in preserving the din and removing and obliterating shirk and bidah? There is no papacy in Islam or religious spiritual leaders so this the time has come to demolish these self appointed religious leaders so that Allahs servants create a strong direct link and connection with Allah.</span></p>
