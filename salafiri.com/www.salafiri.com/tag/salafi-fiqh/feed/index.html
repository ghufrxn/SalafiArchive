<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Summarised and Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibban and Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>A general point: What is taqlid?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Ibn Abdul Barr and Imam Ibn al-Qayyim quote Abu Abdullah b. Khawaz Mandad saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8216;Taqlid in the shariah is to turn to the saying of someone without proof and this is impermissible in the shariah and Ittiba is to take the saying with proof. <em>(I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> Imam Ibn Qayyim (2/178) and <em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm</em> of Ibn Abdul Barr (2/118).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Hanafi madhhab jurists have explained taqlid to mean,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">To act upon the saying of someone without any evidence or proof. (<em>Fawatih ar- Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/400).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it can be seen that those who perform taqlid will not be able to differentiate between the saying which is upon the truth and that which is upon falsehood. It can generally be seen from the definition of taqlid that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">✓ Taqlid is not knowledge but it is ignorance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Ghazzali writes, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“taqlid is to accept the saying of someone without any proof or evidence and this is not the way to attain knowledge of that which is from the usul (fundamental principles of the religion or the furu (those matters which are secondary). (<em>al-Mustasfa</em> (2/385).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">And it is written in <em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/402) that, taqlid is not the way for attaining certain knowledge. So know that that thing (taqlid) which does not lead to attaining knowledge cannot be called wajib (obligatory). Taqlid stops an individual from looking at the Quran and hadith as a proof and evidence. Never mind this being obligatory this cannot even be tolerated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Despite this some of the Hanafi scholars wrote,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The dalil (proof) for a muqallid is the saying of the mujtahid scholar, not his own thought or his scholars&#8217;. (<em>Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (p.5).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Therefore for the one performing taqlid the Quran and sunnah are no longer the proof and evidence and he is forever free from them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Some misconceptions cleared</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">To accept the witness of someone is not taqlid. The highly accepted book of the Hanafi fiqh titled <em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/400) states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“For the general lay person to turn to the mufti (scholar who gives a verdict) and for the judge to turn to the acceptable witness is <strong>not taqlid</strong>.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it is clearly proven to accept a verdict of the scholar of hadith is <strong>not taqlid</strong>.<strong> It is not taqlid</strong> to accept narrations from <em>Sahih Bukhari</em>. Why? Because there is <em>ijma</em> (unanimous agreement) of the ummah that it is the most authentic book after the book of Allah. And it is known that to turn to ijma is not taqlid. &#8216;So to turn to ijma is to turn to proof (not taqlid). (<em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-</em>Thabut 2/400)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is <strong>not taqlid</strong> to take a saying which is based upon revelation is <strong>not taqlid</strong>. (<em>Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (1/290).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">According to the Hanafi&#8217;s it is <strong>not</strong> permissible to perform taqlid of a <strong>Tabi’i</strong> (those of the second generations and many were students of the Companions). And the famous Hanafi jurisprudence book <em>Talwih</em> reports,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8216;So as for these narrations (the tabi&#8217;in) then taqlid will not be made of them. For they were men and we are men. (<em>Talwih</em> (2/17).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Some evidences on the prohibition of taqlid from the Quran.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> &#8216;Say (O Muhammad) to your folk follow what has been revealed down unto you from your Rabb (the Quran and Sunnah), and follow not any Auliya (protectors and helpers) besides him&#8217;. (Al-A&#8217;raf: 3).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">All classical mufassirin (explainers of the holy Quran) explain <strong>“That which has been</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>revealed by your Rabb”</strong> in the above ayah to refer to the Quran and hadith. For example, <em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> (2/200), <em>al-Qurtubi</em> (7/161), <em>al-Khazin </em>(2/182), <em>an-Nasafi</em> (2/44), <em>Shawkani</em> (2/179), <em>al-Qasmi</em> (7/2610), <em>al-Maragi </em>(8/100). This shows that we are ordered to follow the Quran and hadith as they are revealed by Allah and to abandon following any other way or saying as there is no evidence for following this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “Say, &#8216;Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful”. (an-Naml: 64).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This shows that without evidence shall not be accepted. Know that a saying which has no evidence to support it from the Quran and hadith shall not be accepted no matter who the saying is from. This is sufficient to refute the performing of taqlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Know that if a saying or action could be accepted without proof from the Quran and hadith then Allah would not have ordered for the proof to be brought forth in this verse. Verily it was sufficient for Allah to have called the disbelievers as &#8216;liars&#8217; but in ordering for the showing of proof in this verse, Allah has indicated that no saying shall be accepted without evidence. The utterance of this verse from the prophet Muhammad is to show that the way of the Muslim is not to perform taqlid and blindly follow. Some may comment that this verse was revealed in relation to the disbelievers and does not apply to Muslims. Then note that even though the disbelievers had no proof of what they used to do despite this they were still asked to produce there proof. Then the Muslim who has proof for what he does should be more readily asked for proof and this is necessary. Furthermore, to provide evidences is the way of the Muslim and to follow without proof or performing taqlid is and was the custom of the disbeliever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “When those who were followed disown (declare themselves innocent of) those who followed them, and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them. And those who followed will say, &#8216;If only we had one more chance to return (to the worldly life), we would disown (declare ourselves innocent from them) as they have disowned (declared themselves innocent from us). Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regrets for them&#8217;. (al-Baqarah: 166-167).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The ittiba (to follow) which has been mentioned in this verse is not ittiba which has been ordered with the proof as has been mentioned in verse one above. Therefore the ittiba referred to here will be to follow without proof and this is taqlid. If someone says that the itiba referred to here is the worship which is done for other than Allah and not making taqlid of any Imam or scholar. Then this in itself is a great proof in the prohibition of taqlid as it will have to be conceded that to make ittiba or to follow other than Allah is to worship that person and this will be shirk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> &#8216;When it is said to them: &#8216;Follow do ittiba) what Allah has sent down&#8217;. They say, &#8216;Nay! We shall follow (do ittiba) what we found our fathers following&#8217;. (would they do that) even though their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided?&#8217;. (al-Baqarah: 170).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This verse invites people to follow with evidences whereas those who are astray perform ittiba or follow that for which there is no evidence or proof. This is why they follow there forefathers and elders even though they had no evidences and proofs for what they used to say. So how is it that those who were astray continued to follow there elders not knowing whether they were upon the truth or falsehood? The only way they could distinguish between the truth and falsehood and actually be certain they were following the truth was if they had followed with proof and evidence,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">If someone says that &#8216;this verse is admonition of those disbelievers who would blindly follow there disbelieving elders and forefathers and does not refer to blindly following pious people and Imams. Then the answer to this is that this is a proof against you. For if it is as you say then know that this verse shows that to follow without evidences was the way of the disbelievers whereas the way of the Muslims is to follow the prophet Muhammad with clear evidences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad), &#8220;This is my way: I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me”. (Yusuf:108).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It would have been sufficient to call the disbelievers liars in the beliefs they held. However to explain in more detail the reason for the deviancy of the disbelievers it is not being said &#8216;that you are astray because you followed your disbelieving forefathers&#8217; but what is rather being said is that the disbelievers followed those for whose guidance or being upon the truth they had no evidences and proofs. And this what taqlid is to follow without evidences and proofs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Some sayings of the Salaf as-Salihin about taqlid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">The Companion Abdullah Ibn Mas’ud said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Let no person perform taqlid of any other person.” (<em>Majma az-Zawa’id</em> and <em>Mizan al-Kubra</em> of Shirani (1/48).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">The Companion Mu’adh Ibn Jabal said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“So when a scholar is upon guidance do not perform taqlid of him in your religion.” (<em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> (2/174), of Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, Egyptian print).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">A similar narration has been narrated as above from the companion Salmaan. (<em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> (2/174), of Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, Egyptian print).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Amir al-Mu’minin Ali said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Be aware in taking from the ways of people.” (<em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm wa Fadlihi</em> (2/114) of Imam Ibn Abdul Barr).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is known that those who were being addressed with this advise were the companions and Tabi’in. This clearly shows that taqlid in the era of the companions was forbidden.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Amir bin Sharajil Sha’bi said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“What these people inform you of from the messenger of Allah (hadith) take it. And what they say from there opinions then throw it in the rubbish.” (<em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em> (1/37) and <em>al-Hujjatullah al-Balighah</em> of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (1/148).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Dear readers know that Imam Sha’bi was from the Kibar Tabi’n&#8217; (those from the second generation after the prophet). He met 500 companions of the messenger of Allah (<em>Tazkirrah al-Huffaz</em> of Imam Dhahabi (1/74). So if the saying of a man of this stature and position is not proof in itself then how can the saying or opinion of any other Tabi’in or those who followed them be blindly accepted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Abdullah bin al-Mu&#8217;tamir said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“There is no difference between that animal which is pulled (after being tied up) and that human which performs taqlid”. (<em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm wa Fadlihi </em>(2/113,) <em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in </em>(2/170).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Know that the animal which is tied and dragged behind it&#8217;s owner knows not if it is being taken to be fed grass, or to sell or to slaughter. Likewise the muqallid (blind follower) has no knowledge that the one who he is blindly following whether he is taking him towards the truth or falsehood! This is because he has no proof for what he is following and nor is the one who he is following infallible (but our prophet is infallible).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Abu Hanifah said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“It is not halal (permissible) for anyone to take my saying who does not know from where I have bought the evidences”. (<em>Muqaddimah Hidayah</em> (p.93).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The author who recorded this saying continues by commenting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“And our Imam has prohibited the performing of taqlid and has stressed the importance of knowing the dalil (proofs and evidences).” (<em>Muqaddimah Hidayah </em>(p.93).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is clear from the above saying of the Imam that at first he prohibits the performing of taqlid and then he stresses the importance of following with proof. So it can therefore be seen that to accept with evidences and proof is not taqlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Malik said:</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Verily I am a man and I err and at times am correct. So look at what I say and whatever is in accordance with the book (Quran) and sunnah take it and whatever opposes this then abandon it.” (<em>Jalb al-Manfa&#8217;a</em> p.68).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Imam has completely finished here the performing of taqlid. This is because he has ordered the asking for proof from the book and sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Shafi’ has clearly warned against taqlid. Therefore his student Imam Muzani said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Imam Shafi’ forbids the performing of taqlid of himself and others (scholars and Imams). And he gave the order that all should look for themselves (at the proofs) in the religion and should be careful.” (<em>Mukhtasar al-Muzani</em> (1/2) on the marginal notes of <em>Kitab al-Umm</em>).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="9">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Do not perform taqlid of me, nor Malik, nor Awza&#8217;i, nor Nakha&#8217;i nor anyone else&#8217;s these were all Imams of their times. But they took there matters of the religion from the book and sunnah so you take them from there as well.” (<em>Iqd-ul-Jid</em> p.81).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">He also said to Imam Abu Dawud,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Do not perform taqlid of anyone of them in your religion.” (<em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> (2/181).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="10">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">The Imam of the Hanafi madhhab Imam Tahawi said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Only a misguided one performs taqlid.” (<em>Lisan al-Mizan</em> (1/280).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="11">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">One of the greatest scholars according to the Hanafi madhhab is Imam Sarakhsi he said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“If taqlid were permissible then it would have been performed of those who came before Abu Hanifah such as Imam Hasan al Basri and Ibrahim Nakha&#8217;i as they were more rightful for taqlid to be performed of them&#8217;. (<em>al-Mabsut</em> of Sarakhsi (12/28), Kitab al-Waqf).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It can be clearly seen Imam Sarakhsi that performing taqlid is not permissible and this was not the way of the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="12">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Another Imam of the Hanafi madhhab Jaraullah Zamakhshari said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“If there is a mother of misguidance then it is performing taqlid.” (<em>Atwaq az-Zahab</em> (p.42).</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>So did the Companions or those who came before them with their various shariah&#8217;s perform taqlid in any aspects of the religion? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. Shah Waliullah Dehlwee quotes in his book <em>Hujjatullah al-Balighah</em> (p.154) from Imam Ibn Hazm in his book <em>al- Ihkam</em> (1/760) that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“So to perform taqlid was haram (forbidden) in all of the shariah&#8217;s from the first of them to the last. Whether it was (performing taqlid) in Tawhid (aqidah), Prophethood, belief in pre-destination or all of the other aspects of worship and ahkam (rules and laws).”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Explanation of an ayah which is often quoted for performing taqlid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “Ask the people of knowledge if you do not Know.” (surah an-Nahl)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is claimed by some that when a layperson asks a scholar or seeks a verdict from him about something this is taqlid of the scholar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This is not the case because the layperson is within his rights to ask the scholar what the Quran and hadith say about a particular matter and not to ask him about his opinion. So after being told what the hadith states about a certain matter he will try to act upon it to his capability. This is not taqlid but it is the following of proof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">If just by &#8216;asking&#8217; someone one falls into taqlid then what does one say about the following verse wherein the prophet Muhammad was ordered to &#8216;ask&#8217; from the jews and Christians. Allah forbid! Will you now say that even Muhammad was performing taqlid or blindly following the Jews and Christians?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">What does to &#8216;ask&#8217; mean in this ayah? Does it mean ask the person of knowledge for his own opinion or what the Quran and hadith state? If it meant ask the scholar of his opinion then know that opinions vary. So the only reason a questioner asks is so that he can be led to certainty rather than more uncertainty and confusion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, the “people of knowledge” in this verse are those who are people of the Quran and hadith, not people of opinion. So this in itself refutes taqlid. Therefore, the muqallid and blind follower will ask about his Imam&#8217;s or scholars opinion. Whereas if he were to ask</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">for proof from the Quran and sunnah then he would no longer remain a muqallid. Also this verse orders to ask the person of knowledge if a person does not know and the following verse restricts the questioner not to follow other than that which is revealed, that is, the Quran and sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it is proven from this that one should not follow the scholar himself but should ask the scholar for proof and then follow that. We ask about the mentioning of the people of &#8216;knowledge&#8217; in this verse. Is &#8216;knowledge&#8217; anything other than the Quran and hadith?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is it obligatory to perform taqlid?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. The Hanafi scholar Adul Hayy Lucknowi writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Only that is obligatory which Allah has made so. And only he has authority to do this. Allah did not make it obligatory on anyone that he choose for himself a madhab (school of thought today such as Hanafi, Shafi’, Maliki, Hanbali and others) of an Imam. To think it obligatory to do this is to make a new religion which Allah has not legislated for.” (<em>Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em>).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Dhahabi states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Ahl us Sunnah do not make it obligatory upon anyone to follow for themselves only one specific Imam.” (<em>al-Muntaqa</em> (p.166).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is there any other person from whose tongue nothing will come except the truth, other than Muhammad?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. When the companion Abdullah bin Umar Ibn al-Aas RadhiAllahu Anhu was stopped by the Quraysh in writing the hadith (narrations) of the messenger of Allah because he (the messenger) was only a man also and at times he would be happy and at times in anger so not everything should be written down of his. Therefore, the companion Abdullah stopped writing all that was said from the tongue of the messenger. When the Prophet heard about this he pointed to his tongue and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Write! So I swear by Allah in whose hand is my soul that nothing comes from this (my tongue) except that it is the haqq (truth).” (<em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em> (1/68).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is it permissible to ascribe to a particular madhab, being known as Hanafi, Shafi’, Maliki or Hanbali?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. If it were permissible for a person to ascribe himself to a particular madhhab or person then the companions would have been the foremost to make there separate and distinct madhhabs with other companions as the leaders of the particular madhhab or group. But we see that despite the existence of great companions such as the four caliphs, Ibn Umar, Ibn Masud, Ibn Abbaas RadhiAllahu Anhum and others no particular madhhabs were formed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">In fact the companions refrained from ascribing themselves to any other companion or madhab. Therefore, the companion Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“I am not Alawi (a person who makes a particular madhab ascribing himself to the fourth caliph Ali as leader) nor am I Uthmani (a person who makes a particular madhab ascribing himself to the third caliph Uthmaan as leader), but <strong>I AM UPON THE &#8216;MILLAH&#8217; (NATION AND FOLLOWERS) OF MUHAMMAD<em>.”</em></strong> (<em>al-Ihkam</em> of Ibn Hazm (6/118).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it can be seen that the companions did not like to ascribe themselves to any other person except Muhammad. Also the four Imams Abu Hanifah, Shafi’, Maalik and Ahmad did not have their own separate &#8216;millah&#8217;s&#8217; therefore to ascribe oneself to them cannot be permissible also. If one was to say now that there are four separate &#8216;millah&#8217;s&#8217; (nations) then this would be a different matter altogether!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">O Allah guide us all upon truly following Muhammad. Amin.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated by</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
[Translated in 2001, but published for the first time now]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Anas RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Straighten your rows as straightening the rows is part of establishing of the prayer.” </em>(Sahih al-Bukhari no.723).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The wording of the hadith through another chain of transmission is,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Straighten your rows, as the straightening of rows is from perfecting the prayer”</em> (Sahih Muslim no.124/433, Abu Dawud no.688, Ibn Majah no. 993, Musnad Abu Awanah 2/38, Sunan ad-Darimi no.1266, Musnad Ahmad 3/177, 253, 273, 279, 291).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We learn from this hadith straightening the rows is from establishing and the completion of the prayer. This would mean uneven rows or rows that are not straight would lead to deficiency of the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“</em><em>Straighten the rows in the prayer, as the straightening of the rows is from the perfection of the prayer.”</em> (Sahih al-Bukhari no. 723, Abdur-Razzaq no.2424).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu also narrates Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Perfect the straightening of the rows in prayer.”</em> (Musnad Ahmad 2/485). The narrators of this hadith are of the Sahihayn. Allaamah al-Albani graded it authentic (Sahih at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib 1/271 no.496, Sahih Ibn Hibban, Mawarid no.384, Majma’ az-Zawa’id 2/92).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We learn from these hadith straightening the rows is from perfecting and beautifying the prayer and this is what Allah’s Messenger ﷺ ordered. If the rows are not straight, it will lead to deficiency in the prayer. The straightening of the rows applies when standing and when in ruku and it is obligatory. In fact Allah’s Messenger ﷺ would first perfect the straightening of the rows and then commence the prayer. If the rows were not straight he would straighten them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Nu’man b. Bashir RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“The Messenger of Allah </em><em>ﷺ used to straighten the rows until he made them like a spear or an arrow. Once he saw a man’s chest (sticking out) so Allah’s Messenger </em><em>ﷺ said, make your rows straight or Allah will create division among you.”</em> (Ibn Majah no.994, Abu Dawud no.663, Sahih Muslim no.128/436, Sahih al-Bukhari no.717 summarised)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Bara b. A’zib RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Allah’s Messenger ﷺ used to pass through the row from one side to the other; he used to set out chests and shoulders in order, and say, and do not differ in case your hearts also differ.. And he would say: Allah and His angels bless those who are near the first rows.”</em> (Abu Dawud no.664, Nasa’i no.810, Ibn Majah no.997. Zawa’id Ibn Majah mentions the chain is authentic and its narrators are trustworthy).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We learn from these authentic hadith, the rows should be straightened before the prayer. We also learn another duty of the Imam is to straighten the rows and to correct any shortcomings. It is a shame the Imams nowadays do not dispense this duty and they begin the prayer as soon as the iqamah is announced.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Worshippers should stand in the rows ensuring their feet and shoulders touch the feet and shoulders of those praying next to them without any gaps between them. Allah’s Messenger ﷺ ordered to fil the gaps in the row.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abdullah Ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhum said The Prophet ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Straighten the rows, stand shoulder to shoulder, fill the gaps, be gentle in the hands of your brothers, and do not leave gaps for shaytan. If anyone connects a row, Allah will connect him, but if anyone breaks a row, Allah will cut him off.”</em> (Abu Dawud no.666, Nasa’i no. 818, summarised, al-Bayhaqi 3/101, Ibn Khuzaimah no.1549, Mustadrak al-Hakim 1/213. Iman Hakım and adh-Dhahabi authenticated it according to the conditions of Imam Muslim. Allamah Al-Albani authenticated it in Sahih Targhib wa’t Tarhib no. 492, Musnad Ahmad 2/98).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Mundhiri explained the word ‘Farjat’, <em>“It is the plural of farjah and it refers to the gap and space between two people.”</em> We learn from this hadith we should close the gaps in the rows and there should be no space of gap between two worshippers who are praying. The action of the people who leave a gap of four fingers or more is incorrect and they should rectify this.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Anas RadhiAllahu Anhu RadhiAllahu Anhu,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“I saw each of us joining our shoulder with the shoulder of our companion and our feet with their feet, but if you were to practice this today, a person would flee from you like a restless mule.”</em> (Ibn Abi Shaybah 3/308 no. 3524, Dar al-Taj, Beirut, Fath al-Bari 2/211, Umdah al-Qari 5/260).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Nu’man b. Bashir RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“The Messenger of Allah </em><em>ﷺ</em> <em>turned to the people and said three times; straighten your rows, by Allah, you must straighten your rows, or else Allah will create disagreement between your hearts. I saw each man join shoulder to shoulder with that of his companion, knee to knee with that of his companion, and ankle bone to ankle bone with that of his [companion]”.</em> (Abu Dawud no.662, Sahih al-Bukhari in note form, Musnad Ahmad 4/276, Ibn Hibban no.396, ad-Daraqutni 1/282-283, al-Bayhaqi 3/100-101).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Uthman an-Nahdi said</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>&#8220;I was from the people whose feet Umar RadhiAllahu Anhu hit in order to straighten the row”</em> (al-Muhalla of Ibn Hazm 4/58, Mawsu’ah Fiqh Umar b. al-Khattab, p.445, Ibn Abi Shaybah 1/30 no.3530, Fath al-Bari, 2/210).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Salih b. Kaysan narrates Abdullah b. Umar RadhiAllahu Anhum said</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s more beloved to me that two of my teeth break that I see a gap in the row and I don’t fill it.&#8221;</em> (Abdur-Razzaq 2/57 no.2473, Ibn Abi Shaybah 1/333, al-Muhalla 4/59).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So, we learn from these authentic hadith that we should straighten the rows before we start praying and to close any gaps in the row, and this is an obligation. Every worshipper should join shoulder to shoulder and feet to feet with his brother in a gentle way. The Imam should begin the prayer once the row is straight in the beginning. Similarly, the row should be not be straightened once in ruku but rather before when everyone stands to commence the prayer. Similarly, the complete feet should join and not just a one toe as the Companions did and no one should run like a restless mule. The worshippers who fill the gaps will receive reward from Allah. May Allah give us tawfiq to do righteous actions and save us from exaggeration and leniency. Amin  </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Question:</strong> If the lower garment is raised above the knees is wudhu invalidated? What part of the body if uncovered invalidates wudhu? Does raising the lower garment to the thighs break and invalidate wudhu?</span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Answer:</strong> Wudhu is not invalidated, nor does it break If garments or clothes are raised above the knees or to the thighs, or if private parts are uncovered. This means a person’s wudhu does not break if clothes are removed from these body parts. However, if a person touches his private parts without clothes (or a barrier) then it is necessary for him to renew or repeat his wudhu. The Noble Prophet ﷺ said,</span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>Whoever touched his private parts should perform wudhu</em>. (Sharh Ma’ani al-Athar, 1/58, Chapter, does touching the private parts obligate Wudhu or not).      </span></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hanbalee Text</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>al-Khiraqeee ( d. 334):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>– “The hands are raised up to the lobes of the ears or parallel to the shoulders, then the right hand is placed upon the left, and both of them placed below the navel.” (Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee)</strong></span></p>
<p><b>Reply</b></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly the origin and sources are the Quraanic text and the Prophetic ahadeeth and as it is often advocated by those who deem it necessary and permissible to adhere and follow a madhab usually tend to say evidences must have been used to derive these rulings and final positions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a basic text of Hanbalee fiqh authored by Abul Qaasim Umar bin al-Hussain bin Abdullah al-Khirqee and he died in the year 334H. It is considered to be one of the very first classical text on the hanbalee fiqh and as the name suggest it is Mukhtasar ie summarised and brief, its full name is <i>Matn al-Khirqee A’la Madhab Abee Abdillaah Ahmad ibn Hanbal ash-Shaibaanee</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore it is very strange that this text would be used to establish the opinion of the hanaabilah to clasp their hands below the navel when this text is just a very brief guide. Furthermore the author ie al-Khiraqee has not cited any evidences at all whatsoever and has just cited a position we known without evidences this is invalid as its just opinion. It is often said the madhaahib must have used evidences yet in this instance there is no evidence so just to cite Khiraqee saying the position of the madhab is below the navel is ambiguous and requires further investigation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The checker ie Abu Hudhaifah Ibraaheem ibn Muhammad of one of the editions of Mukhtasar al-Khirqee added a footnote to this passage and said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i>“</i><i>There are a number of narrations</i><i> </i><i>from Imaam</i><i> </i><i>Ahmad</i><i> </i><i>that acknowledge and establish the</i><i> </i><i>placing</i><i> (of the hands) </i><i>on the chest.”</i> (<i>Mukhtasar al-Khirqee</i> (pg.21), Chapter, The Characteristics of the Prayer. Edn 1st Daar us-Sahaabah Lil-Turaath of Tantha (Egypt) 1413H/1993)</strong> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So we have previously mentioned al-Khiraqee is a basic text of the Hanaabilah and it does not cite any evidences just opinions of the madhabs. In this situation and other situations it is obligatory upon as Muslims to refer back to the divine sacred texts and in this instance for the evidences utilised by the madhab.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then we look at these evidences in light of the scholars of hadeeth and fiqh if the hadeeth are authentic we take them irrespective of the madhab and what the end result of adopting the ahadeeth brings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A recent explanation of Khiraqee does not mention the evidence used for this position and this explanation was by Khaalid bin Abdullaah al-Ansaari titled. <i>‘Sharh Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee’</i> Edn 1st Daar ul-Ei’tisaam Lil-Nashr 1425H/2004H and he also does not mention any evidence. As it must be said by the checking by Muhammad Zuhair ash-Shaawaish of Matn al-Khiraqee of one of the earliest printed edition in this century with his checking back in 1378H/1954 and he also offered no explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the earliest explanations of the Khiraqee was that of Shaikh Noor ud deen Abee Taalib Abdur Rahmaan bin Umar bin Abil-Qaasim bin Alee bin Uthmaan al-Basree adh-Dhareer who died in the year 684H titled. <i>‘al-Waadhihu Fee Sharh Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee’</i> (Edn 1st Daar al-Khadar Lil Taba’ah Wan-Nashr Wat-Tawzee’a 1421H/2000, Beiroot Lebanon)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In it Shaikh Noor ud deen said in explanation of al-Khiraqees words,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i>“</i><i>and both of them placed below the navel” </i><i>This has been narrated from Alee, Abu Hurairah (</i><i>Radhiallaahu Anhuma) and others from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) who said, “It is from the Sunnah to place the right hand on the left below the navel.” Transmitted by Ahmad and this is equivalent to the Prophetic Sunnah. This statement is also emanated from the companions.</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i>It is also narrated from (Imaam) Ahmad the Sunnah is to place the hands above the navel and this is also the statement of ash-Shaafi’ee from what is narrated by Wail ibn Hujr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) who said, “I saw the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) praying and he placed his hands on his chest one over the other.”</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i>It is also narrated from (Imaam) Ahmad that one has the choice or option to place them below the navel or above the navel based on all of the narrations (on this subject) and the command pertaining to them is broad.”</i> (End of his words)(‘al-Waadhih Fee Sharh Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee’ (1/213-214)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>BENEFITS</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly the explainer Shaikh Noor ud deen has summarised the narrations and used different wordings from what is present in the books of hadeeth. The narrations of Alee and Abu Hurairah (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) have been continuously used by all of the different madhabs in support of this opinion and in recent times books on prayer in the English language from the hanafee school of opinion from the likes of <i>‘Fiqh ul-Imam’</i> of Abdur Rahmaan ibn Yoosuf and Mr Riyadhs book <i>‘Salah of The Believer’</i>which are of Deobandee Hanafee persuasion and also some have been printed in the English language by the Barailwee Hanafee persuasion all by default use the very same reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration elucidating the meaning of the report of Alee and Abu Hurairah can be found in the <i>‘Sunan Abee Dawood’</i>(1/201 no.756) of Imaam Abu Dawood and The <i>‘Musnad’</i> of Imaam Ahmad himself (1/110 no.875)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the narration of Wail ibn Hujr can be found in the <i>‘Saheeh Ibn Khuzaimah’</i> of Imaam Ibn Khuzaimah (1/234 no.479)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So we also find the evidences used by the Hanaabilah for the position of placing their hands below their navels are the very same reports of Alee and Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) but these report have been comprehensively established to be weak. (as a brief idea refer to an appendix of the English translation of Allaamah Muhammad Naasir ud deen al-Albaanees <i>‘Sifah Salaatun Nabee’ </i>which addresses the trustworthiness of the central narrator of both of these reports and he is Abdur Rahmaan ibn Koofee al-Waasitee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most staunchest and most bigoted in this issue are our brethren from amongst the Ahnaaf ie the hanafees and even they have admitted overwhelmingly and acknowledged in their various works throughout history the weakness of Abdur Rahmaan al-Koofee. Which inshaAllaah maybe addressed at a different time. It suffices for now to know that some traditionalists ie prominent and universally accepted scholars have even established universal consensus in his weakness ie Ijmaa which as we dear readers know constitutes evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next question we may ask ourselves well if these reports are so weak why did such scholars from amongst the hanaabilah or others for that matter still utilise them as evidence as part of their madhabs. Well the simple answer to this is that this issue has been continually argued and discussed throughout history on why people still utilise evidences that are weak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is such a complex issue that books have even been written on it, in recent times the great Saudi and renowned scholar of Usool and Aqeedah Allaamah Shaikh Muhammad ibn Saaleh al-Uthaimeen Rahimahullaah, authored a book on why scholars differed or why differences of opinion existed and the Shaikhs goes through such pertinent reasons. It is indeed one of those must read books and you will be pleased to know it has been translated into English a number of years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imaam Shaikh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah also wrote a monumental work on the subject of understanding the differences of opinion amongst scholars titled, <i>‘Raf al-Malaam Ann Ai’matul A’laam’</i> as have other Scholars from the likes of Shaikh Shaah Waleeullaah Dehlawee and Shaikh Muhammad Hayaat Sindhee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the reasons they have mentioned are that the scholars are unaware of the other ahadeeth or narrations, another reason is if they were aware they believed their position was stronger, another reason is that they may have been unaware of the authenticities of such reports and or the authenticity of opposing reports and this leads onto another reason and that is that the scholars of fiqh or compilers of such books on fiqh were not strong in the verification and research of ahadeeth but rather their expertise was more focussed on the interpretation, interpolation and elucidation of these sacred texts. The above narration is a prime example of this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> It must also be noted here and we find this extremely interesting and that is it is often said and re-iterated and this article that was shared with us is a pertinent example that the 2 opinions from Imaam Ahmad are below the navel or above the navel and this is what Shaikh Noor ud deen has mentioned in <i>‘al-Waadhih Fee Sharh Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee’ </i>baring in mind this was at least as early as the 7th century of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Unfortunately there are those who are from amongst us, who for some strange and odd reason lack the vision and insight into such issues and say, “well only the words above the navel has been mentioned from Imaam Ahmad as his opinion and therefore this does not mean on the chest so why do the Salafis and the Ahlul Hadeeth say Imaam Ahmads opinion was to place the hands on the chest.” This is a very common point made by such “madhabees” they also say in a different way above the navel does not mean on the chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In answer to this weak point Imaams Ahmad position was to place the hands on the chest because the evidence used for placing the hands above the navel is the hadeeth of Wail ibn Hujr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) which mentions on the chest. So this shows every time the wording above the navel is cited as Imaam Ahmads position, it should by default denote on the chest as this was the understanding of the explainer of <i>Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee</i> ie Shaikh Noor ud deen as he used the hadeeth of placing the hands on the chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore according to some opinions anything above the navel means the chest and this is well known according to the usoolee scholars and the linguists. So the defining line and distinguishing sign is the belly button ie the navel, below or above it and in this way the navel becomes the line of demarcation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is most pertinent and extremely interesting to note a cunning and deceptive ploy by our madhabee brethren in that they have now shifted their arguments and therefore now say placing the hands below the navel and also above the navel are both valid and correct opinions. They also say placing the hands them on the chest is something alien and an odd opinion. Similarly it also opposes the position of the majority of the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Previously they were (ie the Madhabees) vehemently opposed to anything above or on the navel and in recent times our beloved hanafee brethren have changed and refined their position after realising the strength and authenticity of the evidences presented and have now formulated a new argument that below the navel is good, above the navel is good and acceptable but just not on the chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This ploy according to them has been adopted in order to include the 2 varying opinions of the Hanbalee madhab according to their understanding that above the navel does not mean on the chest thereby increasing their numbers from just the hanafee madhab to now include the hanbalee madhab and to say to the Salafis and Ahlul Hadeeth that you guys now even oppose the hanaabilah, yet this is nothing but just distancing themselves from the truth and overlooking the divine sacred texts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A clear rebuking of this point is that numerous scholars and researchers from amongst the madhab of the hanabilah have done 1 of 2 things, the first is that they have adopted the opinion of the madhab which suggests according to their understanding of the hanbalee madhab that above the navel means the chest and therefore place their hands on their chests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly they may have simply adopted the stronger opinion based on the way of the Madhab of Ahlul Hadeeth that the ahadeeth mentioning the placing of the hands on the chest to be stronger and more authentic than the ahadeeth which mention the position of below the navel. There are numerous scholars from amongst the hanabilah who left and abandoned the position of their madhab in this issue and adopted the position of on the chest and there so many it seems daunting to mention them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Delving into the Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee we have yet another explanation titled, <i>‘Sharh az-Zarkashee A’la Matn al-Khiraqee’</i>which was authored by Shaikh Shams ud deen Abu Abdullaah Muhammad bin Abdullaah az-Zarkashee, who was Egyptian during the 8th century Hijree and he died approximately in the year 772H. So again this is an early explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaikh Zarkashee said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>“<i>and both of them placed below the navel” (Explanation) This is one report from (Imaam) Ahmad. From what Ahmad and Abu Dawood transmit from Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said, “It is from the Sunnah to fasten the palm(s) in the prayer below the navel.” And the definitive Sunnah is equivalent to the Sunnah from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam)</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i> </i><i>The second report (from Imaam Ahmad) and this has the most precedence (al-Afdhal)  is to place the hands below chest as is narrated from Qabeesah bin Hulb from his father who said, “I saw the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) he placed his hands on his chest” and Yahyaa ibn Sa’eed described this and said, “the right on the left above the joint.” Transmitted by Ahmad.</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i> </i><i>The third report (from Imaam Ahmad) one has a choice between the 2. This was adopted by Abee Moosaa and Abul Barkaat and his actions upon it has been reported. Abul Barkaat said, “and so from these narrations there is a wide scope in these 2 commands and there is no harm in anyone from amongst them. And Allaahs knows best.”</i> (Sharh az-Zarkashee A’la Matn al-Khiraqee (1/298) Edn 3rd 1430H/2009, Maktabah al-Asdee, Makkah, KSA)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>BENEFITS</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again essentially 2 opinions below the navel based on the narration of Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and this has been established and comprehensively elucidated to be weak due to a central problematic narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The saying of Shaikh Zarkashee below the chest is not problematic and just requires a little further comprehension and reasoning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Firstly</i></b> below the chest does not mean below the navel rather it means above the navel. It must also be noted Shaikh Zarkashee said back in the 8th century that this has precedence ie it is better to place the hands above the navel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Secondly</i></b> Shaikh Zarkashee uses the report of Hulb which categorically mentions chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Thirdly</i></b> he explains what he means by chest as he goes onto say Imaam Yahyaa ibn Sa’eed described ‘chest’ as being above the joint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Fourthly</i></b> the question what does the joint mean here? Well being open minded and not indulging into polemics that some will exhort to, it is most pertinent that they are answered before they create further confusion and that is the <i>‘Madhabees’</i>may say above the joint may mean placing the right hand on and over the joint of the left hand ie the palm of the right hand covers the back of the left hand, the wrist and the beginning of the forearm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> This is an incorrect notion as the word ‘fauqa’ (above) has been used denoting position in terms of height in relation to something else and if the meaning we have discussed above was intended, the word A’la (on) would have been used.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Fifthly</i></b> it could be strongly argued that Imaam Yahyaa ibn Sa’eed describing the narration of Hulb is doing so in specifying and clarifying what is meant and intended by chest and the author ie Shaikh Zarkashees by bringing his statement is also explaining his position where he said “below the chest.” So the joint here could mean and refer to the joint that occurs between the 2 sides of the ribs which is well above the navel and just below the chest in the general understanding of the word chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> We have also discussed previously the meaning of the word chest and what does some have opined it could refer to anything from the lower part of the neck to the navel.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="color: #993300;"><span style="color: #000000;">-&gt; &lt;-</span> Hadya al-Muslimin Fi Jam al-Arba&#8217;in Min Salah Khatim al-Nabiyin ﷺ <span style="color: #000000;">-&gt; &lt;-</span></span></em></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #993300;">A Gift to the Muslims with a Compilation of 40 Hadith of the Prayer of the Final of the Prophets ﷺ </span></strong></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai</em></strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated by</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">HOW TO PRAY THE FUNERAL PRAYER</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">HADITH NO.40</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Talha Ibn Abdullah Auf said, ‘’I prayed a funeral behind Ibn Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) and he recited Surah al-Fatihah (and he recited another Surah loudly) and he (Ibn Abbas) said “(I recited it loudly) to teach you this is the Sunnah.”</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>REFERENCES</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sahih al-Bukhari (1:178), the wording in the first set of brackets is from Nasa’i (1:281) and the wording in the second set of brackets is from Muntaqa Ibn al-Jarud p.188 no.534, 536.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>BENEFITS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. This hadith evidences and establishes the permissibility of reciting Surah al-Fatihah in the funeral prayer and the generality of the hadith, “There is no Salah without the recitation of Fatihah” also supports this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. </span><span style="color: #000000;">The recitation of Subhanaka Allahuma… wa Jalla Thanauka and the Darud Ibrahimi is not established from the Quran and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. If a companion uses the words ‘Minus-Sunnah,’ then it refers to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). (Refer to Sahih al-Bukhari (2:785) Sahih Muslim (1:472). This has also been mentioned in the books on the science of hadith. Muhammed Ibn Ibrahim al-Halabi said in ‘Qufu al-Athar Fi Sufu al-Athar’ (p.94). <em>“As for the statement of a companion ‘Minus-Sunnah’ whether it is in relation to a statement or action then it is understood to be marfu (ie raised to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) according to the majority and this is also the view of the early scholars from amongst our followers. This view was also adopted by the author of Bada’i al-Sana’i (Mulla Kasani) who was from amongst the later scholars.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4. It is also permissible to recite aloud in the funeral prayer as evident from Sahih Bukhari and Sunan al-Nasa’i and also silently as it relates from the hadith of Abu Umamah (Sunan al-Nasa’i (1:281) and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5. Raising the hands ie Raf al-Yadain with the Takbirs in the funeral prayer is established from Abdullah Ibn Umar and others (RadhiAllahu Anhuma). (Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (3:296).</span></p>
