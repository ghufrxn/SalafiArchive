<div class="entry">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>“</strong><strong>Oh, you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best [way].”</strong><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>at-Ta’a</strong> i.e., obedience means total obedience to Allah and his Messenger ﷺ and complete submission of every command. The Ulil Amr are the rulers who the people are agreed upon as their leader or ruler.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Abdullah b. Dinar said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">When Ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma witnessed people agree on the leadership of Abdul Malik he wrote, I hear and obey Abdullah b. Abdul Malik Amir al-Mu’minin according to the Sunnah of Allah and the Sunnah of his Messenger to the best of my ability and my sons have also done the same.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Obedience to them [rulers] entails hearing and obeying things that are liked and disliked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Abu Hurayah RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates from Allah’s Messenger ﷺ who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Whoever obeyed me obeyed Allah and whoever disobeys me has truly disobeyed Allah and whoever obeys the Amir (ruler) has verily obeyed me and whoever disobeyed the Amir (ruler) has truly disobeyed me.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">And another hadith narrated from him i.e., Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu mentions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">It is obligatory upon you to listen and obey the ruler in hardship and ease, in pleasure and displeasure, and even when another person is given preference [unduly] over you.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The words of the hadith, <em>‘Atharati Alayka’ </em>means to single something out which you had a right over. This hadith encourages and obliges us to hear and obey the ruler even If the leader is oppressive. The right to obey him needs to be fulfilled without rebelling against him or to replace him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">On the authority of Abdullah b. Amr RadhiAllahu Anhu from the Prophet ﷺ who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">A Muslim must listen and obey (the ruler) whether he likes it or dislikes, if he does not order sinning as there is no hearing or obeying if he orders you to sin.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The words of the hadith, <em>‘Fima Ahabba wa Kariha &#8211; whether he likes it or dislikes it.’</em> meaning whether he agrees or disagrees with it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">If the leader orders you or applies a ruling when there is a difference of opinion amongst the scholars, then it is impermissible to openly criticise him. If someone wishes to advise him, it should be done privately, and this is not for everyone. This is the duty of the well-known scholars, and it is not necessary that he accepts every advice. It is possible what he ordered might be to help his country.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">It is obligatory to obey the rulers in other matters they command and prohibit, and it is impermissible and unlawful to rebel against them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The Imam of Ahlus-Sunnah waʾl Jama’ah, Abu Muhammad al-Barbahari (d.329H) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Whoever rebels against a Muslim ruler is a Khariji, has caused dissent within the Muslims and contradicted the narrations and dies a death from the days of ignorance (Jahiliyyah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">It is impermissible to fight the ruler or to rebel against him, even if he oppressive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">There is no fighting against the ruler according to the Sunnah because there is destruction turmoil in the religion and worldly affairs.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided.”</strong><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The Rope of Allah according to Ahlus Sunnah wa&#8217;l Jama&#8217;ah includes and incorporates the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of Allah&#8217;s Messenger ﷺ just as it includes and incorporates sticking to the Jama&#8217;ah and its leader.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">On the authority of Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu who reported the Prophet ﷺ said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Verily Allah likes three things for you, and He disapproves three things for you. He is pleased with you that you worship Him and not associate anything with him, that you hold fast the Rope of Allah and not be divided, and He dislikes for in idle talk (gossip – It was said, and he said), asking to many questions and wasting of wealth.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">On the authority of Zayd b. Thabit RadhiAllahu Anhu from Allah&#8217;s Messenger ﷺ who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">There are three things the heart of a Muslim does not fetter from, sincerely performing actions for Allah, advising Muslim rulers and sticking to the Jama&#8217;ah of the Muslims since their supplications include others.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma transmits Allah&#8217;s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Whoever notices something he dislikes from his ruler, he should be patient, for whoever becomes separates a hand-span from the Jama’ah dies the death pre-lslamic period of Ignorance.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Muhammad b. al-Munkadir said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">When Yazid b. Mu&#8217;awiyyah was given the pledge of allegiance it was mentioned to Ibn Umar and he said, &#8216;We are content if there is good in it and we will have patience if there is harm in it&#8217;.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">There are numerous reports that corroborate this meaning, and they also encourage to abandon evil which leads to separation from the Jama&#8217;ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">On the authority of Hudhaifah b. al-Yaman, the people used to ask Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) about the good but I used to ask him about the evil lest I should be overtaken by them. So, I said, &#8216;Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)! We were living in ignorance and in an (extremely) worst atmosphere, then Allah brought to us this good (i.e., Islam); will there be any evil after this good?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Will there be any good after that evil?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Yes, but it will be tainted (not pure.)&#8217; I asked, &#8216;What will be its taint?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(There will be) some people who will guide others not according to my tradition? You will approve of some of their deeds and disapprove of some others&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Will there be any evil after that good?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Yes, (there will be) some people calling at the gates of the (Hell) Fire, and whoever will respond to their call, will be thrown by them into the (Hell) Fire.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah s Apostle! Will you describe them to us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;They will be from our own people and will speak our language.&#8217; I said, &#8216;What do you order me to do if such a state should take place in my life?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Stick to the group of Muslims and their Imam (ruler).&#8217; I said, &#8216;If there is neither a group of Muslims nor an Imam (ruler)?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Then turn away from all those sects even if you were to bite (eat) the roots of a tree till death overtakes you while you are in that state.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Trials and tribulations do not occur except when Allah&#8217;s commands are abandoned as He orders with the truth and patience. Trials and tribulations occur when either the truth or patience is abandoned.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">From the great principles of the religion is cooperation through uniting the hearts. Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them. It is they for whom there is an awful torment.</strong><strong>”</strong><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>“…So, fear Allah and adjust all matters of difference among you…”</strong><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">There are other textual examples in the Quran which command sticking to the Jama’ah, prohibit separation and differing. Those worthy of this principle are Ahlus Sunnah and whoever leaves this principle are the people of separation and division.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Imam Tahawi said while mentioning the beliefs of Ahlus Sunnah wa&#8217;l Jama&#8217;ah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">We do not rebel against our Imams or those in charge of our affairs even if they are oppressive, nor do we wish evil on them, nor do we withdraw from following them. We hold that obedience to them is obedience to Allah, the Glorified, and therefore obligatory as long as they do not order sin. We pray for their right guidance and ask for pardon for their wrongs.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Imam al-Barbahari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">If you see a man supplicating against the ruler, know that he is a person of innovation. If you see a person supplicating for the guidance of a ruler, then know he is a person of Sunnah In-sha-Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Fudayl b. Iyad said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">If I knew my supplication would be accepted, I would supplicate for the rectification of the ruler because a rectified ruler is rectification of the people and the nation.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Al-Barbahari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">We are ordered to supplicate for their (i.e., the rulers) rectification and not to supplicate against them even if they are tyrannical and oppressive, since their tyranny and oppression reflect only on themselves, but their rectitude is good on themselves and the Muslims.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">At-Tahawi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">We follow the Sunnah and the Jama’ah, we stay away from deviation, differing and divisions.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Al-Jama&#8217;ah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Jama&#8217;ah refers to the community of Muslims from the Companions, the Tabi&#8217;in (Successors) and those who followed them until the day of Judgement. Obeying them leads to guidance and opposing them is clear misguidance.  This leads and emphasises obeying the Muslim ruler, not rebelling against him, sticking to the body of the Muslims, staying away from misguided sects and the hypocrites who speak and appear like us but indeed they are more dangerous than the open enemy. Therefore, it is upon every Muslim in general and the specifically for every student of knowledge to acquire beneficial knowledge from the Quran and Sunnah and the statements of the pious predecessors to defend the authentic Aqidah, the pure religion, and the appointed rulers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Umar b. al-Khattab RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">There is no religion without the Jama&#8217;ah and there is no Jama&#8217;ah except with the ruler and there is no ruler except with obedience.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">As for commanding good and forbidding evil, the aim and objective is as Shaykh ul-Islam [Ibn Taymiyyah] mentioned,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">If trying to achieve righteousness through completing good deeds, commanding good and forbidding evil results in more harm instead of good, then it is impermissible.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">When advising the ruler, it is necessary to so with wisdom and good conduct for him to accept.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">On the authority of Iyadh b. Ghanam RadhiAllahu Anhu from Allah&#8217;s Messenger ﷺ who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Whoever intends to advise the ruler, should not do this openly but rather take him by his hand and advise him privately. It is good if he accepts, and if not, you have fulfilled your duty.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Some scholars are of the view if the ruler stops a scholar from issuing a verdict, the scholars does not have the right to issue it. Despite this, if he does issue a fatwa, he will incur sin. This is because legal verdicts are intended to rectify the hearts. For example, it is necessary for the ruler to scrutinize the heart doctor compared to the doctor of the body since he is more important for rectifying the heart and this example also applies to teachers (and scholars).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The Prophet ﷺ said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">Leave me as I leave you, for the people who were before you were ruined because of their questions and their differences over their prophets. So, if I forbid something, then keep away from it and if I order you with something, then do as much as you can. Agreed upon.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The honourable Shaykh Abdul Aziz b. Baz said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">It is not from the methodology of the Salaf to spread the sins of the ruler, mentioning them from the pulpits as this leads to turmoil and it prevents people from obeying them in righteousness. This leads to harmful matters and has no benefit. However, the way adhered by the Salaf was to advise the ruler, writing to them, or involving scholars who had connection with them, for them to change them in righteousness.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">As for abusing and cursing rulers and dishonouring them is not from the Manhaj of the Salaf. It is narrated by Anas b. Malik RadhiAllahu Anhu who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;">The major Companions of the Prophet ﷺ would prohibit us [from abusing and cursing the rulers] and said, do not abuse them, betray them, and have hatred for them, fear Allah and have patience as indeed the last affair is near.<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The first person who started the practise of abusing the rulers and dishonouring them was Abdullah b. Saba al-Yahudi the Yemeni. He portrayed Islam for himself and then travelled to Muslim lands like Hijaz, Egypt, Sham, Kufah and Basrah and incited people against Uthman that he seized Khilafah from Ali and looted wealth without right. He repeated the mantra and claim among people in the various lands that he was enjoining the obligation of commanding good and forbidding evil. This resulted in discoursing the reports of the fitnah and turmoil surrounding the murder of Amir al-Mu&#8217;minin Uthman b. Affan RadhiAllahu Anhu and this remains the case today in people discussing it. The knife with which (Ibn Saba) stabbed the Muslim Ummah could not be removed!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Some modern writers cannot understand the intricacies of these events and so they do not cease to speak ill of Muslim rulers in general and Amir al-Mu&#8217;minin Uthman b. Affan RadhiAllahu Anhu specifically because of the hypocrite Yahudi.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">This is the Aqidah of Ahlus Sunnah wa&#8217;l Jama&#8217;ah in the obligation of hearing and obeying Muslim rulers, not to rebel against them especially when the ruler and his appointed people call to adhering to the Quran and Sunnah and the authentic Aqidah which was adopted by the best people of this Ummah [i.e., Salaf us-Salihin]. When they command and order to establish the prayer and Islamic punishment, establish justice amongst the people, maintain safety and peace in the country, fight corruption and innovations, then it is obligatory on everyone under their rule to aid and obey them, to supplicate for their steadfastness and give them success and long lives.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">He was born in a hindu family in 1943 in Bilariyaganj, Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh in India. He was named Banke Ram. After converting to Islam he was called Imam ud-Din which he later changed to Dhiya ur-Rahman, a name he was well known with. Later he changed it again to Muhammad Abdullah al-A’zami.</span></p>

The sermon and the atmosphere left a lasting impression on them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sunnah linguistically means example or way. It is narrated in Sahih Muslim from Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“You would tread the same path as was trodden by those before you inch by inch and step by step so much so that if they had entered into the hole of the lizard, you would follow them in this also. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, do you mean Jews and Christians (by your words)&#8221; those before you&#8221;? He said: Who else (than those two religious groups)?”</em> (Sahih Muslim (4/2054)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And it is also transmitted in Sahih Muslim via Jarir ibn Abdullah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He who introduced some good practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being diminished in any respect. And he who introduced some evil practice in Islam which had been followed subsequently (by others), he would be required to bear the burden like that of one who followed this (evil practice) without their&#8217;s being diminished in any respect.”</em> (Sahih Muslim 4/2059)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Trans Note] This is a portion of a longer Hadith which states, <em>“Jarir ibn Abdullah reported that some desert Arabs clad in woollen clothes came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He saw them in sad plight as they had been hard pressed by need. He (the Holy Prophet) exhorted people to give charity, but they showed some reluctance until (signs) of anger could be seen on his face. Then a person from the Ansar came with a purse containing silver. Then came another person and then other persons followed them in succession until signs of happiness could be seen on his (sacred) face. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:</em> (as above) END</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith mentions the virtue and benefits of reviving the Sunnah, spreading it amongst the people and following and acting upon it ie the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another meaning of Sunnah is unpleasant appearance as it has been cited in Lisan ul-Arab that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) encouraged to give Sadaqah when an unpleasant looking (Sunnah) person stood up. (Lisan ul-Arab (13/224) of Ibn Manzur)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sahih al-Bukhari mentions the statement of Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu), </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Khubaib was the person who would pray 2 Rakahs of Sunnah for every Muslim who would die (ie killed unjustly).”</em> (Sahih al-Bukhari (6/166) and (10/28)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said as reported by Imam Malik in his Muwatta about the fire worshippers, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Adopt the way (Sunnah) with them, the way that is applied to the people of the book.”</em> (Muwatta (no.42), Imam Malik has transmitted this report via Jafar bin Muhammad from his Father from Umar bin al-Khattab (RadhiAllahu Anhu), however there is a disconnection in the chain because it is not established that Jafars Father, Muhammad met Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu). However taking Jizyah from fire worshippers is established from other narrations because they also believe in some book instead of the Torat or Injil. However, they distorted their book so much that they eventually forgot it themselves. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) ordered to take jizyah from them. The authentic hadith mentions the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) took jizyah from the fire worshippers of Hijr. For further details refer to Ahkam al-Quran (pg.54) of Imam ash-Shafi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning to take jizyah from the fire worshippers in the same way it is taken from the Jews and Christians. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said as occurs in Sahih Bukhari,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &#8220;The most hated person to Allah is person who seeks that the traditions of the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, should remain in Islam.&#8221;</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> (Bukhari (12/210) [Trans Note] This is part of a longer Hadith which is,</span><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &#8220;The most hated persons to Allah are three: (1) A person who deviates from the right conduct, i.e., an evil doer, in the Haram (sanctuaries of Mecca and Medina); (2) a person who seeks that the traditions of the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, should remain in Islam (3) and a person who seeks to shed somebody&#8217;s blood without any right.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Tirmidhi transmits from Abu Waqid al-Laithi (RadhiAllahu Anhu), when the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) travelled to Khaibar they passed by tree which was venerated by the mushrikin, called Dhat Anwat and they would hang their weapons on it. So some of the companions (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Oh Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) make for us a tree like the Dhat Anwa? Upon which the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) replied, “Allaahu Akbar! By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, verily these are the ways of the earlier nations. You have said exactly as the Banu Israil have said to Musa, &#8220;Make for us a god just as their Gods He (Musa) said, “Verily you are an ignorant people (7:138).&#8221; Certainly, you will follow the ways of those who went before you.&#8221;</em> (Sunan Tirmidhi (4/475), This Hadith is Hasan Sahih)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sunan Tirmidhi transmits another narration from Jarir ibn Abdullah (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) where the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whoever starts a good tradition which is followed, then for him is a reward, and the likes of their rewards of whoever follows him, there being nothing diminished from their rewards. And whoever starts a bad tradition which is followed, then for him is the sin, and the likes of the sins of whoever follows him, there being nothing diminished from their sins.”</em> (Sunan Tirmidhi (5/43), Musnad Ahmad (2/505), Imam Tirmidhi said, “This hadith is Hasan Sahih.”)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are numerous ahadith and reports which have been transmitted in this regard collated in the books of Jam’e, Sunan and Masanid and all of them allude to the linguistic meaning of Sunnah being a way and path. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also because the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) was given something along with the Quran and this was the pure Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muttalib bin Abdullah bin al-Muttalib narrates the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have not left any command which Allah ordered for you except that I have ordered you with and I have not left anything that Allah prohibited for you except that I ordered you with its prohibition.”</em> (Imam ash-Shaf’i has transmitted this, as cited in Bada’i al-Manan (no.7). However this report is mursal because al-Muttalib bin Abdullah bin Muttalib bin Hantab was a Tab’i.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith inferring a similar meaning has been reported from Hasan bin Ali (RadhiAllahu Anhu) that on the battle of Tabuk the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) ascended the Minbar and after praising Allah he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Oh people, I swear by Allah, I only order you with what Allah ordered you with and I only prohibit you what Allah prohibited you with, so be good in seeking sustenance, I swear the one whose hand the soul of Abul Qasim is in, sustenance seeks you just as death seeks you. If you find something hat is difficult then find it by obeying Allah.” </em>(Mu’jam al-Kabir (3/86). A narrator in the chain Abdur Rahman bin Uthman bin Ibrahim Hatibi and his father have been spoken about by Abu Hatim, however Ibn Hibban has included I his book of trustworthy narrtaors, ath-Thiqat (3/422) of Ibn Hibban.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This statement is one from amongst the commands which Allah has ordered his Messenger to spread and to propagate in the following words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;O Messenger, announce that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, and if you do not, then you have not conveyed His message. And Allah will protect you from the people.&#8221; (Surah al-Ma’idah:67)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah has testified in his following statement that the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) held firmly onto the command of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;And indeed, [O Muhammad], you guide to a straight path.&#8221; (Surah ash-Shura:52)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We find the way of the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) is in reality the way of Allah, which Allah ordered his servants to obey and to follow. Imams Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah transmit from Abdur Rahman bin Amr as-Sulami and Hajr bin Hajr, that both of them came to Irbadh ibn Sariyah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) and he was one of the companions from amongst those, whom this ayah was revealed about,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Nor [is there blame] upon those who, when they came to you that you might give them mounts, you said, &#8220;I can find nothing for you to ride upon.&#8221; (Surah at-Tawbah:92)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Irbadh ibn Sariyyah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“One day after prayer the Messenger of Allah, admonished us such that the eyes wept and hearts shuddered. A man said, “Indeed, this is a farewell speech, so what do you order us, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “I enjoin you to fear Allah, and to listen and obey your leader even if he is a slave from Abyssinia; verily, whoever lives among you will see many differences; beware of newly invented matters, for indeed they are misguidance; so whoever sees that must uphold my tradition (sunnah) and the tradition of the upright successors who are guided; bite onto it with you molar teeth.”</em> (Sunan Abi Dawud, Kitab as-Sunnah (no.4607), Sunan Tirmidhi (5/44), Ibn Majah, al-Muqaddimah (no.42), Sunan Darimi (1/57), Imam Tirmidhi said, “This hadith is Hasan Sahih.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Rajab said in <em>‘Jam’e al-Ulum al-Hikam’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This hadith commands holding onto the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Rightly Guided Khulafa firmly during times of discord and differences. The Sunnah is a path that is tread upon and this compromises holding onto the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the way of the companions with regards to beliefs, actions and statements and this is the complete Sunnah.”</em> (Jam’e al-Ulum al-Hikam (pg.230)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imams Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Darimi transmit with a Hasan chain from Miqdam bin Ma’di Yakrib (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Very soon a time will come when a person resting on a pillow, a hadith will be presented to him (as evidence), he will say &#8216;the Quran is sufficient for you and me, whatever is Haram and Halal in this book is indeed Haram and Halal&#8217;. For verily! What the moa makes unlawful (haram), it is like how Allah has made it haram.&#8221;</em> (Sunan Tirmidhi (5/38), Sunan Ibn Majah, al-Muqaddimah (no.12), Sunan Darimi (1/44). Imam Tirmidhi graded it Hasan Gharib.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the narration of Abu Dawud and Ahmad it is transmitted with the following words, The Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam), said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Verily, I have been given the Quran and something along with it, but the time is coming when a man will recline on his couch and say: Keep to the Quran, for whatever you find in it lawful is lawful and whatever you find in it unlawful is unlawful. Certainly, it is not lawful for you to eat a domesticated donkey, beasts with fangs, or the lost item of a citizen unless he no longer wants it. If people are visited by guests then they must be entertained, but if they do not do so then the guests have a right to take what is due from them.” </em>(Musnad Ahmad (4/131), Sunan Abi Dawud (5/12), its chain is Hasan.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith is an evidence that it is not necessary to present the Hadith on the Quran because the established and reliable hadith from the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) are evidences, proofs and worthy of a specific status in itself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imams Ahmad, Shaf’i and Tirmidhi transmit from Abdullah ibn Mas’ud (RadhiAllahu Anhu) in Marfu (Raised) form from the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) who said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“May Allah make radiant the man who has heard what I said and has preserved it in his memory until he conveys it to another.  Perhaps the one he conveyed it to has a better understanding than him.&#8221;</em> (Musnad Ahmad (1/437), ar-Risalah (pg.401) of Imam Shaf’i, Sunan Tirmidhi (5/34), who graded it Hasan Sahih.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And other variant routes of the hadith have been transmitted with the following words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“A Muslims heart should not be deceptive in three things, making actions sincerely for the sake of Allah, wishing and advising the Muslims with good and holding onto the Jama’ah because their supplications continue to protect them”</em> (Refer to Tadrib ur-Rawi (2/179), Qatf al-Azhar al-Mutanasirah Fil Akhbar al-Mutawatirah (no.2)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith has reached the level of mutawatir because more than 30 companions narrated this from the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) and this Hadith is regarded from amongst those profound ahadith which evidences the preservation and collection of the Prophetic Sunnah, learning them and conveying them to people. (Our respected teacher, Allamah Abdul Muhsin al-Abbad (Hafidhahullah) has authored a very beneficial book in relation to the verification and explanation of this Hadith which is printed with the title, “Dirasah Hadith Nadharallah Amra Sam’e Maqalati…Riwayah Wad Dirayah.”)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) supplicated  to make the individual radiant who emphasis the teaching and preservation of the Prophetic Sunnah. Radiant (Nadharat) here means to make his face glow and to beautify it. Radiance (Nadharat) also means that Allah guides him to the blessings of Paradise. (May Allah make us from amongst them, Amin).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Shaf’i said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) telling his Ummah to hear his ahadith, to memorise them and then to propagate is evidence that this is the thing he ordered to propagate by which proof against an individual can be established that dawah was given to him. This is because the dawah can only be given based that which established to be halal from the moa, that which is to be abstained from, actions that require legal punishment, affairs of this world and the hereafter&#8230;&#8221;</em> (ar-Risalah (pg.402-403) of Imam Shaf’i)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated, Compiled &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah ordered the obedience of his Messenger (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) in the Glorious Quran and he made this compulsory for all of the Muslims. Allah says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And whatever the Messenger has given you &#8211; take; and what he has forbidden you &#8211; refrain from.”</strong> <strong>(Surah al-Hashr:7)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And obey Allah and the Messenger that you may obtain mercy.</strong><strong>” (Surah Aal-Imran:132)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“O you who have believed, respond to Allah and to the Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life.” </strong><strong>(Surah al-Anfal:24)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“He who obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah” (</strong><strong>Surah an-Nisa:80)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This proves that Allah declared obedience of his Messenger to be obedience to him  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Kathir said in explanation of the last ayah cited above,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Allah states that whoever obeys His servant and Messenger, Muhammad, obeys Allah; and whoever disobeys him, disobeys Allah. Verily, whatever the Messenger utters is not of his own desire, but a revelation inspired to him.” </em>(Tafsir Ibn Kathir (2/319)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Say, [O Muhammad], &#8220;If you should love Allah, then follow me, [so] Allah will love you and forgive you your sins.”</strong><strong> (Surah Aal-Imran:31)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah declared the obedience of his Messenger a criterion for loving him. This is because Allah revealed the Quran in general and relegated its explanation and clarification to his Messenger. Hence the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) explained the Glorious Quran by his statements, actions, character and silent tacit approvals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is has been further explained in the following ayahs,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them and that they might give thought.”</strong><strong> (Surah an-Nahl:44)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And We have not revealed to you the Book, [O Muhammad], except for you to make clear to them that wherein they have differed and as guidance and mercy for a people who believe.”</strong><strong> (Surah an-Nahl:64)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Shafi’e said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“There are different of ways the Quran makes bayan,</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">1) Some rulings of the din have been clarified in great detail therefore nothing else other than the Quran is required to explain them</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">2) The obligation of some rulings have been explained in the Quran in great detail, for instance the obligation of obeying the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam). However, the details of this obeying, who it is obligatory upon, when some of this obedience is looked into, when it is established and when it becomes absolutely obligatory are all aspects the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) explained in detail.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">3) Some rulings have been mentioned without a definitive text but just an indication – such aspects are explained and described from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam).&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And Allah has revealed to you the Book and wisdom and has taught you that which you did not know. And ever has the favor of Allah upon you been great.”</strong><strong> (Surah an-Nisa:113)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And he said in Surah Aal-Imran,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Certainly did Allah confer [great] favor upon the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom, although they had been before in manifest error.”</strong><strong> (Surah Aal-Imran:164)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In these ayahs Allah has mentioned The Book as The Glorious Quran and The Hikmah as the illustrious Sunnah. It should also be duly noted that it is better to equate Hikmah with the Sunnah of the Messenger than the Glorious Quran according to the understanding of the Arabic Language</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Shaf’i also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allah has mentioned The Kitab (Book) as the Quran and he mentioned Hikmah and I have heard every expert in the science of the Quran and noble personalities say that Hikmah refers to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam).”</em> (ar-Risalah pg.32-33)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah has negated the Iman (Faith) of the individual who does not hold the Beloved Prophet (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) as the judge in all of his affairs in the following Ayah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission.”</strong><strong> (Surah an-Nisa:65)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Ayah was revealed concerning az-Zubair (RadhiAllahu Anhu) as Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim and other Imams have transmitted from him. During the presence of the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) an Ansari quarreled with az-Zubair with regards to the Harra Canals which were used to irrigate the date-Palms and a contention arose. So both of them presented their case to the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam). The full hadith is,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“An-Ansari man quarrelled with Az-Zubair about a canal in the Harra which was used for irrigating date-palms. Allah&#8217;s Apostle </em><em>(SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam), </em><em>ordering Zubair to be moderate, said, “O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) first and then leave the water for your neighbour.” The Ansari said, “Is it because he is your aunt&#8217;s son?” On that the color of the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle </em><em>(SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam)</em><em> changed and he said, “O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and withhold the water till it reaches the walls that are between the pits around the trees.” So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle </em><em>(SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam)</em><em> gave Zubair his full right. Zubair said, “By Allah, the following verse was revealed in that connection”: <strong>“But no, by your Lord They can have no Faith until they make you (O Muhammad </strong></em><strong><em>(SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) </em></strong><strong><em>judge In all disputes between them.” (4.65) </em></strong><em>(The sub-narrator,) Ibn Shihab said to Juraij (another sub-narrator), “The Ansar and the other people interpreted the saying of the Prophet </em><em>(SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam)</em><em>, ‘Irrigate (your land) and with-hold the water till it reaches the walls between the pits around the trees,’ as meaning up to the ankles.” </em>(Bukhari as-Saqah (5/34), Sahih Muslim al-Fadha’il (4/1829)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Kathir said in his Tafsir,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Present your mutual differences and contentions upon the Book of Allah and The Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) and accept them as the judge and ruling.</em><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>If you should believe in Allah and the Last Day” (Suran an-Nur:2)</em></strong><em>. </em><em>So we find he individual who does not accept the decision of the Quran and Sunnah on contentious issue and nor does he refer and return back to them then he has denied and rejected Allah and the hereafter.”</em> (Tafsir Ibn Kathir (2/304)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ami al-Mu’minin Umar al-Khattab (RadhiAllahu Anhu) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Repel ignorance far away from the Sunnah.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abdur Razzaq transmits in his book, Musannaf from Abdullah ibn Mas’ud (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“The Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) of Allah cursed those ladies who practice tattooing, those who get tattooed, those who pluck their eyebrows and those who make space between their teeth for beautification, changing the creation of Allah.” This was reported to a woman from the tribe of Bani Asad called Umm Yaqub, who went to Ibn Mas’ud and said: What&#8217;s the truth about a narration that was reported to me from you that you cursed those ladies who practise tattooing, …etc. Ibn Mas’ud replied, “How can I refrain from not cursing someone the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) cursed…. And they are also cursed in the Quran..” Thereupon that woman said: I read the Qur&#8217;an from cover to cover, but I did not find that in it. whereupon he said: If you had read (thoroughly) you would have definitely found this in that (as) Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has said, “<strong>What Allah&#8217;s Messenger brings for you accept that. and what he has forbidden you. refrain from that.&#8221; (Surah al-Hashr:7) </strong>The lady said, “Yes I have read this.” Then Abdullah ibn Mas’ud said to her, “The Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) has prohibited this and Allah said, <strong>“It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error.”</strong><strong> (Surah al-Ahzab:36)</strong>” (Muslim (3/1678), Summarised in Bukhari (10/377)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This proves the statements of the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam), whether they are commands or prohibitions-fulfilling his commands is in essence fulfilling the command of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Indeed, those who pledge allegiance to you, [O Muhammad] &#8211; they are actually pledging allegiance to Allah. The hand of Allah is over their hands.”</strong><strong> (Surah al-Fath:10)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah informed the companions (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) giving allegiance to the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) is in reality pledging allegiance to Allah because Allah is the one who sent Muhammad (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) as a Messenger, as a guide and bearer of glad tidings and revealed the Quran and Hikmah to him. This Hikmah is known as the Sunnah which is an explanation and clarification of the Quran, its meaning and understanding as Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned in Aqidatul Wasitiyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Darimi transmits from Sa’id ibn Jubair, one day he narrated a hadith of the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) and a person said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Quran opposes what you are saying.” Sa’id ibn Jubair said, “Listen, I am narrating a hadith of the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) to you and your trying to mention an apparent contradiction from the Quran, remember the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) knew the Quran better then you.”</em> (Sunan ad-Darimi (1/145), Bab Sunnah Qadiyyah Ala Kitabillah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the reason why Yahya ibn Kathir said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Quran can be explained by the Hadith but the Quran does not explain the Hadith.”</em></span></p>
