				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>by </strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Shamil in an article attempted to prove Shaykh Irshad al-Haq distorted the words of as-Samarqandi in his article <strong><em>Did as-Samarqandi say rafay yadain nullifies salah? (Irshad ul Haq Athari’s tahreef)</em></strong> on Hanafiyya wordpress and Darul Tahqiq copying them, published it on their site. I did not expect this level of presentation for this unwarranted allegation of tahrif, and even they know it’s not tahrif.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Shamil’s scathing allegation is that Shaykh Irshad distorted as-Samarqandi’s words and put words into his mouth while he in turn was quoting Imam Abu Hanifah! So, merely on account of this, Ahmad Shamil echoes this charge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9828 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-cov.jpeg?resize=386%2C636" alt="Nawazil cov" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-cov.jpeg?resize=182%2C300 182w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-cov.jpeg?w=698 698w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9830 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?resize=398%2C600" alt="Nawazil 49" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?resize=199%2C300 199w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?resize=768%2C1158 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?resize=679%2C1024 679w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?w=832 832w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You can clearly read Shaykh Irshad saying, “<em>Faqih Abu Layth as-Samarqandi has clearly written…” </em> because as-Samarqandi did write this in his book. Shaykh Irshad chose the words <em>“has clearly written”</em> opposed to <em>“he clearly said”.</em> So, Shaykh Irshad was very precise in what he was implying. However, the brother missed this point because he was too busy juggling the word <em>“Tahreef”</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9823 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/irshadul-haq-athari-1.jpg?resize=484%2C313" alt="irshadul-haq-athari 1" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/irshadul-haq-athari-1.jpg?resize=300%2C194 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/irshadul-haq-athari-1.jpg?resize=768%2C497 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/irshadul-haq-athari-1.jpg?w=900 900w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secondly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says, <em>“Also one must note that as-Samarqani quoted it saying </em>روى عن <em>which is </em><em>“</em><em>sighah al-tamreedh</em><em>”</em><em> and a way to point towards weakness of the narration.”</em> So, if as-Samarqandi alluded to its weakness it means he was in doubt of its attribution to Imam Abu Hanifah. However as-Samarqandi is the one who transmitted it to the world and the readers. So, If Shaykh Irshad al-Haq was also aware of this sighah, it would be natural for him to say “<em>Faqih Abu Layth as-Samarqandi has clearly written.” </em>So, is this your appreciation of Shaykh Irshad al-Haq for not attributing this statement to Imam Abu Hanifah and giving him the benefit of doubt?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9824 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fatawa-al-nawazil-asal.jpg?resize=536%2C220" alt="fatawa-al-nawazil asal" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fatawa-al-nawazil-asal.jpg?resize=300%2C123 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fatawa-al-nawazil-asal.jpg?resize=768%2C314 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fatawa-al-nawazil-asal.jpg?w=799 799w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says, <em>“In his work Irshad al Haqq Athari in asserting that scholars of the four established schools of Islamic fiqh have gone to extremes in issues of furoo’..” </em>Shaykh Irshad summarised as-Samarqandi’s speech and you clearly see this from the Urdu summary of the Arabic. Ahmad Shamil clearly knew this, this is clear like the day, yet he wanted to pass this off as a tahrif of the Shaykh. This is common when quoting lengthy passages as the point is to usually convey the intended meaning or comprehension. Surely as Muslims we should know better.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fourthly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is clearly a view which as-Samarqandi believed in. He first says, “Qalu” as in they say, meaning the elders and authorities of the Hanafi madhhab and that this is their view and by default also his. He mentions these scenarios and reasons in which the Hanafis can pray behind the Shafi’s. He then proceeds to mention raising the hands also nullifies the prayer, the only difference this time is that he mentions it through Makhul from Imam Abu Hanifah. So the question is, did as-Samarqandi hold this view? Yes, of course he did. What is the problem then when Shaykh Irshad said, “<em>Faqih Abu Layth as-Samarqandi has clearly written.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fifthly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says, <em>“What he has done here is to put into the mouth of a seasoned Hanafi jurist what he merely stated as a report from Imam Abu Hanifa through Makhul an-Nasafi.” </em>This is a very poor line or argument to begin with. It would make more sense to have said this was Imam Abu Hanifah’s view because he is “the most seasoned Hanafi jurist” and it would further support and strengthen Shaykhs Irshad’s view and the point he was trying to make. Why would he settle for a lesser point. Obviously this does not make sense.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sixthly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are not concerned with what other Hanafi scholars have had to say about his issue, as this is an internal matter for the Ahnaf to deal with. He said, <em>“Shaykh al-Lucknawi has mentioned the names of multiple renowned jurists who have not accepted that word.” </em>This is besides the point and what al-Lucknowi or others said. This is a matter for your house to resolve. In fact, al-Lucknowi offered a detailed discussion in <em>as-Si’ayah fi Kashf ma-fi Sharh al-Wiqayah</em> (2/150-151), (Deoband: Maktabah Shaykh ul-Hindh, Faisal Publications, 1427H).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He does refute this incident in his <em>al-Fawa’id al-Bahiyyah fee Tarajim al-Hanafiyyah</em> (1/401 under no. 244) (Riyadh/ Cairo: Dar Ibn al-Qayyim/Dar Ibn Affan, 1441/2020) and alludes to it elsewhere under Makhul’s entry in detail. (<em>al-Fawa’id al-Bahiyyah </em>(2/197 no.479).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And did the brother not read in <em>al-Fawa’id al-Bahiyyah fee Tarajim al-Hanafiyyah</em> how Amir Katib al-Itqani attributed this view to Imam Abu Hanifah from Makhul (1/194 no.90). So, it was your own scholars who continued to use this report for centuries even until Amir Katib’s time. So, a sharp exit through al-Lucknowi is not as honourable as you might want to think.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The contention was a Hanafi jurist and mufti held this view, the view of raising hands nullifies the salah and thus the salah of the Hanafi behind the Shafi&#8217; is null and void, this was the point. It would be pointless to even share books which Hanafi scholars wrote advocating raising hands in prayer. This is not the discussion brother.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To then conclude, Shaykh Athari summarised as-Samarqandi’s words and mentioned the issue of the prayer being invalid if the hands were raised. As-Samarqandi held this view himself as he mentions it with the discussion when a Hanafi can pray behind a Shafi&#8217; and that before him al-Makhul attributed this view to Imam Abu Hanifah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us take a moment here and ask, was it not as-Samarqandi’s work which mentioned the following while transmitting from Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There will light be after the Prophet and his kunyah will be Abu Hanifah and he will revive the religion of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam<em>.</em> Anas RadhiAllahu Anhu said Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, there will be a man at the end of times with the kunyah Abu Hanifah who will revive the religion of Allah and my sunnah… (<em>an-Nawazil </em>(p.378) (Hyderabad: Matba’a Shams al-Islamiyyah, 1355H/1936).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9831 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-p378.jpeg?resize=407%2C626" alt="Nawazil p378" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-p378.jpeg?resize=195%2C300 195w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-p378.jpeg?resize=665%2C1024 665w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-p378.jpeg?w=762 762w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whether this addition is not from the author or if someone else added it, it has remained in his book, read and seen since its publication, and this edition was published around 1936, i.e for almost 90 years. Is this not a distortion of the religion?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Honest and sincere advice would be to rectify your own house before accusing others of distortion!</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>AYĀT FROM THE QURĀN ON THE CREED OF THE SALAF. </strong></span></h4>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Indeed your Lord is Allāh, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty).</strong><strong>[Al-Arāf:54]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Surely, your Lord is Allāh Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty), disposing the affair of all things. </strong><strong>[Yūnas:2]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Allāh is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then, He rose above (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty). [Ar-Rʿad:2]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawa) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty) </strong><strong>[Taha:5]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six Days. Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). The Most Gracious (Allāh)! Ask Him as He is Al-Khabîr (The All-Knower of everything i.e. Allāh). </strong><strong>[Al-Furqān 59]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Allāh it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six Days. Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Walî (protector or helper) or an intercessor. Will you not then remember (or receive admonition)? </strong><strong>[As-Sajdah:4]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, and what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. And Allāh is the All-Seer of what you do. </strong><strong>[Al-Hadīd:4]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ISTIWĀ’ WITH THE MEANING OF ‘IRTIFĀ’ TO BE HIGH AND ABOVE.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is recorded in the Sahīh of Al-Bukhārī in the book of Tawhīd, chapter of ‘His Throne Was Above The Water<em>’</em> from <em>Abū Ālīyah that, “His saying “He rose above the heavens” meaning ‘Irtifā’ [he rose].” Mujāhid said it means “He rose high/above’ his Throne” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Ḥajr says <em>“Abū ʿĀlīyahs report has been cited by Ibn Jarīr in mawsūl via the route of ʿAbdullāh bin Jʿafar’s from his father from Abū ʿĀlīyah and Mujāhids report has been transmitted by al-Faryābī in his Tafsīr in mawsūl via the route of Warqā from Ibn Abī Najīh from Mujāhid.”</em> [Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī [22/427] and Fath al-Bārī of Ibn Ḥajr [17/176]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Imām Ishāq Ibn Rahawaihah states that he he heard from numerous specialist explainers of the Qurān that the meaning of <strong>“</strong><strong>The Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawā) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)”</strong> <em>“is that ‘Irtifā’ he rose/above.”</em>  [Jalāl ud-Dīn al-Qāsmī, Tafsīr Maḥāsin ut-Tā’wīl [7/2703]</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>TO SAY ‘ISTAWĀ’ [HE ROSE ABOVE] MEANS ‘ISTĪLĀ’ [HE CONQUERED] IS TOTALLY INCORRECT. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ismāʿīl al-Harawī narrates in his book <em>‘al-Fārūq’</em> with a chain of transmission from Dawūd bin Khalf that he was with Muḥammad bin Ziyād al-Lughawī when a man asked him about the ayah <strong>“</strong><strong>The</strong><strong> Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawā) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)</strong><strong> [Ta-ḥa 4].” </strong><em>He replied, “We accept it as he has informed us. The man said it means “he overcame and conquered [Istawlā].” al-Harawī replied, “Istawlā would only be correct if head any competitor or challenger to overcome so this cannot be correct.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad bin Aḥmad bin Naḍr al-Azdī transmits that he heard from Muḥammad bin Ziyād Al-Lughawī who said that <em>“Aḥmad Bin Dawūd enquired of me whether I could investigate whether the word “Istawā’ [he rose] has ever been recorded in the Arabic language as “Istawlā [He conquered]? I replied, “I swear by Allāh that I searched for this and could not find it in any place.”</em> [Fath al-Bārī of Ibn Ḥajr [17/177]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, the Hāfiẓ Ibn Qayyīm has recorded in his monumental work <em>‘As-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah’</em> over 42 replies to rebut the fact that ‘Istiwā’ in this verse does not mean ‘He conquered or overcame’. From amongst these are:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The third response is that al-Khattābī mentions in his book ‘Shiʿār ud-Dīn’ that, “Some have considered that Istiwā here means he overpowered basing this on some lines of poetry and these are not such that they can be used an evidential basis. If it meant as they say that he overpowered/conquered then this would render the verse confusing as Allāh’s knowledge and power is all encompassing then why would he need to ‘conquer’ his Throne whilst this is the case? The word ‘istawlā’ he overpowered would only be used for one who was stopped from something and then through struggle he achieved success by overpowering. So what is it that they say was ‘stopping or restricting’ Allāh? So these are the words of Al-Khattābī who was from amongst those who were known as a linguist.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,<em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The fifth response is that to say as they say falls under the forbidden action of explain the Qurān based on one’s own intellect. No Companion OF Muhammad, a successor of theirs or any scholar of the Muslims [mufassirs] have explained as they have. Let them know that Muhammad the prophet said that ‘let him take a seat in the fire of hell who explains the Qurān with his own opinion.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The tenth response is that the words ‘istawā’ and ‘istīlā’ have not been considered interchangeable in use by the scholars of the Arabic language and this is due to the reason that they both have distinct and separate features and meanings. Those who claim other than this are lying. Research the Qurān, Sunnah and Arabic language and syntax and you will never find that the word ‘istawā’ has come in the meaning of or interchangeable with ‘istīlā”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The fifteenth response is that Imam Abūl Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī has recorded a consensus that to take ‘istawā’ with the meaning of ‘istīlā’ is wholly incorrect.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The twenty seventh response is that the one amongst the creation who knows most about his lord is prophet Muhammad who has described in numerous traditions that Allāh is high and above and these traditions are an evidence of the explanation of such ayat”</em> [Mukhtaṣar as-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah, Muhammad al-Mawṣalī [2/321-326]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some have figuratively attempted to explain (Tāwīl) the fourth ayah and said that ʿAla is the action (Fʿil) and ar-Rahman is the one who does the act (Faʿil) and the Faʿil of Istawa is the ʿArsh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zarkashī refutes this (Tāwīl) and says, <em>“This is refuted from two angles the first is that the mu’awil (the one who did the tāwīl) made the attribute into an action and all of the scripts of the Qurān in Shām, ʿIrāq and Ḥijāz have ʿAla as a harf and if this was Fʿil (ie action) it would have been written with a Lām and ālif like for example at another instance it says, “Walʿalā Baḍuhum ʿala Bʿaḍ. The second reasons is the mu’awil rendered ʿArsh as marfū whereas none of the reciters ie Qura recite it like this.” </em>[Zarkashī, al-Burhān Fī ʿUlūm al-Qurān [2/81]  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the third reason is that it will contradict the other ayahs.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THOSE AYAT WHICH MENTION ALLĀH BEING ‘ISTAWĀ’ ABOVE THE HEAVENS. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything. </strong><strong>[Al-Baqarah:29]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2] </strong><strong>Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: &#8220;Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.&#8221; They both said: &#8220;We come, willingly.” [Fuṣilat:11]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already recorded the narration from <em>Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī</em> from Abu ʿĀlīyah that ‘istawā means he rose high above.’ In fact Ibn Qayyīm quotes an Ijmāʿ consensus that <em>“The meaning here is he rose high above.”</em> [Mukhtaṣar as-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah [2/320]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Baghawī explains the above ayat in his <em>‘Tafsīr Muʿālim ut-Tanzīl’</em> notes on Khāzin’ states, <em>“Many explainers of the Qurān from the Salaf and Ibn ʿAbbās explain this ayat to mean he rose above.”</em> [Tafsīr Muʿālim ut-Tanzīl [1/37]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Jarīr whilst explaining the above ayāt in his Tafsīr states in his Tafsīr <em>‘Jāmʿe ul-Bayān’</em> that, <em>‘The true meaning of the verse <strong>‘</strong></em><strong><em>He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything </em></strong><strong><em>[Al-Baqarah 29]</em></strong><em>’ is that he went high and rose above. Allāh showed his wisdom in creating the heavens and the earths. It is very strange that those who oppose this go against what is understood by the language of the Arabs, that is, he rose and was high. They prefer such meanings as they themselves give thinking that they will escape giving the verse a meaning which is not befitting to Allāh according to their own intellects. In fact, if he were to consider carefully his own explanation then in it he will find that which he was trying to avoid, for example, if he says istawā means he ‘turned towards/observed’ the heavens then we reply, was he ‘not observing/turned away’ from the heavens that you say he had to then ‘turn towards’ them? And if he replies, yes to this then we ask what is it that you base this on? In reality, his explanation causes more conflict and confusion and this is the very thing that he aimed to avoid in the first place. Praise be to Allāh I this way we reply to all those who oppose the truth and deviate from the true understanding of the Qurān. Abū Jʿafar said, that if someone were to ask us whether Allāh’s istiwā towards the heavens was before the heavens were created or after? Then we reply, it was after the heavens were created but Allāh said before he created the seven heavens that ‘</em><strong><em>Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: &#8220;Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.&#8221; They both said: &#8220;We come, willingly.’</em></strong><em> [Fussilāt 11]. </em><em>So the istiwā was after the creation of the smoke but before the formation of them into seven heavens. </em><em> </em><em>In regards to the word in the verse ‘Fasawwahunna’ i.e., [he made them] then this means that he created and originated them. He made them as he willed with perfection and suitability.  In Arabic ‘taswiyah’ means to make something correct and suitable, as it is said in the language ‘so and so made such a thing suitable’. So Allāh created the heavens in a most suitable way as he willed and planned and when they close he opens them as per his will.”</em> [Tafsīr at-Ṭabarī [1/192]</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE MENTION OF THE ‘GREAT THRONE’ OF ALLĀH. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] But if they turn away, say (O Muhammad): &#8220;Allāh is sufficient for me. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), in Him I put my trust and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne. </strong><strong>[At-Tawbah:129] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2] </strong><strong>And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. [Hūd:7]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[3] Had there been therein (in the heavens and the earth) âlihah (gods) besides Allāh, then verily both would have been ruined. Glorified is Allāh, the Lord of the Throne, (High is He) above all that they attribute to Him! [Al-Anbiyā:21]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[4]   </strong> <strong>Say: &#8220;Who is (the) Lord of the seven heavens, and (the) Lord of the Great Throne?&#8221; (86) They will say: &#8220;Allāh.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Will you not then fear Allāh (believe in His Oneness, obey Him, believe in the Resurrection and Recompense for every good or bad deed)?&#8221; </strong><strong>[Al-Muminūn:86-87]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[5] So Exalted is Allāh, the True King, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne! [Al-Muminūn:116]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[6] </strong><strong>Allāh, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne! [An-Naml:26] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[7] (He is Allāh) Owner of High Ranks and Degrees, the Owner of the Throne. [Al-Ghāfir:15] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[8] </strong><strong> Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted is He from all that they ascribe (to Him). [Az-Zukhruf:82]</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[9] </strong><strong>Owner of the Throne, the Glorious. </strong><strong>[AL-Burūj:16] </strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE MEANING OF ARSH [THRONE]. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the meaning itself of Throne is the indication of Allāh being high and above as is found in the verses and narrations. Then it should be known that Allāh being above his Throne shows he is above it and ‘bāin ʿanil Khalq’ separate and distinct from his creation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Bakr al-Ājurī said in his book <em>‘ash-Sharīʿah’</em> that, <em>“It is the madhab of the scholars that Allāh is above his Throne above the heavens. His knowledge encompasses all. He knows that which is in the heavens, earth and that which is beneath it. He knows that which is open and hidden. He knows that which is concealed in the chests and the deceitful eyes. He knows the affairs of the hearts and every beat it takes before it occurs. There is not a particle in the heavens or earth except that he is aware of it. He is above his Throne. He raises the deeds of the people up towards himself and he is aware of their deeds even more so than those angels whose duty it is to record such deeds.” </em>[Imām Abū Bakr al-Ājurī, ash-Sharīʿah [pg.288]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the first ayah above, <em>“It shows he is the originator and owner and this is why he is the owner of the great Throne. His Throne is a ceiling for all of creation including all of the heavens, earth and all that is what is between them. His knowledge is encompassing everything. His decree is upon everything and he is the creator of all.” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [2/404]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Tafsīr <em>‘Madārik ut-Tanzīl’</em> of Nasafī’ considers the ayah <em>“The Lord of the mighty Throne’ that the greatest of the creation was his Throne, which is a place of where duʿā is directed by those in the heavens.”</em> [Tafsīr Nasafī [2/152]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the second ayah above, <em>“Ibn Abbās (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhuma) said that the Throne was given this title as it is something which is high/above. Ismāʿīl bin Abī Khālid said he heard Sʿād Ṭā’ī say that the Throne is red/ruby in colour. Muḥammad bin Ishāq said concerning the verse <strong>‘And</strong></em><strong><em> He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds’, </em></strong><em>that, it is as he has described. There is nothing but water, upon this is the great Throne and above this is Allāh, the owner of all majesty and great, the wisest, the ablest and the one who is most merciful, wise all bountiful. He does as he wills and wishes.”</em> [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [2/437]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Nasafī states concerning the second verse, <em>“Meaning that his Throne was above the water, that is, before the creation of the heavens and the earth there was nothing but water beneath his Throne.”</em> [Tafsīr Nasafī [2/13]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is stated in <em>‘Tafsīr al-Futūhat al-Ilāhīyah lil Jamal’</em> that, <em>“He was where he is now, that is, above the seven heavens and the water was where it is now, that is, below his Throne.” </em>[Tafsīr al-Futūhat al-Ilāhīyah lil Jamal [2/382]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the fourth ayah above, <em>“He is the lord of the mighty Throne which is a ceiling for his creation. It is mentioned in the narration transmitted by Abū Dawūd that the prophet said ‘Your Lords status is the greatest and his Throne is above the heavens’. [after recording a few more narrations] Ḍihāk narrates from Ibn Abbās (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) that ‘it is called ʿArsh [Throne] due to it being lofty/high’. Aʿmash narrates from Kʿab al-Ahbār that the heavens and earth in relation to the Throne are as if a small lamp is lit hanging in between the heaven and the earth. Mujāhid states that ‘the heavens and earth in relation to the Throne are like a small ring which are left in a vast plain.” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [3/253]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the fifth ayah above, <em>“The Throne is a ceiling for the entire creation. It is called ‘ʿArshul Karīm’ [supreme Throne] as it is the most beautiful to look at greatest presence.  As Allāh has said ‘</em><em>And We send down water (rain) from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind to grow therein.’ [Luqmān:9]” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [3/259]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Nasafī states, <em>“It is called supreme Throne as all mercy from Allāh descends from there or that the closest most supreme angels surround it.” </em>[Tafsīr Nasafī [3/130]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Khāzin records that, <em>“Karīm, that is beautiful. Others have said it means high. It is recorded as such by Baghawī in his footnotes on Khāzin.”</em> [Tafsīr al-Khāzin [5/38]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shawkāni states in his <em>‘Tafsīr Fath al-Qadīr’ </em>that, <em>“It is called the supreme Throne because Allāh descends his mercy to his creation from it or it is supreme due to the fact that the one who is above it [the Throne] is the most supreme as it is said by the Arabs ‘the noble house’, meaning that the one who resides in it is noble.” </em>[Fath al-Qadīr [3/485]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the ninth ayah above, <em>“Glorious Throne, that is, he is the owner of the great Throne which is above all of creation.”</em> [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [4/496]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nasafī states, <em>“Glorious, that is, the creator of the Throne is the most glorious and greatest. Glorious here also refers to his Throne as well as himself. Meaning, that the one who is the owner of the Throne is even more Glorious than it.” </em>[Nasafī [4/346]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in Jalālayn it says, <em>“Glorious, that is, the owner and creator of the Throne is the most glorious. Glorious, meaning that the one who is completely deserving of the attribute of being highest and it is like this in ‘Jamal’ and ‘Maḥāsin at-Tā’wīl.”</em>  [Jalalayn [12/422], Jamal [4/515] and Maḥāsin at-Tā’wīl [18/6118]  </span></p>
