				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<h3><span style="color: #000080">Hadith No. 7443</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Yusuf bin Musa narrated to me: Abu Usamah narrated to me from Al-A&#8217;mash, from Khaythamah, from &#8216;Adiy bin Hatim who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;There is none amongst you except that his Rabb will speak to him, there will be no interpreter between them nor a veil to veil Him.&#8221; </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left">
<h3 style="text-align: left"><span style="color: #000080">Explanation of Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him)</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">And in this Hadith is a refutation of those that speak with &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217;¹, and its meaning is that Allah will introduce speech (yuhdithu al-qawl) in that Hour, He speaks to the one who is alone with him in that Hour, and those that speak with &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217; (i.e., the Asha&#8217;irah) say: &#8220;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi is eternal, however, Allah creates sounds when He wishes for someone to hear, and it is an expression from Al-Kalam An-Nafsi.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And on account of this, some of the intelligent said: The Madhab of the Asha&#8217;irah regarding the Speech [of Allah] is the Madhab of the Jahmiyyah, rather it is even worse! For verily they say that which is heard [in recitation] and that which is written in the Masahif is created, and it is [nothing more than] an expression from the [true] Speech of Allah, and as for the Speech of Allah then it is that which is in His Self, it is not heard and He does not speak when He wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the Jahmiyyah, then they said, &#8220;That which is heard is the Speech of Allah in reality, however it is created.&#8221; So who is closer to that which is correct? The Jahmiyyah, and this is the reason they said, &#8216;The speech of the Asha&#8217;irah regarding the Speech [of Allah] is worse than the speech of the Jahmiyyah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the reality of the matter, then there is no difference between them and the Jahmiyyah, for verily they are in agreement that what was heard by Muhammad ﷺ, and what was heard by Musa (Peace be upon him), and what will be heard in the future is all created. But the Asha&#8217;irah say that is an &#8216;Ibarah (Expression)² from Al-Kalam An-Nafsi, and these people say: &#8220;No! Rather it (the Speech of Allah) is a creation that He created, He created sounds which are heard, and He attributed them to His Self as a way of honouring and venerating.&#8221; &#8211; So this Hadith clearly refutes those that claim that the Speech of Allah is [just] the Meaning established eternally within His Self, and they have narrated that the Speech [of Allah] is like [His] Knowledge or [His] Will.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>(Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin, Sharh Kitab At-Tawhid min Sahih Al-Bukhari p. 437, 438,<br />
Dar Al-Kalim At-Tayyib, 1st Edn.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Translators Notes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>&#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi:&#8217; </strong>The Asha&#8217;irah reject that Allah has volitional actions (actions tied to His will), and this led to their belief in &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217;, the corrupt belief that Allah does not speak, rather the &#8216;Speech (Kalam)&#8217; is merely a single indivisible meaning which is established in His Essence &#8211; as for the Qur&#8217;an that we have with us which is written in the Mushaf and memorised by all Muslims, then it is <strong>created</strong> and merely an &#8216;Expression (&#8216;Ibarah)&#8217; of the Meaning which subsists within the Essence of Allah. Some went as far as claiming the Qur&#8217;an we have with us is the speech of Jibreel (Peace be upon him), rather than the Speech of Allah! Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;The Ash&#8217;ariyyah say: What is in the Mushaf is not the Speech of Allah, rather it is an &#8216;Ibarah (Expression) from Him [&#8230;] and these letters which are in the Qur&#8217;an, and the sounds which the Messenger heard, or Jibreel heard, verily it is created.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sharh Fath Al-Bariyyah bi-Talkhis Al-Hamawiyyah p. 314)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Madhab of Ahlus-Sunnah regarding the Speech of Allah: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu &#8216;Uthman As-Sabuni said, &#8220;And the Ahlul-Hadith testify and believe that the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah and His Book, and His Revelation, and that which He revealed is uncreated, and whoever speaks with its creation (i.e., that the Qur&#8217;an is created) and believes in it is a Kafir according to them.&#8221; <em>(Aqidatu&#8217;s Salaf wa Ashabu&#8217;l Hadith p. 165, Dar Al-&#8216;Asimah)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Muhammad bin Isma&#8217;il Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;I met more than 1000 men from the People of Knowledge: [From] the People of Hijaz, and Makkah, and Madinah, and Kufa, and Basrah, and Wasit, and Baghdad, and Sham (Levantine Region), and Misr (Egypt) [&#8230;] and I did not see one of them differ on these matters: [&#8230;] and that the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah, uncreated&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad of Imam Al-Lalaka&#8217;i 1/273-274, Dar Al-Lu&#8217;lua)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Abu Zur&#8217;ah and Abu Hatim Ar-Raziyayn said, &#8220;We reached the scholars of all the cities, in Hijaz, &#8216;Iraq, Sham, Yemen, and from their Madhab was: Al-&#8216;Iman is speech and action, it increases and it decreases, and the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah, uncreated from all aspects [&#8230;] and whoever claims that the Qur&#8217;an is created then he is a disbeliever in Allah Al-&#8216;Adhim, with a disbelief that removes him from the Religion, and whoever doubts his disbelief &#8211; from those that understand [this issue] &#8211; then he is [also] a disbeliever&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad of Imam Al-Lalaka&#8217;i 1/278-282, Dar Al-Lu&#8217;lua)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Ibn Battah narrated from Imam Ahmad who said, &#8220;And whoever says that verily Allah will not be seen in the Hereafter, then he is a Jahmi who has surely disbelieved&#8221; and &#8220;They will look at their Rabb, and He will look at them, and they will speak to Him, and He will speak to them, However He wills, Whenever He wills.&#8221; <em>(Al-Ibanah &#8216;an Shari&#8217;atu&#8217;l Firqatu&#8217;n Najiyah #47-48, Dar Al-Rayah)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Harb Al-Kirmani, companion of Imam Ahmad and Ishaq bin Rahuyah, transmitted consensus on this issue saying, &#8220;And the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah by which He speaks, uncreated, so whoever claims that the Qur&#8217;an is created then he is a Jahmi Kafir.&#8221; <em>(Ijma As-Salaf fi&#8217;l-I&#8217;tiqad p. 64, Dar Al-Imam Ahmad)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;Ahlus-Sunnah w&#8217;al-Jama&#8217;ah have agreed upon that Allah speaks, and His Speech is an Attribute in truth, established for Him in a manner which is befitting for Him. And He, Exalted is He, speaks with letters and sounds, however He wills, whenever He wills, and His Speech is an attribute of His Essence (Sifat Dhatiyyah) in terms of genus, and it is an attribute of action (Sifat Fi&#8217;liyyah) in terms of occurrences.&#8221;</strong> He commented on his own speech, explaining, &#8220;This is because it is connected to His Will, and every attribute connected to His Will is an attribute of action, and Speech in its essence is an attribute of the Essence, for verily Allah has not ceased and does not cease to be One that Speaks.&#8221; <em>(Sharh Fath Al-Bariyyah bi-Talkhis Al-Hamawiyyah p. 303, 304) </em></li>
</ol>
<p>² Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilani said, &#8220;So whoever claims that it (the Qur&#8217;an) is created, or an &#8216;Ibarah, or that the recitation is other than what is recited, or he says: &#8216;My articulation of the Qur&#8217;an is created&#8217;, then he is a disbeliever in Allah Almighty, he is not to be mingled with, or fed, or married, or neighboured&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Al-Ghunya li-Talibi 1/128, Dar Al-Kutub Al-&#8216;Ilmiyyah)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is correct that the one who intentionally abandons the prayer is a disbeliever and that his fast, as well as other acts of worship, are not correct (i.e., accepted) until he repents to Allah (Exalted is He), due to the saying of Allah, Mighty and Majestic:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُوا لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;But if they associated partners [with Allah], all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them.&#8221; </strong><em>(Surah Al-An&#8217;am, 6:88)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Additionally, the meaning of this Ayah is supported by numerous other Ayat and Ahadith which indicate that the actions (i.e., worship) of the one that abandons the prayer are fruitless. Some of Ahlul-&#8216;Ilm (the People of Knowledge) took the view that the one who acknowledges the obligation of the prayer, but leaves it off due to laziness and carelessness, then his fast and other acts of worship are not in vain (i.e., they consider him to be a Muslim). However, the first position is correct &#8211; the one who intentionally abandons the prayer is a disbeliever, even if he acknowledges its obligation, due to the numerous evidences for this position. From these evidences, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>&#8220;Verily between a man and between shirk (polytheism) and kufr (disbelief) is the abandonment of the prayer.&#8221; </strong><em>(Sahih Muslim no.82)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">and he ﷺ also said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><b>&#8220;The covenant between us and between them (the disbelievers) is the prayer, so whoever abandons it has disbelieved.&#8221; </b><em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi no.1621, Sunan ibn Majah no.1079, Sunan An-Nasa&#8217;i no.464, Musnad Imam Ahmad 5:346)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This hadith has been narrated by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa&#8217;i, At-Tirmidhi and ibn Majah through the path of Buraydah bin Al-Husayb Aslami (may Allah be pleased with him) with a sahih sanad (authentic chain of narration).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from ‘Ahkam wa Masa’il Ramadan’ (p.51,52)</em></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>TN</strong>: Imam Al-Sabuni mentions, <strong>&#8220;And the Ahlul-Hadith differed over the Muslim that intentionally abandons the obligatory prayer, so Ahmad bin Hanbal and a group from the scholars of the Salaf (may Allah have mercy upon them) made takfir of him on account of that, and removed him from Islam, due to the authentic narration: &#8216;Between the slave and between Ash-Shirk is the abandonment of the prayer.&#8217; And the way Ash-Shafi&#8217;i, his companions, and another group from the scholars of the Salaf took is that he has not disbelieved (major disbelief), as long as he continues to believe in its obligation.&#8221; </strong><em>(Aqidatus Salaf wa Ashabul Hadith p.279, Dar Al-&#8216;Asimah edn.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Shaykh ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;Verily he does not disbelieve except by abandoning the prayer permanently, meaning he has settled himself upon the abandonment of the prayer, so he does not pray Dhuhr, nor &#8216;Asr, nor Maghrib, nor &#8216;Isha, nor Fajr, then this is the one who has disbelieved. So if he prays one or two of the obligatory prayers, then he has not disbelieved, because this is not the one who has abandoned the prayer, and surely the Prophet ﷺ said, &#8216;Between a man and between Ash-Shirk and Al-Kufr is the abandonment of the prayer&#8217; and he did not say: &#8216;abandonment of a prayer.'&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sharh Al-Mumti&#8217; 2:27, Dar ibn Al-Jawzi edn.) </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Regardless, those that abandon a single prayer should be aware that they have fallen into a grave matter, Imam Adh-Dhahabi narrates that Ibn Hazm said, <strong>&#8220;There is no sin, after Shirk, more severe than abandoning the Prayer until its time ends and killing a Muslim unjustly.&#8221; </strong><em>(Kitab Al-Kaba&#8217;ir p.91, Dar Al-Mirath An-Nabawi edn.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And Allah surely knows best.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Debunking Yasir Qadhi(ism)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point by Point on Debunking Yasir Qadhi (ism) In light of his DISPATCH: Yasir Qadhi on Salafis and Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab, Science and Miracles, Yajuj and Majuj.</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Part 4</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Timestamp 1:00</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Host Mahin Says: I have heard, there is a guy in our WhatsApp group that calls him Sheikh ul-Islam of America, Ali al-Boriqi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Host SIM: oh Ali is very learned as well Mashallah that’s a huge compliment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Comment</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says in the glorious Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">[And they should consider that] when those who have been followed disassociate themselves from those who followed [them], and they [all] see the punishment, and cut off from them are the ties [of relationship], Those who followed will say, &#8220;If only we had another turn [at worldly life] so we could disassociate ourselves from them as they have disassociated themselves from us.&#8221; Thus will Allah show them their deeds as regrets upon them. And they are never to emerge from the Fire. (Surah al-Baqarah:166-167)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a prime illustration of how individuals like this Ali al-Boriqi, who are fanatical followers, fall into extremism, the very thing they irresponsibly accuse others of! This level of praise is if at all only for the major scholars of this Ummah. In fact, we don’t even find the students of the major scholars of our times referring to them with such loaded titles of eminence. How is then the case for someone who is only 45 and and has perhaps only studied Islamic sciences for around a decade, with most parts being centered on a corrupt methodological approach anyway.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We then see Yasir Qadhi at this moment of sheer humility letting off a smug smirk lasting for a good few seconds. There is obviously no uproar, nor a dare I say quote unquote remark, actually there isn’t even a weak sigh or gasp of dismay at the utterance of such a chilling testimony. This is Yasir Qadhi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Compare Yasir Qadhi to the humility of Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan. Yasir Qadhi during the course of the podcast stated that he started to deliver sermons when he was 16 and that he has been lecturing preaching and teaching for almost three decades and during this moment of enlightened self-amazement, he says “wow, Subhanallah” (Time stamp 11:15).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us now compare him to who the real scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah are, why? Because he has repeatedly asserted that the west should refer to the Scholars of the WEST. Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan was born in 1933 and in 1950 he was appointed as a teacher in a school in Buraydah. Therefore, Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan has been teaching the Islamic sciences, issues legal edicts ranging from creed to governance and so on for the best part of 69 years, yes dear readers 69 years. I am quite certain the intelligent person will see the enormous disparity between precision, depth and accuracy in the knowledge of Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan and the other scholars of our times and between the insignificant role Yasir Qadhi actually has in the West. Moving on, a scholar who has taught Islam, the true “strand” of Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah, Salafism or as Yasir likes to define as the Najdi Da’wah said the following when:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Questioner praises Shaykh Fawzan for his defence of the Islamic Aqidah and Shari’ah. He says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“May Allah show goodness to you, this questioner calls Allah to witness, as well as those present here, that he loves you for the sake of Allah, he asks Allah, The Exalted, The Most High that He forgives you, gives you Tawfiq and rewards you on Behalf of Islam and the Muslims, due to what you do in defending the Aqidah and the Shari’ah.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan replies:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Firstly we ask Allah that He loves you, just as you love us for His sake, as for your statement that I defend Islam, then in reality I am not of this rank. I am less than this, I am deficient and I Seek the forgiveness of Allah, however we hope in Allah, that he gives victory to Islam, a victory from Himself and He forsakes the enemies of Islam by his Honour and His Ability, may He Be Glorified, the Most High.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Example &#8211;  Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The questioner says: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah grant you good. How does one reach the level of knowledge possessed by Shaykh Ibn Baz and You?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan replies:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I don’t have knowledge! As for Shaykh Ibn Baz, yes he had knowledge, may Allah forgive him and have mercy on him. As for us, we are poor (in terms of knowledge) like you. However, it is obligatory upon us to learn.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allahu Akbar, May Allah have mercy on the noble Scholars Ahl al-Sunnah, just look at their humility and simplicity, a true sign of knowledge which leads to Taqwa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Third Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A host introduces Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan during a lecture and he continues to praise him for almost one and a half minutes. When Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan finally speaks he says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim, Alhamdulillah Wassalatu Wassalam Ala Rasullillah Wa Ala Alihi Wa Sahbi wa Man Wala, to proceed: Indeed, you have EMBARASSED me, where you have lifted me to a place I have not reached, I’m to say the least just a seeker of knowledge just like one of you. Rather, perhaps amongst you there are those who greater and more noble.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fourth Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yasir Qadhi goes onto mention his Islamic achievements that he wrote books and delivered lectures on this i.e in defence and propagation of the Najdi Da’wah, like Kitab al-Tawhid, Kashf al-Shubuhat and Qawa’id al-Arba’a and propagation of the Najdi Da’wah. He goes onto say I quote unquote:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Quote <span style="color: #ff0000;">“Dare I say to this day NOTHING (emphasis his) has been written in the English language that is more of an advanced defence of the Najdi da’wah then my critical analysis of shirk which is still available in the English language.”</span> Unquote (Timestamp, 12:50)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan was asked:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Allah has blessed you to author many books; are there any books you deem better?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: which books?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Questioner Your Books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: (with some concern) You want me to praise my own book? (The Shaykh chuckles)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: I deem all of my books to be weak.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fifth Example –Shaykh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A host introduces Shaykh al-Albani for approximately two and a half minutes. Shaykh al-Albani while following the Sunnah of Allahs’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam begins by reciting the Khutbatul Hajah. He then thanks the host for his words and praise and then says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I have no answer to it except to follow the example of the First Khalifah, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq RadhiAllah Anhu, who was the first and true Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. When he heard someone praising him, and it is my belief that no matter how much the one who is exaggerating in his praise (it was the truth) since he was the Khalifah of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam yet. (THE SHAYKHS STARTS CRYING from timestamp 4:29 until 5:00 and in between says Allahul Musta’an and then continues) Yet he used to say “Oh Allah don’t hold me responsible for that which say, make me better then that which they think of me and forgive me for that which they don’t know” (The Shaykh is still shaken and upset) This is what the great Siddiq said. What is there for us to say after him? So I say Following his example (while the Shaykh is still upset) Oh Allah don’t hold me responsible for that which say, make me better then that which they think of me and forgive me for that which they don’t know” The truth is and I say the truth, I am not the person that was described by our noble brother but I am merely a student of knowledge, nothing else.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Sixth Example –Shaykh Muhammad b. Saleh al-Uthaymin</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yasir Qadhi proudly claims he was the student of Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin, is this the case? I will scrutinise this claim later. Let us look at the humility of Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin. A host asks Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin if it was permissible for a person to recite a poem, so Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin grants them permission. He starts reciting:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“My Ummah after this night comes</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Dawn that its light spread across the world</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Good is awaited and the opening is soon</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the truth will be victorious despite of the efforts of evil</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By a revival that Allah has blessed</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That is pure and free of any defects</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as Ibn Saleh (i.e. Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin) is amongst us</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as Ibn Saleh is amongst us</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh of our revival</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With his likes we wish for support and victory</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin interjects and says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I do not agree with this line, no I do not agree because I don’t want the truth to be attributed to individuals. Everyone makes mistakes and if we attribute the truth to individuals and then that person dies, the people will fall into desperation. If you wish (i.e) change that line to “As long as we have the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of his Messenger” It would be better.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reciter then continues his recitation:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as we have the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of his Messenger</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Uthaymin…</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin then interjects again: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“No Oh Shaykh (like I just told you) Don’t say this, no no, stop, stop.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reciter continues and it seems like he does not understand what the Shaykh is trying to point out:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Jurist..</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin stops them and they say let us continue by the will of Allah. Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“No, by Allah I don’t want, no I am not joking, you only have this? Then ask your question. The poem was absolutely uncalled for. I advise you from now and after, not to tie the truth to men. Firstly, men can deviate even Ibn Mas’ud RadhiAllahu Anhu said: “Whoever is to follow someone then follow those who have passed away because those who are alive are not safe from trials.” If you attribute the truth to men a person could be deceived by himself, we seek refuge of Allah from that and adopt wrong ways. Therefore, I advise you not to attribute the truth to men. Firstly, a man is not safe, I ask Allah to make us firm, a man is not safe from mistakes and trial. Secondly, he will die, no one remains alive, “We granted not to any human being immortality before you then if you die, would they live forever (Surah al-Anbiya, 21:34). Thirdly the sons of Adam, humans may be deceived if he sees people honouring and flocking to him. He might be deceived, he might think he is infallible or claim that he is and believe everything that he does is the truth and that every path he takes is permissible. This could lead him to destruction, a man praised another man a the presence of the Messenger of Allah Salallahu alayhi Wsallam, The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam told him: Woe to you, you have cut the neck of your friend (his back). I thank the brother in advance though I have not heard what he says about me to what he expresses of his feelings towards me I ask Allah to make me as he best sees me no more but I don’t like being praised, I will reward you inshallah and so I ask Allah to reward you and to recompense you”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After these illustrative examples showing how our scholars displayed humility and how Yasir Qadhi displays the direct opposite. It would be most pertinent to remind the readers secondarily and Yasir himself primarily concerning the issue of Riya- the hidden shirk or polytheism. Yasir Qadhi is usually very quick in listing the names of his books relevant to the Sunni Salafi Aqidah but rarely if at all ever mentions his book on Riya – showing of. On page 43 of the book he mentions how the dangers of riya are the destruction of the Ummah and then on page 45 the love of praise and the most important on page 32, it increases misguidance. It seems likes Yasir Qadhi has not only left Salafism and the Najdi Da’wah but also the basic concepts of self rectification and personal purification of the soul and it is a must that he reads his book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly in this part I would like to leave the readers with words of Shaykh Abd al-Razzaq al-Badr where in he states and the aim to highlight the idea of being humble</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Mutarif ibn Abdillah ibn ash-Shik-kheer who was a scholar from Tabi’in, he saw a man wearing a cloak and walking or strutting boastfully. So, he said to the man: “Oh slave of Allah, this is the type of boastful walking or strutting of those whom Allah hates.” The man replied, “Don’t you know who I am? This man was wearing this beautiful cloak and his appearance was attractive and he was strutting, and someone has the nerve to speak to him in this manner?! Thus he replied, Don’t you know who I am?! Meaning if you knew who I was you would not speak to me like this. Mutarrif said: “On the contrary, of course I know who you are!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You started as a sprinkled drop of sperm</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You will end up as a soiled corpse</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in the meantime you are carrying faeces around (in your intestines)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So I know who you are</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the man went about his way and he no longer strutted and these words of Mutarrif taught this man some manners.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(YouTube: How to humble an arrogant person – By Shaykh Abdur Razzaq Al-Badr. Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee. Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv62pV2BOXw)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv62pV2BOXw)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The purpose of knowledge is that is saves a person from disobeying Allah and his Messenger. Allah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error. (Surah al-Ahzab:36)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hasan al-Basri said: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">there are two types of knowledge, one that which is in the heart which is beneficial knowledge. The second type of knowledge is that which is on the tongue which is Allah’s evidence against mankind. (Sunan al-Darimi, 1:350 no.374, Dar al-Tasil)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With this being said, it is first and foremost for us to be humble and know our status in terms of ilm. Secondly for my fellow Muslims, brothers and sisters to to sit back a little and realise that true scholarship, academia and knowledge is with the Rabbani scholars of this Ummah, their virtue and status is well universal and agreed upon. Thirdly, do not be naïve and let people play with your emotions and Islam, for indeed you alone are responsible for your actions when you have to stand before Allah without any leader, scholar or interpreter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the subsequent parts I will highlight many inconsistencies, contradictions and the true reality of Yasir Qadhi, InshaAllah.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Shaikh Muhammad Saleh al-Uthaymin</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What should a woman do when she is cleansed from menstruation or Post Natal Bleeding During the Day in Ramadan</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ANSWER</strong><br />
When a menstruating women becomes cleansed or after post natal bleeding during the day in the month of Ramadan then it is not incumbent upon her to abstain from food or drink but rather she is permitted to eat and drink because she has to make up that fast anyway. This was the view of Imam Malik, Shafi&#8217;i and according to one report the view of Imam Ahmad this is because it is narrated by Abu Mas&#8217;ud (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><i>&#8220;Whoever ate in early part of the day should also eat in the latter part.&#8221; </i>(Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah 2:310)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meaning whoever is permitted not to fast in the early part of the day is also permitted not to fast in the latter part of the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Majmu&#8217;a al-Fatawa wal Rasa&#8217;il p.95)</p>
