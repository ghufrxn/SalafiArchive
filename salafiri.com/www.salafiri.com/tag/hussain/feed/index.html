<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1326H &#8211; 1908c</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Muhammad Tanzil al-Siddiqi al-Hussaini</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Dr. Abu Nasr Fazal Hussain bin Qadi Farakh Hussain bin Qadi Wahid Ali bin Shah Ramadan Ali Ja’fari Mehdawani was a great scholar, an accomplished Doctor, writer and poet. He is the one who authored the biography of his illustrious teacher Shaikh al-Kul Mian Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi titled, ‘al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat’ and the book is well known due to him. He was born in the Mehdawan’s which was his ancestral residence. He lived in the Pakki Sarai area of Muzaffarpur.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Farakh Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Farakh Hussain possessed a lot of knowledge and was an expert in Arabic, Persian and Urdu. He was born in 1242H in the Mehdawans. He would indulge in Persian and Urdu poetry. He married three times, his first marriage was to the daughter of Shaikh Ja’far Faruqi of Bhawalpur. He had a son from this marriage and he was Shaykh Fazal Hussain. Qadi Farakh Hussain died in 1306H. (refer to, Kulliyat Fakhar: p.59, Tazkirrah Mehdawanu: p.34 and Tazkirrah Ulama Bihar: 2:204)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Birth of Shaykh Fazal Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Fazal Hussain was born on the 27<sup>th</sup> of Muharram 1271H corresponding to 1854H in the Mehdawans.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Seeking Knowledge</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He sought knowledge from Shaykh Muhammad Arif Peshawari and Shaykh Abdul Hamid Bihari. He later travelled to Delhi and sought knowledge from the Musnad of the time Shaikh al-Kul Mian Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi and studied hadith and tafsir with him. He also learnt medicine from Hakim Abdul Majid Dehlawi whilst in Delhi.  </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">After Seeking Knowledge</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He started to practise as a Doctor and was counted from amongst the accomplished Doctors of Bihar. He continued to reside in Muzaffarpur and and also set up his clinic there. He was also an avid writer and was a weekly columnist in the Weekly newspaper, ‘Taj’ which would be published in Patna.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Poet</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was very interested in poetry and would recite poems in both Persian and Urdu. He would use the poetic name of Hashr</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">His Books</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain wrote books on different disciplines some of them were,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(1) al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a biography of Shaykh al-Kul Sayyid Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi. This is considered to be Shaykh Fazal Hussains most important and famous work. It is approximately 367 pages and printed by Matba’a Akbari in Agra in 1326H/1908c and it has been reproduced a number of times thereafter. Dr. Muzaffar Iqbal said concerning this book, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This biography was authored based on modern principles and is worthy to be considered from the foremost of biographies in the Urdu language. The wording and presentation is highly reverential and the passages are clear, simple and continuous.”</em> (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857c until 1914c: p.200)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(2) al-Sufiyyah wal-Tasawwuf</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh mentioned this book himself in ‘Hayat Ba’dal Mamat’ when he wrote, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Sufiyyah wal Tasawwuf’ is a specific treatise I wrote wherein I discuss Tasawwuf in detail. The avid reader can thus distinguish and differentiate every claimant of Tasawwuf whether they are even actuals Sufi’s or not.”</em> (al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat: p.144).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the words of the Shaykh it is indicative this book was already published before al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat was authored. However, we have not seen this book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Tamaddun Arab Aur Hadith Afak (Arab Civilisation and the Hadith of Afak)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is a substantive and detailed answer to the well known French orientalist Museo Layban’s book, ‘Arab Civilisation’ wherein he attempted to misrepresent the hadith of Afak and other doubts. The columnist who reviewed the book in the newspaper, ‘Taj’ of Bankipur of Patna on the 27<sup>th</sup> of October 1902 said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is our view that such a work should be translated and spread in the Arab world.”</em> (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.68)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Risalah Fiqh Wa Hadith</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh briefly outlines the knowledge of jurisprudence and hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Kitab al-Kuhl</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh discusses and debates in detail, the great evil, catastrophic harm and unlawfulness of alcohol. It is 177 pages and was published in 1902c. Dr. Muzaffar Iqbal wrote, “The reality of alcohol and its unlawfulness are scrutinised in detail. The editor of ‘Taj’ of Bankipur Patna, Allamah Fazal Haq Azad has published a review of the book in the issue dated 13<sup>th</sup> October 1902c. (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.216)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(6) Qunut Fi’l Nazila</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is concerning making Qunut at times of calamities and disasters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was a brief overview of the writings of the Shaykh and there are perhaps other works we do not know about.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Children</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain married the daughter of Muhammad Akram Faruqi. He had five children, 3 sons and 2 daughters. The sons were Ali Akbar, Ahmad Hussain and Ghulam Muhammad.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">His Death</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Dr. Abu Nasr Fazal Hussain spent his life based on knowledge and its practical example. He spent time practising medicine as well as poetry. He died at the age of 55 in 1326H / 1908H in Lucknow and he was also buried there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat, Nuzhatul Khawatir: 8:360-361, Hadiqah al-Insab: 1:78-88, Ashab Ilm Wa Fadal: p.110, Tazkirrah Ulama Bihar: 1:224, The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.68, 199-200, 216, Kulliyat Fakhar: p.151-152, Tazkirrah Mehdawanu: p.11-40, 70, 177, Hayat Nazir: p.199)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The e-Book is a wealth of information on historical facts surrounding the murder of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu). Most of the references are from Shiʿa sources which the Shaikh has presented in great detail.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The e-Book serves as basic primer for those wishing to read an unbiased account of the historical events without the extreme exaggeration of the Rāfiḍah and Barelvīyyah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Birmingham, England.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Abūl-Ḥarīz Mālik ʿAbdul ʿAzīz Munāzīr Multānī</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was born approximately at the turn of the 19<sup>th</sup> century at about 1899 in the eastern part of Multān, a major city of the state of Punjāb, in Pākistān. He was born in a district 7 miles to the east of Multān, in an area known as Khudādwala in a family of farmers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Seeking Knowledge </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He starting seeking knowledge from an early stage, however the environment around was not entirely scholarly. So he moved to the city where he sought knowledge and achieved the studentship of the two famous and well-known scholars teaching there. They were</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Allāmah ʿAbdul-Ḥaq Multānī</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Allāmah ʿAbdul-Tawāb Multānī</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Shaikh al-Allāmah ʿAbdul-Haqq Multānī </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was originally from Dhera Ismāʿīl Khān and a Farānī Afghan, he later moved to Multān. He was from amongst the first people who started to call the people to the Tawhīd of Allāh and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) in that area. Suffice it to say that he was one of the foremost students of al-Allāmah al-Muhaddith al-Muftī Mian Nazīr Ḥussain Muhaddith Dehlawī [1318H), from who he learnt all the different branches of Islām. His rank and position with his teacher was such that he (Mian Nazīr Ḥussain) would have complete trust and reliance in him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When questions would come to Mian Nazīr he would pass them onto Shaikh ʿAbdul-Haqq who would answer them and Main Nazīr would then just add his approval. So when one looks at ‘Fatāwaa Nazīrīyyah’ of Allāmah Nazīr Ḥussain some of the verdicts have the name of ʿAbdul-Haqq next to them. This was his rank. Then another well-known student of al-Allāmah Mian Nazīr Ḥussain, Shaikh al-Allāmah al-Muhaddith Abūl-ʿA’la ʿAbdur Rahman Mubārakpūrī, Sāhib Tuhfatul Ahwaḍī, checked Fatāwa Nazīrīyyah.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Shaikh al-Allāmah ʿAbdul-Tawāb Multānī </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Born in 1288H, he also learnt aḥadīth from the hadeeth master, al-Allāmah al-Muhaddith al-Muftī Mian Nazīr Ḥussain Muhaddith Dehlawī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter he gained permission of hadīth from,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ahmad bin ʿAbdur Rahman al-Banna Misrī, the one who put al- Musnad of Imām Ahmad in an order.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Allāmah Muhammad Rāghib at-Ṭabbākh al-Ḥalabī Shāmī (1370H).</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was highly influenced by the works of the two Shaikhain, Shaikh ul-Islām Imām Ibn Taymīyyah and Imām Shams ul-Islām Ibn Qayyīm as well as the works of Imām Ibn Ḥajr al-ʿAsqalānī. He would often re-print their books and give them out free especially ‘ʿA’lām al-Muwaqqʿīn’. He authored many books. He died in 1366H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter the Shaikh travelled to Siyālkot and studied in ‘Jāmia Ibrāhīmīyyah’ where he benefited from Shaikh Muḥammad Ibrāhīm Mīr Siyālkotī. Then when the seeking of knowledge further instilled zealously in him, he travelled to ‘Jāmia Saʿīdīyyah’ in Delhī and learnt from Shaikh al-Allāmah Abū Saʿīd Sharf ud Dīn Dehlawī, the famous student of al-Allāmah Mian Nazīr Ḥussain Muhaddith Dehlawī, where he completed his studies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He spent most of his life as the rector of ‘Dār ul-Ḥadīth Muḥammadīyyah’ in Multān. He spent years teaching the Prophets ḥadīth in this institution as well as delivering the Friday sermon at the Jāmia Masjid. He also travelled and visited other cities where he helped to establish and propagate the dawah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of his most memorable such programs was in the town of Dhera Ghazī Khān, where he, alongside another Shaikh, severely refuted the madhab of the Rāfiḍī’s and the censurable concepts of shirk and innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Debates </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During his life he had many victories whilst debating with Ahlul-Bidʿah on various issues. He was a close companion of Shaikh al-Allāmah  Thanaullāh Amritsārī and both of them would indulge in defending Ahlus-Sunnah equally against the accusations and objections of the people of shirk and innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of his well known debates were with the Shiʿa, one of them was with the Shiʿī Sayyīd Zain al-ʿĀbidīn Shāh and another one with Ismāʿīl ash-Shīʿī, both of whom were severely refuted and their arguments annihilated by the Shaikh, Walillahil-Hamd.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the district of Shāh Ghardaiz in Lucknow (a place known for Shiʿa residency), in the house of Sayyīd Asghar ʿAlī Shāh, Sayyīd Zain al-ʿĀbidīn in the presence of other Shiʿa’s debated with the Shaikh on different issues between Ahlus-Sunnah and the Shiʿa’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was so knowledgeable about the Shiʿa madhab that he (his) opponent began to sweat as the expertise of the Shaikh was such that all his arguments were based and referenced from the books of the Shiʿa’s themselves. The Shaikh would always return victorious.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also debated with the famous Ḥanafī Mullah, Mawlāna Khair Muḥammad Jalandharī and it has been narrated that after the debate the Ḥanafī Mawlāna did not know his way back home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>His Works </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The main areas of writing and research of the Shaikh were shīʿism and the refutation of Taqlīd hence most of his works revolve around this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In refutation of the Shiʿa he wrote,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Decisive Word On Who Murdered Ḥussain.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Decisive Word On the Marriage of Umm Kulthūm (bint ʿAlī to Umar al-Khattāb).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥadīth Qartās.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Garden of Fidak.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ehtimām Janāzah Khair al-Anām.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">al-Burhān al-Maʿqūl Fī Tarbīʿa Bināt ar-Rasūl.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Khilāfat Sādiqah.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Faḍail Khulāfa Rāshīdīn.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Faḍail Abū Bakr, Umar and Uthmān From Shiʿa Narration&#8217;s.</span></li>

Later during the morning he would teach the student Aqāʿid, aḥadīth, fiqh, usūl al-Fiqh in the institution and he would continue this until the end of the day.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise be to Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">O people of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamāʿah let it be clearly known that from the trials and tribulations against Islām is the tribulation of Rafḍ or the Rāfiḍī’s (Shiʿa). This shīʿism is open and in front of the people in the garb of taqīyyah and in opposition to Ahlus-Sunnah they are constantly engaged in attempting to destroy them. The Shiʿa have just one statement on their tongues that they love the people of the household of the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) (Ahlul-Bayt)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it was necessary to defend Ahlus-Sunnah against the claims of love by Shiʿa for Ahlul-Bayt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also clear with Ahlus-Sunnah the words ‘Love for Ahlul-Bayt’ are not only of value but infact are part of our faith and belief. However within the Shiʿa sect these words mean nothing except enmity and hatred for Ahlul-Bayt. The Shiʿa are very famous for fooling the people with little knowledge that the murderers of Ḥussain (raḍi-Allāhu ʿAnhu) were Sunni’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, when the Shiʿa books are looked at then our amazement and astonishment go beyond bounds and limits as to the reality therein which indicates the falsity of their claim for their love for Ahlul-Bayt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this is something one should pay attention to as most of the general Shiʿa public are unaware of their books of ḥadīth. Their scholars hide and conceal this information from the public and the general people so that they do not become aware and familiar with the realities and therefore uncover their secrets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They propagate the Sunni’s were the murderers of Ḥussain (raḍi-Allāhu ʿAnhu) however, the books of the Shiʿas contain manifest evidences and clarify the real murderers of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) were pure Shiʿa. Who after the period of ʿAlī (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) joined alliances and co-operated with ‘Abdullāh bin Saba the jew, and they formerly joined the Shiʿa sect. Therefore the Shiʿa scholars like Mullah Baaqir Majlasee writes in his classical book ‘Jalā al-ʿAyūn’,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When the people of Kūfah found out Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) had moved and was residing in Makkah, the Shiʿas gathered in the house of Suleimān bin Sardkhazāʿī in kūfah and they discussed the issue of Muʿawīyyah (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and the pledge of allegiance to Yazīd. Suleimān said, “Imām Ḥussain denied the pledge of allegiance to Yazīd and went to Makkah and you people are his Shiʿa (sect/party) as well as for his relatives. If you want victory for them, then invite them to Kūfah. The Shiʿa said, ‘when he comes and lighten this city of Kūfah then all of us will give him our pledge of allegiance.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is very clear from this quote the Shiʿas were not only the Shiʿa of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) but also the Shiʿa of ʿAlī (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) as they claimed love for him, as the Shiʿa of today claim. These deceptive and traitorous Shiʿa wrote many letters to the Imām they oppressed, i.e. Imām Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and called him to Kūfah, to the extent that he received 12,000 letters from them. Mullah Bāqir Majlisī writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“So when these Shiʿa formulated a strategy they wrote numerous messages to Ḥussain and 12,000 letters were sent to him. He wrote an answer back to the last letter.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The final letter that was sent to him said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“From all the Shiʿa believers and Muslims of the people of Kūfah to Imām Ḥussain bin ʿAlī bin Abī Tālib. It is clear and apparent we do not have an Imām at this moment in time so pay heed and attention to us and come to our city of Kūfah. We are all obedient to you and are your followers. The governor of Kūfah Nuʿmān bin Bashīr is a very disgraced and humiliated person who is sitting at his government house. We do not pray the Friday or Eid prayer behind him.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><strong>[3]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The quote shows how extreme these Shiʿa were in that they did not pray behind others, this is the same situation with the Shiʿa today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the requests of the Shiʿa exceeded limits Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) sent Imām Muslim bin ʿAqīl to Kūfah where 12,000 Kūfī Shiʿa gave him the pledge of allegiance. Hence Imām Muslim bin ʿAqīl wrote a letter to Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and said the people Kūfah are with you with their hearts, so please come to Kūfah.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter what the Shiʿa did with Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) is recorded in their books. When Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) went to Kūfah the Shiʿas made their deceptiveness, treachery and evil open and clear, the 12,000 letters they had written were shown to them but these tyrant Shiʿa denied them. So upon this Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Our Shiʿa have denied everything and hence our victory.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><strong>[5]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These tyrant and oppressive Shiʿas disgraced and shamed Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and destroyed his victory. When Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) saw the reality of the Shiʿa he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“May Allaah’s curse be upon you and your intentions you tyrant, disloyal and traitor Shiʿa you have carved my chest with a dagger.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><strong>[6]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mullah Bāqir Majlisī continued and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In the end it was these disloyal Shiʿa who martyred Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu).”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><strong>[7]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not need other references to establish the murderers of Ḥussain were these Kūfī Shiʿa however for the satisfaction of the Shiʿa another reference is quoted. Allāmah Qaḍī Saushastarī Shīʿī writes in ‘Majālis al-Muʿminīn’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is no need to establish evidence the murderers of Imām Ḥussain were Kūfī Shiʿa (as this was the case) and as for the claim they were Sunni, it is against the reality and requires evidence even though Abū Ḥanīfah was a Kūfī.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><strong>[8]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This quote is very clear that the killers of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) were Shiʿas and these Shiʿas not only expressed their disloyalty, deceptiveness, treachery and their corruptive beliefs with regards to Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) but also with regards to [his father] ʿAlī (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and his brother Hasan (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) as well as with other people of Ahlul-Bayt.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mullā Bāqir Majlisī writes that Hasan (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I swear by Allaah instead of these Shiʿa, Muʿawīyyah is better for me as these Shiʿa just claim they are my Shiʿa when really they intended to kill me and loot my wealth.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also mentioned in Sīyar al-Aiʿmah and Kashf al-Ghummah that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Shiʿa betrayed Hasan (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and proved to be disloyal to him. They eventually rebelled against him and stole all his wealth and money to the extent that these Shiʿa forcefully pulled and stole the prayer mat Hasan (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) was praying on.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><strong>[11]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similar events are mentioned in the Sunni books. The Shiʿa who invited Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) to Kūfah were also the ones who in fact killed him. When Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) saw their treachery he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I did not come to Kūfah without being asked to come. I received numerous letters from you stating you had no Imām and you asked me to come. So it was obligatory upon you to stick to your promise and to obey me, but you broke your promise and your pledge of allegiance to me. This is not something strange or new to us as you people proved disloyal and treacherous to my father (ʿAlī (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and my brother (Ḥasan (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and my first cousin Muslim bin ʿAqīl. If you did not wish for me to come then I will return back to where I came from.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><strong>[12]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author of the book titled ‘Khulāsatul Masā’ib’ Shīʿī said that Imām Ḥussain said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“My Shiʿa have disgraced me.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><strong>[13]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the same book it says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The killers of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) were all Kūfī and no one from amongst them was a Shāmī (Syrian) or a Hijāzī (From Makkah or Madīnah).”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><strong>[14]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This enmity of the Shiʿas had already started since they had martyred Muslim bin ʿAqīl and ‘Abdullāh bin Bitaqar. The Shiʿa were on their way to stop Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) due to which Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) had to change his direction from Kūfah to Karbala.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have proven from the books of the Shiʿa which they consider to be reliable that the murderers of Ḥussain were pure Shiʿa. This therefore also proves their false claim of loving Ahlul-Bayt, which is in reality nothing but enmity and hatred for them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I think it is also important to inform Ahlus-Sunnah that the Shiʿa say they benefited from the murder of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and due to this all the sins of the Shiʿa have been forgiven. They claim that since in the dream when Ibrāhīm (‘alaihis salaam) had to slaughter Ismāʿīl (‘alaihis salaam), it was stopped therefore the murdering of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) was a correct interpretation of that dream and for this they use a verse of the Qurān. In this regard Mawlāna Awlād Haidar Shīʿī authored a book titled ‘Dhab al-Aẓīm’ in which he explained in detail this interpretation by the Shiʿa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will therefore ask the Shiʿa with all due respect, what is the difference between your beliefs that all your sins are forgiven due to the martyrdom of Ḥussain and the Christians’ claim that all their sins have also been forgiven? So we say there is no difference and that their is full unity and agreement, and why should there not be because the foundation of the Shiʿa religion was laid by the jews and christians. Then how can there be any differences in the final result.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reality is that the Shiʿa killed Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and now they want to acquire the reward for it by lamenting and wailing. They also claim the companions of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) became disbelievers. Qaḍī Saushastarī Shīʿī narrates,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is narrated from Imām Zain al-ʿĀbidīn that he said, “After the death of Ḥussain everyone except 5 of his companions became disbelievers. Abū Khālid, Yaḥya bin Aām Tawīl, Jubair bin Mutīʿa, Jābir bin ʿAbdullāh Anṣārī.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><strong>[15]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to the Shiʿa these 5 were also in the cloak of taqīyyah who after some days also became disbelievers and during the time of Imām Jʿafar there were not even 3 Shiʿa who were believers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Usūl al-Kāfī’ mentions that Imām Jʿafar said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I swear by Allāh if I find 3 Shiʿa believers from amongst you who will conceal what I say then I would not hide my ḥadīth from them.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Mūsaa Kāẓim said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There was only one believer who was ʿAbdullāh bin Yʿafūr.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><strong>[16]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows according to the Shiʿa themselves they were full of heresy and disbelief and in the highly regarded Shiʿa book, Usūl al-Kāfī Imām Muḥammad Bāqir said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allāh established 70 years for the Mahdī to appear but when the Shiʿa murdered Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) Allāh was angry with the people of the earth and therefore he increased Mahdī’s time to 140 years.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><strong>[17]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another narration it states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The anger of Allāh descended upon the Shiʿa.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><strong>[18]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this second narration explains the first one, which clarifies that the phrase ‘people of the earth’ refers to the Shiʿa. The Shiʿa were and are such great criminals that Allāh limited and specified curses upon them. Another narration in ‘Usūl al-Kāfī’ that Allāh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When I am angry with someone I declare my curse upon them and my curse stays with the all the generation and family of that person.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><strong>[19]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then what doubt can we have in their hypocrisy and heresy. Hence finally Imām Mūsa Kāẓim issued a verdict the Shiʿa were hypocrites and disbelievers. He said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If I was to separate and divide my Shiʿa then I will not find anyone except a category of those who claim they are Shiʿa only and if I examined them then I will not find any Shiʿa except that all of them will be infidel disbelievers.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><strong>[20]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shiʿa destroy their faith and religion by declaring the rightly guided Khaliphs and the Companions to be hypocrites, as well as cursing them. The Shiʿa authors, by writing the truth, declared the Shiʿa themselves to be infidels and disbelievers and the ones who will inherit the curse of Allāh upon themselves and their families for the rest of their lives.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Unlawfulness of Lamenting and Mourning</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shiʿa in order to cover their crime for murdering Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) inverted the narrations of Islām and declared the 10th of Muharram to be a month and time for seeking intercession, blessings and it being a pillar of Faith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This included wearing black clothes with black collars, beating their chests and at the same time abusing and cursing the companions of the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) as a means of seeking reward and earning salvation. Such actions are impermissible with the Sunnis however the books of the Shiʿa also contain similar verdicts that state such actions are unlawful. So in this regard we will mention some Shiʿa narrations.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is narrated from Imām Jʿafar Sādiq that the Messenger of Allāh (sal- Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said, <em>“A Muslim beating his thighs at a time of difficulty is synonymous to wasting his deeds.”</em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This narration mentions a Muslim to be a condition however the religion of the Shiʿa is already in danger.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad Bāqir said, <em>“Whoever hit themselves, by slapping their faces and chests and pulling their hair then he has left patience and adopted a way other than Islām and he is despicable. Allāh causes his good deeds to be wasted and whoever cried loudly is impatient which contradicts patience and this is unlawful”.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said to Fātimah (radi- Allaahu ‘anhu), <em>“When I die do not cry over me, or pull your hair, or lament or mourn over me.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><strong>[21]</strong></a></em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said at a time of difficulty do not hit your cheeks nor your faces, do not pull your hair, do not rip your clothes nor wear black clothes or lament and mourn.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Jʿafar Sādiq was asked, <em>“Can women wear black clothes and pray.” He replied, “No, because black is the colour of the clothes of the people of hellfire.” He also said, “Alee said the Messenger of Allāh said to his companions do not wear black clothes as it is the dress of Fir’aun.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><strong>[23]</strong></a></em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note From this narration we find according to the Shiʿa religion it is absolutely unlawful whether at a time of happiness or sadness. So whoever wears black clothes their either he is a Fir’aunī or a person from the hellfire.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Muḥammad Bāqir said, <em>“Whoever made an imitation of a grave or copied anything else then he leaves the fold of Islaam.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><strong>[24]</strong></a></em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Jʿafar Sādiq said, <em>“Crying on the deceased with a loud voice and ripping ones clothes is not permissible.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"><strong>[25]</strong></a></em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Bāqir said, <em>“When the son of the Messenger of Allāh, Ṭāhir, died he prohibited Khadījah from crying.”</em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Alee (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) said, <em>“Whoever at a time of difficulty hit his thighs then his deeds will be wasted.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"><strong>[26]</strong></a></em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These narration’s prove that all that the Shiʿa do in the month of Muharram like beating oneself, hitting ones cheeks and face, wounding oneself, wearing black clothes, being in a state of mourning, lamenting and wailing, making grave imitations of the grave of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) to lament over and all other actions the Shiʿa do, are all prohibited and unlawful actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If all this was permissible and allowed, then the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) would have done this for the martyrs of the battle of Uhud, yet he did not put a black shroud over his uncle Hamzah’s body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the great treachery of the Shiʿa Imām Zain al-ʿĀbidīn did not establish gatherings for mourning every year. Nor did he make images of the women of the Ahlul-Bayt as the Shiʿa do today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reality of these issues is that Allāh or his Messenger (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) didn’t order establishing such gatherings. However the Shiʿas in order to cover up their deceit, mourn for their despicable mistake and with this send curses upon Yazeed trying to lift the blame from themselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, what is ironic here is that according to the Shiʿas it was Yazīd who himself aided this custom of lamenting and mourning. Hence the reliable Shiʿa book, Jalā al-ʿA’yūn mentions Yazīd gave Ahlul Bayt a house and asked them to wear black clothes and to lament for 7 days.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This then proves the person who first started this innovation was Yazīd (according to the Shiʿa) and that the Shiʿa followed him in this custom. So on one hand they curse him and on the other hand they follow his innovated customs. This is indeed strange.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This custom was really introduced by Maʿaz ad-Daulah ash-Shīʿī who on the 10th of Muharram in 352H ordered the people to close their shops, all trading to cease and that the people should grieve, everyone to wear black clothes, women to rip their clothes in public and walk the streets whilst lamenting and wailing.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We find the Shiʿas of this time are following their predecessors foot by foot and earning the wrath and anger of Allāh upon themselves. Similarly according to their own words they ended up declaring their own Shiʿa to be heretical infidels and thereby rightfully earning Allāh punishment.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Virtue of Abū Bakr as-Siddīq According To A Shiʿa Narration.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is narrated by Jʿafar Sādiq,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) was in the cave with Abu Bakr, he said to him, “I can see Jʿafar and his companions on a ship in the middle of the sea and I can see the Anṣār in their houses in Madīnah.” Abu Bakr asked, “O Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) can you see them?” He replied, “Yes I can see them.” Abū Bakr (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) then asked, “Can I also see them.” So the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) wiped his hands over Abu Bakr’s face and then he could also see everything. Upon this the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said to him, “You will always be my friend (Siddīq)”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"><strong>[29]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From this narration of the Shiʿa it is clear that Abū Bakr as-Siddīq the First Khalīph was the most virtuous from all the companions as his title as-Siddīq is from those who seek closeness to Allāh, as Allāh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And who so obeys Allāh and His Messenger then they will be in the company of those on whom Allāh has bestowed his grave, of the prophets, the Siddīqīn (Those who were the first and foremost to believe in the Messenger of Allāh)&#8230;.” <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><strong>[30]</strong></a>           </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence when the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said to Abu Bakr he was his Siddīq, then this station is of a great stature with Allāh.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Virtue of ‘Umar bin al-Khattāb According To a Shiʿa Narration.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a long sermon of ʿAlī in ‘Nahj ul-Balāghah’. When it was the time for Jihād against the Persians ‘Umar (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) intended to go himself in the battlefield so he sought the counsel of ʿAlī. ʿAlī advised him not to go and said to him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“O ‘Umar you are the peg of the Arabs. If you leave this land of Madīnah then the Arab lands will be destroyed from all directions and tomorrow if the non-Arabs look at you they will most certainly say you are one of the pillar of the foundation of the Arabs, please do not leave.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"><strong>[31]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This statement shows how much respect ʿAlī (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) had for ‘Umar (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and how much revered him. It also shows the great unity between the two Khaliphs, and that ʿAlī considered ‘Umar’s (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) Khaliphate to be his Khaliphate.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Virtue of ‘Uthmān bin ʿAffān According To A Shiʿa Narration.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a statement of ʿAlī (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) in praise of Uthmān (radi- Allaahu ‘anhu) in Nahj ul-Balāghah which is decisive of the virtue of ‘Uthmān (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu). It is,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“ʿAlī then went to ‘Uthmān and said to him, “People are hounding and hassling me and they have made me a messenger between themselves and you. But by Allāh I do not know what to say to you, I do not know anything which you do not know and nor can I represent you in anything. I do not precede you in anything except that you know it and we have nothing from seclusion that we can convey to you. You saw what we saw and you heard what we heard. You accompanied the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) and so did we. You are the same as Abū Bakr and Umar (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhuma) in acting and in following the truth. You acquired the virtue of being the son in law of the Messenger (sal-Allāhu ‘alayhe wa sallam) which Abū Bakr and Umar (Raḍi Allāhu ʿAnhuma) did not have.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"><strong>[32]</strong></a></em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref28" name="_ftn28">[28]</a> [TN] Hāfiẓ Ṣalāh ud-Dīn Yūsuf said in ‘The Month of Muharram And The Present Day Muslims.’ <em>“In 351H Maʿaz ad-Daulah [Aḥmad bin Bauīyyah Daīlāmī] wrote the following on the door of the grand Masjid of Baghdād, “May there be curse upon Muʿawīyyah bin Sufyān, the evil ones of the garden of Fidak, the ones who stopped Hasan from being buried in the Prophets grave, the ones who exiled Abū Dhar and the ones who expelled ʿAbbās from the committee.”</em> [See Tārīkh Ibn al-Āthīr [8/179]. Then in 18thDhul-Hijjah Ma’az ad-Daulah announced to the people to make Eīd and he named the Eīd ‘Eīd Khum Ghadīr’ and the drums were beaten and it was a joyous occasion. The reason why he kept the date of 18<sup>th</sup> Dhul-Hijjah was because it was the date of the martyrdom of Uthmaan (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu). Nowadays the Shīʿa consider Eīd Khum Ghadīr to be more virtuous then Eīd ul-Adha. Then in the beginning of 352H Ma’az ad-Daulah ash-Shīʿī ordered the people to close their shops’ all trading to cease and the people should grieve, everyone to wear black clothes, women to rip their clothes in public and walk the streets whilst lamenting and wailing. The shīʿa rejoiced at this is as it was a shīʿā government. [‘The Month of Muharram And The Present Day Muslims. [pg.18-20]</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already mentioned the authentic narration of Ibrāhīm bin Maisarah that the narration was regarding Muʿawīyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥafiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-Asqalānī cites from ʿUmar bin ʿAbdul ʿAzīz that when the name of Yazīd would be mentioned he would seek Allāhs mercy on him ie meaning he would say Rahimahullāh [Lisān al-Mīzān [6/294]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah has denied the report of 20 lashes which has already been mentioned in the previous paper. [Refer to Sārim al-Maslūl ʿAla Shātim ar-Rasūl [pg.574].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ignorant people like Aquilani Ahmed and others like him object as to why is Rahimahullāh said after his name and how can he be the Amīr al-Muʿminīn. The answer is quite simple as some Companions were alive at the time as well as senior Tabiʿeen and no doubt they were believers so how does can this title be denied for him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, some of the following illustrious and noble individuals referred to him as Amīr al-Muʿminīn just to name a few</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Nuʿmān bin Bashīr RadhiAllahu Anhu [64H]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">(2) Alī bin Ḥussain [93-100H]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Imām Laith bin Ṣaʿd [175H]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Imām Ibn Ḥazm [456H]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Qaḍi Abū Bakr bin ʿArabī [543H]</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All sorts of lies and fabrications are levied against Yazīd in order to discredit him. They also lie based on a deep rooted sentiment that Yazīd must be blamed for the death of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu. These slanderous and treacherous accusations were concocted by none other than the Rāfiḍah Shīʿa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The undercover Ḥanafī Aquilani (Aqeel Ahmed) cited a few reports which elucidated that Yazīd was responsible for the death of companions, we will inshaAllāh address this point later. Just a basic rebound for this is there were numerous companions who were with Yazīd at the time and supported him, so will the same be levied against them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also alleged against that he killed hundreds of people and desecrated the Prophets Masjid and his resting place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah refutes this claim and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“10,000 people were not killed and nor was blood spilled at the Prophets Masjid and grave and neither was there any fighting in the Prophets Masjid.”</em> [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/253]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah went on to say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“None of the Muslims rulers from amongst Banī Umayyah or Banī </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Abbās travelled to the K</em><em>ʿ</em><em>abah with the intention of desecrating it. The representative of Yazīd nor Hajjāj bin Yūsuf the representative of Abdul Mālik did this, in fact all of the Muslims respected the K</em><em>ʿ</em><em>abah.”</em> [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/254]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Aquilani Ahmed the deceptive undercover Ḥanafī boldly threw a hideous accusation of, “you cannot digest the criticism against Yazīd” and this individual based his foolish accusation on a number of narrations. From among the narrations he presented was that a person mentioned Yazīds bin Muʿawīyyahs name and said Amīr al-Muʿminīn whereupon Umar bin ʿAbdul ʿAzīz [101H] ordered for the man to be lashed 20 times. [Siyār ʿAlām an-Nabulā 4/35-40] as Aquilani Ahmed quoted</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, the authentic narration is as transmitted by Ibrāhīm bin Maisarah where he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have never seen Umar bin </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Abdul </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Azīz hit anyone except the man who cursed and abused Mu</em><em>ʿ</em><em>awīyyah and he (Umar bin </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Abdul </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Aziz) lashed him.”</em> [Sārim al-Maslūl ʿAla Shātim ar-Rasūl [pg.574], al-Bidāyah Wan-Nihāyah [8/139], Ṣawāʿiq Mehrqah [pg.221] and Nibrās [pg.551] of ʿAllāmah ʿAbdul ʿAziz Farhārwī [d.1239H], see also Nāhīyah ʿAnn Dham Muʿawīyyah [pg.20]</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: justify;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After cursing and hurling abuse at Yazīd, the Shīʿa Rāfiḍah then begin to abuse the governor of Kūfah, Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād who died in the year 64H. They allege that when he came to Kūfah at the behest of Yazīd he was ordered to capture Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu and to kill him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A few days ago it was relayed to us by the admin of <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.Salafiri.com">www.Salafiri.com</a> Facebook account that an undercover Ḥanafī and neo-Jahmī whilst posing as an Ahle Ḥadīth was vehemently arguing in declaring Yazīd a fāsiq and a drunkard and thus someone to be shunned etc etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This undercover person is known to troll and give the false idea that he is an Ahle Ḥadīth when in actual fact from this language as well as other reasons that he is as an ardent Ḥanafī. The readers may know him as Aquilani Ahmed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After seeing the screen shots of his conversation with the admin he ignorantly claims after retracting his initial position that although Yazīd may have been free of the murder of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu he is still responsible and accountable for not bringing the culprits to justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What this mischief maker and ignorant person Aquilani Ahmed (an alias for Aqeel Ahmed) failed to realise is that he did take account of the culprits who were none other than the Rāfiḍah Shīʿa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Secondly we find from the books of Ahlus Sunnah and the Shīʿa that Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād was clearly instructed on the contrary ie to only secure Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ṭabarī and Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Kathīr mention that Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu does not intend to come to us then we do not have any concern.” </em>(meaning coming to Kūfah to see the treacherous and deceptive Rāfiḍah Shīʿa) [Tārīkh al-Umam Wal Malūk [4/282], Al-Bidāyah Wan Nihayah [8/157]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shīʿa authors Mullā Bāqir Majlīsī, Muḥsin Amīn Āmālī and Shaikh Mufīd all mention,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“As for </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu does not intend to come to us then we also will not have any concern.”</em> [Kitāb al-Irshād [pg.251], Lūwaʿij al-Ashjān [pg.57] and Jalā al-ʿAyūn [pg.366]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the instructions and guidance which Yazīd sent to Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād was clear and specific and both the books of Ahlus Sunnah and the Shīʿa mention this, which was,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I (meaning Yazīd) have been informed that </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu has left for </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Irāq therefore place watchers at the frontiers. Keep a watch over the people you suspect (ie those who sent letters to </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu inviting him to Kūfah) and arrest those who have been blamed and have allegations levied against them. However, do not fight anyone that does not fight you and continue updating me with whatever happens. Wasalam.”</em> [al-Umam Wal Malūk [4/286],  Al-Bidāyah Wan Nihayah [8/165], Akhbār at-Tawāl [pg.242] and Maqtil Ḥussain [1/214] of Akhtab Khawārazimī  Shīʿa]</span></p>
