<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [MUSLIM]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/952, 953 hadith no.1841, book 51, chapter 5, hadith no.14), at-Tamhid (2/279) and al-Istidhkar (no.1777) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Muslim (no.1031) from the hadith of Malik, and al-Bukhari (no.6806) from the hadith of Khubaib Ibn Abdurahman al-Ansari from Hafs Ibn Hashim with the same hadith.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Hafidh Ibn Abdul Bar took the word &#8220;Dhilla&#8221; (shade) and understood it to mean mercy. If the meaning of the word literally means shade then this would mean the shade of Allah&#8217;s Throne as it is mentioned in another hadith that, &#8220;&#8230;seven people will be given shade under Allah&#8217;s Throne&#8230;&#8221; (Mushkil al-Athar of at-Tahawi, new edition 15/69 hadith no.5844, Tuhfatul Akhyar 7/195 hadith no.5117 and it&#8217;s chain is [Sahih] authentic). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Whosoever is lenient with with the loan of someone who owes them (i.e. allows them a longer time to pay back, or reduces and forgives them part of the loan or pays of their debt etc.), &#8220;&#8230;Allah will shade him on the Day of Judgement under His Throne&#8230;&#8221; (Sunan at-Tirmidhi no.1302, and he said, &#8220;Hasan Sahih Garib&#8221; and it&#8217;s chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The wording in a hadith of Mu&#8217;adh Ibn Jabal (Radi Allahu Anhu) are, &#8220;&#8230;Allah will put them under the shade of His Throne&#8230;&#8221; (al-Mustadrak of al-Hakim 4/169 hadith no.7315, and it&#8217;s chain is [Sahih] authentic and al-Hakim authenticated it on the conditions of Bukhari and Muslim and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) This hadith points towards many important matters such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of a just leader</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of a youth who spends their youthful days in the worship of Allah</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who is connected to the Masjid and loves it and gives it preference over and above worldly matters </span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who loves and hates someone for the sake of Allah only and not because of a worldly or personal gain </span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who remembers Allah and cries whilst they are alone</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who fears Allah when a noble and beautiful woman invites him to a sinful act of relationship </span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who gives charity in Allah&#8217;s path secretly </span></li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Zakareeyah bin Ghulam Qadir</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Allaah Ta’ala gave proofs in His Noble Book concerning the excellence of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, and following their way, Allaah Ta’ala said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&lt;&lt;And the first to embrace Islaam of the <em>Muhajirun</em> and the <em>Ansar</em> and also those who followed them exactly. Allaah is well pleased with them, as they are well pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.&gt;&gt;   [Tawbah: 100]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From Ibn Mas’ood that the Prophet  said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘The best people are my generation then those who will come after them and then those after them.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, the Companions are the example and they are the ones to follow. It is obligatory upon every Muslim to follow them in what they understood from the evidences of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, because they were the most knowledgeable of the people and they had the most correct understanding of the <em>Sharia’</em> texts out of all the people.  Consequently, if a Muslim takes other than their understanding then he will deviate away from the straight path, since the Companions stood with insight, and they viewed everything with their perceptive knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abu Zayed al-Qayrawani said in his book ‘al-Jaama’ (117):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘Submission to the Sunnan (plural of Sunnah) cannot be opposed with opinion, nor is it repelled with Qiyas (analogy).  As for the interpretation of the Salaf as-Salihthen that is how we interpret, and what they acted upon is which we act upon, what they left off is what we leave.  It is sufficient to adhere to what they adhered to, and that we follow them in that what they clarified.  We take them as an example in what they extracted and viewed from the hadeeth. We do not rebel against the Salaf as-Salih in what they differed or what they interpreted, and everything that we have just mentioned is the stance of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah and the Imams of the people in Fiqh and hadeeth.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As-Sama’ani said in ‘Sown al-Mantiq’ (158):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘Indeed we have been ordered to follow and been encouraged to do so.  And we have been prohibited from innovating and we have been rebuked concerning Bida’. The flag/sign of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah is their following the Salaf as-Salih, and them leaving everything that is innovated and heresy.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The supporter of the <em>Sunnah</em> al-Asbhaani said in his book ‘al-Hujjah Fee Bayaan al-Muhajjah’ (2/437-440):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘Knowledge is not having lots of narrations; rather it is following and using those narrations. It is to take the Companions and the Ta’abieen (the Successors of the Companions) as exemplary, even if it means having a little knowledge.  Whoever opposes the Companions and the Ta’abieen then he is misguided, even if he has a lot of knowledge.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Asbhaani continues:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘And that is to clarify for the people the matter of their Deen, so it is upon us to follow the Companions because indeed the Deen came from Allaah Ta’ala and it did not come from the intellects and opinions of men, but rather the Messenger  clarified the Sunnahfor his Ummah. And he explained it to his Companions.  Therefore, whoever opposed the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  in anything from the Deen then he has become misguided.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Rajab said in the book ‘Fadl Ilm as-Salaf ‘ala Ilm al-Khalaf’ (72):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘The beneficial knowledge from these sciences, are all precisely connected to the texts with the Book and the Sunnah, the understanding of the meaning of these sciences and their restrictions are with what has been narrated from the Companions and the Successors and those who followed them, regarding the meanings of the Qur’aan and the hadeeth.  Likewise, what has been mentioned from them of what they said regarding issues of Halaal and Haraam, as well as Zuhd, softening of the heart and knowledge and other issues.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymeeyah said in ‘Kitab al-Eemaan’ (p.114):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘To understand this principle of al-Eemaan the Murjia’ turned away from the explanation of the Book and the Sunnah, and the statements of the Companions, and the Successors who followed them in goodness. The Murjia’ relied upon their own opinions and they interpreted this principle with their own understanding of Arabic language.  This is the way of the people of Bida’. This is why Imam Ahmad said: ‘The people mainly make mistakes regarding interpretation and analogy.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is why we find the Mu’tazilah[1], Murjia’[2], Rafidah[3] and other than them from the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> explain the Qur’aan with their own intellect, as well as what they interpreted with Arabic language.  This is why you find them not relying upon the Ahadeeth of the Prophet , the Companions, and the <em>Ta’abieen</em> and the Imams of the Muslims.  So the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> do not rely upon the Sunnah, or upon the consensus of the <em>Salaf</em> or their <em>Aathaar</em>, rather they rely upon the intellect and language, and we find that they do not rely upon the books of <em>Tafseer</em> based upon narrations, and upon hadeeth and <em>Aathaar</em> of the <em>Salaf</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Ibn Taymeeyah also said in ‘Majmoo Fatawa’ (10/362):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘So knowledge which has been legislated and the rituals of worship which have been legislated are taken from the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah , as for what came from those after them, then it is not befitting that we take that as a foundation even though they are excused for their mistakes, rather they will be rewarded for theirIjtihad (exertion in deriving a ruling) or due to Taqleed (blind acceptance).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, whoever establishes speech regarding the science of <em>Usool</em> (principles) and its branches upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Athaar</em> narrated from the previous generations then he has achieved the Prophetic way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, whoever establishes his purpose, worship, good deeds and an understanding connected to the principles of righteous actions and its branches of circumstances of the heart and physical actions upon <em>al-Eeman</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em>and the guidance, which Muhammad  and his Companions were upon, then he has achieved the Prophetic way. And this is the way of the Imams of guidance; you find that Imam Ahmad would say when the principles of the Sunnah were mentioned:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘The principles of the Sunnah are adhering to what the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  were upon and the books of <em>Tafseer</em> which have narrations from the Prophet  and the Companions and the successors. This is what is relied upon in its knowledge based principles and its branches………………..’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, regarding <em>Zuhd</em>, <em>Raqaaiq</em> (softening of the heart) and matters of the heart since its knowledge is relied upon the book of <em>Zuhd</em> which has narrations about the Prophets <em>-salawaatAllaah alaihim-</em> from Adam to Muhammad, then upon the way of the Companions and successors and those after them were not mentioned.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">[Taken from ‘Tawdeeh Usool al-Fiqh ‘ala Manhaj Ahl-ul-Hadeeth’ p.41]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</span></p>
