<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Essential Q &amp; A’s regarding Zakaat Al-Fitr</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Rulings &amp; Wisdoms</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is incumbent upon every Muslim to seek knowledge and learn, more so before a particular act of worship is obligated upon him. Below is a concise summary of the basic rulings of Zakaat Al-Fitr.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What is Zakaat Al-Fitr?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Zakaat al-Fitr is an obligatory charity during Fitr i.e. when the fasting of Ramadhan is broken with Eid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What is the wisdom behind Zakaat Al-Fitr?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) beautifully explained the wisdom for the obligation of Zakaat Al-Fitr, he said:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is purification for a fasting person, from idle talk and false speech, and also to feed the poor.”</em> [1]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">i.e. despite a fasting person trying his best to stay away from false speech during fasting, however sometimes he may fall short. Therefore, Zakaat Al-Fitr is a purification from this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is also a way of us showing our gratitude to our Lord, who bestowed upon us Ramadhan and allowed us to live till Eid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Who needs to pay Zakaat Al-Fitr?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) obligated Zakaat Al-Fitr</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>…on the Muslims, free or a slave, male or female, young or old.”</em> [2]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is an obligation upon every Muslim, however the responsibility falls on the head of the household such as the father or husband, to donate it on behalf of his dependants. This is assuming they have enough food for themselves.</span></p>
<p>It is not obligated to pay Zakaah Al-Fitr on behalf of a foetus, however it is recommended and desired.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What should be donated?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa salaam obligated Zakaat al-Fitr to be given</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“a Saa’ of dates, a Saa’ of barley…”</em> [3]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree narrates that the companions</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“would give Zakaat al-Fitr on behalf of every young and adult, the free and enslaved in the era of the Messenger of Allah one Saa’ of staple foodstuff…”</em> [4]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The above &#8211; and other narrations &#8211; show us that Zakaat Al-Fitr should be donated in the form of the staple food of one’s locality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How much should be donated?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The measure used at the time of the Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) was a Saa’. [5]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In modern measurements this relates to:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rice: 2.3kgs Raisins: 1.64kgs</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dates: 1.8kgs Wheat: 2.04kgs</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Lentils 2.1kgs Flour: 2.06kgs</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Couscous 1.8kgs [6]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From the above measurements we can see that Zakaat Al-Fitr ranges from 1.5kgs to 2.5kgs approximately depending on the type of food. For this reason, the scholars have recommended for 3kgs of food to be given as a matter of caution. [7]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How is it given and to whom?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Zakaat al-Fitr is given to any poor person who cannot afford his daily food for himself and his family. There are three possibilities for Zakaat Al-Fitr:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The correct measure of food should be given to poor people in your locality. This is the Sunnah and it fulfils the objective of community cohesion.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">If poor people are not found in one’s community, then the correct measure of food can be transferred to a different community or country, especially if the poor are relatives.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, if none of the above are possible, then a person should give the monetary value of food, this is not from the Sunnah however it is done for a particular need or benefit. [8]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How should it be given?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From the above it is clear that the best practice is to give it directly to the poor in one’s locality. A person should include his wife and children in every step of the donation – buying the food, each child measuring their own quantity, packaging it and finally donating it to the poor.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, we should also be sensitive to the poor who are receiving the Zakaat, that they are not to be made to feel belittled, therefore where appropriate anonymity can be maintained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Why is it given to the poor specifically?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Eid is a day of happiness and festivities, and nobody should feel left out on such a day. For this reason, essential food items are distributed to the poor without them asking. It is also encouraged for Muslims to give gifts and honour the poor in other appropriate ways.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>When should it be given?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The best time to donate the Zakaat Al-Fitr is before the Eid prayer, however it can be given earlier by a day or two especially if it is felt that it may not reach the poor in time. If it is delayed until after the Eid Prayer, it is no longer considered as Zakaah, but mere charity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whoever donates the Zakaah before the Eid Prayer then it is an accepted form of Zakaah, and whoever gives it after the Prayer it is a Sadaqah.”</em> [9]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Allaah knows best; May peace and blessings be upon our beloved Prophet, his family and companions.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">[5] A Saa’ is a measure of volume which was used in the Prophetic era, it is ‘four double handfuls of food’ measured by an average man.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[6] This was calculated by a number of students in the presence of Shaykh Ferkous of Algeria. Ref: <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?howtopic=131485">www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?howtopic=131485</a></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">[8] Ibn Taymiyyah said: <em>“As for donating Zakaat Al-Fitr in monetary value (ie as opposed to actual food) then there is a difference of opinion. Is it permitted unrestrictedly? Is it forbidden unrestrictedly? Is it permitted in some instances to do a need or a benefit?There are three opinions [as above] in the Madhhab of Imaam Ahmad and others. [The last opinion] is the most just and fair.” </em>[Majmoo’ Al-Fataawa 25/79]</span></p>
