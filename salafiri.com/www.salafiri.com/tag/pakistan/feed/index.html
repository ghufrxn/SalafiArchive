				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Annotated &amp; Translated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A Brief Biography of Shaykh Muhammad Isma’il as-Salafi<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>His Birth</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to the most reliable reports he was born in 1314H corresponding to 1895CE in a place called Dhawnaki in Wazirabad. The Shaykh’s family had been seeking knowledge for a few generations and had learnt the Islamic sciences.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> The Shaykh&#8217;s father, Shaykh Ibrahim was also a scholar and calligrapher. He wrote <em>Tuhfatul Ahwadhi</em> and the Quran translated by Mawlana Wahid uz-Zaman in his calligraphy published in Lahore. The old print of <em>Tuhfatul Ahwadhi</em> with <em>Jam’i at-Tirmidhi</em> that we see printed in the Arab countries and the subcontinent is with handwriting of Shaykh Ibrahim.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti said I saw Shaykh Ibrahim in the 1940’s and his grandson, Shaykh Muhammad would often be with him i.e. Shaykh Muhammad Isma’il as-Salafi’s eldest son. When Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi would deliver his lessons on <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> or on any other book of hadith, Shaykh Ibrahim would sit in his lesson and listen attentively.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> Shaykh Ibrahim also studied with Shaykh Abdul Mannan Wazirabadi, he would sit with and learn the science of hadith.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibrahim did not have any children, so he requested the virtuous and pious scholar Shaykh Abdul Mannan Wazirabadi (d.1916) to supplicate to Allah for him and Allah accepted his du’a and Shaykh Muhammad Isma’il as-Salafi was born. When the son was born Shaykh Wazirabadi named him Isma’il and said to his father to let his son serve the Din.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>His early Education</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He received his early education from his respected father in the beginning thereafter he was taken to study with the famous Muhaddith Shaykh Abdul Mannan Wazirabadi. At his madrassah he studied the beginner books of morphology and grammar with Shaykh Umar Din (d.1342H) and the later advanced books like <em>Ibn Aqil</em>, <em>Sharh Jami</em>, <em>Alfiyah</em> and <em>Mir Qutbi</em> with Shaykh Abdul Mannan Wazirabadi. He studied all the books of hadith with Shaykh Abdul Mannan, from the basic books to the Sahihayn. He also studied <em>Nukhbatul Fikr</em> and <em>Tafisr Jalalayn</em> with Shaykh Wazirabadi and the latter gave Shaykh as-Salafi sanad and ijazah in 1333H.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He first travelled to Delhi and enrolled in Madrassah Naziriyyah, which was the madrassah set up by the formidable hadith scholar, Shaykh al-Kul Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi and studied with Shaykh Abdul Jabbar Amrpuri in Delhi. Later he travelled to Amritsar and studied with the Ghaznawi family and then with Shaykh Mufti Muhammad Hasan<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> and then with Shaykh Ibrahim Mir Sialkoti in Sialkot as his eager student.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Around the age of 23-34 after learning the various sciences around 1921, upon the advice and recommendation of Shaykh Thanaullah Amritsari and Shaykh Ibrahim Mir Sialkoti he went to Gujranwala. Shaykh Ibrahim Mir Sialkoti gave his huge library to Shaykh as-Salafi.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also studied with Shaykh Abdul Ghafur Ghaznawi and Shaykh Abdur Rahim Ghaznawi.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> He met the great orator and expert astute debater of the Ahl ul-Hadith, Shaykh Abdul Aziz Rahimabadi when he was around 10 years old for the first time and he was in awe of him.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He remained in Gujranwala for approximately half a century, spreading the Quran and Hadith throughout the city. When he first arrived in Gujranwala there was only one masjid and the Jami’yyah Ahl ul-Hadith only consisted of only seven (7) individuals. However, when the Shaykh died in 1968, a few days before he set the foundation of the 54<sup>th</sup> masjid in the city. From 1921-1930 he focussed on debating and discoursing other religions and sects upon the instruction of Shaykh Thanaullah Amritsari but he abandoned this forever and focussed on other aspects of da’wah.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Lectures on the Qur’an</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As soon as he arrived in Gujranwala, he began giving lectures on the Qur’an after Fajr, which continued for twenty-seven (27) years consecutively without fail. The attendees would number no less than almost 250 daily and this would exceed to 500 in the month of Ramadhan. In his lectures of the Qur’an and Friday sermons he had completed the Qur’an in a consecutive order and was on the 8<sup>th</sup> Juz of his second cycle.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>His Sermons and Lectures</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His sermons would be free from idle speech and irrelevant additions. His speech would be concise, clear with precision and free of stories. He would address every aspect of every subject in his sermons to such an extent listeners would fully understand. Shaykh Muhammad Yusuf Anwar mentions, 40-50 years ago, whenever we saw a poster for a conference, Shaykh Muhammad Isma’il as-Salafi’s name would often be first.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>His Works and Writings</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the explanation of the Qur’an the Shaykh liked the science of hadith, the authority and evidence of hadith, the compilation of hadith and the efforts of the scholars of hadith. It was on this basis the Shaykh liked and revered the scholars of hadith and the methodology of the Ahl ul-Hadith and this is evident from the Shaykhs writings and works. His writings were very clear and precise while choosing the correct and appropriate words to disseminate his point. Despite his busy schedule he was able to complete his works with a level of consistency and continuity without loss of the meaning or fervour.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of his works include,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And numerous articles and small treatises. Some books have been translated to Arabic.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>His Teaching</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As soon as the Shaykh arrived in Gujranwala, while delivering sermons, he also established Madrassah Muhammadiyyah next to Jam’i Masjid Ahl ul-Hadith he was also a teacher at the madrassah and students from all over the country would enrol.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> Shaykh Muhammad Hanif Nadwi was from his batch of students and a plethora of other students benefitted. Shaykh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti, the celebrated historian and biographer was also a student of Shaykh Muhammad Isma’il as-Salafi.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was asked to replace Shaykh al-Albani in Madinah University in the faculty of hadith by Shaykh Abdul Aziz b. Baz and he sent Shaykh Abdul Qadir Shaybatul Hamd as his representative but Shaykh Muhammad Isma’il as-Salafi declined and said his country and locality needed his efforts more.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> He was constantly preoccupied in organizing the Jami’yyah in a structured and methodical way. In 1924 he organized the annual all India Ahl ul-Hadith Conference in Gujranwala. After 1924 when Shaykh Thanaullah Amritsari was chosen as the leader, Shaykh Isma’il as-Salafi visited him with his close friends. Later in 1349H (1930) when Shaykh Sayyid Muhammad Sharif Gharyalwi<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> was chosen as the leader and Tanzim Ahl ul-Hadith was formed, Shaykh Isma’il as-Salafi played an active and pivotal role.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Before the Creation of Pakistan</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After 1947 when the chaos and carnage subsided, Shaykh as-Salafi went to Shaykh Dawud Ghaznawi and convinced him to take a central rolw in the Tanzim Ah ul-Hadith. He happily obliged and continued to assume the role until 1963, fulfilling the academic and active perspectives. In 1963 Shaykh Dawud Ghaznawi died and Shaykh as-Salafi was appointed as the president of Markazi Jami’yyah Ahl ul-Hadith and remained in this post until he died in 1968.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1949 a meeting was held in the hall of Dar ul-Ulum Taqwiyatul Islam to establish Markazi Jami’yyah Ahl ul-Hadith. Shaykh Dawud Ghaznawi was elected as the president, Professor Abdul Qayyum the Secretary General. He later resigned due to his work commitments and Shaykh Ata’ullah Hanif filled the role for a short period. Thereafter Shaykh Isma’il as-Salafi took the role of secretary general of Markazi Jami’yyah Ahl ul-Hadith. He also remained the editor of al-I’tisam magazine from the beginning until the end. Shaykh Dawud Ghaznawi and Shaykh as-Salafi travelled around the country and asked scholars to work with them.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Politics</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1921 the political situation of the subcontinent was critical and at a crossroad; the whole region was up in arms protesting the illegal occupation of the British colonial imperialists. Shaykh Muhammad Isma’il as-Salafi had spent a significant portion of his early life in Wazirabad; which was a nucleus for anti-colonial imperialism. This shaped his thoughts and ideas of resisting the British colonialist and so when Shaykh Abul Kalam Azad visited Lahore to gain support and encourage resistance movement. Shaykh as-Salafi pledged his allegiance to him through his group, Hizbullah. Furthermore, during this period around 1921 he was involved and worked with other organisations that were active in dispelling the imperialists from their lands. In 1953, he was also very active in the movement against the Mirzai’s or commonly known as Qadiyanis and this was with and under the umbrella of Jami’yyah Ahl ul-Hadith West Pakistan.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>His Personality</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was of medium height with frown lines on his forehead due to years of thought and reflection. He was smart and articulate with insightful eyes. He was friendly and pleasant while adorning simple clothes. He had a simple walk but filled with awe. He was rich from the heart and humble in his personality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was very humble and modest with a happy attitude. He would always take an Arabic book with him on journeys and read it sometimes. He would eat little and when offered food he would often say let me remain independent when it comes to my stomach. If he was informed that someone spoke ill of him, he would say, Allah made them from those who wash my clothes i.e. cleaning his sins by giving their good deeds to him.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>His Manners and Habits</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Despite his extremely busy schedule and engagements he remained in one place and continue to spread the Quran and Hadith for over 50 years in a single area. He was even invited to teach in Madinah University, but he declined the offer saying his country and locality needed him more. He traversed great financial difficulties in the beginning of his da’wah but despite such setbacks he lived a simple life of humility and modesty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Yusuf Anwar said once I sent the Shaykh 15 rupees for a journey from Gujranwala from Faisalabad to attend a conference. However, the actual amount was 4 rupees, so the Shaykh returned the money and said, “I am not in a habit of receiving travel money and if my health is good and I am alive, I will attend.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Praise of the Scholars</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Ata’ullah Hanif Bhojiyani addressed him with the following words in a lengthy article documenting his works and efforts</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The outstanding, learned and most intelligent Shaykh Muhammad Ismai’il as-Salafi…<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ihsan Ilahi Zahir said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was from the Salaf that passed, a righteous person with whom the Da’wah spread after spending half a century in one city.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once he was with a group who were setting off for Hajj and it was prayer time. The Shaykh moved forward to lead prayer when an elderly man said, “My prayer is not valid behind you.” The Shaykh picked his handkerchief from floor and moved back and said to the elderly man, my prayer is valid behind you, so you may lead the prayer. The old man was embarrassed and apologised profusely and then fervently requested the Shaykh to lead the prayer.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad, the Shaykh’s son said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was suffering from a sort of nerve problems and the situation was not serious, however on the 25<sup>th</sup> of Dhul Qa’dah 1387H corresponding to 20<sup>th</sup> February 1968 on a Tuesday after Salatul Asr the Shaykh’s health deteriorated dramatically, and he passed away.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Yusuf Ghakarwi led his funeral prayer and a whole multitude of people from different walks of life attended.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">(This biography from is <em>Maqalat Irshad ul-Haq Athari</em>, 4:369-403, which I have very slightly adapted)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">[tn. introduction: This a very brief biography of Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi by his astute and perceptive student, Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq Athari. We find that the true people of knowledge have lofty, praiseworthy and beautiful character which is in accordance with the true teaching of Islam. Despite their vast knowledge, you will find them in them humility, modesty and taqwa. This should be a lesson for all aspiring students of knowledge. Seeking fame, status, and using titles which are not befitting for you, is not from the way of the Salaf, and is in fact a dangerous disease of the heart. Do not be amazed with the little knowledge Allah has given you, and never consider yourself above your brothers]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If a person is born with the qualities of knowledge and acting upon it, insight, virtue, truthfulness, zuhd, taqwa, honesty, integrity, intelligence and other qualities then we say this is the likes of <strong>Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi</strong> who died in <strong>Ramadhan 1405H corresponding to 4<sup>th</sup> June 1985</strong> on a Tuesday to meet his creator and left behind thousands grieving his loss.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was unwell for a while and it was during this period that I had the opportunity to meet him every so often. The last occasion was during the last days of Sha’ban (of that year) when his situation worsened and so I went to enquire regarding his health. He was unable to hear and all that remained was an acquaintance, and so I returned home in a state of sadness and grief. People would ask me concerning the Shaykh and I would say to them May Allah wish good for him as his health situation is bad and worrying. Thereafter, after a period of 4 months of illness the Shaykh passed away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The writer of these words sought knowledge and benefitted from the Shaykh in 1968</strong>. Liyaqatpur was my native area and in 1963 I completed the beginner level books from the local deobandi madrassah Qasim al-Ulum. My teachers advised me to go to Jamia Rashidiyyah in Sahiwal or Khayr al-Madaris in Multan (the madrassah of Mawlana Khayr Muhammad Jalandhari) however Mawlana Mufti Abdur Rahman of Kehraurpaka advised me to go al-Jamia al-Salafiyyah in Faisalabad, this was not because he was an Ahl al-Hadith but rather because his friend Shaykh Sharifullah Khan was teaching there, who was considered an expert teacher of the Ma’qulat. So eventually with my father’s permission I enrolled at al-Jamia al-Salafiyyah. However, Shaykh Sharifullah Khan had left al-Jamia al-Salafiyyah in 1962, nonetheless he was replaced by his student, the teacher of the scholars, Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Abdullah Budhiyamalwi.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> After completing the middle level education I went to Gujranwala to Jamia Islamiyyah Chah Shahan in my last year and this is when I had the opportunity to attend the lessons of the Shaykh (Muhammad Ghonadalwi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Lessons</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In my brief life I’ve had the opportunity to attend the lessons of various Shuyukh and teachers of the era but the prestige I experienced in Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi’s lessons I never experienced elsewhere. We had read about the special care and attention Imam Malik would undertake to deliver his lessons, while first performing Wudu, combing his hair, use Kohl and perfume himself, wear fine clothes and then teach, then our Shaykh would also do the same. He would always arrive on time. As soon as he would enter the masjid he would offer 2 rak’ahs for Tahayyatul Masjid and then focus on his lesson on hadith. One day there was torrential rain and the days were very cold, some us assumed that today the Shaykh won’t come and the lesson will be cancelled, however one our friends came running and told us while he was in a state of shock that the Shaykh is coming, so we all scurried and the Shaykh as per his norm, entered the Masjid and prayed his Tahayyah. Mawlana Muhammad Ali Muslim Chima mentioned to me that before the Shaykhs residence in Abadi Hakim Rayy he would travel from Ghondalwala every day by bicycle, we never ever saw him to be late, even once. One day the Shaykh generally mentioned that it has been five (5) years (in the teaching post) and it is Allah’s blessing that I have never been late for Madrassah, not even one day. Alas, where do we find people who fulfil their obligations with such responsibility nowadays.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the Tahayyatul Masjid he would sit in his position with great care composure and begin his lesson. The Shaykh had so much respect and reverence for hadith that even after one and a half hours he would remain sitting calmly in the same position and would at the very least just move his feet up and down, despite tiredness due to age, which is a natural affair. There was no possibility at all of him lying down on a pillow (due to the respect of hadith). During the lesson if he needed to scratch himself somewhere he would not stop saying the beloved words of <strong><em>Qala Qala Rasul Allah….</em></strong> He would respond to the Salam and and say Walaykum Asalam to whoever was attending the lesson. He would turn to the guest as soon as he would finish his lesson, greeting them with a smile and then ask them how they were, thereafter address their reason for coming.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Shaykh’s Qualities</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With Allah’s infinite blessings, he had a remarkable memory and vast knowledge. <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti</strong> wrote the truth when he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“His mind and memory were remarkable and without match. The affair of vast knowledge was as such that when he would talk about a matter, all the discussions and information pertaining to that matter would be put forth and nothing would be missed while his speech was articulate and continuous, there was no hesitancy or stuttering in his speech (when delivering ilm).”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many of his students have verified the veracity of his memory and presented ample testimonies which can be read in the special edition of <strong><em>al-I’tisam, vol.38, issues 1-2</em></strong>. In this regard you may read the testimony of <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Ashraf Sandhu</strong>, he writes:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Shaykh Hafiz Abdullah Amritsari’s memory and recollection was such that he had complete mastery over all books of Ulum and Fiqh. We observed regarding very difficult issues that when he needed to open a book to refer to an issue, then he would be at the right place straight away. This was also the affair with Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi, that whatever book he consulted, the themes and context would be completely preserved and accurate.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The result of this powerful memory was that when he would speak, it would be as if he was turning the pages and reading from the book and there was no feeling that he was slowing down or having difficulty in what he was teaching. He would teach the basics of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> for example, the difference between the Quran and hadith, the difference between Sunnah and khabar, the authority of hadith, the preservation of hadith, the writing of hadith, the categorization of the books of hadith, a summary of the life and times of Imam al-Bukhari, the importance of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari </em>and its authority, likewise and similarly the authority khabar al-wahid, <strong>the specification of khabar al-wahid and issues of apparent contradiction which would last approximately 15-20 days</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-8796 alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?resize=381%2C233" alt="Minhatul Bari" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?resize=300%2C183 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?resize=768%2C468 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?resize=1024%2C624 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?w=1322 1322w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?w=1236 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would talk about apparently conflicting narrations and then mention that according to the Shafi’yyah the first stage is reconciliation <strong>(<em>Tatbiq/Jam’</em>)</strong> and if that was not possible then declaring one to be <strong><em>nasikh</em> </strong>and the other <strong><em>mansukh</em></strong> and again if this was not possible then they would try to show one as being <strong><em>rajih</em></strong> and the other <strong><em>marjuh</em></strong> (one has precedence over the other) and if all of this was not possible then the ruling from both reports would be dropped. With the Ahnaf the first stage was abrogation<strong> (<em>naskh</em>),</strong> then giving precedence to one report over the other and then the last stage of trying to reconcile between the two reports <strong>(<em>Tatbiq/Jam’</em>).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While mentioning this he would say that in one instance Mawlana Anwar Shah Kashmiri says that doing <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong> has precedence over <strong><em>tatbiq</em></strong> because taking the <strong><em>rajih</em></strong> position is in line with the human natural disposition. However, at the same time he says and holds the view that it is permissible to specify the Qur’an (made <strong><em>takhsis</em></strong> of) by the Sunnah, whereas this is in reality from the angle of <em>tatbiq</em> and it is absolutely clear and manifest that the Quran is <strong><em>rajih</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, according to the Hanafiyyah specifying the Sunnah with the Sunnah and specifying the Quran with Mutawatir hadith and vice versa is permissible and they do not look at the strength of the evidence in this regard. He further said, (i.e. Shaykh Ghondalwi said) that it is amazing that Mr Kashmiri in this discussion of Usul holds the position of the Hanafiyyah to be correct, in that <em>tarjih</em> is the first stage compared to <em>tatbiq</em> but the various statements of Imam Abu Hanifah contradict this view of the Hanafiyyah. He (Anwar Shah al-Kashmiri) said in <em>Kitab al-Ghusl</em> (in his explanation of <strong><em>Sahih al-Bukhari, Faydh al-Bari</em></strong>) that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Know that different reports which have been transmitted from our Imam on a single issue (i.e. Abu Hanifah), then the general position of our Mashaykh is to give one report <em>tarjih</em> first and to take the manifest report and leave the rare or uncommon report but I do not take this view. This is especially the case when the rare or uncommon report is supported by hadith, then in such instances I take that report without caring that it is a rare or uncommon report. This is because any reports from our Imam, May Allah have mercy on him (despite being rare) it is not possible that he did not have evidence from the ahadith or anything else and so if we find the hadith agrees with his report, then we take it. Yes, and if there is disparity between the views of the Mashaykh,<strong> <em>tarjih</em> </strong>is a possibility due to differences between them and sometimes reconciliation between their statements may defy the purpose of the difference. This is because there is no option other than <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong> contrary to the differences that emanate from a single person, when reconciliation has precedence. This is because the principle is that there should not contradictions in the statement of a single individual and therefore reconciliation should take precedence before making <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong>. It is strange that when our people see apparently contradictory ahadith, they try to reconcile them but when they find differences in statements of the Imam they take up the position of <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong> first and leave the method of reconciliation. I like that the contradictory statements that have from our Imam to be first reconciled provided there is no evidence established against this.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You clearly see his words (i.e. Anwar Shah Kashmiri’s) and then in the introduction<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> he gives <em>tarjih</em> precedence over reconciliation but then on the other hand when there are differences in the views or statements of a person,  he holds that reconciliation has precedence over <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In summary Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi would deliver some introductory lessons for a number of days before teaching <em>al-Bukhari</em>. During his lessons he would not only suffice with explaining why the hadith was under the relevant chapter heading, clarification of the juristic points from the hadith, discussions on the controversial issues, a clarification and explanation of the difficult words, but he would also, while treading the path of the scholars of hadith, present brief biographies of the narrators in the chain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example, during the explanation of the first hadith in <em>al-Bukhari</em>, regarding the point of <strong><em>“Hadathana al-Humaydi”</em> </strong>Imam al-Bukhari transmit the hadith from his famous teacher, Imam Abdullah bin al-Zubayr al-Humaydi al-Qurayshi al-Makki, who in turn was the student of Imam al-Shafi’i and of al-Qurayshi lineage. Imam al-Humaydi collated his narrations as a Musnad which has been printed in two volumes. Imam al-Bukhari, by transmitting from Imam al-Humaydi intended to show revelation began in Makkah and thus transmitted his first hadith from his Makki Shaykh. Likewise, and similarly, since Imam al-Humaydi was a Qurayshi and due to the Prophets Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam’s words, <strong><em>“Begin with the Quraysh”</em> </strong>he transmitted his hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since Imam al-Humaydi was Imam al-Shafi’is student, the student like his teacher was also critical of Ahl al-Rayy. Since Imam al-Bukhari had severely criticized Imam Abu Hanifah and some of the hanafi scholars said that Imam al-Bukhari’s criticism of Imam Abu Hanifah was due to the influence of Imam al-Humaydi and his other teacher, Nu’aym b. Hammad, whereas this is incorrect. Imam Muslim and Imam al-Nasa’i also criticized Imam Abu Hanifah, so were they also influenced by Imams al-Humaydi and Nu’aym b. Hammad? There is another al-Humaydi who is famous and he is Imam Abu Abdullah Muhammad b. Abi Nasr, who collated the (biographies) of the narrators of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em> and he was the student of Imam Ibn Hazm.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The second narrator in the chain is Sufyan and there are two famous scholars of hadith with this name. One is Sufyan al-Thawri and the other was Sufyan b. Uyaynah. They were the contemporaries of Imam Malik and from the most trustworthy scholars of hadith in Makkah. Imam al-Shafi’i said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If it were not for Malik and Ibn Uyaynah knowledge in Hijaz would have departed.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Uyaynah like Imam Malik was from the Taba Tabi’in and I remember him vividly saying this part that he read the footnotes of Mawlana Ahmad Ali Saharanpuri (Hanafi) who referred to him as <strong>“Makki al-Tabi’i”</strong> and then said he made a mistake. So he would introduce the narrators comprehensively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the characteristics of the scholars of hadith is that they also sought knowledge from people who were lower (in knowledge or younger) than them in status without any hesitation which led to a specific category in the science of hadith, <strong>‘the narrations of the senior from the junior’</strong>. No matter how many amazing qualities a teacher has, he is still a human at the end of the day and who is free from error or mistakes? Imam Abdullah b. Mubarak said: <em><strong>“Who is safe from error.”</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> So if a teacher makes a mistake and then his student corrects him in the gathering then the Muhaddith wont feel any anger nor have animosity for the student because the fundamental aim is serve knowledge without any inkling for fame. Our Hafiz was also an example of these qualities. Hence, once during the lesson on <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> we were going over <em>Kitab al-Manaqib</em> and we got to the hadith of Anas RadiAllahu Anhu pertaining to the mi’raj. Sharik b. Abdullah narrates from Anas RadiAllahu Anhu and while discussing the hadith, Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Sharik b. Abdullah made a mistake in this hadith, he was unable to preserve the wording of the narration due to his weak memory. When he became the Qadi of Kufah his memory deteriorated and changed. Other than changing the chronology of the explanation and the details he presented for, ‘thumma Haddathana Fatadli’ the scholars of hadith have criticized this.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When he finished speaking I gathered my courage and said, Shaykh this is not Sharik b. Abdullah al-Nakha’i al-Qadi but in fact it is Sharik b. Abdullah ibn Abi Nimr because Imam al-Bukhari did not take any narrations from Sharik Qadi.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> However Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi disagreed and said the individual was Sharik Qadi. However, I still gathered courage and expressed the same view and then the Shaykh stayed quiet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The next day as per usual the Shaykh after reciting the khutbah addressed me and said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“What you were saying yesterday is correct the narrator is not Sharik Qadi but rather it is Sharik b. Abdullah bin Abi Nimr, who is truthful but he made mistakes and the scholars of hadith have criticised some of the wordings of this narration.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One can learn the open mindedness of the Shaykh from this example and an expansive readiness to accept the truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While explaining the ahadith under the <strong>“Bab Halwatul Iman” (The Chapter on the sweetness of Iman”</strong> he said the reality of Iman and its sweetness is something physical and something that one can also feel when one has hatred and dislike for sins, his soul is refreshed (tr. This means he feels his Iman increasing) which causes nur to flourish on the individual due to righteous actions on a truthful believer and therefore sometimes he smells something foul on evil sins and something fragrant due to good deeds. The Shaykh went on to present numerous evidences for this and also mentioned the narration of Jabir b. Abdullah RadhiAllahu Anhu that he was with the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam when a foul smell arose so the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Do you know what this foul stench is? This is the smell from the mouth of the people who backbite the Muslims”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, the hadith:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“When a person lies the angels due to his lying, move away from him.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So I asked the Shaykh is it possible that can happen even now, i.e. being able to smell the fragrance or a foul smell due to deeds. The Shaykh replied the Companions would also experience this which was due to the favours and blessings of Allah upon them. So, if a person maintains a strong powerful link with Allah he would perhaps also experience this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another incident is what is mentioned by <strong>Muhammad Rafiq</strong>, when I saw him I told him that I was studying with Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi and upon hearing his name he was pleasantly surprised. So I asked him if he knew him and he replied very well. Then he mentions that he used to live in Sheikhpura and during the night he would hear a sound in the drains which would increase day by day. We called many people to recite but nothing worked. Then someone advised us to get Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi to do ruqyah, so we bought him to our house and he stayed the night and then when leaving in the morning he advised us to disperse some water throughout the house on which he had recited. This not only helped with the problem but we also smelt roses on the house for three days, so he is indeed a great scholar and sitting with him is an indispensable treasure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another incident which the Shaykh narrated to us was something that occurred during his teaching spell in the Islamic University of Madinah. There was a person who would have severe pain in his back which would start suddenly. The Shaykh instructed him to come to him when the pain arose. So one day he came and the Shaykh put his hand on the pain and informed the person the pain was due to the effect of magic. So the Shaykh did ruqyah on him for a few days and Allah cured him. So I asked the Shaykh how did he know magic was done on him. The Shaykh replied that when I put my hand on his back I could smell a foul stench and I realized this was due to the effect of magic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Under <strong>Kitab al-Ilm</strong>, in the chapter to fix duties in rotation for learning knowledge Imam al-Bukhari cites the hadith of Umar RadhiAllahu Anhu that briefly talks about the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam divorcing his wives. The Shaykh went onto say that Allamah Shibli Nu’mani expressed the view the hadith indicates the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam had divorced his wives but this was only a false rumour and that <strong>Hafiz ibn Hajr</strong> said this false rumour was perhaps spread by a hypocrite, Shibli Nu’mani thus concludes, that narrations in that period were fabricated based on the analogical reasoning (qiyas) of the narrator and therefore the narrations must be scrutinised to see how much of he narration was based on the qiyas of the narrator.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While discussing this Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi said this was a historical event during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and irrespective of the type of rumours, everything must be investigated. Allah says: <strong>“When a fasiq comes to you then verify.” (Surah al-Hujurat:6)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam had exemplary interactions with his wives but despite this he separated from them for a month. It is also possible that a hypocrite may have spread this rumour, however this has no connection whatsoever with the Ahadith of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam but just one incident. The same incident was investigated by Umar RadhiAllahu Anhu and the reality of the issue became clear. The Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam separating from his wives for a month, is something which is established. Qiyas or the rumour is only connected to the understanding of the narrator that the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam divorced his wives and then to form a principle that there is analogical reasoning in the Prophetic Ahadith by a narrator is totally incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then the Shaykh went onto discuss (the issues with) Allamah Shibli’s interpretation and understanding of narrations.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> The Shaykh also said Shibli also rejects the hadith of Qartas (i.e. the hadith of the paper and inkwell during the last days of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam), he claims it was only narrated by Abdullah b. Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma when he was young.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi explained, this view of Allamah Shibli is incorrect because Abdullah b. Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma narrated the incident during the era of the companions and numerous students narrated it from him and when it was not denied or rejected by a single one of them is a reality of its authenticity and just because only one companion transmits a narration does not cause it to be spurious. Abdullah b. Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma also narrated the hadith of talaq and likewise Umar RadhiAllahu Anhu narrated the hadith, actions are by intentions and no other companion narrates this hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The summary of these points is that Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi did not only rely on the books explaining al-Bukhari and other books of hadith but that he was also aware of the disease of the hadith rejectionists in the subcontinent. He also authored two specific books against the hadith rejectionists.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While discussing a mutual issue between a hadith transmitted by Imam al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>There are five types of kissing</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) The kissing of Rahmah, when a parent kisses their child, like the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam kissed Hasan, Hussayn and Fatimah RadhiAllahu Anhum</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) The kissing of greeting, like when Muslims meet each other which is the practice in the Arab lands</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) The kissing of compassion, when children kiss their parents</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) The kissing of desires, when a husband and wife kiss.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) The kissing of love i.e. family, when a brother kisses his brother.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the chapter of writing Ahadith the first hadith Imam al-Bukhari mentions is the hadith of Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu which mentions his sahifah, which contains the hadith: <em>“A Muslim must not be killed for disbeliever.” </em>Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi said while discussing this hadith that the 3 Imams, Malik al-Shafi’i and Ahmad issued their legal edicts in conformation to this hadith. However, Imam Abu Hanifah was of the view that if a Muslims kills a dhimmi then the Muslim shall be killed in retaliation. Allamah Kashmiri has defended the Imam and after a long discussion he presents the following four answers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) In the hadith the disbeliever that is referred to is a combatant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) This hadith is in relation to stopping the blood spilt in the days of ignorance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) The ruling concerning the life of a dhimmi is the same as a Muslims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) During the sermon of the conquest of Makkah the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam announced the laws of retribution for the killing of a Muslim and the dhimmi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These four points that are provided in answer are far fetched and incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) Explaining that the disbeliever in the hadith is a war combatant is an extremely superficial point because the blood of a combatant is permissible irrespective anyway. In fact this understanding is in relation to an attribute and Allamah Shawkani has explained that this understanding is also unreliable according to the hanafi scholars themselves.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) Restricting the hadith to the blood of the people of ignorance is a claim that is without evidence and specifying or restricting something without evidence or proof is impermissible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) The dhimmi is terms of his life is not equal to that of a Muslim, Allah says: <strong>“The people of the fire and the people of Jannah are not equal.” (Surah al-Hashr:20)</strong> he also said: <strong>“</strong><strong>and never will Allah give the disbelievers over the believers a way”</strong> <strong>(Surah al-Nisa:141)</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> and what has been transmitted by Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu: <strong><em>“The Muslims are equal in their retribution of blood.” </em></strong>Therefore, saying the dhimmi is equal to the Muslim in terms of the sanctity of life is incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) During the conquest of Makkah thinking the Muslims and the dhimmis were being addressed in wrong in the first place because the disbelievers are not permitted to enter Makkah and Mr Kashmiri himself, the incident he refers to he says the person was not a dhimmi but rather a someone who fell into the ruling of a dhimmi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being, the Shaykh was mindful of the various explanations of Bukhari from <strong><em>Fath al-Bari, Umdah al-Qari</em></strong> as well as Allamah Kashmiri’s notes, <strong>Faydh al-Bari</strong> and at times he would vehemently express his views when needed. Sometimes he would answer Mr Kashmiri and the Shafiyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once I asked the Shaykh:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Did you meet ever Allamah Kashmiri and have a discussion with him? He replied no, “I never met him, however, once he came to a conference organized by Mawlana Abdul Wahid and in those days an Arab student of knowledge used to study with me. So the student visited Mawlana Kashmiri and discussed some issues of aqidah with him. After his discussion with the Mawlana, any issues the student didn’t understand, he would come and ask me (and I would clarify them to him). So, this coming and going to Mawlana Kashmiri continued for a few days. In the end while leaving him, the student said to him (i.e. Mawlana Kashmiri):</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>لولا الشيخ محمد جوندلوي لأضللتني</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If it were not for al-Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi, you would have misguided me.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Shaykh as a Mufassir</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I also benefitted from the Shaykh while he explained and translated the meaning of the Qur’an. First the Shaykh would begin with discussion the issue of the Qur’an being the speech of Allah which would be followed by explaining the difference between the Quran and Hadith, defining the knowledge of tafsir, the methodology of tafsir, tafsir via transmitted reports and tafsir through opinion as well as other sciences like reason for revelation etc. Once I asked which tafsir was better, he replied if Mawlana Abdul Aziz Muhaddith Dehlawi had completed his tafsir it would have been unrivalled.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our Hafiz and Shaykh was also expert exegetist of the Quran in addition to being a great Muhaddith. I heard from some of the teachers in al-Jamia al-Salafiyyah that when the Shaykh was teaching there, he would deliver lessons on the Quran after the morning prayer and he took 10 months just on Surah al-Fatihah. While at al-Jamia Islamiyyah in Gujranwala, the Shaykh would deliver the Khutbah in Masjid of the Jamia. Shaykh Isma’il al-Salafi was also alive at the time and his sermons were also extraordinary on a range of issues and also include guidance on the socio-political issues which would also be published in <em><strong>al-I’tisam</strong></em> magazine. However, despite this I would pray behind Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi and I would be eager to know what the subject of the khutbah would be each week. The reader will be astonished to know, as I was, that the Shaykh spent almost a whole year explaining the ayah <strong>“He has certainly succeeded who purifies himself And mentions the name of his Lord and prays.”</strong> <strong>(Surah al-A’la: 14-15)</strong> in his Friday sermons every week.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh would say while detailing the requirements of the person who explains the Quran that: “It is necessary for an explainer of the Quran to have the following requirements, to have the correct belief accompanied with the correct intention, having knowledge of hadith and its sciences, the language of the Quran and that he should have comprehensive understanding of Imam Raghib’s <em><strong>Mufradat al-Quran</strong></em>. He must know Sarf, Nahw, the meanings, the knowledge of fiqh and its principles, speculative rhetoric and the knowledge of the variant methods in recitation, so that Allah’s aids him in his explanation.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It can be said without any hesitation that Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi possessed all these qualities and requirements. He would explain the ayah, <strong>“You Alone we worship and you alone we ask for help</strong>”<strong> (Surah al-Fatihah: 4)</strong> in a way that the listeners would be astounded. He would explain in detail the meaning of worship, the difference between worship and habitual norms or customs, why and how Allah should be worshipped and the reasons for worship. In this regard he would explain the difference between worship and obedience and refute the ideas of <strong>Allamah Mashriqi </strong>and<strong> Mawlana Mawdudi</strong>, who would say that establishing Allah’s law (on earth) was in essence and in reality worship and that the prayer, fasting and zikr were merely part of a training course.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh also clarified the difference between worship and obedience and also refuted the ideology and principles of <strong>Mawlana Mawdudi</strong> in a specific book titled, <em><strong>Tanqid al-Masa’il</strong> </em>which is printed. The book does not have the publication date, but it seems to be around 1957ce, this was when Mawlana Mawdudi deviated from his methodology of da’wah all of a sudden, and he would describe the first method of da’wah as the way of the Prophets. Thereafter, contrary to the first method, when he adopted the scientific method of da’wah, aiming for success and reformation with elections and leadership as a policy, which he declared to be prohibited and impermissible before.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people of knowledge know, with this (new) decision and policy of his, 70 of his close allies left him, some of whom were considered the pivotal central core of <strong>Jamat Islami</strong>. It has been a few years his previous associates refuted him, i.e. Mawlana Mawdudi’s understanding of worship, which include the likes of <strong>Mawlana Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi</strong> in his <strong><em>“Asr Hadhir Mein Din Ki Tafhim wa Tashrih” </em></strong>(The Understanding and Explanation of the Religion in Current Times) and Mawlana Manzur Ahmad Nu’mani’s <strong><em>“Mawlana Mawdudi Ke Sath Meri Rafaqat ki Sarghazisht Awr Ab Mera Mawqif”</em></strong> (The History of my Association with Mawlana Mawdudi and My Position on him Now) only when <strong>Mawlana Mawdudi’s</strong> book, <strong><em>“Quran Ki Char Bunyadi Istalahain”</em></strong> (Four Fundamental principles of the Quran) started to emerge in the market. However, our Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi sensed the danger way earlier and comprehensively refuted him in his <em><strong>Tanqid al-Masa’il</strong></em> and warned the nation from the dangerous ideas of Mawlana Mawdudi. May Allah give him a great reward, Amin. I wish to expand on his more but this is not the place for this, however, the avid reader can refer to <em><strong>Tanqid al-Masa’il.</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh said regarding the reality of ghulu while explaining the ayah <strong>“do not commit excess in your religion” Surah al-Nisa:171</strong> that Allah and his Messenger established the limits for the affairs of the Din and therefore exceeding that does not entail reward but rather it entails punishment. Exceeding the prescribed limits in the Din is ghulu and excessiveness. If this excessiveness is in belief, transactions, in places and situations it is considered ghulu, if it is in knowledge then it is considered to be implementation and if it is regarding mannerisms and worship then it is considered to be monasticism, if it is in customs or habits then it is considered compulsion. If it is it do with purification and to keep impurities away it is considered to be whisperings and if it is regarding the lack of preservation of the usul and furu then it is considered to be oppression.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said in explanation of the ayah <strong>“O you who have believed, enter into Islam completely” (Surah al-Baqarah:208)</strong> this ayah commands complete submission and obedience to Islam and a warning against the path of the misguided nations which traversed the path of shaytan <strong>“So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part” Surah al-Baqarah:85</strong>. It is incorrect to take some aspects of Islam and reject the rest and one can only abstain from misguidance after research. It is taqlid that pushed fanaticism and partisanship in Islam. The dissension and discord between the Hanafi’s and Shafi’s was so intense that let alone praying behind one another, they would not marry each other. They issued legal edict that debating with one another was like jihad and it was permissible to break the fast in order to debate with much energy and such historical facts are very lengthy to discuss.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The straight path which was one was divided into quarters and this was why <strong>Allamah Sha’rani</strong> said doing taqlid of one Madhhab does not act on the complete shari’ah. This ayah also refutes the notions above because it advocates complete submission and obedience to Islam and to live in peace and harmony because in <strong>fis silmi</strong> the meaning of silmi is also harmony. Allah said <strong>“And if they incline to peace” (Surah al-Anfal:61)</strong>, in this regard the meaning of the ayah would be oh honest people live with each other in complete harmony and peace and do not be disunited and differ while following the way of shaytan. The summary is that this ayah refutes the ideas bigoted taqlid and supports the concept of research and investigation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said in explanation of <strong>“Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans” (Surah al-Baqarah:62)</strong> he talked about the Sabiyyah and the condition of doing righteous deeds. He also mentioned that <strong>Mawlana Abul Kalam Azad</strong> made a mistake in understanding this ayah because he said that a jewish or christian person believes in Allah and the hereafter while doing righteous deeds, he will worthy of paradise and this is incorrect. This is because believing in Allah entails and obligates believing in the Messenger, who guides to the worship of the creator. So, therefore, if a person believes in Allah and not the Messenger he sent then this is synonymous in him rejecting Allah. In fact, a person has to believe in all of the Messengers and rejecting a single one is disbelief because the jews and Christians do not believe in Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam as the Messenger of Allah so therefore it is incorrect to say they have faith. This ayah also has the wording “and did righteousness” which is restricted to obeying and following the Prophet. Allah says <strong>“Say, [O Muhammad], &#8220;If you should love Allah, then follow me” (Surah Al-Imran:31)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Pakistan and Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In additional to Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi being a distinguished teacher, researcher, Muhaddith, Mufassir, Munazir and author, he was also involved in politics. He was in favour of the two state solution. This was the reason he supported Muslim league for the Pakistan independence movement and not only this, he was also the president of the Muslim league branch in Gujranwala and offered a credible role in the independent Pakistan movement.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Who does not know that the intent in establishing an independent Pakistan was solely to create an Islamic environment and in light of the Quran and Sunnah to spread the message of living (Islamically) to the sad state of affairs of the world and similarly to present a practical example of an Islamic state. However, how disconcerting is this affair that despite continuous efforts this noble and sacred ideology was sidelined that let alone completing this objective the future generations are distancing themselves from Islam. Most of the shortcomings lie and fall with our people of authority and leadership, who did everything in this country but nothing for Islam. This action of these people is synonymous to betraying Allah and his Messenger. Some of which they were punished for by the annexing of East Pakistan (i.e Bangladesh) and the remainder of which we hear on a daily basis. Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi vividly felt these realities so much so that it led him to write:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If the Islamic constitution is not established in Pakistan it will never be safe and there is a real danger that it might break way (into separate states) from a geographical, language and tribal (or regional) perspective. There is a dire need for the Islamic constitution to be established here due to logical perspective and not on the basis of religious devotion. So whoever wishes for a constitution other than an Islamic constitution to be established in Pakistan and he exerts efforts and works towards this, then in reality he is someone who betrays the country. They intend to weaken Pakistan and dividing in to states or wanting it to integrate with India again.&#8221;</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The affair is manifestly clear that there was only one way to protect and defend Pakistan and also to guard it from conflict, which was to establish an Islamic constitution immediately. However, due to stark reality this was not achieved and as a result the same things happened which Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi had expressed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this era, not just Pakistan rather the whole Islamic Ummah is subject to division and discord. The enemies of Islam are in agreement in exterminating the Muslims but a shame the Muslims are disunited. So what should the Muslims do, who feel the pain of the Ummah and what steps should they take. So Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi also offers some valuable advice and thoughts on this, he says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>In this era the world is divided into three parts, politically speaking; The socialist or communist block, the western block (Democracy) and the Islamic block. In such circumstances it is mandatory on all Muslims to support the Islamic Block and all of the Muslims countries should be united into one nation and they should be united on a single point of interest (or demand). All of the Muslims leaders of the different countries should be organised into a group which will make the decisions and all of them should have the same Islamic constitution as well as the education system and where as much as possible, to be lenient on distinctive law pertinent in the different countries as much as possible and finally anything that prevents unity between the Muslims which revolves around, nationalism and language, the utmost effort should be exerted to eliminate them.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, you can understand how much passion he had with regards to unifying the Muslims. He despised division and discord on a national level nor divisions on a global Islamic level. On the contrary he understood global Islam based on the words of the blessed Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam that: <strong><em>“The example of the Muslims is like a single body” </em></strong>as a single body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>An Embodiment of Knowledge and Action</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was in terms of his knowledge some one who upheld the Sunnah and a true embodiment of beneficial knowledge. He was scholar with taqwa and zuhd. He was someone who spent his nights awake in the servitude of Allah, in fact this was his norm from the days he was a student. <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Abduh</strong> narrates from <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Yunus Dehlawi</strong> when Shaykh Ghondalwi was studying in Delhi he would pray tahajjud in a masjid which was further away from Chandni Chowk. One evening he was going to the masjid when a guard blew his whistle. The Shaykh due to his simplicity decided to run and fell when he approached the masjid. The guard by then had caught up with him and arrested him under the pretense of being a thief. The masjid administrators eventually were able to free him once they found out. His night prayers were long with good recitation of the Quran. While reading the ayahs of glad tidings it would seem real. His trembling voice would give away his fear of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His attention to his prayer was such that his acclaimed student <strong>Shaykh Ataullah Hanif mentions the Shaykh never missed the first Takbir of the prayer for approximately 50 years</strong>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> He would also focus on the recommended acts besides those which were obligatory and Sunnahs. He would always offer 2 units of prayer when entering the masjid and would never sit without offering them. After offering his Tahajjud prayers at home he would go to the Masjid and instruct the Mu’adhin to call the Adhan at its correct and allocated time. He would then proceed to make zikr with full concentration.  After sunrise he would offer his Salatul-Duha and then return home and he would the same with the optional prayers after Maghrib.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My brother in Islam <strong>Shaykh Shahbaz Ahmad Salafi</strong> mentions once a questioner came before prayer time. He said i’ve come to know you are a senior scholar of this city, so could you assist me? After helping him the Shaykh said: <strong><em>‘Someone has misinformed you, Shaykh Muhammad Isma’il al-Salafi is the senior scholar, he is the khatib of the of the large masjid, im just a student of knowledge and the Imam of a small masjid.&#8217;</em></strong> After everyone had departed, his affair of humility and modesty was such that he cried through the whole prayer while he led us in prayer. Allah Allah, what a stature of humility, humbleness and modesty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The attachment Shaykh had with the Quran can be deduced from the following example that <strong>Shaykh Sufi Muhammad Akbar</strong> mentioned. In 1984 the Shaykh’s health deteriorated and he was taken to hospital. It was during the month of Ramadhan and the doctor prohibited him from fasting. During the days of severe health concerns he continued to make zikr and recite the Quran. <strong>Later, he expressed his sadness in not being able to fast but also expressed that during this period he was able to finish 30 recitations of the Quran, meaning that he would recite the whole Quran in one day</strong>. It was the same affair during the end of his days when he was in a hospital in Lahore, he was constantly engaged in the remembrance of Allah from his heart and tongue. When people would come to meet him and ask about his health, he would reply with a brief answer and then continue in his Zikr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One day after the Shaykhs death I visited <strong>Shaykh Ataullah Hanif</strong>, during the visit the phone rang. I gathered from the phone conversation Shaykh Hakim Abdul Rahim Ashraf was on the other end and he called to offer his condolences. Shaykh Ataullah’s voice spoke with fear and his eyes became wet and said in a very saddened tone, <em>“Hakim Sahib, not only has the Musnid of Ilm passed away but the gatherings of remembering and pondering have also finished.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh besides talking about knowledge would also encourage righteous actions and remembering Allah. I also had the pleasure to benefit from this and the issues that troubling me before I spent time with the Shaykh were alleviated by the Shaykhs admonitions and advices. In my early days there was a lack of attention but I eventually maintained a link of knowledge and its people. <strong>The Shaykh was unique that if I missed a lesson, he would ask about me.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After finishing my education, I joined Idarah Ulum al-Athariyyah and after every 2 or 4 months I would visit the Shaykh to ask about difficult issues. These gatherings would last long with the Shaykh. After departing from the Shaykh it would seem like I have acquired major wealth and it was this feeling that would give me the inclination to return.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once I went through a period when I was unable to achieve tranquility in my prayer, I was unable to concentrate on my zikr nor have the zeal to research. So, I wrote to the Shaykh. He replied very quickly and instructed me with some duas and invocations, after which those feelings disappeared.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have already mentioned his attention and focus on the obligatory and acts of sunan. After the second sajdah and the brief period of resting, it is the norm of the scholars of hadith to support oneself on the ground, but what is the defined method? This is something that was differed over. However, the Shaykh would support himself with his fists, just as one kneads dough. This resulted in marks on the knuckles, just as one get marks on the ankles (from Tawarruk). I remember very clearly while studying Sahih al-Bukhari when he explained this issue, he read the statement in the marginal notes of Sahih al-Bukhari (1:114), <strong><em>“The jurists says one should support himself just as one kneads dough, as cited by al-Kirmani.”</em></strong> He said the notes mention the word <em>al-Abin</em> but the correct ward is al-Ajin has <em><strong>al-Kirmani</strong></em> has mentioned in his explanation of <em><strong>al-Bukhari</strong> </em>(5:176).<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Abul Barkat Ahmad</strong> mentions the Shaykh would focus on fasting on the white days, but when he became weak he stopped keeping them. However, after this he suffered from nose bleeds and he said, <em>“I realise, the nose bleeds were controlled by fasting and this has happened due to not keeping the fasts.”</em> The point being the Shaykhs was a true example of the Salaf in terms of knowledge and action.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Translated And Compiled By </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Abu Ubaydah</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: center"> <span style="color: #000080">Some Of The Companions Who Conquered The Indian Subcontinent (Hind / Sindh)</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The conquering of Hind i.e. Sindh and Makran (modern day Balochistan in Pakistan and Iran) was during the caliphate of Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) before the famous Muhamad Bin Qasim. The Companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) already reached Hind / Sindh as mentioned by Ibn Kathir in his al-bidiyah wan nihiyah vol no.9 pg no.88. The companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) who entered Sindh were well known for having knowledge of hadith and the Islamic Sciences. Some of them are mentioned below:</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Uthman ibn Abil &#8216;As Thaqafi (Radi Allahu Anhu) </strong></span></em></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">He was the paternal uncle of Uthman Ibn Affan (Radi Allahu Anhu). Ibn Hazm wrote that he was a highly righteous companion, the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) made him the Amir of Ta&#8217;if. He carried out one expedition in Faris (Persia) and three in Hind. (Jamharatun Ansab ul-Arab pg no.266)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Abdul Bar mentioned that the people of Madinah and the people of Basrah narrated hadith from him. Imam Ahmad narrated a saying about him from Hasan Basri who said that I have never seen anyone more in virtue than Uthman Ibn Abul &#8216;As (Radi Allahu Anhu). We used to go to his house to narrate hadith from him. (Isti&#8217;ab bidhayl Asabah vol no.3 pg no.92)</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Hakam ibn Abil &#8216;As Thaqafi (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The first expedition he did here was at Baruch (Gujarat) which was based on the command of his brother Uthman ibn Abil &#8216;As Thaqafi (Radi Allahu Anhu). (Futuh ul-Buldan pg no.430). The second time was in 23 Hijri where Makran was conquered (Tarikh ul-Islam vol no.2 pg no.48 and al-bidiyah wan nihiyah vol no.7 pg no.141). Imam Bukhari, Ibn Abdul Bar and Ibn Hibban counted him amongst the scholars of Basrah and Muhadithin. (at-Tarikh ul-Kabir vol no.1 pg no.229, Isti&#8217;ab vol no.1 pg no.306, Kitab ath-Thiqat vol no.1 pg no.39)</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Rabi&#8217; ibn Ziyad al-Harithi (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Amir of Basrah Abu Musa al-Ash&#8217;ari (Radi Allahu Anhu) sent him to lead an expedition at Makran and Kerman (modern day south east Iran) (Chach Nama pg no.73).</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Hakam ibn Amr Tha&#8217;labi (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In the 23 of Hijri he was part of the conquest of Makran (Tarikh at-Tabari vol no.4 pg no.181, Isabah vol no.1 pg no.246). One of his narrations is present in Sahih Bukhari and he also has narrations present in other books of hadith.</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Sihar ibn Abbas Abdi (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He was with Hakam Ibn Amr Tha&#8217;labi (Radi Allahu Anhu) in the conquest of Makran and through him Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) received the good news of the conquest and spoils of war. He narrated two or three ahadith from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). He was counted amongst the scholars of Basrah.</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abdullah ibn Umayr ash-Ja&#8217;i (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In the 23 of Hijri he was part of the expeditions of Faris and Makran. During this era he provided excellent assistance towards conquering Sijistan (part of modern day eastern Iran, southern Afghanistan and western Pakistan) and some connecting areas of Sindh.</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Ubaydullah ibn Ma&#8217;mar Taymi Qurashi (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Uthman (Radi Allahu Anhu) sent him on an expedition to Makran in the 29th of Hijri. Urwah Ibn Zubair and Ibn Sirin narrated from him. </span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Mushaji&#8217; Ibn Mas&#8217;ud Sulami (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In the 31 of Hijri he was part of the conquest of Qufs (modern day south Afghanistan and Balochistan) and Kerman. His narrations are present in the Sahihayn. </span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abdurahman Ibn Samurah Qurashi Abshami (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He was part of conquering Khurasan, Sijistan, Zabulistan (modern day south Afghanistan) and Kabul etc. During these expeditions he was also part of conquering some areas of Sindh and Makran. He narrated from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and many of the Kibar Tabi&#8217;in narrated from him such as Sa&#8217;id Ibn Musayib, Muhamad Ibn Sirin and Hasan Basri etc. </span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Sinan Ibn Salamah Ibn Muhbiq Huthali (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He entered Sindh in 42 Hijri for the first time and carried out expeditions. The second time he entered it he came back as a leader of the expedition and conquered a lot of areas.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In addition to the above, Suhail Ibn Adi Ansari, Asim Ibn Amr Tamimi, Abdullah Ibn Abdullah Ibn Utban Ansari, Mugirah Ibn Abul &#8216;As Thaqafi, Mundhar Ibn Jarud Abdi, Uthman Ibn Sa&#8217;d and other than them (Radi Allahu Anhum) were part of the conquests of Sindh and Makran. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">All of these companions found blessings and success in Sindh. In the year 62 Hijri Sindh was blessed with the burial of Mundhar Ibn Jarud Abdi (Radi Allahu Anhu) who passed away here. According to some researchers he is the only companion buried in this land.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Arrival Of The Tabi&#8217;in And Taba Tabi&#8217;in In Sindh</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">During the beginning of the conquest of Sindh there were many scholars of the Tabi&#8217;in and Taba Tabi&#8217;in who were part of the expeditions. Some of them are below:</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Hakim Ibn Jablah Abdi</strong></em></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">He was alive during the time of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) but sadly did not meet him. Khalifah Ibn Khiyat mentions that he was a judge in Sindh during the era of Uthman (Radi Allahu Anhu). (Tarikh Khalifah Ibn Khiyat). He was the first Islamic judge of Sindh. </span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Hasan Basri </strong></em></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">He stayed in Sijistan, Makran and the surrounding areas in Sindh for at least two and a half years during the era of the rightly guided caliphs. He carried out expeditions as well as spreading knowledge. In the year 30 Hijri he was the scribe and administrator of Rabi&#8217; Ibn Ziyad Harithi (Radi Allahu Anhu). He would fight for Islam and give Islamic verdicts. Ibn Sa&#8217;d has mentioned that in the era in which Hasan Basri was busy carrying out expeditions, Jabir Ibn Yazid would give Islamic verdicts in his place, and when Hasan Basri would return he would give Islamic verdicts. (Tabaqat Ibn Sa&#8217;d vol no.7 pg no.180). </span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Jabir Ibn Yazid Ju&#8217;fi Kufi </strong></em></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><span style="color: #000000">In the year 30 Hijri he was with Hasan Basri in the expeditions around Sindh. He also gave Islamic verdicts here. </span></span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Sa&#8217;d Ibn Hisham Ansari  </strong></em></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><span style="color: #000000">He was the paternal cousin of the famous companion Anas Ibn Malik (Radi Allahu Anhu). Imam Bukhari and Ibn Sa&#8217;d have mentioned that he was martyed during the expeditions at Makran. (at-Tarikh al-Kabir vol no.2 pg no.67, Tabaqat Ibn Sa&#8217;d vol no.7 pg no.209). His narrations are mentioned in the six books of hadith. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">From the above we can see how great scholars were around in the Sindh area and they spread their knowledge whilst being there. On one occasion the conqueror of Makran Ubaydullah Ma&#8217;mar Taymi (Radi Allahu Anhu) wrote to Abdullah Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) whilst being in Sindh and said, we have obtained peace and serenity here, we have no fear of enemies, we have lived in this area for seven years and we have become parents&#8230;(Isabah vol no.2 pg no.432)  </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #000080">The First Markaz For Spreading Hadith In Sindh Was In Debal (Part Of Modern Day Karachi)</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Debal was the first city in Sindh to establish a hadith Markaz. The most famous scholar who taught in this area was Abdurahim Ibn Hamad Debali. Yaqut al-Hamawi said, &#8220;There is a group of Muhadithin who are attributed to this city.&#8221; (Mu&#8217;jam al-Buldan vol no.4 pg no.118). Ibn Jazari mentioned, &#8220;Debal is a coastal city in Sindh where a group of many scholars are attributed to it.&#8221; Khatib Baghdadi mentions the saying of the narrator Ahmad Ibn Imran that, &#8220;&#8230;My friend Khalf Ibn Muhamad ad-Debali al-Mawazini narrated to me that we heard from Ali Ibn Musa Debali at Debal&#8230;.&#8221;(Tarikh Baghdad vol no.8 pg no.333). Afterwards these Debali scholars went to Baghdad and narrated the hadith as mentioned by Sam&#8217;ani, &#8220;Khalf Ibn Muhamad al-Muwazini ad-Debali narrated the hadith of Ali Ibn Musa Debali at Baghdad.&#8221; (Ansab Sam&#8217;ani mentioning Debal). Additionally, Abul Qasim Ibn Muhamad Debali narrated hadith from Abdurahim Ibn Yahya Debali in the city of Debal. Abu Nu&#8217;aym mentions the saying of his Shaykh Muhamad Ibn Ja&#8217;far Ibn Yusuf in Tarikh Isfahan that,&#8221;We heard from Abul Qasim Shu&#8217;ayb Ibn Muhamad Ibn Ahmad Ibn Shu&#8217;ayb ad-Debali said that we heard from Abdurahim Ibn Yahya ad-Debali. (Tarikh Isfahan vol no.1 pg no.345). I will mention other famous Sindhi scholars alongside him below: </span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Abdurahim Ibn Hamad Debali </strong></em></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><span style="color: #000000">His lineage goes back to the tribe of Thaqif who entered Debal with the expedition of Muhamad Ibn Qasim. He travelled from Debal to Basrah and that is where he became known for his knowledge and virtue. The grandfather of Imam Uqayli mentioned that a big scholar from Sindh came to Basrah who narrates hadith from A&#8217;mash and Amr Ibn Ubayd. (Lisan ul-Mizan vol no.4 pg no.410). Khatib al-Bagdadi mentions that he was from the well known pious scholars of his time and was similar to the likes of scholars such as Harith Mahasibi, Hatim Asam and Shafiq Balkhi etc. (Tarikh Bagdad vol no.8 pg no.9251)      </span><em><strong><span style="color: #000000"> </span> </strong></em></span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Qays Ibn Yasar Sindi</strong></em></span></h5>

<p><span style="color: #000000">After the conquest of Qayqan (an area in modern day Balochistan) a number of the local people became Muslim. In particular a tribe called Muqsim Qayqan. A person named Ibrahim was from this tribe and he would regularly go to Basrah to carry out trade and business. He ended up marrying a lady from Basrah who was from the tribe of Bani Shayban. Her name was called Ulayah Bint Hasan and from this marriage came many famous scholars and Muhadithin. Some of their names are as follows:</span></p>
<ol>

<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #333399">Students From Sindh Who Travelled To Seek Knowledge </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The famous Imam Abul Abas al-Asm (Died 346 Hijri) used to teach in Baghdad. He had students of knowledge from around the entire world who would come and study from him. Imam Abu Abdullah Hakim said that I have not seen any study class in any city of the world of Islam which has students of knowledge from the East and West than the class of Imam Abul Abas al-Asm. It is also mentioned that a group of students of knowledge came from Mansura (Which is near modern day Shahdadpur in Pakistan), Multan and Sijistan etc. to his classes. (Ansab of Sam&#8217;ani vol no.1 pg no.9291). </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Mansura Was Another City In Sindh Which Had Muhadithin </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Mansura became a great Muslim city that thrived with knowledge as mentioned by Maqdisi Bashari that, &#8220;There is a lot of nobility and Islamic virtue and values there. There are plenty of scholars and knowledgeable people. Business is also thriving there and the people are very intelligent.&#8221; (Ahsanul Taqasim). He also goes on to say that, &#8220;Most of the scholars of Mansura are Ahlul Hadith. I saw Qadhi Abu Muhamad Mansuri who was an Imam of the Dawud Dhahiri madhab. He conducts lessons and authors books. He has written many good books.&#8221; (Tabaqatul Fuqaha Shayrazi)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Lahore, Qanuj And Qasdar </span></h4>
<p>In Sindh, Lahore and Qanuj also gave rise to people of knowledge. Qalqashandi said, &#8220;The city of Lahore is a very big and blessed place. A group of scholars have come from here.&#8221; (Subhul A&#8217;shi vol no.5 pg no.76). Maqdisi Bashari said, &#8220;There are very big scholars in Qanuj.&#8221; The first person to have conquered Qasdar was Mundhir Ibn Jarud Abdi (Radi Allahu Anhu) in the year 62 Hijri.</p>
<p>Apart from the above there were numerous scholars who were from the Sindh region.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Books Written By Scholars From Sindh</span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Rabi&#8217; Ibn Sabih was the first person to author a book in Basrah and after him it was Sa&#8217;id Ibn Abi Arubah. (al-Muhadith al-Fadhil pg no.611). After he added fiqhi codification to ahadith he went to Sindh for Jihad and died and was buried there in 160 Hijri according to the historians. Imam Bukhari mentions that he died in the land of Sindh in 160 Hijri. (at-Tarikh ul-Kabir vol no.2 pg no.285), Ibn Hajr also mentions this from Muhamad Ibn Muthana etc. (Tahdhib at-Tahdhib). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">It has already been mentioned that Imam Makhul had Sindhi lineage. Ibn Nadim mentions that he authored two books, Kitab as-Sunan Fil Fiqh and Kitab ul-Masa&#8217;il Fil Fiqh. (al-Fihrist 118). Abu Ma&#8217;shar Sindhi Madani authored a book called Kitab ul-Maghazi in the same era that Muhamad Ibn Ishaq and Musa Ibn Uqbah authored Kitab ul-Maghazi in Madinah. In the year 270 Hijri a scholar from Mansurah who knew many languages, translated the Quran and wrote the tafsir of it in Sindhi for the Raja (ruler) of Aror (modern day Rohri in Sindh Pakistan, this city was once the capital of Sindh) called Mahruq Ibn Ra&#8217;iq. The purpose of it was to explain to him the teachings of Islam. It is reported that he used to explain the ayat of the Quran to the non-Muslim Raja in open court and remained there for a period of three years. It has been further stated that during the course of translation when the Muslim scholar reached the ayah in Surah Yasin &#8220;He said, &#8216;who will give life to the bones when they are totally rotten&#8221; (Quran 36 ayah 78) the Raja alighted from his throne and threw himself on the ground. He remained in a long prostration weeping bitterly in such a manner that his face was covered with dust. He then raised his head and addressed the court, “Indeed Allah is the sole Ilah, the nourishing benefactor of the whole world.” When the scholar returned to Mansurah he said that the non-Muslim Raja had accepted Islam but kept his intentions secret for loss of the throne. (Aja&#8217;ib ul-Hind)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">There was a Muhadith called Abu Ja&#8217;far Sindhi who authored a book on Hadith. Imam Bukhari mentions that Amr Ibn Malik Rasibi borrowed the book of Abu Ja&#8217;far Sindhi and supplemented it with Ahadith. (Mizan ul-&#8216;Itidal vol no.2 pg no.35) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abu Ja&#8217;far Tusi mentions in Kitab ul-Fihrist that Abul Faraj Sindhi authored a book which was narrated through the chain of Muhadithin to us. (Mu&#8217;jam al-Musanifin vol no.3 pg no.33). Abul Faraj Sindhi was well known scholar of the past who narrated ahadith. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Ali Ibn Ahmad Debali&#8217;s book Adab al-Qadha was a well known accepted book of those who followed the Shafi&#8217;i madhab. Abu Umar Ahmad Ibn Sa&#8217;id Hindi Qurtubi was an exceptional scholar of this time. He authored a book on Ilm ash-Shurut which was very beneficial and detailed. This was widely accepted and relied upon by the scholars of Magrib and Andalus just as it has been mentioned by Qadhi Iyadh in Tartib al-Madarik. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abu Nu&#8217;aim mentions that Abu Ishaq Ibrahim Ibn Sindhi was an excellent scholar of Usul. (Tarikh Isfahan vol no.1 pg no.193) It seems as though he had a well known book of Usul. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abu Bakr Muhamad Ibn Raja Ibn Sindhi Isfara&#8217;ini took the book of Sahih Muslim and narrated it through the chain of Imam Muslim&#8217;s teachers or the teachers above them. A book written like this is called an Istikhraj and Takhrij. This book was called Mustakhraj Abi Bakr Sindhi Isfara&#8217;ini where only a remnant of it is now available. He became well known as Sahib us-Sahih Ala Shart Muslim. (Tadhkiratul Huffadh vol no.2 pg no.230).   </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abdullah Ibn Hasan Ibn Sindhi Andalusi authored a twenty volume book on Zuhd and Raqa&#8217;iq. Ibn Asakir mentions that the twentieth volume has been seen and a big group of Muhadithin have narrated in it. (Mukhtasar Tarikh Ibn Asakir vol no.7 pg no.363) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The Qadhi of Mansurah Abul Abas Ahmad Ibn Muhamad Mansuri had many durus and authored many books. Maqdisi Bashari mentions that he met him in Mansurah and wrote, &#8220;He has a well established study Majlis and authored many exceptional books.&#8221; (Ahsan ut-Taqasim)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Yaqut Hamawi wrote in Mu&#8217;jam al-Buldan, &#8220;He authored some books on the Dawudi (Dahiri) madhab.&#8221; Ibn Nadim mentions in al-Fihrist that he authored exceptionally good and great books. Some of them are Kitab ul-Misbah, Kitab ul-Hadi and Kitab un-Nir which has also been called Kitab un-Nirin. This book became so famous and well known that he became known from this book and was nicknamed author of Kitab un-Nirin as mentioned by Ibn Qaysarani in al-Insab ul-Mutafiqh. Sheyrazi attributed him as author of Kitab un-Nirin in Tabaqat ul-Fuqaha. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">There were two Sindhi scholars who were students of Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. They had unique knowledge of issues and specific narrations from him. One of them was called Hubaish Ibn Sindhi Baghdadi which Abul Khilal mentions about him that he was one of the major students of Imam Ahmad. He wrote twenty thousand ahadith from Imam Ahmad and he had two volumes of important Masa&#8217;il and Fatawa from Imam Ahmad which other students did not have. (Tabaqat ul-Hanabila vol no.1) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The other Sindhi scholar was Abu Bakr Sindhi Khwatimi which Abul Khilal mentions that he was equivalent in companionship and studentship as Abu Harith. He used to stay with Imam Ahmad and his children. He heard important and excellent Masa&#8217;il from Imam Ahmad. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abu Musa Ibn Sindhi Jurjani narrated ahadith from Imam Waki&#8217; Ibn Jarah. He had all of the books of Imam Waki&#8217; and these books were counted as the best from him. Suhmi mentions in Tarikh Jurjan that he had the books of Imam Waki&#8217;. (Tarikh Jurjan pg no.426)  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abu Ja&#8217;far Muhamad Ibn Ibrahim Debali he narrated Sufyan Ibn Uyaynah&#8217;s book Kitab ut-Tafsir from Abu Abdullah Sa&#8217;id Ibn Abdurahman Makhzumi. He also narrated Abdullah Ibn ul-Mubarak&#8217;s book al-Bir Wa Sula from Abu Abdullah Husayn Ibn Hasan Marwazi who narrated it from Abdullah Ibn Mubarak. (al-Aqd ath-Thamin Fasi pg no.397). Muhamad Ibn Ibrahim Debali had the unique reputation of narrating these two books. The scholars of hadith used to narrate books from him.   </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the partition he moved with his family and some elders to Chak no.36 in the Jaranwala district, which is in the greater district of Faisalabad and to its western side. The Pakistani nomenclature for villages which dates back to British rule is Chak, which is a Punjabi word, which essentially means village and instead of names, numbers and letters are used to identify villages in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The Shaikhs title of Chathwi is from the Urdu word translation of the number 36, which was the village he moved to after migrating from India during the partition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the nephew of the great Ahl al-Hadith scholar and the son in law of Shaikh Abdullah Budhyamalwi, who spent his whole life going from institute to institute and teaching the clear meanings from the Quran and Sunnah, giving Hadith it&#8217;s due right and superior importance, above and beyond the opinion of men and those who just referred back to the opinion of men within the madhabs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After moving to Pakistan, he joined the madrasah of Mian Muhammad Baqir which was Khadim al-Quran wal-Hadith and at the time Shaikh Muhammad Siddiq Karpalwi was teaching there. Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi remained at this madrasah for 2 years and learnt and studied with Shaykh Muhammad Siddiq Karpalwi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then moved to Owdanwala and enrolled at Shaikh Sufi Abdullah&#8217;s madrasah known as Dar al-Ulum Ta&#8217;lim al-Islam. It should be noted Shaykh Sufi Abdullah was not a Sufi as we know the term to denote but rather it was a colloquial term used for pious and righteous people. Shaykh Abdullah Amjad remained here for another two years and studied with versatile scholars like Shaykh Abdus Samad Rauf, Shaikh Muhammad Yaqub Quraishi, Shaykh Muhammad Sadiq Khalil and Shaykh Abdullah Budhyamalwi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His fellow students also went onto become major scholars and Shuyukh al-Hadith in their own right from the likes of Shaikh Abdur Rashid Hazarwi who was the Shaykh ul-Hadith in Dar ul-Hadith in Okara and the Shaykh and Qadi Muhammad Aslam Sayf as well as many others.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Abdullah Amjad’s Quest for Knowledge</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdullah Amjad was the nephew of Shaykh Abdullah Budhyamalwi and was was also married to his daughter. When Shaykh Abdullah Budhyamalwi moved from Owdanwala to Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara, Shaykh Abdullah Amjad also went with him. While at Okara Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi studied books of Hadith with Shaykh Muhammad Bhathwi, he studied the books like <em>Jame Tirmidhi, Sunan Abi Dawud</em> as well as other books on other sciences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the teachers that were teaching in Jamia Muhammadiyyah in those days was the Hadith Master Shaykh Muhammad Abduh al-Falah, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad had the opportunity to study books <em>Hujjatullah al-Balighah, Mutanaba, Sharh Aqaid al-Nasafi</em> and others with him. Shaikh Abdullah Budhyamalwi who was fulfilling the role of Musnad as Shaykh ul-Hadith and so in this regard Shaykh Abdullah Amjad studied <em>Sahih al-Bukhari, Tafsi<span style="color: #000000;">r Baidhawi</span></em> as well as other important books of the sacred science of advanced level.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During these years and specifically around 1953 the movement for upholding and honouring the Finality of the Prophethood was in full force. The government of Pakistan at the time was supporting the Qadiyani&#8217;s ie Mirzai&#8217;s. The people objected to the beliefs of the Qadiyani&#8217;s and their desecration of the Finality of the prophethood. Shaykh Abdullah Amjad was also very instrumental and highly active in this movement ie preserving the honour and finality of the prophet of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi wasallam. He along with a few other companions would visit the local areas and he would explain the deviation of these corrupt beliefs, the importance to uphold the honour of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi wasallam as well refuting the beliefs of the Qadiyani&#8217;s. The Shaykh at the time was just a teenager, perhaps when he was either 17 or 18.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When this fitnah subsided Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi continued with his studies, he took the exam for <em>Hujjatullah al-Balighah</em> and the paper was written by the eminent scholar of the Ghaznawi family, namely Shaykh Muhammad Dawud Ghaznawi, the Shaykh Alhamdulillah passed the exams with high marks. Once Shaykh Abdullah Amjad met Shaykh Muhammad Dawud Ghaznawi while in Lahore and Shaykh Ghaznawi asked Shaykh Abdullah Amjad to come to his Institute to teach and he also told him they would bare the complete expenses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was because Shaykh Abdullah Amjad had already studied a few books with Shaykh Muhammad Ishaq at Shaykh Muhammad Dawud Ghaznawi’s institute known as Dar al-Ulum Taqwiyatul Islam and some books at Jamia Ashrafiyyah. Shaykh Abdullah Amjad declined the kind and benevolent request and explained that he would be teaching in Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara whilst also seeking knowledge by studying and reading certain books on the sacred sciences to Shaykh Abdul Mannan Kamelpuri and Shaykh Abdul Qadir. When Shaykh Dawud Ghaznawi heard that he wanted to study with Shaykh Abdul Mannan, he said to him, to go ahead and continue to study and also teach at the same time. So he studied a few books on mantaq ie logic with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter at the behest of Shaykh Mu&#8217;in ud-Din Lakhawi, Shaykh Abdullah Amjad began teaching. Shaykh Abdullah Budhyamalwi was already teaching in Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara and when Shaykh Abdullah Amjad graduated in 1956 he began teaching at Jamia Muhamadiyyah, this is also where he had spent most of this time learning. After graduating and teaching at Jamia Muhammadiyyah, the people became well acquainted with him, his manners, and deep knowledge of the sacred sciences. Due to the status which Allah granted him, he became known amongst the students who would come to him to seek knowledge.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Teachers</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had numerous teachers which include the likes of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul -Hadith Wal-Tafsir Shaikh Abdullah Budhyamalwi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Hadith Muhammad Abduh Falah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Hadith Wal-Tafsir Muhammad Abdullah Rawpari</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Hadith Muhammad Yaqub</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Bhathwi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Siddiq Karpalwi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdus Samad Rauf</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Yaqub Quraishi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Sadiq Khalil</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Ishaq</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Mannan Kamelpuri</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Qadir</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Legacy as a Teacher Over Half a Millennia </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh continued to teach in Jamia Muhammadiyyah for 4 years, during which time he taught, <em>Sunan Nasai, Mishkat al-Masabih, Jame Tirmidhi, Tafsir Jame al-Bayan, Kafiyyah, Talkhis al-Miftah, al-Fiyyah</em> and other books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter the Shaykh ul-Hadith Abdullah Veruvalwi spoke to Shaykh Abdullah Amjad and asked him to come to Faisalabad to Dar al-Quran wal-Hadith, during the same year Shaikh Abdullah Budhyamalwi who was the Shaykh ul-Hadith also left Jamia Muhamamdiyyah and went to Jamia Salafiyyah in Faisalabad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdullah Amjad taught in Dar Al-Quran wal-Hadith in Faisalabad for 4 years, thereafter Shaikh Ismail Salafi requested Shaikh Abdullah Amjad to come to teach Jamia Salafiyyah in Faisalabad where he taught the <em>Muwatta of Imam Malik</em>, <em>Mukhtasar al-Ma&#8217;ani</em> and <em>Musallam al-Thabut</em>. He remained in Jamia Salafiyyah for a whole year and also taught other books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter at the behest of his teachers Shaikh Muhammad Abduh Falah and Shaikh Mu&#8217;in al-Din Lakhawi he returned to Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara by fulfilling the request of his teachers. During his first year there he taught <em>Sahih Muslim</em>, <em>Sharh Aqaid al-Nasafi, Muwatta Imam Malik, Sunan Abi Dawud</em> as well as other books. At the time Shaikh Muhammad Abduh Falah was the Shaikh al-Hadith and in 1970 Shaikh Muhammad Abduh Falah transferred to Jamia Ulum al-Athariyyah which was another learning institute in Faisalabad and so Shaikh Mu&#8217;in al-Din Lakhawi gave the position to Shaykh Abdullah Amjad and made him the Shaykh ul-Hadith of Jamia Muhamamdiyyah. In total and in general Shaikh Abdullah Amjad taught in Jamia Muhammadiyyah for 18 or so years and also taught <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> for a number of years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During the years 1973-1974 the problems of the Finality of the Prophethood of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi wasallam remerged and Shaikh Abdullah Amjad and Shaikh Mu&#8217;in al-Din Lakhawi were fervent in the movement to preserve the finality of the Prophethood of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and their severe refutation of the Qadiyaniyyah. Eventually both Shaikhs were arrested and put into prison and numerous other people were also with them in prison. The Shaikh continued delivering lessons and sermons on the Quran and its explanation while in prison.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh continued to teach in Jamia Muhammadiyyah for a few years after he was released from prison and thereafter the Shaikh went to a village called Pak Patan which was next to a place called Arifwala. In Pak Patan the Shaikh taught in Jamia Ishat ul-Islam for approximately 10 years, despite the fact Shaikh Mu&#8217;in ud-Din tried to stop him from leaving Jamia Muhamamdiyyah, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad replied that he had given his word.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After 10 years in Jamia Ishat ul-Islam he moved to Arifwala at the request of the Ahl al-Hadith people there. The Shaikh further spend 1 and half years teaching in Arifwala, after this period the administrators of the institute were having financial problems and had to let the Shaikh move on. During this time the Ahl al-Hadith brothers at Chichawatni learnt of the circumstances and thus some of the elders went to Arifwala and asked the Shaikh, the other teachers as well as all of the students to all come to Chichawatni and the Shaikh began teaching at their institute, Jamia Ishat al-Ulum al-Muhammadiyyah. The Shaikh remained here for 1 year and due to unforeseen circumstances the Shaikh had to leave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter, Shaikh Atiqullah Salafi and other respected people met Shaikh Abdullah Amjad and requested that he come and teach at their institute of Dar al-Dawah aAl-Salafiyyah situated at Satyana Bangla, which was situated in the district of Faisalabad. Since leaving Chichawatni, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad remained in Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah as the Shaykh ul-Hadith and Mufti and this is where he continued to teach until he died this week from approximately 1993, making it approximately 24 years of teaching in Satyana Bangla.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While in Satyana Bangla the Shaikh taught many books as one can imagine, he taught for example, <em>Hidayah, Tafsir Baidhawi</em> and of course <em>Sahih al-Bukhari.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh apart from his usual lessons would also deliver lessons and lectures on the explanation of the Quran during the whole month of Ramadhan, which he continued for 30 or more years which the students would benefit from immensely.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the Shaikh giving a lesson on the Quran in Satyana Bangla, Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOtJTFg8Az0">SEE HERE</a></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh has been teaching from approximately 1956 and has continued to teach well over half a millennia and probably closer to 60 years or so. In this regard he has taught classical fundamental texts numerous times, year in year out. He has taught the <em>Muwatta Imam Malik</em> many times as well as teaching <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> at least 40 times. Besides being an expert and specialist teacher he was also an excellent orator. He also had an analytical debating mind and would often engage in discussions with the people of knowledge of the various different methodologies.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Shaikh Abdullah Amjad Teaching Bukhari</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh loved to teach Bukhari and he would thus teach it with great diligence with giving each Hadith, the narrators and the points of benefit it&#8217;s due right and attention. He would take his time and make sure every student had understood each point. He would test them on a regular basis and the students in the same way would come prepared. At times if the students were ill prepared the Shaikh would be very firm and reprimand them, he would explain the lesson to them and then later show them kindness and highlight the importance to learn and memorise the knowledge. Some days the Shaikh would deliver two and sometimes even three lessons in a single day on Bukhari, which showed his love for this tremendous book on the saying of our Beloved Prophet Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi wasallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The rector of Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah, Shaikh Atiqullah Salafi informed us, the day before his death on the 14th of August 2017, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad gave his usual lesson on <em>Bukhari</em> and the the students were eventually dismissed but he wished to continue teaching as he did not feel content. So the students returned and the Shaikh continued with his explanation and lesson on <em>Bukhari</em> which he then finished for a second time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Atiqullah Salafi also mentions on the same day on the 14th of August 2017, there was a meeting at the university and the discussion was regarding starting a new class in a particular location and the idea was that any teacher that lived near the location should deliver it for convenience’s sake. However, none of the other teachers volunteered to take the role of teaching or beginning the class. So Shaikh Abdullah Amjad decided to deliver the first lesson for the opening of the class. Shaikh Abdullah Amjad delivered the lesson after Maghrib for approximately 1 and half hours on explaining the Quran.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7735 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah1.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="salafiyyah1" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah1.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah1.jpg?resize=768%2C576 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah1.jpg?w=960 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah, Satyana Bangla</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Atiqullah Salafi said I have known Shaikh Abdullah Amjad for over 2 decades and in all the time I have known him as teacher at Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah he has never taken a single day holiday or time off, he never came late, not even a minute, he never wasted anytime time especially of the students. Another student mentioned that once the Shaikh was extremely ill with severe fever but the Shaikh still came to teach without missing the day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was very simple in nature, without excessive talking and would only speak when needed. He would spend hours with students teaching them and answering questions when needed. Sometimes students would visit him throughout the day asking questions. Sometimes other dignitaries and students would come to visit him to ask questions and to benefit from him. When the people would ask him questions he would reply to them strictly from the Quran and Hadith and he would also give the references for the Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh also had another unique characteristic in that when he would answer questions and provide evidences he would also add any further discussions that could arise from the evidences. So he would say the answer is this Hadith and if someone claims such and such then the answer to that is this Hadith etc and this is how the Shaikh would cover all possible alternative issues when people would ask him questions. It was such unique characteristics that raised Shaikh Abdullah Amjads rank as a highly proficient Mufti.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah-bukha2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7734 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah-bukha2.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="salafiyyah-bukha2" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah-bukha2.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah-bukha2.jpg?resize=450%2C600 450w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah-bukha2.jpg?w=720 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Shaikh Abdullah Answering Questions as the Mufti</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh would also travel to Raiwind to deliver the Friday Khutbah which was periodically over 40 years, Raiwind is approximately 109Km / 68 Miles directly from Faisalabad but driving via the main roads takes in excess of 2 and half hours one way. So one can imagine the diligence and the effort Shaikh Abdullah Amjad would endure to deliver a Friday Khutbah and with this it must also be noted which is by no means an easy journey at such tender ages past the age of 60 and then doing this for 40 years periodically, at least once a month is something one needs to be in awe of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During one Khutbah in 1999 the Shaikh began to vomit blood but he continued and finished the Khutbah. The Shaikhs sermons would last 50 minutes or so and the people Alhamdulillah would listen attentively without showing any signs or disengagement. Thereafter the Shaikh limited his visitations and reduced his sermon times. It is very evident such students who learnt and listened to the Shaikh are the ones who benefitted the most and hence became scholars and students of the sacred sciences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was extremely humble and filled with immense humility, when people would ask him questions he would refer them to his students while saying they have good knowledge on this subject. Once a person asked him a question pertaining to Hadith and the angle was from rejecting Hadith, so Shaikh Abdullah Amjad told him to go to his student, Shaikh Irshad ul-Haq Athari. This shows his humility and the status of his students.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another time he was delivering a lecture and there were other scholars on the stage and so Shaikh Abdullah said, these Mashaikh are perhaps younger than me in age but they have more knowledge than me. This was from the Shaikhs humility, wara and taqwa. The reality was none of the Shaikhs were even near Shaikh Abdullah&#8217;s knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh had hundreds of students whilst teaching for over half a millennia and making a list of all of them would be near enough impossible. The Shaikh would always ask about his students, how they were and what they were doing, he would always convey his Salam to them. Sometimes visitors would come to him and he would ask them about his student who had studied with many many years ago and at times over a decade ago. This shows the love of a teacher for his students, that even after graduating he remembered them wishing them good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Aside from the daily teaching routine, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad would visit the students in their quarters everyday after Asr, where the students would ask general questions and issues related to their subjects and curriculum, the Shaikh would answer them with great patience and comprehension.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh would also look after his health and this is evident because the Shaikh died at an old age, and all praise is for Allah the giver of life. Once the students asked Shaikh Abdullah Amjad what his daily routine was. He replied that whilst he was a student and teacher in Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara, he would eat two apples everyday and he would play volleyball between Asr and Maghrib.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Shaikhs Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A teacher is often recognised by the calibre of his students. From them are the likes of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Allamah and Muhaddith Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq al-Athari</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shaikhs-irshad-and-amjad.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7732 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shaikhs-irshad-and-amjad.jpg?resize=267%2C477" alt="shaikhs-irshad-and-amjad" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shaikhs-irshad-and-amjad.jpg?resize=168%2C300 168w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shaikhs-irshad-and-amjad.jpg?w=539 539w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Shaikh Irshad humbily Greeting Shaikh Abdullah Amjad</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is well known for his knowledge and especially the science of Hadith. He has many detailed books on Hadith and narrators and also his specialty in correcting the false notions and errors of the hanafi madhab. His book <em>I&#8217;la Al-Sunan Fil Mizan </em>is a testimony to this. He also has numerous other books that are highly beneficial. His is one of the instrumental scholars who has kept the people of innovation at bay, so much so that one of the heads and defenders of the hanafi and deobandi madhab in Pakistan had to say about Shaikh Irshad that we ie the hanafis and deobandi cannot take charge of the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafi&#8217;s while their Ibn Taymiyyah of this era is around, and he was referring to Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq al-Athari.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Shaykh is of this calibre and status, one would naturally would like to know who his teachers are, since they produced such a brilliant student and scholar in his own right. Approximately 1999-2000 Shaykh Irshad ul-Haqq al-Athari visited England and Alhamdulillah we spend every second of our time with him, so upon asking him who his teachers were he mentioned Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi as one of them. So from that day we were acquainted with the Shaikh and then every so often upon reading the biographies of some of the other Shuyukh, we would read Shaikh Abdullah Amjad’s name as one of the teachers.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Shaikhs Last Hours</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After delivering his lesson and explaining the Quran for 1 and a half hours after Maghrib, he prayed Isha in Jama&#8217;ah and around 10.00pm he felt some pain in his shoulders which later subsided. Later in the night at 2.00am the Shaikh felt the pain again, thereafter which he was taken to a hospital in Faisalabad and passed away while returning to our creator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was the typical day in the life of these great scholars delivering lessons in the day on <em>Bukhari</em> whileexpounding and explaining the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi wasallam and then explaining in the Quran in the evening, what such great solace can a person have in propagating the Quran and Sunnah and then meeting our Rabb.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This great Salafi scholar of the Ahl alHadith died at the tender age of 82 years after having spend in excess of 60 years teaching and propagating the Quran and Sunnah. He died in Faisalabad around 2.00am on the Dhul Hijjah 1438H corresponding to 15th of August 2017. His funeral prayer was on the same day after Asr in Satyana Bangla which was attended by thousands of people, students and scholars alike.</span></p>
