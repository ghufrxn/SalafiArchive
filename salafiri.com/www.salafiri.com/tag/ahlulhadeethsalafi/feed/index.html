				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[10] al-Lamhat Ila Ma Fi Anwar ul-Bari Minuz Zulumat</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> </strong></span><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Allamah Muhammad Rais Nadwi (1430H)</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Discussing the Reality of Imam Abu Hanifah Being Tabi’i According the Usul Of The Hanafi Madhab </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and documented the Imam was born in 80H of the period of Prophet ie in other words the era of the companions. The last companion was Abu Tufail Amir bin Wathilah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), who according to the most correct opinion died in 110H (Taqrib ut-Tahdhib).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore according to this the Imam encountered 30 years of the companions era, in other words the Imam was around 30 years during the time of the companions. These 30 years were the last years of the companions. Some narrations mention after the death of Anas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), who died in the year 90H or 91H until 110H (until the death of Abu Tufail) ie during this 20 year period only one companion was alive, namely Amir bin Wathilah and there was no other companion during this 18 or 20 year period.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even if there were a handful of other companions who were alive during this era, one can only conclude and deduce the Imam encountered a limited period of time of a very few companions. Some hanafi authorities with great desperation and exhorted efforts have enumerated the names of 20 companions in the 30 years from the time of the birth of the Imam up until the era of the companions. (Rad al-Mukhtar 1/44)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mentioning some of these names is an outright and clear error whereas some of the companions died literally a few days after the birth of the Imam when he was a very small child. Those the Imam saw when he was at a tender age and or when he was at an age where it was possible to see them, then there affair is such that every intelligent person knows that any individual alive at a particular time cannot see every person who is alive during his era. Meeting everyone, hearing from them or accompanying them is something far from reality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even the author of Anwar, even with numerous resources is not able to see the millions of people alive during his era. Even myself I have not seen the author of Anwar and their prestigious centre of learning ie Deoband or most of its teachers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author of Anwar has ascertained the death of imam Shafi to have been in 150H and the death of Imam Abu Yusuf in 182H. In other words both imams were living in the same era for approximately 32 years, but the author of Anwar writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Imam Abu Yusuf and Imam Shafi’i did not convene at one place just as Allamah Ibn Taymiyyah, Hafidh Ibn Hajr and Hafidh Sakhawi have also clarified. As for some of the masanid of Imam Abu Hanifah which have been transmitted by Imam Abu Yusuf via Imam Shafi’i are incorrect because Yusuf has been incorrectly written as Abu Yusuf and this Yusuf is bin Khalid as-Samti and Allah knows best.” (Muqaddimah Anwar 1/179 via Hasan al-Taqada)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So according to the author, although both imams were living in the same era for 32 years they never met or saw each other. Then we ask how does one conclude that the imam being around during the time of the companions would have seen them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Lamhat Ila Ma Fi Anwar ul-Bari Minuz Zulumat (2/265-267)</span></p>

<span style="color: #000080;">[7] Ibra Ahlul Hadith Wal Quran Mima Fi Jame ash-Shawahid Min at-Tuhma Wal Buhtan</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Of</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Shaikh Abdullah Muhadith Ghazipuri (1337H)</span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Rebutting the Slanderous Accusation on the Ahlul Hadith; The Prophets made mistakes in the Din</span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Compiled and Translated </span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(In reply to the allegation on the Ahlul Hadith that they believe the Prophets made mistakes in matters of the din.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have looked at the passage of the aforementioned book and I did not find the said passage, the author has made a slanderous accusation here. The words of the author are that all of the prophets were not free from error (in worldly affairs) and not in the din as the authored slanderously alleged.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the author cited this passage from Mawlana Abu Shakur Silmi’s <em>Kitab at-Tamhid Fil Ilm al-Aqa’id Wat Tawhid</em>. Raising further allegations is also pointless because most of the people of Sunnah hold the same belief.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu Hanifah has himself said in his book Fiqh al-Akbar, <em>“without doubt (the prophets) did make mistakes and errors.”</em> (Sharh Fiqh al-Akbar pg.69, Matba’a Hanafi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Haq Dehlawi Hanafi said, <em>“The prophets would also do ijtihad and they would sometimes make mistakes.”</em> (Sharh Futuh al-Ghayb pg.314)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For further references refer to</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8211; Sharh Fiqh al-Akbar pg’s182-183, Matba’a Hanafi</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <em>&#8211; Sharh Mussallim at-Thabut pg.349 Naulkishaur print, of Mawlana Abdul A’la Lucknowi</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <em>&#8211; Husami pg.98 Naulkishaur Print.</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <em>&#8211; Tawdhih Wat-Talwih pg.317 Naulkishaur print.</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <em>&#8211; Nur al-Anwar pg’s 182, 183, 212</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <em>&#8211; Tafsir Kabir 4/569, 570, 652, Istanbul Print.</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <em>&#8211; Tafsir Baidhawi 1/324, Naulkishaur Print</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <em>&#8211; Tafsir Ahmadi pg.277</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the belief which the author attempted to level against us is null and we are free from it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However others from amongst Ahlus Sunnah like Qadhi Abu Bakr Baqilani had this belief, they believe the prophets made mistakes and errors in propagating the din and in the rulings. They have clearly said it is possible the prophets erred and lied in spreading the rulings of the din. (Hashiyyah Abdul Hakim al-Khiyali pg.251, Sharh Musallim at-Thabut pg.388 of Mawlana Bahr al-Ulum, Sharh Mawaqif pg.688, Sharh Fiqh al-Akbar pg.67)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ibra Ahlul Hadith Wal Quran Mima Fi Jame ash-Shawahid Min at-Tuhma Wal Buhtan pg. (51-53)</strong></span></p>

<h3>For a while now the hanafis have been rebuking the Ahlul Hadith merely because they reject people’s statements and the opinion of men, that they give precedence to the authentic reports and narrations from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and they obey and follow him In everything.</h3>
<h3>I swear by him in whose hand my soul is in, they (The Ahlul Hadith) have no fault except that they have rejected the statements of the mujtahids over the texts of the shariah. The muqallidin found this very unfavourable and hence embarked on a relentless campaign of hurling abuse. It is such that they started calling them despicable names such as La-Madhab (those without a madhab), Ghair Muqallid, Wahabi and those who abandon the Imams.</h3>
<h3>This behaviour and temperament is manifest from them and most of the people know this and have witnessed it from them. Furthermore, they claim that this way (the way of Ahlul Hadith) is a new way and does not conform to the others. Therefore in this regard I authored this treatise and I have only quoted hanafi books in order to silence those who abuse, calls us names and to establish the proofs on them.</h3>
<h3>……</h3>
<h3>For instance Asaam Ibn Yusuf would raise his bands whilst going into ruku and whilst rising from it and likewise and similarly other scholars would do certain actions (not legislated in the Hanafi madhab) but yet they were still considered to be from the Hanafi school of thought and they would not be expelled from it. We find that they were not bigoted or staunch but rather just and fair. However the hanafis of this day and age lack any justice and fairness not like the hanafis of the past. This is the reason why they are very forthcoming with their name calling and the abuse they hurl with their tongues.</h3>
<h3>…..</h3>
<h3>And what profound words are of those Shaikh Shah Waliullah Muhadith Dehlawi who said in his Wasayah that all issues of Fiqh should always be relegated to the Quran and Sunnah, “so issues of fiqh should be referred back to the Quran and the Sunnah and only those that conform and concur should be accepted. The Ummah has no choice in this (if their opinions or statements differ with the Quran and Sunnah). Similarly it is impermissible to listen to the Mujtahid who is stringent in the taqlid of his imam, his opinion and position which contradicts the Quran and Sunnah. With the aim of getting closer to Allah, it can only be achieved by staying away from such people.”</h3>
<h3>Zahra Riyadh al-Abrar Ma Yugna an-Nas An Hamal al-Asfar Ena al-I’tilaf limaja Rawayat Muhaqiqi al-Ahnaf Wa Raf’a al-Ikhtilaf (Pg.25-31) First Edn. 1964ce</h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>The Madhab of Ahlul Hadith is old And the Ignorant Ones</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Compiled and Translated</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Ahlul Hadith is a old and Specific Madhab</strong></h3>
<h3>So our opposers due to their lack of knowledge think the Ghair Muqallideen sect (this is how they name and address us due to their lack of knowledge and instead of referring to us as Ahlul Hadith) is a new movement and hence there was no specific madhab prior to this. So we say our way is an old methodology and yet they counter claim and say there are only four main madhabs and their is no other specific madhab upon the way of the muhadithin or the Ahlul Hadith.</h3>
<h3>The fact of the matter is that if these people had looked in the very same books that are well known and agreed upon, then they would have found the madhab of Ahlul Hadith and also found it to be a specific and separate madhab from the four madhabs. It is known that these books don’t encompass the other madhabs or statements from them, you will rather find statements and opinions that are required on a regular basis.</h3>
<h3>Therefore you will find the names of Imam Ahmad and Imam Malik less in these books. In these writings the authors will write the Fiqh opinion of the madhab of the Ahlul Hadith different to the other madhabs thereby deducing the madhab of Ahlul Hadith to be a separate entity. This therefore clearly elucidates this madhab is old and existed in previous times and various authors in different era referred to this madhab, this was something they credited and highlighted a madhab to be referenced at various instances.</h3>
<h3>So this is the madhab of the people that are ignorantly labelled as Ghair muqallidin or La Madhab in the same way the people in our times criticise them and create all kinds of false aspersions about them. The truth is that it is a madhab, the madhab of Ahlul Hadith and in essence the correct methodology of Islam.</h3>
<h3>(For example the saying in the issue of consensus, Talwih mentions, “The general Ahlul Hadith are on this opinion.” (pg.354, Naulkishaur)</h3>
<h3>and on the issue of the permissibility of Qunut an-Nazilah, “And a group of Ahlul Hadith are upon this.” (Fath ul-Qadir Sharh Hidayah (pg.188), Naulkishaur)</h3>
<h3>and on the issue of nullification of the fast with Hijamah it says, “as the Hanabillah and the Ahlul Hadith say” (Fath ul-Qadir Sharh Hidayah (pg.411) and much more.</h3>
<h3>(Refer to Sa’iq al-Ibad Ila Matalib al-Irshad Sharh al-Irshad Ila Sabil ar-Rashad Fi Amr Taqlid Wal-Ijtihad (pg.308)</h3>
<h3>Why is the Madhab of Ahlul Hadith Rejected.</h3>
<h3>Since these people are in reality ignorant and unaware of the facts because they continue and chose to be on the religions of their forefathers in a customary manner. They continue in this way as if they are blind folded and strangers to this madhab. So they fail to understand and on the contrary formulate all kinds of false allegations and problems whilst they themselves adamantly present their madhabs in a pristine way without any errors.</h3>

<h2 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Imam Badi ud deen Shah Rashidi Sindhi (1416H)</strong></span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Compiled and Translated</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reciting qunut before or after the ruku in the last rakah are both established from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) (Bukhari, Nasai and others) however the narrations mentioning reciting the qunut after the ruku are more in number hence this is given precedence (Baihaqi).</h3>
<h3>Furtheremore, raising the hands during the qunut or saying Allahu Akbar is a Bidah ie an innovation because there is no evidence for both actions in any hadith, rather infact there is no authentic chain reported from a companion that they raised their hands at such an instance.</h3>
<h3>On the contrary those who opine that one should raise their hands do so by reasoning (Qiyas) on the raising of the hands in the Qunut an-Nazilah ie calamity or affliction for example like Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal has verified and accepted. (Mukhtasar Qiyam ul-Layl)</h3>
<h3>With regards to any individual from the Ummah saying that we should raise our hands cannot be superimposed on the words of the leaders of both words the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam), even though if it may be good to observe or to look at (ie the action of dua in the Witr) whereas in reality he is free from it.</h3>
<h3>If however it was something good or beneficial the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) would have most definitely not kept it from us because this would be treachery and Allah has purified him of this.</h3>
<h3>Refer to Raf’a as-Satr Min Ahkam al-Witr, manuscript form</h3>
