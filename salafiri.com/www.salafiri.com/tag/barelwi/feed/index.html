<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Sufi Barelwi attempted to answer a paper I wrote and honestly its charitable to call it a refutation if that, it seemed more like copy and pasting what I wrote and then adding some emotive distortions.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">DECEMBER 26, 2020 / SUNNI HANAFI</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Refuting http://www.salafiri.com/pinned-ebook-dismantling-the-proofs-for-tawassul-and-istigatha-with-conclusive-evidences-part-2-the-%e1%b8%a5adith-of-fatimah-bint-asad-radiallahu-anha-and-the-tawassul-of-me/</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Some pseudo-Salafis have began to make allegations of weakness on the hadith of Sayyida Fatima bint Asad رضى الله عنه .</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">For example they say that</span> “Imām Dhahabī in his summary of the al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Fīʾl Aḥadīth al-Wahiyyah of Ḥāfiẓ Ibn al-Jawzī again grades Rawhū weak thus showing his consistency. (Talkhīs Kitāb al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Li-Ibn al-Jawzī (p.91 no. 218), Riyadh: Maktabah al-Rushd, 1419H/1998)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Irshād ul-Ḥaq al-Atharī said in his notes to al-ʿEllal after mention the statements of Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy, Imām al-Dāraquṭnī, Imām Ibn Mākūlā, Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Yūnus, the authentication of Imām al-Ḥākim and the entry of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān in his al-Thiqāt as mentioned in Lisān (2:465),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I say their leniency (tasāhul ie of al-Ḥākim and Ibn Ḥibbān) is well known and al-Shaikh al-Albānī has mentioned in Silsilah al-Daʿīfaʾ no.23 so refer to it.” (al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Fīʾl Aḥadīth al-Wahiyyah (1:269 footnote no.5), Edn, Khalīl Mayyis (1:270 footnote no.8)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They do ta’wil of Imam al-Hakim and Imam Ibn Hibban’s tasHih yet they consider us “deviant and people of innovation” for doing tawasul/istighatha. If the followers of the pseudo-Salafi/Wahabi movement have any intellectual honesty, they will tell me why they have not considered Imam al-Hakim or Imam Ibn Hibban a deviant for doing tasHih of a narration on tawassul.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Barelwi in order to bulk the size of so called reply reproduced large chunks of my paper, whereas his response is a few paragraphs if that. In his response he the unnamed one] fails to make any recourse to the books related to the science of hadith, rijal and or without reference to any classical books other than emotive polemics, so nothing usual here for typical Barelwis so far.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Unnamed begins with the accusation of ta&#8217;wil, meaning explaining the authentication of Imams al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban. The unnamed author hid behind a generality, that this attribution to al-Hakim, that he authenticated it came from al-Haythami in his (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid (9:256-257), Cairo: Maktabah al-Quddūsī, 1414H:1994) and Majma&#8217;a al-Zawaid, 18:736 under no.15388)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">So, the accusation levied against me should be put first and foremost to al-Haythami, who despite citing Ibn Hibban&#8217;s and al-Hakim&#8217;s authentication continued to class it weak!!! I wonder why the unnamed author forgot this very little but important information? I guess, al-Haythami is also a pseudo Salafi? I reproduce the words of al-Haythami and what I wrote in the paper,</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;He, al-Haythamī also said after transmitting it in his Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid said,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Transmitted by Ṭabarānī in al-Kabīr and in al-Awsaṭ and Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ is in the chain who was declared trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim, however he has weakness with him and the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ.” (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid (9:256-257), Cairo: Maktabah al-Quddūsī, 1414H:1994)&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>al-Haythami himself organised the Thiqat of Ibn Hibban, so he was fully aware of Ibn Hibban&#8217;s entry for Rawhu, yet despite this he still graded him weak. (Tartib Thiqat Ibn Hibban,5:393 no.3979. 1st edn (Mansura: Dar Ibn Abbas, 1440H/2019).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Hamdi answered the very point made by this brother and i quoted this, and it is well known amonsgt the circles of hadith, that Ibn Hibba and al-Hakim were mutasahil, if someone does not even know the basic, they should refrain from discussing things way over their head. Shaykh Hamdi said,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Ḥamdi ʿAbd al-Majīd al-Salafī answers the authentication of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and says,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“As for Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who has been declared to be trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and Hakim, then it is well known about both of them that they are mutasāhil ie lenient. He was declared to be weak by Ibn ʿAdiyy and Ibn Yūnus said he would narrate rejected narrations. Darāquṭnī said he is weak in Ḥadīth and Ibn Mākūlā weakened him and Ibn ʿAdiyy said after transmitting two of this ḥadīth he has many āḥadīth and some of them are abandoned.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thus, this is detailed criticism from the specialist critical analysts, furthermore, his narrations are rejected and this is the case with this narration and when he is alone in reporting such ḥadīth they are rejected and cannot be used as evidence therefore, the ḥadīth is is weak.” (Muʿajam al-Kabīr (24:351-352), Cairo: Maktabah Ibn Taymiyyah, 1415H/1994)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, I also quoted the Sufi Shaykh ʿAbd Allah bin Ṣiddīq al-Ghumārī he also acknowledged the weakness of Rawhū. He said,</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Rawhū, his weakness is light.” (Ittihāf al-Azkiyaʾ Bijawāj al-Tawassul bil-Anbiyāʾ waʾl Awliyāʾ (p.11) (?: ʾAlī Raḥmī, p.11) and (p.20) cited from Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ (p.146)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">So, this charge should be levied against these personalities too, especially Hafiz al-Haythami. In reality this is nothing but pure desperation and a feeble attempt to answer what I wrote. The unnamed author failed to even cite one reference and he called its a refutation!</span></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Leniency of Imam al-Hakim</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr in this introduction to his <em>Lisan ul-Mizan</em> indicates and alludes to the leniency of Imam Ibn Hibban by discussing some of his principles. (Lisan ul-Mizan 1:208-209, ed Abu Guddah Abdul Fattah (Beirut: Dar al-Basha&#8217;ir, 1423H / 2002CE).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">And the Imam as-Salah, in his reference work for hadith, <em>Ulum al-Hadith</em> also grades Imam al-Hakim as lenient. (Ulum al-Hadith, 22 (24th edition (Damascus/Beirut: Dar al-Fikr /Dar al-Fikr al-Ma&#8217;asir, 1440H / 2019CE) ed. Nur ud-Din al-&#8216;Itr</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imams al-Nawawi and al-Suyuti in his <em>Taqrib and Tadrib al-Rawi Fi Sharh Taqrib al-Nawawi</em> both held the view that Imam al-Hakim was lenient. al-Suyuti even went onto say that Imam al-Dhahabi rendered many of al-Hakims hadith in his al-Mustadrak weak and even compiled a treatise of around 100 fabricated narrations. This all indicates towards th leniency of Imam al-Hakim (Tadrib al-Raw 1:112. (Riyadh: Dar al-Taybah, 1422H) 5th edition ed. Abu Qutaybah Nazar Muhammad al-Faryabi).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi himsef alludes to the lenenicy of al-Hakim and says himself that he collated the fabricated and weak ahadith in al-Hakims al-Mustadrak (Siyar al-A&#8217;lam al-Nubala, 17:175)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi very clearly declares Imam al-Hakim to be Mutassahil, he says, &#8220;Like the the type that is referred to as Mutasaahil like al-Hakim (Ma&#8217;rifah ur-Ruwat al-Mutakkalm Fihim Bima Yujad ar-Radd, 15. (Dar al-Ma&#8217;rifah)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi said another time. &#8220;The mutasahil (lenient ones) are like at-Tirmidhi, al-Hakim and ad-Daraqutni sometimes&#8221; (al-Muqizah Fi Ilm Mustalah al-Hadith, 83. ed. Abdul Fattab abu guddah. (Beirut: Maktabah Matbuat al-Islamiyyah, 1425H) 8th edition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Shaykh Salim al-Hilali brings a long passage from al-Lucknowi&#8217;s <em>al-Rafa&#8217; wa&#8217;t-Takmil</em>, 282-308, who in turn quotes Hafiz al-Sakhawi saying the same in his <em>Fath ul-Mughith</em> (Kifayah ul-Hifzah Sharh a-Muqaddimah al-Muqizah, 323. (UAE: Maktabah al-Furqan, 1422H / 2001CE) 2nd edition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Ibn al-Mulaqqin also attributed Tasahul to Imam al-Hakim (al-Muqn&#8217;i Fi Ulum al-Hadith, 67. (KSA: Dar al-Fawaz)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr does the same in his <em>al-Nukt Ala Ibn as-Salah</em>, 314.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">IMAM IBN HIBBAN</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000080;">The author of this below standard reply wont be able to grasp the finer details and Imam Ibn Hibban&#8217;s methodology in his <em>ath-Thiqat</em>, which is the core theme of his contention, namely Rawhu&#8217;s inclusion in the Thiqat. The Imam outlines he is likely to include narrators who have also been criticised and Rawhu is one of them (Kitab ath-Thiqat, 1:11. 1st edition. (Beirut: DKI, 1419H/1998CE)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">al-Lucknowi outlines Ibn Hibban&#8217;s methodology in his <em>Thiqat</em> and concludes, Ibn Hibban was lenient in his Tawthiq. (ar-Rafa&#8217; Wat-Takmil Fi Jarh wa&#8217;t-Ta&#8217;dil, 332-339. 4th edition (Pakistan: Maktaba Maroofia, 1433/2013), edited Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Ghuddah Abdul Fattah endorses this view and also says the view of the Hanafi Zafar Ahmad Thanwi in his </span><em style="color: #000080;">Qawaid Fi Ulum al-Hadith</em><span style="color: #000080;">, 180. He further said numerous scholars have attributed Tasahul to Imam Ibn Hibban from the classical and contemporary scholars. He goes onto say that even al-Kawthari, who undoubtedly is probably highly respected by the author of this reply, also indicates tasahul of al-Hibban this in several places in his <em>Maqalat</em>, 69, 185, 303. (ar-Rafa&#8217; Wat-Takmil Fi Jarh wa&#8217;t-Ta&#8217;dil, 335, footnote 2).</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">This then makes the argument of the detractor redundant as instead of applying Sunni sciences, he applies the usual emotion and this is not how we scrutinise reports. Therefore, in conclusion the TasHih of Imam al-Hakim and the grading of Imam Ibn Hibban is problematic. The Sufi authors have also acknowledged this as I presented in the paper.</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Furthermore they say:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">“Shaikh Zubair ʿAlī Zaʾī graded the report to weak on account of the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ according to the scholars of Ḥadīth. He also argued, even if he was authentic the second problem is the tadlīs of Sufyān al-Thawrī. Shaikh Zubair said seven scholars of Ḥadīth classed Rawhū to be weak,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Ibn ʿAdiyy, (2) Ibn Yūnus, (3) al-Dāraquṭnī, (4) Ibn Mākūlā, (5) al-Dhahabī, (6) Ibn al-Jawzī, (7) Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah al-Baghdādī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān, al-Ḥākim authenticated him and Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī narrated from him. These three authentications are rejected based on the criticism of the majority of the scholars of ḥadīth. (al-Ḥadīth no.76, Ramaḍḥān 1431H/September 2010, p.9-12).Shaikh Zubair ʿAlī Zaʾī graded the report to weak on account of the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ according to the scholars of Ḥadīth.

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Let’s assume this is true- for sake of argument. There is a big question – what is the similarity between the tad`if of, Imam al-Daraqutni or Ibn al-Jawzi or Ibn Adiyy or Allamah al-Dhahabi and those of today, like Zubair Alizai? One main difference – the former `ulama never had the manhaj of denying tawassul. Check Siyar al-Alam al-Nubala 12:469 for Imam al-Dhahabi narrating about wasilah through Imam al-Bukhari رضى الله عنه and 16:400, ed. Arna`ut for wasilah through the Messenger ﷺ .</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong><br />
<strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">This is purely clutching at straws and saving oneself after they have sunk neck deep. The unnamed detractor provides no Hadith based answer except another digressive point which is the usual tactic of Barelwis. What exactly does the narration under discussion and the scrutiny of its chain and narrators have to do with someone allegedly making tawassul through the grave of Imam al-Bukhari? Precisely, nothing. The  unnamed chap seems to forget the Imams of the Salaf who declared Rawhu weak while Shaykh Zubair Ali Za&#8217;i relayed this information. Honestly at times there is a serious level of disingenuous by Barelwis, who instead of presenting a direct answer, tend to skirt around digressive points. At this point the detractors is literally making things up to support his view. Nonetheless since he has presented this point lets scrutinise it briefly.</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">1. The unnamed detractor quotes a report from a book of biographies of Imam al-Dhahabi, claiming then that he believed in Tawassul is an outright lie since the task of a biographer is to quote incidences related to the entry. If this was the case, we have to attribute to Imam al-Dhahabi as a belief system everything he quotes in his 30 volume of the Siyar, and of course this is absurd but for sure a Barelwi would bring such a silly point to fool the readers.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">The detractor surprisingly did manage to quote the correct reference for this report, namely Siyar al-A&#8217;lam an-Nabula, 12:469 (Beirut: ar-Risalah al-A&#8217;lamiah, 1438H/2017CE) and the chain Imam al-Dhahabi quotes it from through Abu Ali al-Ghassani who died in 498H (Siyar 19:150).</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi died 748H and therefore there is a gap of 250 years in the chain. In conclusion this chain is disconnected and hence weak with all scholars of hadith, the early and later ones. It is therefore upon the unnamed Barelwi detractor to first bring the chain, then prove its connected and continuous chain and only then proceed to authenticate and use it as evidence. It is unsurprising to learn this since this is a hallmark of Barelwi Sufis who claim link and chain connections to knowledge but terribly bring chainless report to prove their Aqidah. Barelwism has no hope if this is the best they come with him as a reply as their Tanbih al-Ghafilin, it seems more appropriate for the detractor to apply this to himself due to his dire negligence of hadith and Aqidah sciences.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">As for this claim :</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Muḥammad ibn ʿAlawī al-Malikī quotes it in his book and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“There is a difference of opinion regarding one of the narrators, Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ, however Ibn Ḥibbān mentions him in his al-Thiqāt and al-Ḥākim said he was safe and trustworthy. So both of them, the two Ḥāfiẓs authenticated the ḥadīth. Likewise al-Haythamī followed up on this in (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid) and said Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is in the chain, Ibn Ḥibbān declared him to be trustworthy as did al-Ḥākim, however, he has some weakness and the remaining narrators are the narrator of the Ṣaḥīḥs.” (Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ (p.146), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1430H/2009)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamdūḥ does the same and claims the narration is Ḥasan. He also quotes the statements of the scholars as we have mentioned above. He says the scholars have differed over Rawhū, some have said he is weak and others have declared him trustworthy. (Rafʿ ul-Minārah Li-Takhrīj Aḥadīth al-Tawassul wal-Ziyārah (p.147-148), Cairo, Maktabah al-Azhariyyah Lit-Turāth, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʿIsā Himyarī jubilantly went on to assert the Ḥadīth is Ṣaḥīḥ ie authentic according to the conditions of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim and Ḥasan according to the conditions of others. (al-Tāʾmul Fī Ḥaqīqah al-Tawassul, p.214-215)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a little imaginative of Himyarī to say the ḥadīth is authentic according to the condition of both Imām Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">G.F. Ḥaddād has also attempted to authenticate this report while relying on the works of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ and Muḥammad bin ʿAlawī al-Malikī. He pushes the line of argument of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ that the criticism is undetailed which is laughable as we have shown in this discourse. The Sūfī Aḥmad Daḥlān has also attempted to authenticate this report as does al-Ḥabīb al-Jifrī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The central argument of the detractors is that Rawhū is differed over and that the criticism levied against him is not detailed but rather general and therefore we take the general praise and authentication of him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and accepted by the detractors themselves that Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim are both mutāsahil ie lenient with their gradings and authentication. It does not make sense for them to accept this and leave the criticism. They couple this argument with the fact the criticism and discrediting is undetailed and vague, therefore one retorts to the position of praise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This has been answered by Shaikh al-Albānī and the scholars before him wherein he mentions the reasons Rawhū is weak. The main reason being he would narrate rejected narrations and that his narrations were rejected themselves. At times he would be a lone reporter of narration without any support.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAmr bin ʿAbd al-Munʿim explains that Imāms al-Ṭabarānī, Abū Nuʿaym and Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythamī have all declared this to be a lone report of Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and none of the other students and companions of Sufyān narrates this from except Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and these other students of Sufyān were memorisers and trustworthy narrators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Imām Ibn Ḥibbān citing Rawhū in his al-Thiqat, it is not tantamount to trustworthiness as he is known to be lenient ie Mutasāhil. Whatever he mentions under his entry in his al-Thiqāt does not clarify the affair of Rawhū except that it is information as we have shown under his entry, which has preceded. Rather we find this entry alludes to all of his narrations being of the rejected type.”</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is responded to here:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Abu Nuaym chains contain Rawh ibn Salàh al-Hàkim asserted was trustworthy and highly dependable (thiqa ma’mun) –as mentioned by Ibn Hajar in Lisàn al-Mïzàn (2:465 #1876), Ibn Hibbàn included him in al-Thiqàt (8:244), and al-Fasawï considered him trustworthy (cf. Mamdoh, Raf‘ [p. 148]).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Al-Haythamï (9:257) said: “Al-Tabarànï narrated it in al-Kabïr and al-Awsat and its chain contains Rawh ibn Salàh whom Ibn Hibbàn and al-Hàkim declared trustworthy although there is some weakness in him, and the rest of its sub-narrators are the men of sound hadïth.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I was unable to find Abu Hàtim’s declaration of Rawh as trustworthy reported by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Alawï in his Mafàhïm (10th ed. p. 145 n. 1). Nor does Shaykh Mahmod Mamdoh in his discussion of this hadïth in Raf‘ al-Minàra (p. 147-155) mention such a grading on the part of Abu Hàtim although he considers Rawh “truthful” (sadaq) and not “weak” (da‘ïf), according to the rules of hadïth science when no reason is given with regard to a narrator’s purported discreditation (jarhmubham ghayr mufassar).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mamdoh (p. 149-150) noted that although Albànï in his Silsila Da‘ïfa (1:32-33) claims it is a case of explicated discreditation (jarh mufassar) yet he himself declares identically-formulated discreditation cases as unexplicated and therefore unacceptable in two different contexts! Ibn ‘Alawï adds that the hadïth is also narrated from Ibn ‘Abbàs by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr –without specifying where –and from Jàbir by Ibn Abï Shayba, but without the du‘à.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Imàm al-Kawtharï said of this hadïth in his Maqàlàt (p. 410): “It provides textual evidence whereby there is no difference between the living and the dead in the context of using a means (tawassul), and this is explicit tawassul through the Prophets, while the hadïth of the Prophet from Abu Sa‘ïd al-Khudrï ‘O Allàh, I ask You by the right of [the promise made to] those who ask You (bihaqqi al-sà’ilïna ‘alayk)’* constitutes tawassul through the generality of Muslims, both the living and the dead.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Furthermore, the hadith of Hadrat Fatima bint Asad رضى الله عنه is proving the istihbab or fadail of tawasul and daif ahadith are accepted in fada`il.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong><br />
<span><strong><span style="color: #000080;">There is no answer from the detractor except that I had already mentioned it on my article. We already know some scholars of hadith praised Rawhu but he was criticised by numerous others and the criticism takes precedence and the author even knows this yet the Barelwi sect will try anything to slip falsehood through. Interesting to Ibn Alawi used Abu Hatim when that does not even exist while our detractors is concerned with Tasahul. It does not matter how many other chains there are if they cannot be substantiated as the detractors acknowledges. al-Kawtharis statement is redundant as it it is another attempt to mix the issues up, in order to seek tawassul from the dead you need clear authentic evidences which you have not provided, and as Shaykh al-Albani has done in his book besides many others proved permissible tawassul from authentic texts.</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><strong><span style="color: #000080;">If the claim was Istihbab then the detractor and his Sufi Barelwi elders would not have had a problem with those who did not make tawassul with the dead, so its not a case of Istihbab with you. The unnamed guy then admits the narration could be weak and then changes his line of argument by saying weak narrations can be used in Fadhail? So, you admit the narration is weak? What the detractor should be more concerned with is, if Tawassul is matter of creed and not a matter of fiqh with them, they need to bring mutawatir ahadith and not Ahad ahadith for them to be taken in Aqidah, since this is the core principle of Sufi Barelwi Ash&#8217;arim. What is the point of responding if you don&#8217;t follow your own theological principles.</span></strong></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">QUESTION</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people claim it is permissible to make tabarruk ie seek blessings from the relics of the scholars and righteous people; they present evidence and say the companions sought blessings from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, so what is the ruling concerning this affair? Also in the form that is deemed permissible, is not a non-Prophet being compared to the Prophet of Allah ﷺ? Also is it permissible to seek blessing from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ after his demise? And is it permissible to seek wasilah ie intercession of the blessings of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ?</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is impermissible to seek blessing from the relics of anyone other than the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, for example the water remaining after wudu, his hair, his sweat or any other part of the body. All of these things are specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and this is because Allah had blessed his body and anything else that he touched. This is the reason why no companion sought blessing or virtue from each other during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ or after his death, even to the extent that blessings or tabarruk was not sought from the four rightly guided Khulafa Rashidun or from the other virtuous companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, such actions and the understanding of the companions is a clear and manifest evidence they understood tabarruk ie blessings to be specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ which was impermissible for anyone else. It is also impermissible for anyone who is not a Prophet because it leads to and is a means to Shirk with Allah which is also the false worship of others. Likewise, and similarly it is not correct to make wasilah of the essence or selfness of Prophet ie dhat, his attributes, his blessings, his station and status because it lacks evidence. This is also due to the fact that it is a means and also leads to Shirk with Allah, this is extremism as well as exaggeration in the status and station of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the reasons is is impermissible is because none of the companions adopted or practiced this type of wasilah. If this was something good, they would have surely preceded us.  Another reason why it is impermissible is because it opposes evidence s from the Shari’ah. Allah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Allah has the most beautiful names, so call him by them.” (al-A’raf:180)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Apart from Allah&#8217;s name, it is permissible to make wasilah through his attributes like Honour, mercy and speech which is established and proven from the authentic hadith, in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would seek refuge in Allah through his Speech, Honour, Mercy and Power. (Muslim no.2202, 2708).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also by having Iman in Allah and his Messenger, it is a means of loving both. Hence it is permissible to seek nearness or closeness to Allah via his righteous good deeds. This is exemplified in the incidence of the people of the cave, who sought shelter in a cave from rain when eventually a rock covered the entrance and blocked it. The people did not have the power to remove the rock, so they began to figure out a way in how to deal with the calamity, and so they agreed to supplicate to Allah by mentioning the good deeds they had done, and would use them as interecessors. So one used his good conducts with is parents as a means to seek nearness to Allah, so the rock moved a little. The second person used his deed of abstaining from fornication as a means to seeking closeness to Allah despite having the ability to do so, so the rocked moved a little more. The third person sought means of closeness by mentioning his good deeds of being honest and trustworthy, eventually the rocked moved from the entrance of the cave and they were eventually able to leave. This is an incident of the people or nations before, so It contains admonition and guidance for us all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This answer has been further expounded by Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim in their respective books. Allamah Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan has also addressed it in his <em>Fath al-Majid Sharh Kitab al-Tawhid.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the hadith of the blind man who sought intercession through the Prophet ﷺ which also mentions the Prophet ﷺ interceded on his behalf, so Allah restored his sight (Ahmad 4:134, Tirmidhi no.3579, Ibn Majah 1404, see also Shaikh al-Albani’s al-Tawassul wal-Wasilah p.75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we should know, this hadith did not mention his station or status as a means of closeness or intercession but rather it was due to the supplication of the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, his intercession, using his own wasitah and wasilah as the hadith clearly states. Furthermore, the people will go to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for this type of intercession on the Day of Judgement so that Allah makes Judgement on them quickly (Bukhari 7410, Muslim 193).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, and similarly the people of Jannah will come to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and ask him to intercede with Allah on their behalf for them to enter Jannah quickly (Muslim 196).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the aforementioned forms of Wasilah, whether they are related to when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was living or the afterlife, all in all of them are related to the Wasilah or du’a of intercession and not due to his selfness, ie Dhat or due to the right of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Tuhfatul Ikhwan Bajwibah Muhimmah Tataluq Biarkan al-Islam</em> (Question 5 p.29), see also <em>Majmu’a Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawah</em> (7:67)   </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">READ PART 38</span> &#8211; </span><a href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-38-mawlid-beginnings-historical-origins-rafidhi-fatimids/"><span style="color: #008000;">Mawlid Beginnings &amp; Historical Origins – Rafidhi Fatimids</span></a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Th historians differ greatly as to when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born ie the exact date however most of them opine it was the 9th of Rabī Al-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Sa‘īd Muzaffar Kaukabūrī was himself unsure of the exact date of the Mawlid due to the difference of opinion, he Kawkaburi, who was considered the chief Mawlid innovator, would celebrate the Mawlid on the 8th of Rabi ul-Awwal in one year and on the 12th the following year. (al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah 1:552)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Dahiyyah, the one who wrote one of the earliest books promoting the Mawlid, was of the opinion the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 8th of Rabi ul-Awwal and he refutes the notion of it being the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal (<em>al-Tanwir Fi Mawlid al-Bashir wal-Nazir from al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah</em> 2:260)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Dahiyyah also mention the 17th of Rabi ul-Awwal as another potential birth date (<em>al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah</em> 2:260)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is strange how the Barelwis use Imam Ibn Kathirs al-Bidayah to support their views in other things but in such instances they turn a blind eye to such remarks and research. The likes of Saqid Shami are happy to use Ibn Kathir on Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and his alleged book on the Mawlid, so we are we using here too?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The founder of Baraliwism Ahmad Raza Khān said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 12th of Rabī Al-Awwal and he died on the same day.&#8221;</em> (Malfūzāt 2:220)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Qādir Jilānī said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Prophet ﷺ was born on the 10th of Muharram.&#8221;</em> (<em>Ghuniyyah al-Tālibīn</em> 2:392).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan said about Shaikh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The illustrious son and descendant of the Glorious Prophet ﷺ and the true representative and inheritor of Prophetic Bounties, the great Ghawth Shaykh Sayyid ‘Abd al-Qadir Jilani (d 561/1164) states: ‘I see all the cities of Allah as I see a mustard seed in the centre of my palm.’ The Grand Ghawth also states: ‘The pupil of my eye is set on the Luhe-Mahfuz.&#8221;</em> (Malfuzat 1:35-36, Barelwi translation)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is deception at its highest level, on one hand they have this belief about Abdul Qadir al-Jilnai while at the same time reject his view regarding the birth date and hence the Mawlid. The conclusion, Ahmad Raza was categorically lying when he made this statement about Shaykh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another Barelwi writer, Muhammad Umim Ehsan al-Mujaddadi al-Barkati said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on a Monday in the year of the Elephant, either on the 8th, 9th or the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Awjaz al-Siyar Mulhiq Bi-Mishkat al-Masabih</em> 1:586)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdul Haq Dehlawi also mentions the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal being the birth date of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ (<em>Ma Thabt Bil-Sunnah</em> p.288, <em>Madarij al-Nabuwwah</em> 2:23)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qādi Muhammad Suleimān Mansūrpūrī said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Prophet ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī Al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant, corresponding to 22nd April 571ce, corresponding to the 1st Jith 628 Bikrami in Makkah in the early morning before sunrise. &#8220;</em> (<em>Rehmah Al-Alamīn</em> p.40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The historians have differed with regards to the birth date, Tabari and Ibn Khaldun said the 12th, Abu Fida said the 10th. However all are agreed the Monday (of the birth) on that year corresponds to the 9th and this is why the 9th of Rabi ul-Awwal seems to be most accurate date of birth.&#8221;</em> (<em>Rehmah Al-Alamīn</em> p.40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Suleimān Nadwī said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;As regards to the birth of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ Egypt&#8217;s Mahmūd Pashā the astronomer authored a treatise in which he proved mathematically that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 9th Rabī Al-Awwal corresponding to 20th April 571ce.&#8221;</em> (<em style="color: #000000;">Sirah al-Nabī</em> 1:171)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Indian historian Akbar Shah Najibabadi said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant corresponding to the 40th gathering of Kisrah Naushirwan corresponding to the 22th April 571ce in the morning before sunrise.&#8221;</em> <em style="color: #000000;">(Tārīkh Al-Islām</em> 1:76)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The leader of the Sufi&#8217;s, Yusuf bin Ismail Nabahani said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;And what is famous and well known and what the majority (of the scholars) are agreed upon is that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Hujjatullah Alal A&#8217;lamin</em> p.231)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Deobandi church father, Ashraf Ali Thanwi has also mentioned a difference of opinion with regards to the exact birth date. (<em>Nashr al-Tayyib</em> p.28)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of the well known scholars were of the view that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal. Imam Nawawi mentioned,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away on the Monday morning on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal after the 12th year after the Hijra.&#8221;</em> (<em>Taqrib Ala Ibn Salah</em> 2:251)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti, who is revered by the proponents of the Mawlid because of his generic reverence of the birth of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, said in explanation of the words of Imam Nawawi,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The majority (of the scholars) are upon what the author (i.e. Imam Nawawi) mentioned, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tadrib al-Rawi Sharh Tarib al-Nawaw</em>i 2:51)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Tal&#8217;at, the author of <em>Tarikh Dawal al-Arab wal-Islam</em> was also of the view the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabi ul-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdur Rahman Mubrakpuri in his <em>Tuhfa</em> brings the statement of Hafiz Ibn al-Jawzi from his <em>al-Tanqih</em> in which he says,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;They are agreed the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the Monday in the year of the elephant in the month of Rabi ul-Awwal, however, they differ with regards to the exact date of the month and there are four views, (1) 2nd Rabi ul-Awwal, (2) 8th Rabi ul-Awwal, (3) 10th Rabi ul-Awwal and the (4) 12th Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tuhfa al-Ahwadhi Sharh Tirmidhi</em> 4:295)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shia rafidah fatimid rulers were instrumental in formulating and pushing the Mawlid and the Milād amongst the people and they are the ones who made it famous. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ahmad bin Alī bin Ahmad al-Fazārī al-Qalqashandī  [821H] said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Fatimid Khaliph would organise their third gathering on the 12th of Rabī al-Awwal and celebrate the Mawlid. Their habit pertaining to the gathering was to cook various sweet dishes at Dār Al-Fitrah with a lot of sugar which they would distribute in 300 silver dishes. During the Mawlid night the sweet dishes would be distributed between the numerous dignitaries like the judges, religious callers, the various reciters and admonishers as well as the presidents of the various universities and the sūfī patrons of the tombs and shrines..&#8221;</em> [Subh al-&#8216;Asha Fī Sana&#8217;a al-Insha [3:576]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bukhīt al-Mutī‘ī Al-Hanafī the Qadī of Alexandria (Egypt) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Fatimids khaliphs were the first ones to innovate the Mawlid in Cairo and first from amongst them was Mu&#8217;az Al-DīnAllāh. He travelled from Maghrib to Egypt in shawwal in the year 361H. He then travelled to Alexandria in Sha&#8217;bān 362H and then entered Cairo in the same year on the 7th of Ramadhan. These people innovated 6 Mawālīd, the Mawlid of the prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, the Milād of Alī, the Milād of Fatimah, the Milād of Hasan, the Milād of Hussain and the Milād of the current ruler. These mawlids continued with the custom and practices until Afzal bin Amir Al-Juyūsh came and abolished them. His father Amir Al-Juyush went to egypt fromSham upon the invitation of the Khaliph Mustansarbillah wherein he entered Egypt on the eve of the 2nd of Jumada al-Ula in the year 465H. When he went on the war expedition to Sham he placed his son Afzal his representative. When Amir Al-Juyush died in Rabī Al-Thani or Jumada Al-Ula in the year 487H his son Afzal took control of the army. When Muntasarbillah died on the 17th of Dhul Hijjah 495H, his reign of Khilafah was 7 years and 2 months. Afzal then put forward muntasarbillahs son as the new Khaliph whose name was mustalabillah. Then mustalabillah died on the 17th of Safar 496H and Afzal then made his son, Al-Amr bi Ahkamallah the Khaliph. Then on the eve of Eid Al-Fitr in the year 515H Afzal was murdered and the same happened to Al-Amr bi Ahkamallah in the year 524H. The 6 Milād were restarted during his reign whereas Afzal had abolished them and the people had eventually forgotten them.&#8221;</em> [Ahsan Al-Kalām Fimā Yata‘laq Bil-Sunnah Wa&#8217;l Bid‘ah Minal Ahkām [pp.59-61]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same has been reported by other authors in their various books from them include</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Alī Mahfùz in <em>Al-Ibda‘a Fī Madhār Al-Ibtidā‘a [pp.136]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sayyid Alī Fikrī in <em>al-Mukhadharāt Al-Fikriyyah [pp.84]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Alī Nāsir Al-Faqihi in <em>al-Bid‘ah Dhawabituha Wa Athārahā as-Sayy&#8217;ia Fil Ummah [pp.16,21]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ismā‘īl bin Muhammad Ansārī in <em>Al-Qaul Al-Fasl Fī Hukm Al-Ehtifāl bi Mawlid Al-Rūsul [pp.64-72]</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As we have already mentioned the Mawlid was innovated by the Fatimid Shī‘as. The reign of the Fatimids started in approximately 362H until 567H. They are the ones who first innovated the Mawlid and they also innovated mawlids for Ahlul Bayt, again this is another clear cut evidence that the concept of Mawlid was not practised or even heard of during the first three generations. What is also apparent is that the current days Muslims the Sūfīs and Barailwis have rejected the other 5 Mawlids and just adopted one. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The people of deviation may say how could Muzaffar al-Dīn Al-Kaukabūrī innovated the Mawlid when the Fatimid Shias did. Well we say that when the ruler Al-Afzal bin Amīr Al-Juyūsh prohibited and banned the Mawlid and its associated practices innovated by the Fatimids, Muzaffar al-Din restarted it and gave it a new shape and direction. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu Muhammad Abdul Rahman bin Ismail Abī Shāmah [665H] said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The first person to do this (ie the Mawlid or Milād) in Mosul was Shaikh Umar bin Muhammad al-Mulla who was a well known Sūfī and then the ruler or Irbil followed him.&#8221;</em> [al-Bā&#8217;ith Ala Inkār Al-Bid‘ah wa&#8217;l Hawādith [pp.24]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bukhīt al-Mutī‘ī Al-Hanafī said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I say Malik Muzaffar Al-Dīn the ruler of Irbil, he is the one who Suyūti spoke about when he said he was the first one to innovated the Mawlid. His name was Abu Sa‘īd Kaukabūrī bin Abul Hasan Alī bin Baktakīn bin Mu‘ammar, his title was Mulk Al-A&#8217;zam Muzaffar Al-Dīn of Irbil. After his fathers death on the 10th of Dhul Qa&#8217;dah 563H he became the king at the age of 14. He is the one who innovated the Milād in the city of Irbil.</em> [Ahsan Al-Kalām Fimā Yata‘laq Bil-Sunnah Wa&#8217;l Bid‘ah Minal Ahkām [pp.66]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Muhammad al-Abdarī famously known as Ibn Al-Haj said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;And from everything that is new from the affair of innovations with the associated belief that they are from the superior aspects of worship and the manifestation they are the well known signs of Islam, one such issue is the Mawlid in the month of Rabī Al-Awwal which includes innovations and unlawful things.&#8221;</em> [al-Mudkhal [2:229]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;These people only want to gather at the corrupt Mawlid when there is music is sama, if it is without music and just the Mawlid and they invite the brothers for food, likewise it is free from any corrupt practices, of which some have been mentioned before and of the sole intention is for Milād then this is an innovation and a new act in the Dīn which was not a practise of the Salaf of the past because traversing the path of the Salaf is superior and better.&#8221;</em> [al-Mudkhal [2:234]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Taj Al-Dīn Umar bin Ali Al-Fākihānī was asked concerning the Mawlid who which he replied, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I do not know the basis or the origins of this Mawlid in the Kitab or Sunnah, neither is it mentioned that a single scholar from the Ummah acted upon it and they were from amongst those who were exemplary in the Dīn and held firmly onto the reports of the earlier scholars, rather this Mawlid is an innovation which was introduced by the people of falsehood, of desires, whims and to seek personal gains. &#8220;</em> [al-Hawi Lil Fatāwa [1:190-191]</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a very short part but hopefully In Sha Allah equally succinct and elucidatory. The Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s all the time call us Najdiyyah coupled with a few other descriptive words or nice adjectives. In fact the Salafi&#8217;s and the Ahl al-Hadith, who are the real Ahl al-Sunnah wal Jama&#8217;ah are very often always referred to as Wahabi&#8217;s or Najdi&#8217;s. At times these Sufi Barailwi&#8217;s write articles and treatise&#8217;s explaining the hadith of the horns of shaytan  refers to najd and the emergence of Shaykh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab from that region i.e. the Najd.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So they say oh you najdis or you najdiyyah, you come from a place which has been cursed i.e. the najd and the emergence of wahhabi&#8217;s was prophesized. When it is explained to them, and the understanding of najd is presented to them with the clear evidences from the scholars of geography and hadith explanations, they remain defiantly adamant that Najd refers to the Wahhabi&#8217;s and for this reason they are evil and cursed. etc and so on. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are sure the readers are familiar with this oft repeated fallacious narrative but what can one do when someone deliberately wants to remain obstinate and ignorant of the truth. In such cases a person who wishes good for these blind following Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s has to choice but to retort to measures which will perhaps illustrate the point, in order for it to sink these thick cell walls of the Sufi&#8217;s because being reasonable, academic and pursuing an evidence approach does not work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, it has also forced us to present the following, so the Sufi&#8217;s and Barelvi&#8217;s have to think long and hard before they traverse this path of Sufi Barelwi teachings. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fact of the matter is, the father of their own Imam, who they blindly make taqlid of without any shame, hesitation or denial, Ie the father of Imam Abu Hanifah was from NAJD,,&#8230; thats right, the father of Imam al-A&#8217;zam, their respective Imam, for both the Barelvi&#8217;s and Deobandi&#8217;s was actually from Najd, have look at this scan from Imam Abu Hibban&#8217;s book <em>Kitab al-Majruhim Minal Muhadithin</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/majruhin.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-7564 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/majruhin.jpeg?resize=332%2C466" alt="majruhin" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/majruhin.jpeg?resize=214%2C300 214w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/majruhin.jpeg?resize=768%2C1078 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/majruhin.jpeg?resize=730%2C1024 730w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/majruhin.jpeg?w=848 848w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abu-hanifah-najd.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-7565 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abu-hanifah-najd.jpeg?resize=524%2C117" alt="abu hanifah najd" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abu-hanifah-najd.jpeg?resize=300%2C67 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abu-hanifah-najd.jpeg?resize=768%2C172 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abu-hanifah-najd.jpeg?w=870 870w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Kitab al-Majruhim Minal Muhadithin</em> Vol.2 p.405</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So now one begs and asks a question, all this time these rude and ill mannered people have been constantly calling us Najdis, whereas in reality the dad of their own Imam was also from Najd. We will see how they explain this one away especially the meaning of Najd. Either the latter is true or they confess and admit, the dad of their Imam was from Najd, which essentially means the origins and roots of Imam Abu Hanifah were also Najdi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the next time you think you want to be a little sharp with your tongue by calling us najdi&#8217;s, remember the dad of the very Imam that you resort to make blind taqlid of, likewise the Imam you consider to be the greatest Imam and in the same way, the very Imam you say making taqlid of is obligatory, was of NAJDI origin because his dad was from NAJD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now we assume if you have a little shame. self dignity and respect for yourself you will use the term Najdi for us, because it would mean your Imam and his father are with us., get the point oh you real Najdi&#8217;s  </span></p>
