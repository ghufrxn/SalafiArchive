<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Chapter of  two (narrators whose names begin with the letter) Haa for both of them of Humayd at-Tawil from Anas: Six hadith</span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[147] From Malik from Humayd at-Tawil that Anas ibn Malik (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8220;We once travelled with the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam), in Ramadhan, and those who were fasting did not find fault with those who were not, and those who were not fasting did not find fault with those who were.&#8221; </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [IT&#8217;S CHAIN IS SAHIH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES] </span>&#8211; [BUKHARI]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/295 hadith no.661, book 18, chapter 7, hadith no.23), at-Tamhid (2/169, and he said, “This hadith is <em>[Muttasil Sahih]</em> authentically connected), al-Istidhkar: (no.611)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.1947) from the hadith of Malik, and Muslim (99/118) from the hadith of Humayd at-Tawil and he has clarified hearing from him with it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) It is allowed to either fast or not fast whilst travelling. If one does not fast whilst travelling in Ramadhan then the individual should make up the missed fasts later on. It is more virtuous to not fast whilst travelling on the condition that it is severely hot and there are severe difficulties.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Also see hadith no.465</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) Abdullah Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) did not fast whilst travelling. (Muwatta Imam Malik 1/295, hadith no.663 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Sahih]</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Whilst Urwah Ibn Zubair used to fast whilst travelling. (Muwatta Imam Malik 1/295, hadith no.664 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Sahih]</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) If there are two allowable ways of carrying out a deed that have been established in the Sharia then one should not condemn the other person. (T.N. for example if person A is fasting whilst travelling and person B is not fasting whilst travelling, then person A should not condemn person B and vice versa, since both methods been established in the Sharia). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"> 5) It is absolutely correct to refute those things which go against the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[2] Risalah Amal Bil-Hadith</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Walayat Ali Sadiqpuri (1269H)</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to note, the individual who was preoccupied in his profession and due to this he was not able to study which led him to think that it is sufficient for him to ask the Muslim scholars. It is appropriate for such an individual to ask the scholars of Hadith and the upright and righteous scholars who are known to fear Allah and are well versed with the Quran and Hadith. They should ask them (ie the scholars) and say what has Allah and his Messenger said about such and such issue or what is the ruling pertaining to a certain issue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the contrary, if a student of knowledge who possess the desire and zeal to seek the knowledge of the various islamic sciences, then it is appropriate for him to first and foremost to read the Quran and Hadith, then move onto and consult and study other books so that he becomes somewhat proficient in knowing which scholars statement and position is closer to the truth and hence worthy to be accepted or alternatively if they erred.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no taqlid of a mujtahid when an issue is found clearly and manifestly in the Quran and Hadith because there is no basis for ijtihad (or taqlid of this ijtihad) in the presence of clear manifest rulings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mu’adh said the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam), sent him to Yemen and the Prophet said, <em>“How will you judge?” Mu’adh said, “I will judge according to what is in the Book of Allah.” The Prophet said: “What if it is not in the Book of Allah?” Mu’adh said, “Then with the tradition (sunnah) of the Messenger of Allah.” The Prophet said: “What if it is not in the tradition of the Messenger of Allah?” Mu’adh said, “Then I will strive to form an opinion (ijtihad).” The Prophet said “All praise is due to Allah who has made suitable the messenger of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).”</em> (Tirmidhi no.1327)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is thus evident from the aforementioned Hadith, when there is a clear ruling in the Quran and Hadith the need for ijtihad is abandoned by default. If we find statements that contradict and conflict with the books of the mujtahids, then we should clearly abstain from them and fervently adhere to the Quran and Hadith otherwise the mujtahids statement will necessitate abrogation of the Quran and Hadith and Allahs aid and refuge is sought from such a thought.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Risalah Amal Bil-Hadith (pg.16-17)</span></p>
