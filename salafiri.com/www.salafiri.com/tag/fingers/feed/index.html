				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #999999">Fatwas of Ibn Baz&gt; Volume 6&gt; Important questions and their answers&gt; The Meaning of: &#8220;Allah created Adam in His Own Image&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Q4: <em>&#8220;Allah created Adam in His Own Image.[1]&#8221;</em> Does this mean that all the characteristics of Adam are also Divine?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It is authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) that he (peace be upon him) said: Allah created Adam in His own image In a narration by Ahmad and some scholars of Hadith, the same Hadith reads: in the image of Al-Rahman (the Most Merciful). In the first Hadith, the pronoun refers to Allah. Some scholars like Ahmad (may Allah be merciful to him), Is-haq ibn Rahawayh and the Imams of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) said: &#8220;We have to accept the Hadith in a way befitting Allah without Tashbih (comparison), Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation) or Ta`til (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes). It does not necessarily mean that His Image (Glorified be He) is like the image of human beings. Similarly, attributing a face, hand, fingers, feet, leg, anger, and the like attributes does not entail that Allah&#8217;s Attributes are like those of the human beings. He (Glorified be He) is described as what He tells about Himself and what His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) said in a way befitting Him, without being in similitude with any of His Creatures. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: &#8220;There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; [Surah al-Shura 42:11].</p>
<p>We have to accept this in the way that the Messenger intended without Takyif (descriptive designation of Allah&#8217;s Attributes) or Tamthil. The meaning &#8211; Allah knows best &#8211; is that He created Adam in His Image with a face and ability to hear, speak, see and do whatever he wants. It is not necessarily that the image is the same. This is a general rule according to the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream), meaning that the Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and Hadiths speaking about Divine Attributes should be accepted as true without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Takyif, Tamthil or Ta`til. They confirm His Names and Attributes without Tamthil and exalt Him above being similar to His Creatures without Ta`til, contrary to those who commit Bid`ah (innovation in religion) of Al-Mu`attilah (deniers of Allah&#8217;s Attributes) and Mushabihah (those who liken Allah’s Attributes to those of His creation). The hearing, seeing and knowledge of the creature is never like those of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), for none of His creatures can be compared to Him. Indeed, there is nothing like Him, for the Attributes of Allah are perfect and infinite, with no shortcomings. As for the attributes of the creatures, they are finite and imperfect.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p><span style="color: #999999">Fatwas of Ibn Baz&gt; Volume 25&gt; Book on Hadith, First Section&gt; Book on Iman&gt;Degree of the authenticity of the Hadith: Allah created Adam in His own image</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">33- What is the authenticity of the Hadith that reads: <em>Allah created Adam in His Own Image[1]</em>.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: The following Hadith is recorded in the Sahih collection of Al-Bukhari, Book of Asking Permission: Allah has created Adam in His own image It falls within the subject of Asking Permission and the Beginning of Creation. Its exact wording is: <em>&#8220;Allah created Adam in the image of the Beneficent.[2]&#8221;</em> Ibn Hajar (may Allah be merciful to him) commented: It is soundly reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated that Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam in the Image of the Beneficent. How authentic is this Hadith?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This information contained in this Hadith is sound. The Hadith is Sahih (authentic) as confirmed by Is-haq, Ahmad and others. It means that Allah is All-Hearer and All-Seer but it does not conclude that His Hearing or Seeing resemble those of human beings. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <em>&#8220;There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; [Surah al-Shura 42:11]</em>. This denotes that Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam in His Own Image and endowed him with the faculties of hearing, seeing and speech and with hands and feet. Yet, Allah&#8217;s (Exalted be He) Image does resemble that of human beings, High Exalted be He above having likes or peers.</p>
<p>Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; [Surah al-Shura 42:11] And, &#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221; [Surah al-Ikhlaas 112:4] and, &#8220;Do you know of any who is similar to Him?&#8221; [Surah al-Maryam 19:65] And, &#8220;So put not forward similitudes for Allâh (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything).&#8221; [Surah an-Nahl 16:74].</p>

<p><span style="color: #999999">Fatwas of Ibn Baz&gt; Volume 28&gt; Book on subject related to `Aqidah&gt; the Creed of Ahl Al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community)&gt; Questions&gt;Degree of authenticity of Hadith: Allah created Adam in His own image</span></p>
<p><strong>Q9: What is the degree of authenticity of the following Hadith: &#8220;Allah created Adam in His own image.[1]&#8221; Or &#8220;&#8230; In the Merciful&#8217;s image&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it is a Hadith Sahih (authentic Hadith). Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam in His own image i.e. He can hear, see, speak, with eyes, hands, and feet. However, the Hadith does not imply any Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation), for Allah (Glorified be He) states: &#8220;There is nothing like Him&#8221; [Surah al-Shura 42:11] And: &#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221; [Surah al-Ikhlaas 112:4].</p>
<p>This is the explanation of the Hadith by scholars of Ahl-ul-Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah) such as Ahmad, Is-haq and others (may Allah have mercy on them all).</p>

<p>Al-Imaam Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah) discusses the hadeeth: Allaah Created Adam upon His Image</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> A hadeeth has been reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in which he prohibits cursing the face (literally saying &#8216;may Allaah make your face ugly&#8217;), and it mentions that Allaah (Subhaanahu) created Adam upon His Image. So what is the safe belief in reference to this hadeeth?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The hadeeth is confirmed from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), that he said: &#8220;When one of you hits (someone else), then let him avoid the face, for indeed Allaah created Aadam upon His Image.&#8221; And in another wording (of this hadeeth) he said, &#8220;upon the Image of Ar-Rahmaan (the Most Merciful).&#8221; And this (hadeeth) does not necessitate resembling or likening Allaah (to His creatures).</p>
<p>The meaning of it with the people of knowledge is that Allaah created Adam hearing, seeing, and speaking if he wished to do so (i.e. Aadam had these attributes). This is also the description of Allaah, for verily He is Hearing, Seeing, and Speaking if He wishes, and He has a Face, Magnificent and Exalted is He.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean resembling or likeness. Rather, the Image that is for Allaah is not like the image that is for the creation. It only means that He is Hearing, Seeing, and Speaking if and whenever He wishes to do so. And thus did Allaah create Aadam as one who is hearing, seeing, and possessing a face, and a foot. However, the hearing (of one) is not like the hearing (of the other), and the seeing (of one) is not like the seeing (of the other), and the speaker is not like the (other) speaker. Rather, Allaah has attributes that are befitting His Majesty and His Sublimity, and the slave (of Allaah) has attributes that are befitting him. The attributes of the slave (of Allaah) is exposed to cessation and deficiency, whereas the attributes of Allaah are perfect and not exposed to deficiency, cessation of being, or ending. For this reason, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic said, &#8220;There is nothing like Hime, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.&#8221; And He, Glory be unto Him, said, &#8220;And there is none comparable or coequal to Him.&#8221; Thus, it is not permissible to strike the face (of someone), nor to curse the face (saying &#8216;may Allaah make your face ugly&#8217;).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of Abu Hurairah RadiAllahu Anhu the Messenger of Allah Sallalalhu alayhi Wasallam said, <em>&#8220;Whenever one of you performs wudu for Salah, he should not do tashbik with his fingers (after he has completed the wudu)</em> (al-Sahihah no.1294, transmitted Tabarani in al-Awsth (1:4-5).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tashbik is interlocking the fingers of both hands, ie putting the fingers on one hand into the fingers of the other hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith as narrated by Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri RadiAllahu Anhu said, <em>&#8220;When one of you is in the masjid, do not do tashbik for verily tashbik is from the Shaytan.&#8221;</em> (Musnad Ahmad (3:43).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Isma’ll b. Umayyah said, <em>“I asked about a man who intertwines his fingers while he is engaged in prayer. He said that Ibn ‘Umar had said: This is the prayer of those who earn the anger of Allah.”</em> (Abu Dawud no.993) Shaikh al-Albani graded its chain to be authentic (Irwa 2:103)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Thumamah al-Hannat said that Ka&#8217;b ibn Ujrah met him while he was going to the mosque; one of the two (companions) met his companion (on his way to the mosque) And he met crossing the fingers of my both hands. He prohibited me to do so, and said: The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said: If any of you performs ablution, and performs his ablution perfectly, and then goes out intending for the mosque, he should not cross the fingers of his hand because he is already in prayer. (Abu Dawud (no.562), Sahih Abi Dawud (1:168 no.562), Ibn Majah (no.967)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari established the following chapter heading in his Sahih, <strong>“Chapter on interlocking the fingers in the Masjid and elsewhere” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then brings a hadith from either Abdullah ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) or Abdullah ibn Amr bin Aas (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) interlocked his fingers. (Bukhari no’s 478-479)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the following hadith the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said to Abdullah Ibn Amr al-Aas (RadhiAllahu Anhu), <em>&#8220;O Abdullah bin Amr! What will be your condition when you will be left with the of (worst) people?&#8221; (and he indicated by interlocking the fingers of his two hands). </em>(Bukhari no.480)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of Abu Musa al-Ash’ari (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who narrates the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “<em>A faithful believer to a faithful believer is like the bricks of a wall, enforcing each other.&#8221; While (saying that) the Prophet (</em><em>ﷺ</em><em>) clasped his hands, by interlocking his fingers.” </em>(Bukhari no.481)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith in this regard is the long hadith of Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu about the story of Dhul Yadayn, it mentions the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, <em>“went and stood by a piece of wood that was set up in the masjid, and leaned against it as if he was angry, and he placed his right hand on his left and interlocked his fingers…”</em> (Bukhari no.482, Muslim no.573)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari brings this ahadith to show the permissibility of clasping the hands and interlocking the the fingers. The prohibition is because this is ie interlocking of the fingers a futile and useless act. However, there is no harm if there is a specific reason for a person to do this as in the hadith above the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) used the interlocking of his fingers to illustrate or explain a particular point.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr has explained despite one of the narration being in note form, Ibrahim Harbi has cited a continuous chain for it in his Gharib al-Hadith. Imam Bukhari’s intent in establishing this chapter heading is to elucidate and show the permissibility of clasping the hands and interlocking the fingers. As for the ahadith which mention prohibition of interlocking the fingers they are specific and in relation to the prayer or whilst preparing for the prayer and or most of them are not even authentic. (Fath al-Bari (1:565)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr further said whilst reconciling between these ahadith, the ones cited above and the ones that mention the prohibition, that <em>“al-Isma’ili reconciled between them by noting that the prohibition is limited to when one is in prayer or is intending to pray, because the one who is waiting for the prayer comes under the same ruling as one who is praying… Then al-Haafiz said: The report which says that this is forbidden so long as one is in the mosque is da’eef (weak) as we have stated above.” </em>(Fath al-Bari (1:565)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people whilst in a state of prayer may interlock their fingers in an attempt to crack them. This is unnecessary movement and a distraction from concentrating on the prayer. It was narrated by Shu’bah that he said, <em>“I prayed beside Ibn Abbas and cracked my fingers. When the prayer finished, he said, “May your mother lose you! You crack your fingers when you are in prayer?” </em>(Ibn Abi Shaybah (2:344). Shaikh al-Albani said in Irwa al-Ghalil (2:99), its chain is Hasan.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is another report in which is very weak according to Shaikh al-Albani in Ibn Majah (no.965) that Ali (RadhiAllahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, <em>“</em><em>Do not crack your fingers during the prayer.”</em> (Irwa ul-Ghalil (2:99 no.367) al-Bawsiri declared a narrator in the chain to weak. (al-Zawa’id (1:63). Shaikh al-Albani follows this with another narration from Mu’adh bin Anas (Ahmad (3:438), Daraqutni (no.64), Baihaqi (2:289) who said one of the narrators was not strong.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams ul-Haq Azimabadi also offers similar explanations and alludes to the fact that there are no contradictions in the aforementioned narrations. He cites further ahadith from Ibn Hibban in the prohibition of interlocking the fingers whilst on the way to the masjid to prayer. He also cites a narration from Hakim from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) when one of you performs wudu in his house and then he comes to the masjid, he is in a state of prayer up until he returns and he should not interlock his fingers. Hakim said the hadith is authentic on the conditions of the two Shaikhs. He goes onto cite another narration from Ibn Abi Shaybah’s Musannaf, that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said when one of you prays, he should not interlock his fingers for verily interlocking the fingers is from Shaytan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams ul-Haq goes onto say The Hadith of Ka’b has been authenticated by Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibban and that some scholars have differed over the authenticity of its chains and have thus rendered it to be weak. They (the scholars of hadith) have said there is no contradiction between these ahadith. They are understood to mean that a person is not to interlock their fingers after wudu and whilst on their way to the masjid to pray or whilst praying. The hadith of Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) in Sahih al-Bukhari refers to after the prayer and not during the prayer or from the time leading to the prayer. He then goes onto to cite the view of Ibn al-Munir, al-Ayni and al-Khattabi. (Au’n al-Ma’bud Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud (2:188-190 no.558) </span></p>
