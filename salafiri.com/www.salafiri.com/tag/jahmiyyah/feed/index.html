<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah al-Rajihi said in his explanation of <em>Asal as-Sunnah wa I’tiqad ud-Din</em> wherein Imam Ibn Abi Hatim mentions from Imams Abu Hatim Razi and Abu Zur’ah ar-Razi,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[11]</strong> <strong>Allah, The Blessed and Exalted, will be seen in the Hereafter; the People of Jannah will see Him with their sights.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The believers will see their Rabb, The Exalted, as transmitted by texts from the Book of Allah and the Prophets Sunnah. So, Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah affirm the believers will see Allah with their sight in the Hereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Affirming the seeing of Allah on the Day of Resurrection is an attribute which is disputed between Ahlus Sunnah and the people of innovation. The same applies to the attribute of Kalam – Speech and the attribute of Uluww and Istiwa – Highness and rising over the Throne.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These three attributes are a distinguishing sign and a distinction between Ahlus Sunnah and Ahlul Bid’ah. So, whoever affirms these attributes is from Ahlus Sunnah and whoever rejects them is from Ahlul Bid’ah. Whoever affirms Allah’s Istiwa – rising over The Throne and his Highness over his creation, and whoever affirms Allah’s speech is with words [with] meaning, sound and letters and whoever affirms the seeing of Allah in the Hereafter is from Ahlus Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The believer has the Aqidah that Allah will be seen in the Hereafter and the believers will see Allah with their eyesight. This is established and proven from the texts of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[Evidence from the Quran and Sunnah Affirming the Seeing of Allah]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Quran says,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> “On that Day some faces will be bright, looking at their Lord.” (Surah al-Qiyamah: 22-23)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He added they will be looking at his Face by the addition of “ila” denoting they will be looking at the Face of Allah, The Magnificent with the eye(s) of their face (i.e. head). So, the statement of Allah is free of any factors that oppose the true reality of this matter. This then proves the believers will see Allah with their eyesight.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Glorious said,<strong> “There they will have whatever they desire, and with Us is even more.” (Surah Qaf: 35)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The explanation of this ayah mentions, <strong>“Mazid – Even more”</strong> means looking at the face of Allah, The Benevolent.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Glorious said,<strong> “Those who do good will have the finest reward<sup>1</sup>and </strong><strong>˹</strong><strong>even</strong><strong>˺</strong><strong> more.” (Surah Yunus: 26)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Ziyadah – even more”</strong> means looking at the face of Allah, The Benevolent. This is proven and established from the explanation of this as mentioned in <em>Sahih Muslim</em> when the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was asked about az-Ziyadah he said, <em>“</em><em>Looking at their Rabb.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> “Undoubtedly, they will be veiled from their Rabb on that Day.” (Surah al-Mutaffifin: 15)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning the disbelievers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam ash-Shafi’i used this ayah as evidence to affirm the believers will see Allah in the Hereafter. He said, <em>“When Allah veiled them in anger, then there is evidence in this that they will see Him in delight.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, when the disbelievers were veiled, it proves the believers will see Allah. If they (the believers) do not see Allah, they and their detractors would be in a state of confusion regarding the veiling.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, and similarly, there are texts in the Mutawatir Sunnah that affirm the seeing of Allah. Allamah ibn al-Qayyim said, <em>“As for the ahadith from the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and his Companions which evidence the seeing of Allah are mutawatir.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> and he followed this up by transmitting 30 such reports in Hadi al-Arwah.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From such reports are the following,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Abu Hurayrah RadiAllahu Anhu when a group of Companions said, <em>&#8220;Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam! Will we see our Rabb on the Day of Resurrection?” The Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said, “Do you have any difficulty seeing the Moon when it is a full moon?” They said, “No, Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.” He said, “Do you have difficulty seeing the Sun when there are no clouds?” They said, “No, Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.” He said, “So you will see Him in the same way…”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><strong>[5]</strong></a> </em></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Hadith of Jarir bin Abdullah al-Bajali RadiAllahu Anhu when the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw the moon on the 14<sup>th</sup> night he said, <em>“</em><em>Certainly you will see your Rabb as you see this moon and you will have no trouble in seeing Him.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Abu Musa al-Ash’ari RadhiAllahu Anhu who narrates from the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who said, <em>“(There will be) two Paradises of silver and all the utensils and whatever is therein; and two Paradises of gold, and its utensils and whatever therein, and there will be nothing to prevent the people from seeing their Rabb except the Cover of Majesty over His Face in the Paradise of Adan.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Where Will the Believers See Allah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahlus Sunnah affirm the believers will see Allah in the Hereafter. As for seeing Allah in this world, then no one holds this to be correct. Furthermore, there is no dispute among Ahlus Sunnah in this regard (that anyone can see Allah in this world) except concerning our Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam when he ascended on the Night Journey. Ahlus Sunnah agree that he (The Prophet Sallalalhu Alayhi Wasallam) did not see Allah on earth, but they differed whether he saw Allah on the night of ascension and there are two views regarding this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[The Disagreement of the Scholars Whether the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam Saw Allah on the Night Journey and There are Two Views]</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The first view:</strong> He saw Allah with his normal eyes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The second view:</strong> He saw Allah with the eyes of his heart. This is the correct view due to the following reasons.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The statement of Ai’shah RadhiAllahu Anha when Masruq asked her, <em>“Did Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam see Allah”? She said, “My hair stood up by what you said! Then she said, “Whoever says to you that Muhammad saw Allah, has indeed lied.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Abu Dharr in <em>Sahih Muslim</em> when the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was asked did you see your Rabb (Allah) he said, <em>“Nur is all that I saw.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning, the Nur was his veiled barrier which prevented him from seeing him.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Abu Musa RadhiAllahu Anhu from the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who said, <em>“Allah, The Exalted and Mighty does not sleep, and it does not befit Him to sleep. He lowers and raises the scale. The deeds in the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day, and the deeds of the day before the deeds of the night. His veil is the Nur – light.” In another narration it mentions “The Fire. If he withdraws it (the veil), the splendour of His countenance would consume His creation so far as His sight reaches.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a></em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu alayhi Wasallam is included in the generality of the creation of Allah, The Exalted.    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Correct View is what the Researchers (Scholars) are Upon</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(they say) the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam did not see Allah on the Night of Ascension, but he heard the speech of Allah from behind the veiled barrier without an intermediary and he spoke with Allah as Musa spoke with Allah. Allah said, <strong>“It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by Revelation, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His Leave. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise.” (Surah ash-Shura: 51).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some scholars reconciled these texts like Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> so the scholars who held the view that the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw Allah based on the report of Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma who said, <em>“He Saw His Rabb (Allah) The Exalted.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> and what is transmitted from Imam Ahmad that the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw Allah as well and including all the texts and reports which affirm the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw Allah, are taken and understood as seeing with the heart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for what has been transmitted by the way of texts and reports which negate seeing Allah, are to be taken and understood as the negation of seeing Allah with the eyes. In this way the evidence is reconciled, and it is not contradictory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Those who held the view the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw Allah with his eyes include an-Nawawi, al-Qurtubi and a group of other scholars.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answering the Narrations Which Mention Seeing Allah with the Eyes</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">As for what has been transmitted from Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma that he said, <em>“He saw His Rabb (Allah) The Exalted.”</em> Then this is general and brief. It is also transmitted from him that he said, <em>“He saw with his heart.”</em> So, the first narration is unrestricted which the second narration is restricted or confined and the restricted is taken over the unrestricted.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly the same applies to what was transmitted from Imam Ahmad when he said, <em>“He saw (Allah)”</em> as it was transmitted from him that he said, <em>“He saw with his heart”</em>, so the restricted is taken over the unrestricted.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the seeing of Allah in this world, the scholars are agreed that no can see Allah, and no one differs with this except when our Prophet ascended on the night journey.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No consideration or importance is given to some of the people of innovation like the Sufis who say it is possible to see Allah. They engulf themselves in every danger when they believe it is possible to see Allah and this is the most futile of futilities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Seeing (wanting to see) Allah in this world is permissible but also an impossible and not a reality. It might be possible rationally but invalid and unreal according to the Shari’ah. As for the Hereafter, it is rationally permissible, valid, and real according to the Shari’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The evidence that supports the view that seeing Allah in this world is impossible is when Musa Alayhis Salam asked Allah to see Him. He said, <strong>“Oh my Rabb! Show me (Yourself), that I may look at You.” </strong>So, if it was possible to see Allah Musa would not have asked, and so in order to see Allah he asked. However, he heard the speech of Allah and wanted more and wanted to see Allah. Allah said, <strong>“You cannot see Me.”</strong> Meaning he did not have the capable power to see Allah due to the weakness of humans. So, when he said, <strong>“Oh my Rabb! Show me (Yourself), that I may look at You.&#8221;</strong> Allah said, <strong>“but look upon the mountain; if it stands still in its place then you shall see Me.&#8221;</strong> So, when Allah appeared to the mountain it was crushed to dust and Musa fell unconscious.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> As Allah said, <strong>“So when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He made it collapse to dust, and Musa fell down unconscious. Then when he regained consciousness, he said: “Glory be to You, I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.&#8221; (Surah al-A’raf: 143)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the Salaf said, <em>“He only appeared except the size of the tip of the little finger.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the Aqidah of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah regarding seeing Allah. As for the Day of Resurrection Allah will recreate the believers stronger and it would be possible for them to see Allah. A person decays when he dies, and he becomes dust except the tailbone.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> On the day of Resurrection Allah will send rain and the bodies of mankind will sprout. Allah restores human matter through transformation and thus recreates believers stronger which affirms the believers will see Allah. So, mankind is same of and in themselves, but their attributes have changed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>In Summary</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No one can see Allah in this world, nor the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam or anyone else. Seeing Allah is eternal bliss for the people of Paradise, and it is the greatest pleasure given to the people of Paradise that they will see Allah, as Allah said,<strong> “Those who do good will have the finest reward and even more.” (Surah Yunus: 26) </strong>and he said<strong>, “and with Us is even more.” (Surah Qaf: 35)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, when the believers see Allah in Paradise, they will forget the eternal bliss they are in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Religious View of the People of Innovation in Seeing Allah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, concerning the people of innovation they deny the seeing of Allah in this world and in the Hereafter. This is the belief of the Jahmiyyah, the Mu’tazilah and Asha’irah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mu’tazilah: They explain away the seeing of Allah as knowledge. They say the meaning of the statement of Allah, <em>“</em><em>So verily, you shall see your Rabb as you see the moon like on a night with a full moon.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> Meaning you will see your Rabb is to have knowledge of it without difficulty and without any doubts just as one knows the moon is the moon just as Allah says, <strong>“Have you not seen how your Rabb dealt with the owners of the Elephant?” (Surah al-Fil: 1)</strong> So, the seeing of Allah here means [having] knowledge of it i.e. meaning to have knowledge of how the owner of the elephants dealt with them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This explanation is absolutely futile and it renders the meaning invalid. The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said in a hadith. <em>“Like you see the Moon…like you see the Sun.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a> This is seeing with the eyes and not having the knowledge of seeing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the Asha’irah they affirm the seeing of Allah, but they reject the direction in which they will see Allah. They say we will see Allah but not in a specific direction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you say to them: Will you see Allah above, you? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him below you? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him on your right? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him on your left? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him in front of you? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him behind you? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So where will you see Him? They say: We will see him but not in any direction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is batil because whatever is seen must be facing opposite to what is seeing it. This is why the intelligent people laughed and mocked the position of Asha’irah: that we will see Allah but not in a specific direction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, with this approach they (the Asha’irah) wanted to be on the same position as the Mu’tazilah in rejecting Allah’s Uluww and direction while wanting to be on the same position of Ahlus Sunnah in affirming seeing Allah. However, they were unable to do this and resorted to arguments of sophistry, they saw these are valid arguments when they were not at all. This is the reason why the Asha’irah are hermaphrodites (transgendered) as Shaykh ul-Islam, <em>“The Mu’tazilah transgendered into philosophers and the Asha’irah transgendered into the Mu’tazilah.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning they are not with them or others in the issue of seeing of Allah and the same applies to many other issues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mu’tazilah and the Jahmiyyah reject the seeing of Allah and the Asha’irah affirm the seeing of Allah but negate the direction in which He will be seen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The correct and the true position is that of Ahlus Sunnah, that Allah will be seen on the Day of Resurrection while looking up and above. The hadith of Jabir RadhiAllahu Anhu in Sunan Ibn Majah which has some weakness to it. The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“While the people of Paradise are enjoying their blessings, a light will shine upon them, and they will raise their heads, and they will see their Rabb looking upon them from above. He will say: &#8220;Peace be upon you, Oh people of Paradise.&#8221; This is what Allah says in the ayah: &#8220;Salam (peace be upon you) &#8211; a Word from the Rabb (Allah), The Most Merciful.&#8221; He will look at them, and they will look at Him, and they will not pay any attention to the delights (of Paradise) so long as they look at Him, until He will screen Himself from them.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<h3><span style="color: #000080">Hadith No. 7443</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Yusuf bin Musa narrated to me: Abu Usamah narrated to me from Al-A&#8217;mash, from Khaythamah, from &#8216;Adiy bin Hatim who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;There is none amongst you except that his Rabb will speak to him, there will be no interpreter between them nor a veil to veil Him.&#8221; </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left">
<h3 style="text-align: left"><span style="color: #000080">Explanation of Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him)</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">And in this Hadith is a refutation of those that speak with &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217;¹, and its meaning is that Allah will introduce speech (yuhdithu al-qawl) in that Hour, He speaks to the one who is alone with him in that Hour, and those that speak with &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217; (i.e., the Asha&#8217;irah) say: &#8220;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi is eternal, however, Allah creates sounds when He wishes for someone to hear, and it is an expression from Al-Kalam An-Nafsi.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And on account of this, some of the intelligent said: The Madhab of the Asha&#8217;irah regarding the Speech [of Allah] is the Madhab of the Jahmiyyah, rather it is even worse! For verily they say that which is heard [in recitation] and that which is written in the Masahif is created, and it is [nothing more than] an expression from the [true] Speech of Allah, and as for the Speech of Allah then it is that which is in His Self, it is not heard and He does not speak when He wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the Jahmiyyah, then they said, &#8220;That which is heard is the Speech of Allah in reality, however it is created.&#8221; So who is closer to that which is correct? The Jahmiyyah, and this is the reason they said, &#8216;The speech of the Asha&#8217;irah regarding the Speech [of Allah] is worse than the speech of the Jahmiyyah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the reality of the matter, then there is no difference between them and the Jahmiyyah, for verily they are in agreement that what was heard by Muhammad ﷺ, and what was heard by Musa (Peace be upon him), and what will be heard in the future is all created. But the Asha&#8217;irah say that is an &#8216;Ibarah (Expression)² from Al-Kalam An-Nafsi, and these people say: &#8220;No! Rather it (the Speech of Allah) is a creation that He created, He created sounds which are heard, and He attributed them to His Self as a way of honouring and venerating.&#8221; &#8211; So this Hadith clearly refutes those that claim that the Speech of Allah is [just] the Meaning established eternally within His Self, and they have narrated that the Speech [of Allah] is like [His] Knowledge or [His] Will.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>(Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin, Sharh Kitab At-Tawhid min Sahih Al-Bukhari p. 437, 438,<br />
Dar Al-Kalim At-Tayyib, 1st Edn.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Translators Notes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>&#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi:&#8217; </strong>The Asha&#8217;irah reject that Allah has volitional actions (actions tied to His will), and this led to their belief in &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217;, the corrupt belief that Allah does not speak, rather the &#8216;Speech (Kalam)&#8217; is merely a single indivisible meaning which is established in His Essence &#8211; as for the Qur&#8217;an that we have with us which is written in the Mushaf and memorised by all Muslims, then it is <strong>created</strong> and merely an &#8216;Expression (&#8216;Ibarah)&#8217; of the Meaning which subsists within the Essence of Allah. Some went as far as claiming the Qur&#8217;an we have with us is the speech of Jibreel (Peace be upon him), rather than the Speech of Allah! Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;The Ash&#8217;ariyyah say: What is in the Mushaf is not the Speech of Allah, rather it is an &#8216;Ibarah (Expression) from Him [&#8230;] and these letters which are in the Qur&#8217;an, and the sounds which the Messenger heard, or Jibreel heard, verily it is created.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sharh Fath Al-Bariyyah bi-Talkhis Al-Hamawiyyah p. 314)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Madhab of Ahlus-Sunnah regarding the Speech of Allah: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu &#8216;Uthman As-Sabuni said, &#8220;And the Ahlul-Hadith testify and believe that the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah and His Book, and His Revelation, and that which He revealed is uncreated, and whoever speaks with its creation (i.e., that the Qur&#8217;an is created) and believes in it is a Kafir according to them.&#8221; <em>(Aqidatu&#8217;s Salaf wa Ashabu&#8217;l Hadith p. 165, Dar Al-&#8216;Asimah)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Muhammad bin Isma&#8217;il Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;I met more than 1000 men from the People of Knowledge: [From] the People of Hijaz, and Makkah, and Madinah, and Kufa, and Basrah, and Wasit, and Baghdad, and Sham (Levantine Region), and Misr (Egypt) [&#8230;] and I did not see one of them differ on these matters: [&#8230;] and that the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah, uncreated&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad of Imam Al-Lalaka&#8217;i 1/273-274, Dar Al-Lu&#8217;lua)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Abu Zur&#8217;ah and Abu Hatim Ar-Raziyayn said, &#8220;We reached the scholars of all the cities, in Hijaz, &#8216;Iraq, Sham, Yemen, and from their Madhab was: Al-&#8216;Iman is speech and action, it increases and it decreases, and the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah, uncreated from all aspects [&#8230;] and whoever claims that the Qur&#8217;an is created then he is a disbeliever in Allah Al-&#8216;Adhim, with a disbelief that removes him from the Religion, and whoever doubts his disbelief &#8211; from those that understand [this issue] &#8211; then he is [also] a disbeliever&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad of Imam Al-Lalaka&#8217;i 1/278-282, Dar Al-Lu&#8217;lua)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Ibn Battah narrated from Imam Ahmad who said, &#8220;And whoever says that verily Allah will not be seen in the Hereafter, then he is a Jahmi who has surely disbelieved&#8221; and &#8220;They will look at their Rabb, and He will look at them, and they will speak to Him, and He will speak to them, However He wills, Whenever He wills.&#8221; <em>(Al-Ibanah &#8216;an Shari&#8217;atu&#8217;l Firqatu&#8217;n Najiyah #47-48, Dar Al-Rayah)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Harb Al-Kirmani, companion of Imam Ahmad and Ishaq bin Rahuyah, transmitted consensus on this issue saying, &#8220;And the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah by which He speaks, uncreated, so whoever claims that the Qur&#8217;an is created then he is a Jahmi Kafir.&#8221; <em>(Ijma As-Salaf fi&#8217;l-I&#8217;tiqad p. 64, Dar Al-Imam Ahmad)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;Ahlus-Sunnah w&#8217;al-Jama&#8217;ah have agreed upon that Allah speaks, and His Speech is an Attribute in truth, established for Him in a manner which is befitting for Him. And He, Exalted is He, speaks with letters and sounds, however He wills, whenever He wills, and His Speech is an attribute of His Essence (Sifat Dhatiyyah) in terms of genus, and it is an attribute of action (Sifat Fi&#8217;liyyah) in terms of occurrences.&#8221;</strong> He commented on his own speech, explaining, &#8220;This is because it is connected to His Will, and every attribute connected to His Will is an attribute of action, and Speech in its essence is an attribute of the Essence, for verily Allah has not ceased and does not cease to be One that Speaks.&#8221; <em>(Sharh Fath Al-Bariyyah bi-Talkhis Al-Hamawiyyah p. 303, 304) </em></li>
</ol>
<p>² Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilani said, &#8220;So whoever claims that it (the Qur&#8217;an) is created, or an &#8216;Ibarah, or that the recitation is other than what is recited, or he says: &#8216;My articulation of the Qur&#8217;an is created&#8217;, then he is a disbeliever in Allah Almighty, he is not to be mingled with, or fed, or married, or neighboured&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Al-Ghunya li-Talibi 1/128, Dar Al-Kutub Al-&#8216;Ilmiyyah)</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Fir&#8217;aun (Pharaoh) said: &#8220;O Hâmân! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways, (36) &#8220;The ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the Ilâh (God) of Mûsa (Moses) But verily, I think him to be a liar.&#8221; Thus it was made fair-seeming, in Fir&#8217;aun&#8217;s (Pharaoh) eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the (Right) Path, and the plot of Fir&#8217;aun (Pharaoh) led to nothing but loss and destruction (for him).</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Ghāfir: 36-37]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are various points of benefit from these āyahs of which some are:</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The prophets and messengers of previous nations also held the creed that Allāh is above the heavens.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">To reject Allāh being above the heavens is to follow the way of Fir’aun the accursed.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed, to reject Allāh being above the heavens is that which leads to misguidance and a removal from the straight path of guidance.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Such a baseless creed of rejecting Allāh being above the heavens makes one’s evil deeds as seem fairing to the person.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Such a creed leads a person to find ways to reject and alter the Shari’ah revealed by Allāh [as was perpetrated by Fir’aun].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">However, Allāh destroys all false ways and alterations made by the person of false creed.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Tahāwī states:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Those from the Jahmiyyah sect who reject Allāh being high above are Firawnī [upon the way of Fir’aun]. Then those who affirm Allāh being high above are upon the way of Mūsa and Muhammad”.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">[Sharh Aqīdah Tahāwiyyah, pg:259]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And in the heaven is your provision, and that which you are promised.” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Adh-Dhāriyāt:22]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;You worship besides Allâh only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allâh have no power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allâh (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back.” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[al-Ankabūt:17]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is thus clearly established that the provision of sustenance is with Allāh and He is above the heavens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4] </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Do you feel secure that He, who is over [fī] the heaven (Allâh), will not cause the earth to sink with you, and then it should quake?” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[al-Mulk:16]</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5]</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Or do you feel secure that He, who is over [fī] the heaven (Allâh), will not send against you a violent whirlwind? Then you shall know how (terrible) has been My Warning.” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[al-Mulk:17]</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imām al-Bayhaqī comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The word [Fī] in these ayaat means over and above. It is saying are you not afraid of your Lord who is above the heavens? Similar to this is the meaning when Allāh says in the Qurān “so travel [Fī] the earth” also ‘and I will crucify you on [Fī] the trunks of palm trees’ [which is what Fir’aun said to the magicians when they believed in Mūsa]. It is clear that the ayah of travelling upon the earth means that the thing ‘above’ is the heavens and Allāh is above them. Therefore, the meaning of these ayaat shall be ‘Are you not afraid of the one who is above His Throne’ as is established in many other ayaat”.</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Al-Itiqād of al-Bayhaqī, pg 42]. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He also states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Abū Abdullah al-Hāfidh said the Shaikh Abū Bakr Ahmad Bin Ishāq Bin Ayūb the Jurist said that ‘The specialist linguists of the Arabic language have said that the word ‘Fī’ is used interchangeably with the word ‘alā’ [above/over] in the language. Allāh said ‘“so travel [Fī] the earth” and ‘and I will crucify you on [Fī] the trunks of palm trees’ here the word Fī in these ayaat means ‘alā’, i.e., over/above. It is likewise with this in mind we understand Allāh’s words in Quran when he says ‘Fī’ the heavens, i.e., it means above His Throne, above the heavens as has been mentioned in numerous prophetic traditions.”</span></em></p>
</blockquote>

<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Abu Abdullah al-Agharu and Abu Salamah Ibn Abdurahman: One Hadith</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[26] From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Abu Abdullah al-Aghar and from Abu Salama from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, &#8220;Our Rab (Nourisher, Cherisher, Guide, Administrator), the Blessed and Exalted, descends every night to the heaven of this world when the last third of the night is still to come and says, &#8216;Who will call on Me so that I may answer him? Who will ask Me so that I may give him? Who will ask forgiveness from Me so that I may forgive him?&#8217; &#8221;  </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> <span style="color: #000000">– [SAHIH]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Abu Abdullah al-Agharu) in Darimi ((1/347) hadith (no.1487)</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/214 hadith no.499, book 15, chapter 8, hadith no.30) at-Tamhid (7/128), al-Istidhkar: (no.468)    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.1145) and Muslim (no.758) from the hadith of Malik.  And in the original from Yahya’s narration: Yad’oni (compared to Yad’uni as said above)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">1) This hadith is mutawatir. at-Tamhid (7/128) and Nazmul al-Mutanasir (no.206)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) It is compulsory to have Iman that Allah the most High descends to the world in the last part of every night in a manner that befits His Majesty. Taking this to mean the mercy of Allah descending and performing ta’wil (false interpretation) of Allah descending is false.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) Allah the most High is above his Arsh in terms of His Essence, His Knowledge and Power covers everything.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The Jahmiyah (a severely misguided sect) described Allah all Glory be to Him the most High, to be everywhere in his essence. See Talbis Iblis (pg.30), this necessitates and leads to the heretical belief of incarnation. See Hafidh Ibn Taymiyaah’s book “Ibtal Wahdatul Wujud” expounding the belief of incarnation being futile and Mulla Ali Qari Hanafi&#8217;s book “Ar Rad Alal Qa’ilin Bi Wahdatul Wujud”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) Imam Malik said, “Allah the most High is in the heavens and His Knowledge encompasses every place. No place is free from His Knowledge. (Kitab al-Shar’iah of al-Ajuri (pg.289) hadith (no.652) and its chain is [Hasan] good)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) Imam Aw’zai, Malik, Sufyan Ath-Thawri and Layth Ibn Sa’d said about the Ahadith of the attributes (of Allah) that: they have been narrated without explaining how (the attributes are). (Aqidatus Salaf Wa Ashabul Hadith of As-Sabuni (pg.56) hadith (no.90) and its chain is [Hasan] good, another edition (pg.248, 249)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) Imam Abdullah Ibn al-Mubarak said, “We recognise our Rab, He is above the heavens above his Arsh, He is separate from His creation and we do not say as the Jahmiyyah say that He is here (on the Earth) and he (Imam Abdullah Ibn al-Mubarak) pointed towards the Earth. (Aqidatus Salaf Wa Ashabul Hadith of As-Sabuni (pg.186) hadith (no.28) and its chain is authentic, Ar Rad Alal Jahmiyah of al-Darimi: (no.67, no.162), Al Asma Wa Sifat of Al-Bayhaqi (pg.427) another edition (pg.538), As Sunnah of Abdullah Ibn Ahmad: (no.216))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) Imam Zuhri said, “Salvation lies in clinging to the Sunnah” (Hilyatul Awliya of Abu Na&#8217;im Al-Isbahani (3/369) and its chain is authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">9) This hadith establishes the permissibility for making Dua, it does not negate tawakul i.e. reliance in Allah but rather there is more need for it.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>AYĀT FROM THE QURĀN ON THE CREED OF THE SALAF. </strong></span></h4>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Indeed your Lord is Allāh, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty).</strong><strong>[Al-Arāf:54]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Surely, your Lord is Allāh Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty), disposing the affair of all things. </strong><strong>[Yūnas:2]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Allāh is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then, He rose above (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty). [Ar-Rʿad:2]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawa) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty) </strong><strong>[Taha:5]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six Days. Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). The Most Gracious (Allāh)! Ask Him as He is Al-Khabîr (The All-Knower of everything i.e. Allāh). </strong><strong>[Al-Furqān 59]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Allāh it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six Days. Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Walî (protector or helper) or an intercessor. Will you not then remember (or receive admonition)? </strong><strong>[As-Sajdah:4]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, and what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. And Allāh is the All-Seer of what you do. </strong><strong>[Al-Hadīd:4]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ISTIWĀ’ WITH THE MEANING OF ‘IRTIFĀ’ TO BE HIGH AND ABOVE.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is recorded in the Sahīh of Al-Bukhārī in the book of Tawhīd, chapter of ‘His Throne Was Above The Water<em>’</em> from <em>Abū Ālīyah that, “His saying “He rose above the heavens” meaning ‘Irtifā’ [he rose].” Mujāhid said it means “He rose high/above’ his Throne” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Ḥajr says <em>“Abū ʿĀlīyahs report has been cited by Ibn Jarīr in mawsūl via the route of ʿAbdullāh bin Jʿafar’s from his father from Abū ʿĀlīyah and Mujāhids report has been transmitted by al-Faryābī in his Tafsīr in mawsūl via the route of Warqā from Ibn Abī Najīh from Mujāhid.”</em> [Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī [22/427] and Fath al-Bārī of Ibn Ḥajr [17/176]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Imām Ishāq Ibn Rahawaihah states that he he heard from numerous specialist explainers of the Qurān that the meaning of <strong>“</strong><strong>The Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawā) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)”</strong> <em>“is that ‘Irtifā’ he rose/above.”</em>  [Jalāl ud-Dīn al-Qāsmī, Tafsīr Maḥāsin ut-Tā’wīl [7/2703]</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>TO SAY ‘ISTAWĀ’ [HE ROSE ABOVE] MEANS ‘ISTĪLĀ’ [HE CONQUERED] IS TOTALLY INCORRECT. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ismāʿīl al-Harawī narrates in his book <em>‘al-Fārūq’</em> with a chain of transmission from Dawūd bin Khalf that he was with Muḥammad bin Ziyād al-Lughawī when a man asked him about the ayah <strong>“</strong><strong>The</strong><strong> Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawā) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)</strong><strong> [Ta-ḥa 4].” </strong><em>He replied, “We accept it as he has informed us. The man said it means “he overcame and conquered [Istawlā].” al-Harawī replied, “Istawlā would only be correct if head any competitor or challenger to overcome so this cannot be correct.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad bin Aḥmad bin Naḍr al-Azdī transmits that he heard from Muḥammad bin Ziyād Al-Lughawī who said that <em>“Aḥmad Bin Dawūd enquired of me whether I could investigate whether the word “Istawā’ [he rose] has ever been recorded in the Arabic language as “Istawlā [He conquered]? I replied, “I swear by Allāh that I searched for this and could not find it in any place.”</em> [Fath al-Bārī of Ibn Ḥajr [17/177]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, the Hāfiẓ Ibn Qayyīm has recorded in his monumental work <em>‘As-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah’</em> over 42 replies to rebut the fact that ‘Istiwā’ in this verse does not mean ‘He conquered or overcame’. From amongst these are:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The third response is that al-Khattābī mentions in his book ‘Shiʿār ud-Dīn’ that, “Some have considered that Istiwā here means he overpowered basing this on some lines of poetry and these are not such that they can be used an evidential basis. If it meant as they say that he overpowered/conquered then this would render the verse confusing as Allāh’s knowledge and power is all encompassing then why would he need to ‘conquer’ his Throne whilst this is the case? The word ‘istawlā’ he overpowered would only be used for one who was stopped from something and then through struggle he achieved success by overpowering. So what is it that they say was ‘stopping or restricting’ Allāh? So these are the words of Al-Khattābī who was from amongst those who were known as a linguist.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,<em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The fifth response is that to say as they say falls under the forbidden action of explain the Qurān based on one’s own intellect. No Companion OF Muhammad, a successor of theirs or any scholar of the Muslims [mufassirs] have explained as they have. Let them know that Muhammad the prophet said that ‘let him take a seat in the fire of hell who explains the Qurān with his own opinion.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The tenth response is that the words ‘istawā’ and ‘istīlā’ have not been considered interchangeable in use by the scholars of the Arabic language and this is due to the reason that they both have distinct and separate features and meanings. Those who claim other than this are lying. Research the Qurān, Sunnah and Arabic language and syntax and you will never find that the word ‘istawā’ has come in the meaning of or interchangeable with ‘istīlā”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The fifteenth response is that Imam Abūl Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī has recorded a consensus that to take ‘istawā’ with the meaning of ‘istīlā’ is wholly incorrect.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The twenty seventh response is that the one amongst the creation who knows most about his lord is prophet Muhammad who has described in numerous traditions that Allāh is high and above and these traditions are an evidence of the explanation of such ayat”</em> [Mukhtaṣar as-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah, Muhammad al-Mawṣalī [2/321-326]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some have figuratively attempted to explain (Tāwīl) the fourth ayah and said that ʿAla is the action (Fʿil) and ar-Rahman is the one who does the act (Faʿil) and the Faʿil of Istawa is the ʿArsh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zarkashī refutes this (Tāwīl) and says, <em>“This is refuted from two angles the first is that the mu’awil (the one who did the tāwīl) made the attribute into an action and all of the scripts of the Qurān in Shām, ʿIrāq and Ḥijāz have ʿAla as a harf and if this was Fʿil (ie action) it would have been written with a Lām and ālif like for example at another instance it says, “Walʿalā Baḍuhum ʿala Bʿaḍ. The second reasons is the mu’awil rendered ʿArsh as marfū whereas none of the reciters ie Qura recite it like this.” </em>[Zarkashī, al-Burhān Fī ʿUlūm al-Qurān [2/81]  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the third reason is that it will contradict the other ayahs.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THOSE AYAT WHICH MENTION ALLĀH BEING ‘ISTAWĀ’ ABOVE THE HEAVENS. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything. </strong><strong>[Al-Baqarah:29]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2] </strong><strong>Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: &#8220;Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.&#8221; They both said: &#8220;We come, willingly.” [Fuṣilat:11]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already recorded the narration from <em>Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī</em> from Abu ʿĀlīyah that ‘istawā means he rose high above.’ In fact Ibn Qayyīm quotes an Ijmāʿ consensus that <em>“The meaning here is he rose high above.”</em> [Mukhtaṣar as-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah [2/320]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Baghawī explains the above ayat in his <em>‘Tafsīr Muʿālim ut-Tanzīl’</em> notes on Khāzin’ states, <em>“Many explainers of the Qurān from the Salaf and Ibn ʿAbbās explain this ayat to mean he rose above.”</em> [Tafsīr Muʿālim ut-Tanzīl [1/37]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Jarīr whilst explaining the above ayāt in his Tafsīr states in his Tafsīr <em>‘Jāmʿe ul-Bayān’</em> that, <em>‘The true meaning of the verse <strong>‘</strong></em><strong><em>He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything </em></strong><strong><em>[Al-Baqarah 29]</em></strong><em>’ is that he went high and rose above. Allāh showed his wisdom in creating the heavens and the earths. It is very strange that those who oppose this go against what is understood by the language of the Arabs, that is, he rose and was high. They prefer such meanings as they themselves give thinking that they will escape giving the verse a meaning which is not befitting to Allāh according to their own intellects. In fact, if he were to consider carefully his own explanation then in it he will find that which he was trying to avoid, for example, if he says istawā means he ‘turned towards/observed’ the heavens then we reply, was he ‘not observing/turned away’ from the heavens that you say he had to then ‘turn towards’ them? And if he replies, yes to this then we ask what is it that you base this on? In reality, his explanation causes more conflict and confusion and this is the very thing that he aimed to avoid in the first place. Praise be to Allāh I this way we reply to all those who oppose the truth and deviate from the true understanding of the Qurān. Abū Jʿafar said, that if someone were to ask us whether Allāh’s istiwā towards the heavens was before the heavens were created or after? Then we reply, it was after the heavens were created but Allāh said before he created the seven heavens that ‘</em><strong><em>Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: &#8220;Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.&#8221; They both said: &#8220;We come, willingly.’</em></strong><em> [Fussilāt 11]. </em><em>So the istiwā was after the creation of the smoke but before the formation of them into seven heavens. </em><em> </em><em>In regards to the word in the verse ‘Fasawwahunna’ i.e., [he made them] then this means that he created and originated them. He made them as he willed with perfection and suitability.  In Arabic ‘taswiyah’ means to make something correct and suitable, as it is said in the language ‘so and so made such a thing suitable’. So Allāh created the heavens in a most suitable way as he willed and planned and when they close he opens them as per his will.”</em> [Tafsīr at-Ṭabarī [1/192]</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE MENTION OF THE ‘GREAT THRONE’ OF ALLĀH. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] But if they turn away, say (O Muhammad): &#8220;Allāh is sufficient for me. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), in Him I put my trust and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne. </strong><strong>[At-Tawbah:129] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2] </strong><strong>And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. [Hūd:7]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[3] Had there been therein (in the heavens and the earth) âlihah (gods) besides Allāh, then verily both would have been ruined. Glorified is Allāh, the Lord of the Throne, (High is He) above all that they attribute to Him! [Al-Anbiyā:21]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[4]   </strong> <strong>Say: &#8220;Who is (the) Lord of the seven heavens, and (the) Lord of the Great Throne?&#8221; (86) They will say: &#8220;Allāh.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Will you not then fear Allāh (believe in His Oneness, obey Him, believe in the Resurrection and Recompense for every good or bad deed)?&#8221; </strong><strong>[Al-Muminūn:86-87]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[5] So Exalted is Allāh, the True King, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne! [Al-Muminūn:116]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[6] </strong><strong>Allāh, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne! [An-Naml:26] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[7] (He is Allāh) Owner of High Ranks and Degrees, the Owner of the Throne. [Al-Ghāfir:15] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[8] </strong><strong> Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted is He from all that they ascribe (to Him). [Az-Zukhruf:82]</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[9] </strong><strong>Owner of the Throne, the Glorious. </strong><strong>[AL-Burūj:16] </strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE MEANING OF ARSH [THRONE]. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the meaning itself of Throne is the indication of Allāh being high and above as is found in the verses and narrations. Then it should be known that Allāh being above his Throne shows he is above it and ‘bāin ʿanil Khalq’ separate and distinct from his creation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Bakr al-Ājurī said in his book <em>‘ash-Sharīʿah’</em> that, <em>“It is the madhab of the scholars that Allāh is above his Throne above the heavens. His knowledge encompasses all. He knows that which is in the heavens, earth and that which is beneath it. He knows that which is open and hidden. He knows that which is concealed in the chests and the deceitful eyes. He knows the affairs of the hearts and every beat it takes before it occurs. There is not a particle in the heavens or earth except that he is aware of it. He is above his Throne. He raises the deeds of the people up towards himself and he is aware of their deeds even more so than those angels whose duty it is to record such deeds.” </em>[Imām Abū Bakr al-Ājurī, ash-Sharīʿah [pg.288]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the first ayah above, <em>“It shows he is the originator and owner and this is why he is the owner of the great Throne. His Throne is a ceiling for all of creation including all of the heavens, earth and all that is what is between them. His knowledge is encompassing everything. His decree is upon everything and he is the creator of all.” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [2/404]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Tafsīr <em>‘Madārik ut-Tanzīl’</em> of Nasafī’ considers the ayah <em>“The Lord of the mighty Throne’ that the greatest of the creation was his Throne, which is a place of where duʿā is directed by those in the heavens.”</em> [Tafsīr Nasafī [2/152]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the second ayah above, <em>“Ibn Abbās (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhuma) said that the Throne was given this title as it is something which is high/above. Ismāʿīl bin Abī Khālid said he heard Sʿād Ṭā’ī say that the Throne is red/ruby in colour. Muḥammad bin Ishāq said concerning the verse <strong>‘And</strong></em><strong><em> He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds’, </em></strong><em>that, it is as he has described. There is nothing but water, upon this is the great Throne and above this is Allāh, the owner of all majesty and great, the wisest, the ablest and the one who is most merciful, wise all bountiful. He does as he wills and wishes.”</em> [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [2/437]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Nasafī states concerning the second verse, <em>“Meaning that his Throne was above the water, that is, before the creation of the heavens and the earth there was nothing but water beneath his Throne.”</em> [Tafsīr Nasafī [2/13]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is stated in <em>‘Tafsīr al-Futūhat al-Ilāhīyah lil Jamal’</em> that, <em>“He was where he is now, that is, above the seven heavens and the water was where it is now, that is, below his Throne.” </em>[Tafsīr al-Futūhat al-Ilāhīyah lil Jamal [2/382]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the fourth ayah above, <em>“He is the lord of the mighty Throne which is a ceiling for his creation. It is mentioned in the narration transmitted by Abū Dawūd that the prophet said ‘Your Lords status is the greatest and his Throne is above the heavens’. [after recording a few more narrations] Ḍihāk narrates from Ibn Abbās (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) that ‘it is called ʿArsh [Throne] due to it being lofty/high’. Aʿmash narrates from Kʿab al-Ahbār that the heavens and earth in relation to the Throne are as if a small lamp is lit hanging in between the heaven and the earth. Mujāhid states that ‘the heavens and earth in relation to the Throne are like a small ring which are left in a vast plain.” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [3/253]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the fifth ayah above, <em>“The Throne is a ceiling for the entire creation. It is called ‘ʿArshul Karīm’ [supreme Throne] as it is the most beautiful to look at greatest presence.  As Allāh has said ‘</em><em>And We send down water (rain) from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind to grow therein.’ [Luqmān:9]” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [3/259]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Nasafī states, <em>“It is called supreme Throne as all mercy from Allāh descends from there or that the closest most supreme angels surround it.” </em>[Tafsīr Nasafī [3/130]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Khāzin records that, <em>“Karīm, that is beautiful. Others have said it means high. It is recorded as such by Baghawī in his footnotes on Khāzin.”</em> [Tafsīr al-Khāzin [5/38]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shawkāni states in his <em>‘Tafsīr Fath al-Qadīr’ </em>that, <em>“It is called the supreme Throne because Allāh descends his mercy to his creation from it or it is supreme due to the fact that the one who is above it [the Throne] is the most supreme as it is said by the Arabs ‘the noble house’, meaning that the one who resides in it is noble.” </em>[Fath al-Qadīr [3/485]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the ninth ayah above, <em>“Glorious Throne, that is, he is the owner of the great Throne which is above all of creation.”</em> [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [4/496]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nasafī states, <em>“Glorious, that is, the creator of the Throne is the most glorious and greatest. Glorious here also refers to his Throne as well as himself. Meaning, that the one who is the owner of the Throne is even more Glorious than it.” </em>[Nasafī [4/346]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in Jalālayn it says, <em>“Glorious, that is, the owner and creator of the Throne is the most glorious. Glorious, meaning that the one who is completely deserving of the attribute of being highest and it is like this in ‘Jamal’ and ‘Maḥāsin at-Tā’wīl.”</em>  [Jalalayn [12/422], Jamal [4/515] and Maḥāsin at-Tā’wīl [18/6118]  </span></p>
