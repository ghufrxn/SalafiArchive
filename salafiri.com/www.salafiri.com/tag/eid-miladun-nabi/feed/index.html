				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In this article, we shall be discussing with evidences which all celebrations that are reoccurring (whether yearly, monthly or weekly) are allowed for us Muslims to engage in and celebrate thereby.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||Meaning of &#8216;Eid||</strong><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Al-Azhari (D. 370) said in Tahdhīb al-Lughah (3/84):<br />
<strong> “And ‘eid for the ‘Arabs means: the time wherein happiness and sadness is (frequently) returned”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">al-Nawawī (D. 676) said in Al-Majmū’ (5/2):<br />
<strong> “’Eid is from ‘Awd which means to return as it repeats”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ibn Manẓūr (D. 711) said in Lisān al-’Arab (3/319):<br />
<strong> “Any day where there is a (repetitive) gathering”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ibn Taymiyyah (D. 728) said in Iqtiḍā al-Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqīm (1/496):<br />
<strong> “’Eid is a name for what repeats with a general gathering and repetition”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">al-Fīrūzabādī (D. 817) said in Al-Muḥīṭ (p. 302):<br />
<strong> “what repeats from distress, sickness or sadness etc. Or a day where people gather”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">And other scholars whose mentioning would prolong the article</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||Number of ‘Eid in Islam||</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ibn Ḥazm (D. 456) said in al-Muḥallā (3/293):<br />
<strong> “They are ‘Eid al-Fiṭr of Ramadan which is the first day of Shawwāl and the day of (‘Eid) al-Aḍḥā which is the tenth day of Dhul Ḥijjah. There is no ‘Eid for the Muslims apart from them except Friday and the three days (tashrīq) after the day of al-Aḍḥā as Allah Ta’ala has not made for them an ‘Eid other than what we mentioned, nor His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and there is no dispute between the people of Islam over that”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">We know that Ijmā’ (consensus) is one of the proofs of our religion, perhaps I may write an article on that too if Allah allows</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>(1) ‘Eid al-Fiṭr and ‘Eid al-</strong><strong>Aḍḥā </strong><br />
<strong> Narrated &#8216;Āishah رضي الله عنها that once Abu Bakr entered upon her on the day of &#8216;Eid al-Fiṭr or &#8216;Eid al-Aḍḥā while the Prophet (يصلى الله عليه وسلم) was present and there were two girl singers with her, singing songs of the Ansar about the day of Bu&#8217;āth. So Abu Bakr said twice: &#8220;Musical instrument of Satan!&#8221; But the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, &#8220;Leave them Abu Bakr, For every nation has an &#8216;Eid and this day is our &#8216;Eid.&#8221; </strong>[al-Bukhāri 3931 &amp; Muslim 892]
<p style="text-align: left">Anas رضي الله عنه reported:<br />
<strong> Allah&#8217;s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم arrived in Medina during two days in which they were celebrating. The Prophet said, “What are these two days?” They said, “We would celebrate these two days in the time of Jāhiliyyah (before Islam)” The Prophet said, “Verily, Allah has replaced these two days with two better days: Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr.”</strong> [Abu Dawud 1134 &amp; Nasai 1556 both with Sahih isnad]
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin al-&#8216;Āaṣ رضي الله عنهما said that Allah&#8217;s messenger said to a man:</strong><br />
<strong> “I have been instructed to take the day of al-Aḍḥā as an &#8216;Eid which Allah, &#8216;Azza wa Jall, has ordained for this Ummah.”</strong> [al-Nasai 4365 &amp; Abu Dawud 2789 with Hasan Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>(2) Friday</strong><br />
Ibn Khuzaymah (D. 311) named a chapter in his Sahih:<br />
<strong> “The evidence that Friday is an ‘Eid”</strong> (before hadith 2161)</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Ibn Abbas رضي الله عنهما recited: “&#8217;This day, I perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and chose for you Islam as your religion&#8217; [5:3] and a Jew was with him who said: ‘If this Ayah was revealed to us then we would have taken that day as a day of celebration.’ So Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: “Indeed it was revealed on two &#8216;Eids: On Friday, and on the Day of &#8216;Arafah.” </strong>[al-Tirmidhi 3044 with Sahih Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>(3) Days of Tashrīq (the three days after ‘Eid al-Aḍḥā)</strong><br />
<strong> Narrated Uqbah bin &#8216;Amir رضي الله عنه that Allah&#8217;s messenger said:</strong><br />
<strong> &#8220;The day of &#8216;Arafat and the day of sacrifice and the day of At-Tashriq are our ‘Eid, the people of Islam, and they are days of eating and drinking.&#8221;</strong> [al-Nasai 3007, al-Tirmidhi 773, Abu Dawud 2419 all with Hasan Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left">Note: Just because they are named as &#8216;Eid does not mean all the rulings of the two &#8216;Eid also apply</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||It is not allowed to engage in any other festival||</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Allah said: <strong>&#8220;<span id="verse_2662_language_6_content">For every religion We have appointed rites which they perform.</span>&#8220;</strong> [al-Hajj 22:67]
<p style="text-align: left">Thābit bin  al-Ḍaḥḥāk رضي الله عنه reported:<br />
<strong> A man in the time of the Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه وسلم made a vow to sacrifice a camel at a placed called Buwanah. He came to the Prophet and he said, “I have made a vow to sacrifice a camel at Buwanah.” The Prophet said, “Were there any idols worshipped there in the time of ignorance?” They said no. The Prophet said, “Were any of their idolatrous festivals celebrated there?” They said no. The Prophet said, “Fulfill your vow, for a vow in disobedience to Allah must not be fulfilled, nor a vow over which the son of Adam has not control.”</strong> [Abu Dawud 3313 with Sahih Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left">We know the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم does not ask a question without any reason, this shows that sacrificing at a place where festivals of the disbelievers are held is a preventive factor, even if the intentions are pure, for we do not engage in what the non-Muslims do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ibnul Qayyim (D. 751) said in Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah (2/246):<br />
<strong> “And indeed Allah Subhanah has named their festivals (the mushrikeen) as falsehood and falsehood is not allowed to be attended. Allah said: ‘And those who do not witness falsehood, and when they pass by ill speech, they pass by with dignity’”</strong> [25:72]
<p style="text-align: left">And he said in the next page:<br />
<strong> “It is impermissible for the Muslims to attend the festivals of the mushrikeen or help them upon it, according to the consensus of the scholars whose words carry weight. The fuqaha’ who follow the four schools of thought have stated this clearly in their books”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Al-Khallal (D. 311) named a chapter in Ahkam ahl al-milal (before no. 126):<br />
<strong>“impermissibility of Muslims to go out on the festivals of mushrikeen”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">al-Bayhaqi (D. 458) named a chapter in his sunan al-Kubra (9/234):<br />
<strong>“impermissibility of Muslims entering on ahl al-Dhimmah in their churches and imitating them on their Nawruz and Mihrajaan”</strong> (these are two festivals of the Persians)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||Any other festival is either imitating them or an innovation||</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Allah said: “And for every nation We have appointed religious ceremonies”</strong> [al-Hajj 22:34]
<p style="text-align: left">Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said:<strong><br />
“Whoever imitates a people is one of them.”</strong> [Abu Dawud 4031; Hasan]
<p style="text-align: left">‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas رضي الله عنهما reported:<br />
<strong> “Whoever lives in the land of non-Arabs and engages in their Nawruz (persian new year) and Mahrajan (persian festival) and imitates them until he dies upon that, he will be resurrected with them on the day of judgement”</strong> [al-Sunan al-Kubra li al-Bayhaqi 18896 with Hasan Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left">The history of the festivals other than the ones permitted in Islam either go back to the disbelievers or due to an innovation which the Muslims performed without the Salaf preceding them. We shall present some examples.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Birthdays:</strong><br />
<strong>&#8220;The highest of all holidays in the Satanic religion is the date of one&#8217;s own birth&#8221;</strong> [Satanic Bible, ch. Religious holidays, p.53]
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Independence day:<br />
</strong><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10008" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/independance.png?resize=300%2C164" alt="independance" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/independance.png?resize=300%2C164 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/independance.png?w=613 613w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
<strong>&#8220;I am apt to believe that it (decleration of independance) will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.&#8221;</strong> [Letter from John Adams to Abigail Adams, 3 July 1776, p. 3]
<p style="text-align: left">The Prophet’s birthday يصلى الله عليه وسلم:<br />
<strong> It was started by the Fatimites, A sect from the Shi’ah</strong> [see al-Mawa’idh wal I’tibar (2/436) by Taqi al-Din al-Maqrizi (D. 845)]
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||Conclusion||</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">As a Muslim, we should be steadfast according to what our creator has commanded with, as He said:<br />
<strong> “So remain steadfast as you are commanded”</strong> [11:112].</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Do not look at what the people do as Allah said:<br />
<strong> “And if you obey majority of those on earth, they will mislead you from the way of Allah”</strong> [6:116]
<p style="text-align: left">and do not be surprised by their numbers for you have a great reward. Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said:<strong>“Islam initiated as something strange, and it would revert to being strange. so good tidings for the stranger.”</strong> [Muslim 145]
<p style="text-align: left">and he said:<br />
<strong> “The nations were shown to me and one or two Prophets would pass by me with a group (of followers), and a Prophet who had no one with him…”</strong> [al-Bukhari 5705, Muslim 220]
<p style="text-align: left">Remember that Islam is a complete guideline of one&#8217;s life, we must implement Islam even when it comes to celebrating. Allah said: <strong>“Enter into Islam completely”</strong> [2:208]
<p style="text-align: left">Therefore my beloved brother/sister, leave these celebrations for Allah’s sake, He will reward you with something better. Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said:<br />
<strong> “Verily, you will never leave anything for the sake of Allah Almighty but that Allah will replace it with something better for you.”</strong> [Musnad Ahmad 23074 with Sahih Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left">Do not worry about others being displeased with you if Allah is pleased with you. Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“Whoever pleases Allah with the displeasure of the people, Allah will suffice him. And whoever displeases Allah with the pleasure, Allah leaves him to the people”</strong> [al-Ihsan fi taqrib Sahih Ibn Hibban 277 with Sahih Isnad]

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some people attribute the following to Imam Ibn Taymiyyah</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“This is Imam Ibn Taymiyya’s opinion about Mawlid from: “the Collected Fatwas,” (“Majma’ Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya,”) Vol. 23, p. 163: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“fa-t’adheem al-Mawlid wat-tikhaadhuhu mawsiman qad yaf’alahu ba’ad an-naasi wa yakunu lahu feehi ajra `adheem lihusni qasdihi t’adheemihi li-Rasulillahi, salla-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“To celebrate and to honor the birth of the Prophet (s) and to take it as an honored season, as some of the people are doing, is good and in it there is a great reward, because of their good intentions in honoring the Prophet (s).”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">we already mentioned in a previous paper <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Part 33 <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-33-part-a-shaikh-al-islam-ibn-taymiyyah-728h-demolishing-the-bidah-of-mawlid-what-did-he-really-say/">SEE HERE</a></strong></span> that Muhammad Hisham Kabbani, a sufi misguider from America cites half of the words of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah in his <em>Encyclopaedia of Islamic doctrine</em> (3:15) wherein he mentions the words of the great reward aspect only whilst having distorted Ibn Taymiyyahs words to show the readers that he approved the mawlid. A number of other sufi writers and mawlid proponents have reproduced these words of Shaykh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah in their various treatises.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other scholars like the former grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Al-al-Shaikh dismissed such statements allegedly supporting statements of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah for the mawlid, more so its relevance because of the sheer overwhelming number of statements and clear ruling against the mawlid and declaring it to be an innovation from Imam Ibn Taymiyyah himself. (<em>Rasai&#8217;il Fi Hukm al-Ihtifal Bi al-Mawlid al-Nabawi</em> (1:45)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaikh Isma&#8217;il al-Ansari also answered such false aspersions on the position of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and he also criticised the sufi, Muhammad Alawi Maliki who had cited the same words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah whilst distorting them. Shaikh Ismail al-Ansari answers such points in his specific and detailed treatise on this issue titled, <em>al-Qawl al-Fasl Fi Hukm al-Tawassul Bi Khayr al-Rusul.</em> (See <em>Rasai&#8217;il Fi Hukm al-Ihtifal Bi al-Mawlid al-Nabawi</em> (2:391-884)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Egyptian Salafi scholar Shaikh Muhammad Hamid Fiqi answers this point and says how can such people receive reward when they oppose the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah and the way of the companions. He goes onto say if they argue they reached this conclusion through their independent reasoning i.e. ijtihad but they made a mistake then what kind of ijtihad is this in that it opposes the conclusive and established texts of ibadah and thus it falls outside the remit of ijtihad. (See his notes to the <em>Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim</em> (p.294-296), see also <em>Rasai&#8217;il Fi Hukm al-Ihtifal Bi al-Mawlid al-Nabawi</em> (1:220-223)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah very clearly himself ruled the mawlid to be a reprehensible i.e. makruh innovation because the Salaf us-Saleh did not celebrate it. (<em>Majmu’a al-Fatawa</em> (1:36)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaykh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah was asked can a person recite the whole of the Quran in honour of the Prophets birthday? Instead of giving a straight yes or no answer, he expands on the discusison and deals with all of the innovated festivals or Eids. he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;The gathering of the people for food during the two eids is a normal sunnah as they are the rites of Islam which the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) set for the muslims and by caring for the poor by feeding them during Ramadan is a a sunnah of Islam. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said whoever feeds the fasting person will receive a similar reward to him.&#8221; Also helping the poor recitors of the Quran is a virtuous act at any time and therefore whoever supports them shares the reward. And as for the establishment of a seasonal festival (mawsim) that is not among the lawful i.e. shari&#8217;ah festivals such as one of the nights of Rabi al-Awwal, which is said to be the night of the mawlid or one of the nights of Rajab or the 18th of of Dhul Hijjah of the first friday prayer of Rajab or the eighth of Shawwal which the ignorant call the festival of the righteous ones i.e. Eid al-Abrar, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">THESE ARE AMONG THE INNOVATIONS &#8211; BID&#8217;AH THAT THE SALAF US-SALEH DID NOT RECOMMEND NOR DID THEY PRACTISE</span></strong> and Allah the mighty and exalted knows best.&#8221; (<em>Majmu&#8217;a al-Fatawa</em> (1:312)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The avid reader is referred to the monumental book which has been oft quoted in these papers, namely <em>Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim </em>wherein Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah deals with the innovated festivals and Eids in great detail and lays the foundations and principles of Ahl al-Sunnah wal Jama&#8217;ah. A lot of content can be added to the understanding of the mawlid from the words of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah which would be beyond the simplicity of these papers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, before we conclude the series on Imam Ibn Taymiyyah on the mawlid and how the Sufiyyah have miserably failed to show Ibn Taymiyyah approved the mawlid, let us show the Sufi Barelwi and the global Sufiyyah that they are very quick to quote Ibn Taymiyyah to us, so we ask what they make of Muhammad Alawi Maliki arguing that special gatherings of the Prophets Birthday are lawful because it is understood to be a custom and not worship and not ibadah. Muhammad Alawi Maliki furthers his argument and says if the mawlid was considered a special day of worship it would be an unlawful i.e. haram bid&#8217;ah  (see his <em>Hawl al-Ihtifal Bil Mawlid al-Nabawi al-Sharif</em> (p.12) and <em>Mafahim Yajib An Tusahhaha</em> (p.224-226)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first point is a very poor deduction and a clever ploy to dodge the ruling of innovation and an attempt to hide under the cloak of adat i.e. custom. This is a false notion because an adat or custom is something that has always been practised by the Muslims and or the custom of a group of muslims from different lands and this is limited in number because if all of the Muslims began to do this, it no longer remains a custom. Secondly customs are only accepted if they do not oppose the texts of Islam as any custom which opposes the clear guidance from the Quran and Sunnah is rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One only needs to ask the participants of the mawlid gatherings to see how much Islam they have within them and how the pristine shari&#8217;ah is violated. To say the mawlid is a muslim custom is the most powerful stretch of the imagination because there is no reward in a custom so then why do it and if it is a custom as wishfully claimed, then why is it called an Eid, surely this is highly contradictory and a case of polemics???</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for Muhammad Alawi Maliki&#8217;s second point, then we find the mawlid sympathisers do consider the mawlid to be a special day, wherein special gatherings are organised, food is made, lights adorn the houses and special events and processions are organised around the globe. This clearly shows they do consider the mawlid to be a special day of worship and they do single out  special day i.e. the 12th of Rabi al-Awwal. Therefore according to their own scholar, Muhammad Alawi Maliki the Sufi Barelwis are committing an unlawful innovation i.e. a haram bid&#8217;ah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people attribute the following to Imam Ibn Taymiyyah</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“This is Imam Ibn Taymiyya’s opinion about Mawlid from: “the Collected Fatwas,” (“Majma’ Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya,”) Vol. 23, p. 163: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“fa-t’adheem al-Mawlid wat-tikhaadhuhu mawsiman qad yaf’alahu ba’ad an-naasi wa yakunu lahu feehi ajra `adheem lihusni qasdihi t’adheemihi li-Rasulillahi, salla-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“To celebrate and to honor the birth of the Prophet (s) and to take it as an honored season, as some of the people are doing, is good and in it there is a great reward, because of their good intentions in honoring the Prophet (s).”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even the beginning ardent supporter of the Mawlid knows who Shaikh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah was and his firm positions on innovations and their destructive affects. They find literally one sentence from his magnitude of works and say he supported the Mawlid!!! Sometimes even shame is ashamed of the antics of these people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is known that Imam Ibn Taymiyyah vehemently repelled and subdued innovations and the innovators and his students like Imam al-Bazzar and Imam Ibn Abdul Hadi amongst others all testified to Imam Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s unparalleled efforts in refuting innovations. (<em>al-Uqud al-Durriyyah Min Manaqib Shaikh ul-Islam Ahmad ibn Taymiyyah</em> (p.2) <em>al-A&#8217;lam al-Aliyyah Fi Manaqib Ibn Taymiyyah</em> (p.33), <em>Kawakaib al-Duriyyah Fi Manaqib al-Mujtahid Ibn Taymiyyah</em> (p.52)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is contradictory for Imam Ibn Taymiyyah to say what the opponents allege because he defines innovations very clearly, he said they are things which are not prescribed in the Din of Allah. (<em>Majmu&#8217;a al-Fatawa</em> (31:36). Therefore how can there be a great reward for doing something that is a bid&#8217;ah i.e. not prescribed in the Din of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also very clearly mentions the views and positions of the scholars or leaders that occur in different places whether minority or a majority cannot be used whatsoever as evidence to justify innovations. This is also therefore an answer to the simple beguiled Muslims who sympathize with the Barelwi Sufi&#8217;s doctrine due to their cultural background and link with what they have been custom to without looking at the intrinsic arguments. (<em>Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim</em> (2:584)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah further expounds on the understanding of the Mawlid sympathisers and explains that most of the innovations which have been introduced and formulated by leaders and scholars, have been done so by the aforementioned categories of people thinking they are good and something beneficial. The Mawlid is therefore a classical example of something innovated to build and establish acts for community cohesion and for other reasons which range from socio-political reasons and for popular supports etc. (<em>Majmu&#8217;a al-Fatawa</em> (11:345), <em>Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim</em> (2:594)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We known from the previous Mawlid Paper 33 <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/?p=5763&amp;preview=true">SEE HERE</a></strong></span> Imam Ibn Taymiyyah classified the Mawlid as an innovation and when he said, &#8220;<em>they may be rewarded for this love and ijtihaad&#8221; (Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim </em>(2:619) he explains this and says a scholar will be excused if he erred by exercising independent ijtihad and he may even be rewarded for his efforts but this does not mean the people make taqlid of such a scholar because his ruling and reasoning may be flawed, incorrect and inaccurate. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When this is the case it cannot be argued that such innovations or practices are something praiseworthy or even carry any reward or a great reward for that matter because Imam Ibn Taymiyyah clearly said and argues himself that if any action is considered to be good there must be divine text in support of the action or practise. If there is a textual evidence for any action say for instance the Mawlid then it will be considered a permissible action according to the shari&#8217;ah and not a good innovation i.e. bid&#8217;ah hasanah as some of the proponents of the Mawlid claim regarding the mawlid. (<em>Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim</em> (2:584)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They claim and acknowledge the mawlid was never practiced in the first three generations and it is only the extreme ignorant ones who try to prove the mawlid by distorting the texts or using unrelated, non specific and general evidences such as the Barelwi Sufi&#8217;s spread across the Sufi Tariqahs. Thus, the intellectual prodigies amongst them argue the mawlid is therefore a good bid&#8217;ah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah also clarified that many scholars or individuals introduced innovations with the sole intention to corrupt and to taint the Shari&#8217;ah and when this is his understanding it would be contradictory for him to say there is a great reward for the one who practices the mawlid. (<em>al-Nabuwwah</em> (p.154)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people of innovation and the ardent proponents of Mawlid al-Nabi often mention in support of their view a statement of Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah which they firstly take out of context and secondly misquote by only citing the beginning of the statement. It is very strange and odd that these people quote and present the statement of Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah for the mawlid when they spend night and day declaring him to a heretic and an anthropomorphist. If they say they have only quoted Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah as an evidence against the Salafi&#8217;s and the Ahl al-Hadith, then this yet again is another serious contradiction and shows the people of innovation do not have sound intelligence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On one hand they call us la-madhahabiyyah or ghair muqallids and then at the same time they quote our scholars to us as evidence. Without digressing from the issue at hand, why would the statement of a scholar be a hujjah for the very same people you call ghair muqallids. This is nonsensical and a clear proof the people of shirk and bid&#8217;ah have the most incongruous of intellects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sufis have done the rounds with a statement of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah with a failed attempt to support the Mawlid. Mr Sufi himself; Hisham Kabbani pushed this statement around and his cohorts solidified it amongst their fellow sufi brethren. They refer to the statement of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah where he said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;This is Imam Ibn Taymiyya&#8217;s opinion about Mawlid from: &#8220;the Collected Fatwas,&#8221; (&#8220;Majma&#8217; Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya,&#8221;) Vol. 23, p. 163: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><i>&#8220;fa-t&#8217;adheem al-Mawlid wat-tikhaadhuhu mawsiman qad yaf&#8217;alahu ba&#8217;ad an-naasi wa yakunu lahu feehi ajra `adheem lihusni qasdihi t&#8217;adheemihi li-Rasulillahi, salla-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam&#8221; </i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;To celebrate and to honor the birth of the Prophet (s) and to take it as an honored season, as some of the people are doing, is good and in it there is a great reward, because of their good intentions in honoring the Prophet (s).&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some of them even reproduce the following from Imam Ibn Taymiyyah,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“<em>And similarly what some people innovate by analogy with the Christians who celebrate the birth of ‘Eesa (Jesus), or out of love for the Prophet (saw) and to exalt him, and may Allaah reward them for this love and effort, not on the fact that it is an innovation…</em>” (Majmu’a al-Fatawa, <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">Vol.23</span> p.163, Iqtida’ al-Sirat al-Mustaqim, p.294-295, Section entitled, &#8216;The innovated festivals of time and place.&#8217;)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, this is a false interpretation and representation of his words which is not surprising to say the least, as one would only be surprised if they were accurate and precise for once in quoting Ahl al-Sunnah. Imam Ibn Taymiyyah said in his monumental book, <em>Iqtidaa&#8217; al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim</em> &#8216;Following the Straight Path in Opposing the People of the Hell-Fire&#8217;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“And like that, what some people have innovated, be it out of analogy to the Christians in the birth of ‘Eesa or be it out of love for the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and honor for him and Allah, they may be rewarded for this love and ijtihaad, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">not for the innovation as an ‘Eid</span></strong></span>. Along with the difference between the people with regards to his birth, this (celebration) was not done by the early generations of pious scholars even though factors that would have necessitating [the Mawlid] were present and there was a lack of any factors that would prevent them from doing so if it had indeed been good.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>If this [the Mawlid] was genuinely good or the correct opinion then the pious scholars of the early generations (may Allaah be pleased with them) would have been more entitled to it than us. They had greater love for the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and were more honouring of him than us; they were more eager upon goodness.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>Indeed, from the perfection of loving and honouring him is in following him, being obedient to him, following his command, reviving his Sunnah both in secrecy and open, spreading that which he was sent with, striving regarding that with one’s heart, hand and tongue. For indeed this is the path of the first of the early generations [who accepted his message] from the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar, and those that followed them in goodness.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>Most of them who you find eager upon such innovations (Bid’ah) despite their good intention and striving – for these two things reward is hoped (i.e. their good intention and striving) – however you find them weak in following the command of the Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) in that which they were commanded to be energetic and enthusiastic. They are like a person who adorns the Mushaf (a copy of the Qur’an) yet does not read what is in it; or they are like somebody who reads [what is in the Qur’an] but never follows it; or somebody who adorns the Masjid yet does not pray in it or only prays a little in it; or like a person who takes extravagant prayer beads and mats. Such apparent adornments which have not been legislated and are accompanied with showing off, pride and being pre-occupied away from what is actually legislated – this all corrupts the state of the person who is like this.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>Know that from the actions are those that have some good in them, due to including types of legislated actions and also they include evil such as innovations and other than that. So this action would be good due to what it includes of good and [at the same time] evil due to what it contains of turning away from the religion in its entirety – such is the state of the hypocrites and disobedient people. This is what most of the Ummah has been afflicted by in the later times…&#8221; [Translated by Abul Abbaas Naveed Ayaaz]</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Iqtidaa&#8217; al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim (2:619-620) with the checking of Shaykh Nasir al-Aql, Maktabah al-Rushd 1417/1996,5th edn)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Various translations of the above have been reproduced by a number of brothers with their annotations and essentially it all leads to an undisputed point; that the mawlid is a clear innovation and Imam Ibn Taymiyyah declared it to be an unequivocal innovation. He clearly says as the scans show that the individual may be rewarded for his love and ijtihad. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a stark difference between what Imam Ibn Taymiyyah actually said and how the Sufi&#8217;s and Barelwis have presented this point. Let us also remind the reader the disastrous translations and the deliberate treacherous distortion of the crystal clear words of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah. The Sufi&#8217;s and Barelwis should at least know venerating and respecting the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam); the best of mankind is a fundamental and intricate part of the belief system of Ahl al-Sunnah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Abdullah Ghazipuri was born in 1260/1844 in Mau in Northern India. He studied with numerous Scholars. He was under the tutelage of the Indian Hadith Master, Shaikh Sayyid Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Delhi (1320H) who he also received Ijazah from and was considered to be from amongst his most notable students. He also gained ijazah in hadith from Shaikh Abbas bin and al-Rahman al-Yamani in 1297H, who was the direct student of Imam Shawkani. He died in 1337/1918 in Lucknow. (Nazhah al-Khawatir 8:305-307, Tarajim Ulama al-Hadith  (p.459)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question:</strong> Are mawlid gatherings permissible or impermissible?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer:</strong> It is impermissible to organise and participate in mawlid gatherings because the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam did not himself organise such mawlid gatherings during his time and neither did he instruct his Ummah to do likewise. The companions also did not organise or participate in such mawlid gatherings during his time. Furthermore, what is the legal status of such gatherings? Prophethood finished with the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and thus its legislation also finished with his prophethood, therefore how can these mawlid gatherings be permissible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hidayah mentions it is makruh i.e. prohibitively disliked to pray optional prayers other than the Sunnah prayers after Fajr and the reason cited for this is that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) despite being keen to offer prayers would not extend beyond the legislated number of rakahs (Hidayah 1:82)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hidayah further mentions that one should not pray any optional prayers before the Eid prayer at the Musallah and the reason for this despite the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) being keen to offer prayer never prayed any optional prayers before the Eid prayer. (Hidayah 1:155)</span></p>
