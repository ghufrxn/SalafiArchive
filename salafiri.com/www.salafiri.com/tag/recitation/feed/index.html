				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 align="center"><span style="color: #0000ff">An Explanation By Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff">of the book  ‘<em>Sifat</em> <em>as-Salah</em>’ By <em>Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah </em>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani</span><br />
Translated by Umm Yahya</h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">Shaykh Albaani Wrote:</span></p>
<p align="center">The Imam Saying <em>Ameen</em> Aloud After Reciting <em>Fatiha</em></p>
<p>When the Messenger of Allaah  had completed his recitation of <em>Surah</em> Fatiha he would say: ‘<em>Ameen</em>’ raising his voice and he would elongate it.</p>
<p>He would command those praying behind him to say <em>Ameen</em> loudly just after the Imam said it.</p>
<p>The Prophet  would say: ‘If the Imam recites: <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt; </strong> then say: ‘<em>Ameen</em>, for verily the Angels say<em>Ameen</em> and verily the Imam says <em>Ameen</em>,’</p>
<p>And in other wording: ‘If the Imam says <em>Ameen</em> then say <em>Ameen</em>, whoever says it and it coincides with the <em>Ameen</em> of the Angels, (and in other wording if one of you says<em>Ameen</em> in his prayer and it coincides with the other) all his previous sins will be forgiven.’</p>
<p>In another Hadeeth: ‘Say <em>Ameen</em> and Allah will love you.’</p>
<p>And the Messenger of Allaah  also said: ‘The Jews do not envy you about anything more than they envy you of saying <em>Salaamu</em> <em>alaykum</em> (salutations) to each other and saying <em>Ameen</em> behind the Imam’</p>
<p>______________________</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool explained:</span></p>
<p>This chapter of saying <em>Ameen</em> has a few issues, which will be discussed below.</p>
<p><strong>Firstly</strong></p>
<p>The linguistic meaning of ‘<em>Ameen’</em> is ‘O Allaah respond / answer.’</p>
<p>It has also been said it means ‘<em>Subhanaka</em> <em>Ya</em> <em>Allaah’</em> (How far you are from imperfection) and it has been said it means ‘O Allaah’.</p>
<p>So when one who prays behind the Imam hears the Imam recite <em>Surah</em> Fatiha and reaches the part that says: <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong>  Then it is the Sunnah for him to say <em>Ameen</em> after this, as the Messenger of Allaah would say. This is due to the general statement of the saying of the Prophet : ‘Pray as you have seen me praying.’</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong></p>
<p>The saying of <em>Ameen</em> is Sunnah for the Imam and those following him. It is the Sunnah for the Imam in those prayers that are audible and he says <em>Ameen</em> audibly/ with a raised voice after he recites Surah Fatiha. It is also the Sunnah for those praying behind him to say <em>Ameen</em> after he finishes reciting <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong></p>
<p>The scholars -may Allaah have mercy upon them- have mentioned that this is the point at which the saying of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> of both the Imam and those following him coincide.</p>
<p>I asked Shaykh Al-Albaani -may Allaah have mercy on him- during his visit to the Kingdom in the year 1410 A.H. regarding the matter of the Imam saying <em>Ameen</em> and those who follow him, and the Shaykh -may Allaah have mercy on him- said that it is upon those who are following the prayer to say <em>Ameen</em> just after the Imam, to the count of one or two letters, as the saying of <em>Ameen</em> will then be after the Imam and they will join in saying some of the letters of the word. Therefore, if the Imam says<em>Ameen</em> then those following say it in order for some of the letters of the word to coincide with one another, and at the same time the Imam will precede in one or two letters of the word. Thus in this manner the Imam saying <em>Ameen</em> and the followers will coincide in some of the letters and the end result will be that the saying of <em>Ameen</em> by the follower will be just after the <em>Ameen</em> of the Imam.</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly</strong></p>
<p>The virtue of saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>. The author -may Allaah have mercy on him- mentions from the Messenger , that if the Imam says <em>Ameen</em> and the Angels say <em>Ameen</em> and those following say <em>Ameen</em>, and they coincide with one another Allaah will forgive them all their previous sins.</p>
<p>Another virtue is that Allaah –<em>Subhanahu</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>– answers your saying of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> because it means ‘O Allaah answer \ respond.’</p>
<p>The third virtue is what the Messenger  mentioned in his saying: ‘The Jews do not envy you about anything more than they envy you of saying <em>Salaamu</em> <em>alaykum</em>(salutations) to each other and saying <em>Ameen</em> behind the Imam.’</p>
<p>This is why it is incumbent upon us, to ensure we say <em>Ameen</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Fourthly</strong></p>
<p>Due to what is mentioned with regard to the coinciding of saying <em>Ameen</em> of the Imam and those following him in prayer necessitates that those following are attentive in their prayer whilst following the Imam and the Imam’s recitation to ensure that he does not miss saying <em>Ameen</em> in the correct place. If he misses saying <em>Ameen</em> he loses great reward and recompense, which is mentioned in this hadeeth.</p>
<p>And this summons the presence of the heart and humility of the soul and the body whilst in prayer behind the Imam, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p><strong>Fifthly</strong></p>
<p>I would like to bring to attention that which is relevant to this discussion of saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, which is, once one is aware of the meaning of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, (O Allaah answer or O Allaah). Some people, whilst the Imam reads <em>Qunoot</em> and Exalts Allaah, Praises Him –<em>Subhanahu</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>– and glorifies Him, stop saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, replacing it by saying ‘<em>Subhanak’</em> (Glory be to You) or similar words. This clearly opposes the Sunnah as the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> is sufficient for all supplication regardless of whether it is<em>Dua’</em> praising Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> or <em>Dua’</em> of asking from Him or declaring Allaah’s Majesty and Greatness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[47] From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Urwa Ibn az-Zubayr that Abd ar-Rahman ibn Abd al-Qari said that he had heard Umar Ibn al-Khatab say, &#8220;I heard Hisham ibn Hakim ibn Hizam reciting Surat al-Furqan (Sura 25) differently from me, and it was the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) who had recited it to me. I was about to rush up to him but I granted him a respite until he had finished his prayer. Then I grabbed him by his cloak and took him to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) and said, &#8216;Messenger of Allah, I heard this man reciting Surat al-Furqan differently from the way you recited it to me.&#8217; The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, &#8216;Let him go.&#8217; Then he said, &#8216;Recite, Hisham,&#8217; and Hisham recited as<br />
I had heard him recite. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, &#8216;It was sent down like that.&#8217; Then he said to me, &#8216;Recite&#8217; and I recited the sura, and he said, &#8216;It was sent down like that. This Qur&#8217;an was sent down in seven ways, so recite from it whatever is easy for you.&#8217; &#8221;<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Urwa Ibn az-Zubayr) in Bukhari (no.4992)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/201 hadith no.474, book 15, chapter 4, hadith no.5) at-Tamhid (8/272), al-Istidhkar: (no.443)    </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.2419) and Muslim (no.818) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">1) The hadith which states that the 7 recitation’s was sent down (revealed) along with the Quran is mutawatir. (Qatful Azhar: (no.60), Nadhmul Mutanathar: (no.197))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2) The meaning of seven ways is that there is a difference in reciting some words where its clarification is shown in the following examples: Example 1: the Qari (reciter) Asim Ibn Abi an-Nujud al-Kufi and other than him recited, “Maaliki yawmidin”. Whereas the Qari (reciter) Nafi’ Ibn Abdurahman Ibn Abi Na’im al-Madani recited, “Maliki yawmidin”. The first recitation is mutawatir in the Indian subcontinent etc. and the second recitation is mutawatir in Africa etc. Example 2: The Qari (reciter) Hafs Ibn Sulayman al-Asadi (from Asim Ibn Abi an-Nujud) recited, “Famaa tastatee’oona sarfawn wa laa nasraa”. (Surah al-Furqaan ayah 19) Whereas Qari Nafi’ al-Madani recited, “Famaa yastatee’oona sarfawn wa laa nasraa”. Qur’an (narration of Qalun (pg.309), narration Warsh (pg.293)) Example 3: Qari Asim, Qari Qalun and other reciters have recited “Qul a’udhu bi rabinas” whereas in the recitation of Qari Warsh it is “Qula a’udhu bi rabinas”. Qur’an (recitation of Warsh (pg.712) Jaza’ir print (published), other manuscript, Egyptian print (published)). T.N. The seven ways also mean many different accents. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">3) Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) was always ready to defend Islam, perform Jihad in the path of Allah and love Islam.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">4) If one person is acting upon an issue from two well established issues from the Quran and hadith and another person is acting upon the other issue then they both shouldn&#8217;t harshly refute each other as the paths to verification are always open. Wal hamdullilah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">5) If one person thinks that another brother has committed (is guilty of) an ijtihadi mistake then he should respond and refute with softness and proofs at a selected appropriate time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">6) It is allowed to recite the Quran with the seven recitations however it is better to recite in the most known recitation in your area so that the general people do not become victims of misunderstanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">7) May Allah fill Uthman’s (Radi Allahu Anhu) grave with mercy and nur since he gathered the Muslims together on one written script of the Mushaf (Quran) in which other recitations are recited from.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abbas Abu Yahya </strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Question:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is reading the Qur’aan for the deceased- by placing copies of the Qur’aan in the home or house of the deceased – where some Muslim neighbours and friends come and each one of them reads a part for example, then they go off to their work and they are not paid for reciting …… And after they finish reciting they supplicate for the deceased and gift him the reward for reciting the Qur’aan … Does this recitation and supplication reach the deceased and is he rewarded or not?  I hope for a benefit and I am grateful to you….. Taking into account that I heard some of the scholars saying that it is absolutely prohibited, some saying it is disliked and some saying it is permissible.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This action and the like of it has no foundation and it is not recorded on the authority of the Prophet <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> nor on the authority of his Companions <em>-radiAllaah anhum</em><em> –</em> that they used to read for the deceased.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather the Prophet <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Narrated by Muslim in his authentic book and Bukhari mentioned it without a complete chain but he was decisive about its authenticity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, in the two Saheehs of Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of ‘Aeysha <em>-radiAllaah anha</em><em> –</em> on the authority of the Prophet <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>who said: ‘Whoever innovates in this matter of ours, that which is not from it, it will be rejected.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the Saheeh of Muslim on the authority of Jaabir <em>-radiAllaah anhu</em><em> –</em> that the Prophet <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> used to say in his <em>Khutbah</em> on Fridays: <em>Amma ba’d:</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed the best speech is the Speech of Allaah, the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>– and the worst of the affairs are the innovated ones.  Every innovation is a <em>Bida’</em> and every<em>Bida’</em> is misguidance.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nisa’ee mentioned an extra wording with an authentic chain: ‘and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for charity for the deceased and supplicating for them, then that benefits and reaches them and the Muslims are in consensus aboutthat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And with Allaah is the capability and Allaah’s aid is sought.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Majmoo’ Fatawa – Ibn Baaz vol. 4 p. 339</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Question:</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We wish from the eminent Shaykh that he clarifies for the Muslims the ruling of reciting the Qur’aan over the dead, is it permissible or not?  And what is the ruling of the Ahadeeth that mention this?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Reading over the dead has no foundation which can be relied upon nor is there any legislation for this.  Indeed what has beensanctioned is reading the Qur’aan amongst the living so they can benefit and reflect upon the Book of Allaah and understand it.  As for reciting over the deceased at his grave or after his death – before his burial – or reading for him in any place so that the reward can be gifted to him, then we do not know of a foundation for it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some scholars have authored works and written many books, of them there are those who have allowed and encouraged reciting the whole of the Qur’aan upon the deceased and they regarded it from the same category of giving charity with wealth.  There are those from the people of knowledge who say that these matters are dependent upon evidence; which means that they are from aspects of worship so it is not permissible to perform them except with what the <em>Sharia’ </em>affirms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no evidence for this issue – as far as we know – which indicates the permissibility of reciting for the dead.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no evidence regarding this issue from what we know which indicates the legality of reading over the dead, so it is necessary to remain upon the original foundation which is that worship is dependent upon evidence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So reciting for the dead should not be done, in contrast to giving charity on their behalf, supplicating for them, Hajj, Umrah and paying off debts, then these matters benefit them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are texts which mention this and it is established from the Prophet <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> that he said: ‘When the son of Aadam dies his actions are severed except for three: recurring charity,knowledge which he can benefit from or a righteous child who supplicates for him.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allaah –<em>Subhanahu –</em> said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&lt;&lt; And those who came after them [i.e. after his Companions] say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful’ &gt;&gt; </span><span style="color: #000000;">[Hashr:10]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, Allaah has praised those who came later because they supplicated for those who preceded them.  This indicates theallowance of supplicating for the deceased of the Muslims and that itdoes benefit them.  Likewise, charity benefits them due to theaforementioned hadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is possible to give charity to the poor and needy people with the money used to hire someone to recite over the dead with the intention that it is for the deceased and that the deceased benefits with this money and saves himself from the vulgarity of <em>Bida’</em>.<strong><em> </em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is established in the Saheeh that a man said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah my mother has passed away and did not leave a bequest and I think that if she had spoken she would have given charity.  Will she receive a reward if I gave charity on her behalf?’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Yes.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the Messenger <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> clarified that charity on behalf of the deceased benefits him and likewise Hajj and Umrah on his behalf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are ahadeeth which mention this, likewise paying off debt benefits him.  As for a reward for the deceased for reciting Qur’aan or gifting it to the dead, praying or optional fasting on his behalf then all of this has no basis and what is correct is that it is not fromthe <em>Sharia’</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Majmoo’ Fatawa – Ibn Baaz vol. 4 p. 340- 341</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</span></p>
