<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Synopsis of the Khawārij</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">In the modern world today, various groups, organisations and movements have emerged that have misrepresented and manipulated the image of Islam, this is not to say the media hasn’t played its unscrupulous role. There has been considerable destruction, loss of innocent life and the lives of millions have changed due to the events of the last two to three decades. The devastation faced by the Muslims has been distressing and disturbing. A great part of the blame rests with modern day groups and sects, which have and are still evolving with new and dangerous narratives. In the following series of articles, we will look at the origins and emergence of the Khawārij sect and the many strands they take in current times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Who Are the Khawārij?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Khawārij are those who primarily rebelled against the Sunnah and the Jamāʿah (i.e. Ahl al-Sunnah waʾl Jamāʿah or the Muslim Community) and they left or abandoned the greater body of the Muslims. Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Kathīr (d.774H) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">They are called Khawārij because they stopped obeying the ruler (the Imām) and therefore they became independent of the Sharīʿah of Islam.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">al-Shahrastānī (d.548H) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Imām or ruler – upon whom the whole Ummah is agreed upon and is united behind, so whosoever does Khurūj i.e. rebels against them, will be called a Khārijī. This is whether the Khurūj is during the time of the Ṣaḥābah, during the time of the rightly guided Khulafāʾ or even after their time from amongst the Tābiʿīn or whether it is in the era of any Muslim ruler.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajar (d.852H) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">Khawārij is the plural of Khārijah, these people are innovators and they were called Khawārij because they left the Dīn of Islam, they rebelled and made Khurūj against the best people of the Muslim Ummah.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imām Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr (d.463H) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Khawārij are the people who distort the Book of Allāḥ and made thr blood of the Muslims lawful and they want to declare Muslims to be un believers due to their sins. They raise the sword against them and they opposed the Jamāʿah. The declared the prayer to be obligatory upon the menstruating woman, they also believed there was no rajam (stoning) of the adulterer and they were of the view to lash them 100 times. They also held the view that ritual purity could only be achieved by using flowing water or water that was in very large quantities. They had many other issues in which they opposed the Jamāʿah of the Muslims i.e. Ahl al-Sunnah. Similarly, they innovated many new things in the Dīn and they left the Dīn just as an arrow leaves its prey.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Here we find the Khawārij have been described with a few characteristics, that have been repeated by many Scholars. For example, they went to extremes and eventually left the religion. The example of attaining ritual purity was a prime example. The Khawārij also had other hallmarks and it is these signs and characteristics that are rampant and evident on a whole array of people in our midst who claim to be upon the path of Ahl al-Sunnah. Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) describes them further with another sign, he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">One of the first innovations spread in Islam was the Bidʿah of the Khawārij.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">So, the Khawārij were the first sect of Islam who rebelled and made Khurūj against the body of the Muslims i.e. Ahl al-Sunnah, while raising the sword due to their false beliefs, defective methodology and tyrannical oppression of the Muslims. Imām Ibn Taymiyyah further said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">The very first people of innovation who separated from the Jamāʿah of the Muslims were the Khawārij.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Khawārij have historically always troubled and harmed the Muslims in every era and century. This is why, from Divine texts we find they were condemned and we were commanded to fight them. Aḥadīth transmitted in this regard are so numerous that they reach an overwhelming level. An example of this is the ḥadīth:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Abū Ghālib reported: Abū Umāmah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, The Khawārij are the worst of those slain under the heavens, and the best of those slain are those who were killed by them. They are the dogs of Hellfire. They were Muslims and then became unbelievers.’ I said, ‘O Abū Umāmah, is this something you say?” Abū Umamah said, ‘No, rather I heard it from the Messenger of Allāh Sallalalhu Alayhi Wasallam</span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>.’</strong><a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Hunting With Trained Dogs and Arrows</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[378]<span style="color: #000080;"> Narrated </span></strong><strong>Hamam Ibn Harith from &#8216;Adi ibn Hatim (Radi Allahu Anhu) reported:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> </strong><strong>I said: Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam), I set off trained (hunting) dogs and they catch for me (the game) and I recite the name of Allah over it (I slaughter the game by reciting Bismillah-i-Allah-o-Akbar), whereupon he said: When you set off your trained (hunting) dogs, if you recited the name of Allah (while setting them off), then eat (the game). I said: Even if they (the trained (hunting) dogs) kill that (the game)? He (the Holy Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said: Even if these kill (the game), but (on the condition) that no other dog, which you did not set off (along with your dogs), participates (in catching the game). I said to him: I throw Mi&#8217;rad, a heavy featherless blunt arrow, for hunting and killing (the game). Thereupon he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said: When you throw Mi&#8217;rad, and it pierces (the game), then eat (it), but if it falls flatly (and beats (crushes) the game to death), then do not eat that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>And the hadith of Sha’bi from Adi is with the same meaning and in this hadith it is stated that “provided (the hunting dog) has not eaten (any part of the game). If it has eaten (the game), then you don&#8217;t eat it as I fear that it might have caught for its own self. And do not eat it if other dogs have joined your trained dogs.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>And in (another narration) it is stated, “When you let off your dog, recite the name of Allah, and if it catches (game for you) and you find it alive, then slaughter it; if you find it killed and that (your dog) has eaten nothing out of that, (even then) you may eat it; because what the trained hunting dog catches (and kills) is equivalent to sacrificing it”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>And in (another narration) it is stated, “If you shoot with your arrow then mention the name of Allah” and in it “and if the game disappears from you for one or two days”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>And in another narration, “If the game disappears for two or three days and you do not find on that but the mark of your arrow, then eat that it you so like, but if you find it drowned in water, then don&#8217;t eat that for in that case you do not know whether it is water that caused its death or your arrow.”</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bukhari, Book of Slaughtering and Hunting, Chapter: About hunting with a bow</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1) If a trained hunting dog catches a game and the owner released it by saying the Takbir (bismillah Allahu Akbar) and it brings it back dead then it is allowed to eat it. If it brings it back alive then you need to sacrifice it in order for it to be halal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2) If an owners trained hunting dog carries out a hunt and other dogs become part of the hunt and they bring back the game meat then it is not allowed to eat it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3) If an arrow (bullet) was shot at the game and at that moment the Takbir was said and you find it after two or three days and it only had the mark (wound) from the arrow and no other mark is present then you can eat it if you want to.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4) If you find the game sunk in water then you shouldn&#8217;t eat it because you don&#8217;t know if it died because of the arrow you shot or because of being drowned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) If a trained hunting dog or falcon (eagle, hawk) catches a game and the owner released it by saying the Takbir (bismillah Allahu Akbar) then it is allowed to eat it whether it brings it back dead or alive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) If an owners trained hunting dog carries out a hunt and other normal dogs become part of the hunt and they bring back the game meat then it is not allowed to eat it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) During hunting you should say the Takbir at the time of shooting the arrow, firing the bullet or releasing the hunting dog.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) It is not allowed to eat the game meat that is left over after being eaten by the hunting dog.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) If a hunting dog brings back the game animal alive to the owner then it is necessary to sacrifice it in the halal manner (if you want to eat it)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10) If a game animal gets wounded and sinks into the water then it is not allowed to eat it because there is a doubt if it died because of the wound or because of drowning. However if the amount of water it fell in is small (such as a puddle) and the hunter clearly knows it died because of the arrow (bullet) wound then it&#8217;s meat is halal to eat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">11) If you hunt using a wide spear to strike (the game) then it is allowed to eat it if the spear pierces the game however if it dies because of a small strike (that doesn’t pierce it’s body) then it is not allowed to eat it.</span></p>

Then what is lawful for me to eat?&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for what you have mentioned about the people of the Scripture, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat out of theirs, but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash their utensils and eat out of it. If you hunt an animal with your bow after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it. and if you hunt something with your trained hound after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it, and if you hunt something with your untrained hound (and get it before it dies) and slaughter it, eat of it.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;">[REFERENCES]</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bukhari, Book of Slaughtering and Hunting, Chapter: About hunting with a bow [no.5478]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Muslim, Book of The Book of Hunting, Slaughter, and what may be Eaten, Chapter: Hunting with trained dogs and arrows [no.1930]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1)  During hunting if you shoot your arrow and say Bismillah Allahu Akbar and the game (animal) has fallen and died then its meat is halal </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2) If the hunting dog catches the game (animal) and brings it back to you then its meat is halal on the condition that when you released the hunting dog to carry out the hunt you said Bismillah Allahu akbar. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3) If you release an untrained hunting dog to carry out a hunt and it catches the game meat alive then you sacrifice it in a halal manner it is allowed to eat it. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4) This hadith clearly shows the virtue and superiority of the one who has knowledge compared to the one who is ignorant i.e. the trained (knowledgeable) dog compared to the untrained (ignorant of hunting skills) dog. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) It is allowed to use the kufars utensils and clothes on the condition that you can’t get hold of other utensils and clothes. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Before using these type of utensils or clothes they should be washed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) It is necessary to clean used utensils or clothes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) It is allowed to hunt with a trained (hunting) dog and bow and arrow (in this era it’s equivalence such as a gun).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) The takbir should be said at the time of hunting when shooting the arrow, firing the bullet or letting the hunting dog loose. The wording for the takbir is Bismillah Allahu Akbar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) It is allowed to have game meat that has been hunted by a non trained (hunting) dog on the condition that it brings the game back alive and you slaughter it in a halal manner. If the game animal is brought back dead then it is not allowed to eat it.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>All of the Meat of Animals (Carnivores) With Fangs (Canine Teeth, i.e. Carnivores) is Haram</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[76] </strong><strong>From Malik from Ibn Shibab from Abu Idris al-Khawlani from Abu Tha’laba al-Khushani that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) prevented us from eating animals with fangs.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHEEH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Abu Idris al-Khawlani) in Bukhari (no.5781) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 2/496 hadith no.1096 with the words, “&#8221;It is haram to eat animal’s with fangs”, book 25, chapter 4, hadith no.13), at-Tamhid (11/6), al-Istidhkar: (no.1028)     </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.5530) and Muslim (14/1932) from the hadith of Malik</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) From this hadith it is known that (eating) dogs, cats, lions, cheetah’s, monkeys is haram. The prohibition here is a haram ie unlawful as it is established from Yahya Ibn Yahya’s and Abu Hurairah’s narration. See hadith no.113</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) Imam Malik said about the hadith of Abu Hurairah’s (Radiullahu Anhu), “And we act upon this” (al-Muwatta 2/496, also see hadith no.113) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) This hadith abrogates the narration that mentions hyena&#8217;s are halal. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) In one narration it is mentioned, “The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) forbade spreading the skin of animals (of prey &#8211; on the ground ie carpets, rugs etc.)&#8221; (as-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi 1/21 and its chain is [Hasan] good).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) prohibited the wearing of the skins of beasts of prey and riding on them?(Sunan Abu Dawud no.4131 from a  lengthy hadith and its chain is [Hasan] good) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus the saying of some of the people, &#8220;Ba&#8217;d al-Nas (ie Hanafi&#8217;s)&#8221; tanning a dogs skin renders it lawful and therefore using it to make prayers mats and water containers (made from the skin of dogs) is erroneous and rejected due to it opposing this hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) The elephant is also haram due to having carnivorous teeth as it is mentioned under hadith no.52</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) The hadith is the explanation and commentary to the Qur’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) Using a general proof in comparison to a specific proof is wrong.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) It is permissible to specify a general text (with a specific text)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) Hadith as a text constitutes proof and evidence</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10) Someone who rejects the hadith is a hadith rejector (munkar hadith) and it does not matter whether they call themselves people of the Qur&#8217;an or a true Muslim etc. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[57] From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Abu Bakr Ibn Abd ar-Rahman Ibn al-Harith Ibn Hisham from Abu Mas’ud al-Ansari that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) forbade the sale price of a dog, the earnings of a prostitute and the earnings of a fortune teller.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Abu Bakr Ibn Abdurahman Ibn al-Harith Ibn Hisham) in Humaydi (with my verification: (no.451))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 2/656 hadith no.1400, book 31, chapter 29, hadith no.68) at-Tamhid (8/397) al-Istidhkar: (no.1321)  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.2237) and Muslim (no.1567) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) This hadith is an excellent refutation against those people who say that the selling of a dog is allowed!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2) There is a consensus that the earnings of a prostitute and earnings of a fortune teller are prohibited. (at-Tamhid (8/398))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">3) The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, “The price of a dog is evil, the earning of a prostitute is evil and the earning of a cupper is evil.” (Sahih Muslim: (41/1568)[no.4012]) The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, “The price paid for a dog is not lawful” (Sunan Abu Dawud: (no.3484) and its chain is [Hasan] good) It has come in a hadith that if someone comes to take the earnings for a dog then his hands should be filled with mud (soil). (Sunan Abu Dawud: (no.3484) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">4) The narrations in which it has been declared that selling some dogs is allowed are all [Daif] weak and rejected. For example:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1. “From Jabir that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) forbade the price of cats and dogs, except hunting dogs.” (Sunan an-Nasa’i (7/191) hadith (no.4300) and he said: it is not [Sahih] authentic, (7/309) hadith (no.4672) and he said: this is [Munkar] rejected) This narration is [Daif] weak because of the [An] of Abu Zubayr Muhammad Ibn Mutris. Abu Zubayr was a famous mudallis. (al-Fath ul-Mubin fi Tahqiq Tabaqat al-Mudalisin (pg.61, 62) number (101/3))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2. “From Abu Hurayrah that (the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam)) forbade from the earnings of a prostitute, stallions, cats and dogs except hunting dogs.” (as-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi (6/6)) This narration is weak because of two reasons: 1) the reliability of Muhammad Ibn Yahya Ibn Malik adh-Dhabi is not known. 2) Hamad Ibn Salamah and Qays Ibn Sa’d are both reliable however the narrations of Hamad from Qays are [Daif] weak. Al-Bayhaqi said, “And there is inspection (further examination, looking into, investigation, scrutinizing) (needed) in the narrations of Hamad from Qays” (also (6/6)) This narration which contains Hamad Ibn Salamah from Qays (in the chain) is present in Sahih Ibn Hiban however it does not contain the permission to sell a dog, rather it is written that, “</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">(al-Ihsan (7/217) hadith (no.4920)) Jabir Ibn Abdullah al-Ansari (Radi Allahu Anhu) was asked about the charging (buying and selling) of dogs and cats he said, “The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) has severely prohibited it.”(Sahih Muslim: (42/1569)[no.4015])</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">It is known from this that even Jabir (Radi Allahu Anhu) understood that the charging (buying and selling) of dogs and cats is not allowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">5) In Sunan Daraqutni there are some narrations ((3/72, 73) hadith (no.3045, no.3046, no.3047) whereby the permissibility of selling some dogs is known however all these narrations are [Daif] weak and rejected and Imam Daraqutni has himself declared some of the narrators to be [Daif] weak. The grading and verification of the additional narrations that the people of blind following present are below:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">“Abu Hanifa from al-Haytham from Ikrimah from Ibn Abaas he said that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) permitted in the sale price of the hunting dog” (Musnad Abu Hanifa al-Haskafi’s narration (pg.169), urdu translation (pg.319), Jami’ul Masanid of al-Khwarizmi (2/10,11)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">One of Musnad al-Haskafi’s (died 650 hijri) previous narrator was Abu Muhammad Abdullah Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ya’qub al-Harithi (urdu translation (pg.24) Musnad al-Haskafi (pg.27))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">According to the noble muhadithin, Abdullah Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ya’qub al-Harithi is severely criticised. Abu Zur’ah Ahmad Ibn al-Husayn ar-Raazi said, “[Daif] weak” (Su’alat Hamzah Ibn Yusuf as-Sahmi (no.318))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abu Ahmad al-Hafidh and Haakim Nayshapuri said, “He was a teacher, he used to make hadith (up)” (Kitab al-Qira’at Khalful Imam of al-Bayhaqi (pg.178) hadith (no.388))</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Meaning this person was a complete teacher (talented) in fabricating hadith. Khatib Baghdadi, Khalili, Ibn Jawzi, Hafidh Dhahabi etc. have criticised him. (Tarikh Baghdad (10/126) (check what taa means) (no.5262), al-Irshad of al-Khalili, (3/972) taa (no.899), kitab adh-Dhu’afa Wal Matrukin of Ibn al-Jawzi (2/141), Diwan adh-Dhu’afa of adh-Dhahabi (2/63) taa (no.2297))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Also see Mizan al-I’tidal (2/496) and Lisan al-Mizan (3/348, 349) </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">His reliability is not established from any credible muhadith. </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">An overview of the chains of narration from Jam’ul Masanid of al-Khwarizmi is below:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1. Khwarizmi himself is not trustworthy and has an unknown reliability.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">2. Abu Muhammad al-Bukhari al-Harithi is a liar. As mentioned previously.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">3. Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Sa’id Urf Ibn Aqdah according to the majority of the muhadithin is a criticised narrator. Despite Imam Daraqutni praising him he said that he was a corrupt person meaning a rafidhi. (Tarikh Baghdad (5/22) taa (no.2365) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic) and said he used to say (spread) many [Munkar] rejected narrations. (Also and its chain is [Sahih] authentic) Abu Umar Muhammad Ibn al-Abas Ibn Muhammad Ibn Zakariya al-Baghdadi said that this person listed (wrote) criticisms about the noble companions meaning Abu Bakr and Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) in Jami’ Baratha therefore (because of this) I have abandoned his hadith. (Su’alat Hamzah as-Sahmi: (no.166) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">He (Ibn Uqdah) was also a robber, he stole books from Uthman Ibn Sa’id al-Muris son’s house. (al-Kamil fee adh-Dhu’afa of Ibn A’di (1/209) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic, Muhammad Ibn al-Husayn Ibn Mukram al-Baghdadi is reliable and Daraqutni declared him to be reliable etc.)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">It is known from this that Ibn Uqdah was a robber, unrighteous and a rafidhi.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">4. Ahmad Ibn Abdullah Ibn Muhammad al-Kindi al-Jilaj spread [Munkar] rejected hadiths on behalf of Imam Abu Hanifa. (al-Kamil of Ibn Adi (1/197)) </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Imam Abu Hanifa is not in need of these type of [Munkar] rejected hadiths. Wal Hamdullilah.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Hafidh Abdul Haq Ishbili declared this narration of Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi about the dog, to be a false hadith. (al-Ahkam al-Wasiti (3/249,248) Lisan al-Mizan (1/199))</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">5. The Imam of Asma ar-Rijal Yahya Ibn Ma’in said about Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan Ibn Farqad ash-Shaybani, “He is nothing” (Tarikh Ibn Ma’in: (no.1770))</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Imam Ibn Ma’in also said, “Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani is a jahmi liar.” (Kitab adh-Dhu’afa of al-Uqayli (4/52) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">In the second chain both Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani are criticised and al-Hasan Ibn al-Husayn al-Intaki is unknown. In the third chain there is Ibn Uqdah the robber, Abdullah Ibn Muhammad al-Bukhari the liar and both Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani who have been criticised. In the fourth chain there is Husayn Ibn Muhammad Ibn Khusro al-Bakhli, al-Husayn Ibn al-Husayn Intaki the unknown, Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani who have been criticised. In the fifth chain there is Ibn Khusro, Husayn Ibn Husyan, Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan. In the sixth and last chain there is Ibn Khusro the Mu’tazali who is criticised. See Lizan al-Mizan (2/312) and Sir A’lam an-Nubala (19/592) Qadhi Abu Nasr Ibn Ishkab and Abdullah Ibn Tahir are unknown, and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani is criticised. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Summarised verification: This narration is false and rejected and it is not established from Imam Abu Hanifa. It is known from this that the narrations which show the permissibility for selling some types of dogs are all [Daif] weak and rejected. </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Some people have said that selling a dog is allowed in contrast to a dog’s price being prohibited and evil. See al-Hidayah of al-Mirghinani (2/101, and the words for it, (3/79)) al-Quduri ((pg.74) before chapter as-Sarf) Fath ul-Qadir of Ibn Hamam (6/345) Bida’i as-Sana’i (5/142) Kanzud Daqa’iq (pg.257) al-Bahr ur-Ra’iq (6/172) ad-Durul Mukhtar with Kashf ul-Astar (2/50) Radul Mukhtar al-Ma’ruf with Fatawa Shami (4/238, 239) Hashiyah (marginal notes) of Tahtawi ‘Ala (on) ad-Durul Mukhtar (3/127) Kitabul Fiqh ‘Ala al-Madhahib al-‘Arba’a (2/232) and al-Fiqh al-Islami Wa adilatah (4/446) etc., Rather some people have written that it is allowed to slaughter a dog and sell its meat. See Fatawa Alamghiri (3/115)!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">All these sayings are rejected because they are against the authentic ahadith.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Mulla Marghinani wrote, “Apart from (the meat of) humans and pigs, the meat and skin of those things which are not eaten become pure from slaughtering it.” (al-Hidayah (2/441) other manuscript (4/69)) </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">This fatwa is rejected because of it having no proof.</span></p>
