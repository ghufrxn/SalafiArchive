				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[9] Taqwiyatul Iman</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Allamah Shah Muhammad Isma’il (1246H)</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shirk Will Never Be Forgiven. </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<h3></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Third Chapter</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Evilness of Shirk</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shirk (Polytheism) Will Never Be Forgiven</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The First Sub-chapter in saving oneself from Shirk, meaning that this chapter is a summary of the evilness of Shirk</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Verily! Allah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners in worship with Him, but He forgives whom He pleases, sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, has indeed strayed far away (Surah an-Nisa:l16)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the ways of straying from path of Allah Is not to differentiate between the permissible and impermissible, being involved in stealing and fornication, abandoning the prayer and fasting, neglecting the rights of the wife and children and disrespecting ones parents. However the one who is engrossed in Shirk is the most naivest of individuals because he has involved himself in such a great and tremendous sin that Allah will never forgive it, however, Allah may even forgive all of his other sins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This, we find from this ayah that shirk will never be forgiven and the punishment that is decreed for it will be surely direly incumbent. If the shirk is extreme (ie major) such that it leads a person to be a disbeliever, he will be punished such that he will remain if the fire of Hell forever, he will never leave it and nor will he ever experience any comfort therein.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Note of clarity the Imam here means and is referring to Shirk Akbar and Shirk Asghar, however the ayah is clear and no matter what level the shirk is, the punishment will remain the same as per the verse, this is the explanation of Shaikh Ataullah Hanif Bhojiyani)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the shirk that is of a lesser level (ie minor shirk) he will be punished according to that which Allah has decreed. With regards to other sins, some of the punishments have already been ordained by Allah, hence the affair is with Allah, whether he choses to punish or to forgive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Taqwiyatul Iman (pg.34)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[8] Tanwir ul-Aynain Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Allamah Shah Muhammad Isma’il (1246H)</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Bigoted Staunch Taqlid and Blind Following of the Imams Over Authentic Texts</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh, the Imaam al-Allamah Muhammad Isma’il said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Chapter Exaggeration in Taqlid and Ta’assub (bigotry).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">People have exaggerated a lot in the taqlid of one particular individual and have made rigid bigotry obligatory upon themselves to the extent that they have prohibited an individual from performing ijtihad and from doing taqlid of other Imams. And this is that non-curable illness which destroyed the shi’ahs and these people (ie the muqallidin) have also reached the realms of destruction but the only difference is that the shi’ahs have reached a greater level of destruction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They (the Shi’ahs) started to find texts to back up the statements of their Imams and these people (ie the muqallidin) have also adopted this way and begun to figurative explain well known narrations that opposed the statements of their Imams. However they should have weighed and presented the statements of their Imams to these narrations and texts and if they (the statements) coincided with the text they should have accepted them or otherwise rejected them. (Tanwir ul-Aynain Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain (pg.44-45)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said, “And I am amazed when I see a person has the ability to return to a clear and conclusive hadith of the Messenger of Allaah (Saalalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) which opposes the statement of his Imam and yet they still hold doing taqlid permissible and I wonder how is this permissible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So if he does not leave the statement of his Imam in such a situation then he has with him Shirk Fir-Risalah (Association partners in the Messengership of the Prophet.).” then the Shaikh goes onto mention the hadith of Adiyy bin Hatim in Jame at-Tirmidhi in regards to the verse of Allaah,<strong>“They have taken their monks and rabbis Lords besides Allaah.”</strong> (Soorah at- Taubah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say further, “So we find from this hadeeth that if a person comes to know the evidences from the Book and the Sunnah and he still adheres to the statement of a specific Imam and begins to figurative explain these evidences, then such a person has traits of Christianity in him and there is the danger that he may have taken some aspects of Shirk in him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And there is extreme amazement on such a nation, who instead of fearing such taqlid they declare those who abandon this taqlid to be great oppressors. Then how well does the following verse fit such people, “How shall I fear those whom you associate and yet you do not fear that you have associated partners with Allah for which Allah has not revealed any evidence, so which of the two are upon the truth, if only but you knew.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So think and be just and do not be from those people who have doubts and we seek refuge in Allah from being amongst those who have bigotry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Tanwir ul-Aynain Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain (pg.49-51).</span></p>
