<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the greatest blessings and favours of Allaah upon his creation is that he instils a lot of love in their heart for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). The people of iman have a great desire and fervour to know and understand the ways and means they can achieve the love of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and that it remains continuous</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With the aid of Allaah, the attempt is to know such means and ways in loving Allah and then to convey this to others, so that they benefit from them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One should not forget the obligation of loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). It is obligatory upon every Muslim that he loves the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) more than anything from amongst his love for anything from the creation. An evidence for this is what we find from the hadith which Imam Bukhari has transmitted from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;Verily the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, &#8220;I swear by the one in whose hand my soul is in, none of you is a believer up until I am more beloved to you than your father and child.&#8221; </i>(Sahih al-Bukhari, The Book of Iman, Chapter Loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is part of Iman no.14 1/58)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith which elucidates this point is what Imaam Muslim has transmitted from Anas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><i>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, &#8220;No one is a believer until I am more beloved to him than his family, wealth and the whole of mankind.&#8221; </i>(Sahih Muslim, The Book of Iman, Chapter The obligation of loving the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) more than ones family, father, child and more than mankind, no.69 (44) 1/68)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the Quran warns us of the punishment for every individual who loves his father, child, brothers, wives, tribe, wealth, business or houses more than jihad and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). Allaah the most high said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>&#8220;Say, [O Muhammad], &#8220;If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jihad in His cause, then wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.&#8221; (Soorah at-Taubah:24)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafidh Ibn Kathir said in explanation of this ayah, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;If these things are more beloved to you, more than Allah, the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and doing jihad in the way of Allah, then await for the type of punishment that will befall you.&#8221; (Tafsir Ibn Kathir 2/378)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Qurtubi said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;This ayah elucidates the obligation of loving Allah and his Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and there is no difference of opinion in that, furthermore this love has precedence over loving anything else.&#8221; (Tafsir Qurtubi 8/95)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When a person understands this and he places before him the reality that his iman will be incomplete up until he loves the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) more than anything from the creation. In such an instance with the aid of Allah love and passion for the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will increase further in its intensity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This reality is clearly proven from a Hadith which Imam Bukhari has transmitted from Abdullah. </span><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to always remember Allah and also seek the fruits and merits of loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is not in need of our love at all. Allaah the most merciful has excluded him and exalted him from this. We attain and achieve great blessings and fruits in this world and in the hereafter by loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). Loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is from the means of tasting the sweetness of Imam in this world.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim have transmitted a narration from Anas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;There are three things which if a person possesses are from the sweetness of Iman, that one loves Allaah and his Messenger more than anything, whoever he loves he does so for the sake of Allaah and he dislikes returning to disbelief just as he would dislike be thrown in the fire.&#8221;</i> (Sahih al-Bukhari 1/60 no.16, Sahih Muslim 1/66 no.67 (43)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore from the mercy of Allaah is that the one who loves the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will achieve a great reward due to being neighbour in Paradise which has everlasting and eternal bounties.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim have transmitted a narration from Abdullah ibn Mas&#8217;ood (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;A man came to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and said, &#8220;Oh Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) what do you say about a man who loves a nation but he is not able to meet them?&#8221; The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) replied, &#8220;A person will be with who he loves.&#8221; (Sahih al-Bukhari 10/557 no.6169, Saheeh Muslim 4/2034 no.165 (2640)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The saying of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;will be with who he loves.&#8221; means he will be with him in Paradise.</i> (Refer to Umdah tul-Qari 22/197)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When a person is aware and knows the great benefits and blessing of loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) he will always remember him and never forget him. With the grace of Allaah, showers of love for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will emanate from his heart which will expand and increase because the human disposition is such that it loves beneficial things and so it will attempt to attain and achieve this as much as possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One should never neglect the favours of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).</span> <span style="color: #000000;">It has been instilled in a humans nature that he loves the individual who shares his times of sadness, sorrow, and pain and who also tries to help him in this regard and also tries to benefit him with good. It is famous from olden times that, &#8216;Love has been instilled in the hearts for those who do favours.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in attempting to inform and highlight every beneficial and good thing to the Muslim Ummah he would emphatically struggle. Allaah the most high himself has testified to this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>&#8220;Th</b></span><span style="color: #000000;"><b>ere has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. Grievous to him is what you suffer; [he is] concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful.&#8221; (Soorah at-Taubah:128)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) wishing good and looking out for the Ummah was to such an extent that he would be sad and upset due to the people not accepting the truth (about Islaam) and he would be so engrossed in this it was feared he would end up losing his life. The Lord of all knowing himself said about this</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>&#8220;Then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them, [O Muhammad], if they do not believe in this message, [and] out of sorrow.&#8221; (Soorah al-Kahf:6)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to this Allaah has also prohibited us from being severely upset over someone not accepting Islaam, he said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Then is one to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive so he considers it good [like one rightly guided]? For indeed, Allah sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So do not let yourself perish over them in regret. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what they do.&#8221; (Soorah al-Faatir:8)</span></strong></p>
