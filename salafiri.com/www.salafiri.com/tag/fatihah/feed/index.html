				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[3] Husn al-Bayan Fima Fi Sirat un-Nu’man</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Abdul Aziz Muhammadi Rahimabadi (1338H)</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Reciting Fatihah Behind The Imam and Contradictory Hanafi Principles</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author of Sirat un-Nu’man spoke about the issue of reciting Fatihah behind the imam and whilst raising objections on Imam Bukhari he says in the issue of reciting Fatihah behind the imam, Imam Abu Hanifah uses the the ayah, “When the Quran is recited listen silently…” And Imam Bukhari said concerning this ayah in his Juzz al-Qirah that it was pertaining to the sermon and not the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shibli Numani says how astonishing is this answer of Imam Bukhari because who does not know the ayah being revealed for a specific occasion does not take away the fact that the ruling is clearly general and therefore cannot be specific or restricted to one particular occasion in terms of its ruling</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: this is a wild stretch of the imagination and wishful thinking of the author of Sirat an-Numan as Imam Bukhari answered this deduction of Imam Abu Hanifah from both perspectives ie in general wording and a specific occasion. It is a well known principle in the field of debate and discussions to answer every angle of the argument. It is from this principle that Imam Bukhari answered the question first and foremost from the perspective of a general wording.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is interesting here is that the hanafis do not themselves adhere to the generality of this principle and ayah when it comes to pray the morning Sunnah prayers. This is because their Fiqh dictates that if the imam is reciting loudly in the morning obligatory prayer and a worshippers comes and he has not prayed his Sunnah prayers, then he should pray his Sunnah prayers (whilst the Jama’ah is in progress) so this by default is goes against the generality of that ayah as they claim, so where has that principle gone now?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So when you restrict this ayah to exclude sunnah prayer meaning (that the worshiper can recite Fatihah in the Sunnah prayer whilst the Jama’ah is in progress) then why cannot the ayah be restricted from the generality you claim, to reciting Fatihah in the prayer? Especially since there is not text that restricts or specifies the recitation of Fatihah in the Sunnah prayer. Whereas on the contrary their are specific texts with regards to reciting Fatihah (in all prayers) for example the Hadith of Ubadah bin as-Samit (RadhiAllaahu Anhu).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you claim it is specific with regards to the prayer, then this specificity or restriction is not established because it is specific with regards to the sermon as Imam Bukhari elucidated. This deduction of Imam Bukhari is a testament to his incredible line of argument, contrary to the debate of Imam Abu Hanifah which we have already spoken about.</span></p>

<h4 class="entry-title" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated by Abu Rumaysah</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</header>
<div class="entry-content">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Surah al-Fatihah</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">1) With the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">2) All the praises and thanks are for Allah the Lord of the Universe. </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">3) The Most Beneficent, The Most Merciful. </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">4) Master of the Day of Recompense. </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">5) You Alone we worship, and You Alone we ask for help. </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">6) Guide us to the Straight Path. </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">7) The Path of those on whom You have bestowed your grace, not the Path of those who earned your Anger, nor of those that went astray.</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span class="quran">“ALL THE PRAISES AND THANKS ARE FOR ALLAH”</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no mention here as to when this praise is said or from where this praise comes from, but in <em>Surah Rum</em> there is mention that from amongst the ‘where’s’ are the heavens and the earth – in His saying, <span class="quran">” … and His is all the praises and thanks in the heavens and the earth.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 30:18] And in <em>Surah Qasas</em> there is mention that from amongst the ‘when’s’ are in this world and in the Hereafter – in His sayings:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“And He is Allah, none has the right to be worshipped besides Him. To Him belongs all praise in the beginning (i.e. this world) and in the end (i.e.the Hereafter).”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 28:70]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And He said in the beginning of <em>Surah Sab’a</em>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“His is all the praise in the Hereafter, and He is the All-Wise, All-Aware.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 34:1]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The <em>Alif</em> and <em>Lam</em> (i.e. the definite article ‘the’) in <em>al-hamd</em> is so as to include all the different manners of praise, and it is an extolling with which Allah has praised Himself and ordered His servants to praise Him with.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span class="quran">“THE LORD OF THE UNIVERSE (<em>ALAMIN</em>)”</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no explanation here as to what <em>al-alamin</em> is but this is explained in another place with His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“Pharaoh said: and what is the Lord of the <em>Alamin</em>? He (Moses) said: the Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 26:23-24]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the scholars stated that <em>al-alam</em> (world, pl. <em>alamin</em>) is derived from <em>Al-Allamah</em> (sign) because the existence of the world is a sign, without doubt, of the existence of it’s Creator who is described with perfect and magnificent Attributes. The Exalted said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="quran" style="color: #000000;">“Indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the change of the night and day are signs (<em>ayat</em>) for the people of understanding.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in the language <em>ayah</em> means <em>allamah</em>.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span class="quran">“THE MOST BENEFICENT (<em>AR-RAHMAN</em>), THE MOST MERCIFUL (<em>AR-RAHIM</em>)”</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These are two descriptions of Allah, <em>the Exalted</em>, and two of the Names from amongst His Beautiful Names, derived from <em>ar-rahma</em>(mercy) in a way to express intense and exaggerated meanings. And <em>Ar-Rahman</em> is more intense than <em>Ar-Rahim</em> because <em>Ar-Rahman</em> is the one endowed with Mercy which extends to all of the creations in this world and to the believers in the Hereafter, and <em>Ar-Rahim</em> is the One endowed with Mercy which extends to only the believers on the Day of Judgement – this being the understanding of the majority of the scholars. And from the discussion of Ibn Jarir (at-Tabari) one can understand that there is an agreement on this, and the <em>tafsir</em> of some of the <em>salaf</em> lends weight to this understanding as was stated by Ibn Kathir, and the narration reported from Isa, as mentioned by Ibn Kathir and others, also indicates this – that he (<em>upon him and our Prophet be peace and blessings</em>) said, <span class="hadith">“Ar-Rahman: the One Who shows Mercy in this world and the Hereafter. Ar-Rahim: the One Who shows Mercy in the Hereafter.”</span> <span id="qtip0" class="toggle">1</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah, <em>the Exalted</em>, also points to what we have mentioned when He said, <strong><span class="quran">“Then He rose over the Throne, <em>Ar-Rahman</em>“</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em>25:59] and when He said, <span class="quran">“<em>Ar-Rahman</em> rose over the Throne”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em>20:5]</strong>. So he mentioned the <em>Istawa</em> (rising over the Throne) with His Name <em>Ar-Rahman</em> so as to embrace the whole of His creation with his Mercy as was stated by Ibn Kathir.<span id="qtip1" class="toggle">2</span> And likewise is His saying, <strong><span class="quran">“Do they not see the birds above them, spreading out their wings and folding them in? None upholds them except ar-Rahman”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 67:19]</strong> meaning: from his Mercy to His creation is his kindness to the birds and His holding them in the sky while they are spreading out their wings and folding them in. And from the clearest evidences pertaining to this is His saying, <strong><span class="quran">“<em>Ar-Rahman</em>. He taught the <em>Qur’an</em> … So which of the favours of your Lord will you two deny?”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 55:1-13]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And He said, <strong><span class="quran">” … and He is Ever Most Merciful (<em>Rahim</em>) to the believers”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 33:43]</strong> and hence particularised His name <em>Ar-Rahim</em> to them. So if it said: “How is it possible to reconcile what you have thus far established with his (<em>peace be upon him</em>) saying in the<em>du’a</em>, <span class="hadith">‘The Rahman of the world and the Hereafter and the Rahim of them’</span>?”<span id="qtip2" class="toggle">3</span> The obvious reply – <em>and Allah knows best</em> – is that <em>Ar-Rahim</em> is specific to the believers as we have mentioned, but it is not specified to them in the Hereafter alone, rather His Mercy to them is included in this world as well. So the meaning of <span class="hadith">“the Rahim of them”</span> would be ‘His Mercy to the believers in them’. And the evidence that He is <em>Rahim</em> to the believers in this world as well (as the Hereafter) is that this is the literal meaning of His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“He is the One who sends His Blessings (<em>salah</em>) upon you, and His Angels so as to lead you out of the darkness to the light, and He is Ever Most Merciful (<em>Rahim</em>) to the believers.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 33:43]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Because His <em>salah</em> upon them, the <em>salah</em> of His Angels and His leading them out of the darkness to the light is Mercy to them in this world, even though it be the reason for Mercy in the Hereafter as well. And similar to this in meaning is His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the <em>Muhajirun</em> and the <em>Ansar</em> who followed him in the time of distress after the hearts of a group of them had nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance. Certainly He is full of kindness to them, Most Merciful (<em>Rahim</em>).”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 9:117]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For the Mercy is linked to the event that befell the Prophet, the <em>Muhajirun</em> and the <em>Ansar</em>, and also His forgiving them was Mercy in this world even though it be the reason for Mercy in the Hereafter as well. And the Knowledge (of what is correct) lies with Allah.</span></p>
<h4 class="quran" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“MASTER OF THE DAY OF RECOMPENSE (<em>DIN</em>)”</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no explanation here (as to what the Day of <em>Din</em> is), but this is explained in His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“And what will make you comprehend what the Day of <em>Din</em> is? Again what will make you comprehend what the Day of <em>Din</em>is? It is the Day when no person shall have power (to do) anything for another.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 83:17-19]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the meaning of <em>Din</em> in the verse is recompense, as can be seen in His saying, <strong><span class="quran">“on that Day Allah will pay them their <em>din</em> in truth”</span>[<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 24:25]</strong> meaning: the recompense of their actions with complete justice.</span></p>
<h4 class="quran" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“YOU ALONE WE WORSHIP”</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Indicating in this noble verse to the realisation of the meaning of <em>la ilaha illallah</em> (there is none worthy of worship except for Allah) for it’s meaning is comprised of two matters: negation and affirmation. So the negation aspect means to remove every single object of worship apart from Allah in all the actions of worship, and the affirmation aspect means to single out the Lord of the heavens and the earth Alone for all matters of worship in the way that has been legislated by the <em>Shari’ah</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This negation in the <em>la ilaha illallah</em> was indicated by placing the object of worship first in the verse hence, <span class="quran">‘You Alone’</span>, and it is established in ‘<em>Al-Usul</em>‘ under the discussion on ‘<em>Dalil al-Khitab Alladhi Huwa Mafhum al-Mukhalafa</em>‘, and in ‘<em>Al-Ma’ani</em>‘ under the discussion of ‘<em>Al-Qasr</em>‘: that placing the object first (in a sentence) is one if the ways of confining (the meaning of the verb to the object alone).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the affirmation part of the <em>kalima</em> was indicated in His saying, <span class="quran">‘we worship’</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And He, <em>the Exalted</em>, explained this meaning which is indicated here in detail elsewhere. For example His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“O Mankind! Worship your Lord who created you.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 2:21]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Clarifying the affirmation aspect with his words, <span class="quran">‘worship your Lord’</span> and the negation aspect at the end of this noble verse with His words, <strong><span class="quran">‘so do not set up rivals with Allah while you know’</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 2:22]</strong>. And for example His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“We have indeed sent a Messenger to every people saying: worship Allah and leave all that is worshipped besides Allah.”</span>[<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 16:36]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Clarifying the affirmation with His words, <span class="quran">‘worship Allah’</span> and the negation with His words, <span class="quran">‘and leave all that is worshipped besides Allah’</span>. And for example His saying, <strong><span class="quran">“And whosoever rejects all that is worshipped besides Allah and believes in Allah has held onto the most trustworthy handhold.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em>2:256]</strong> Clarifying the negation with his words, <span class="quran">‘whosoever rejects all that is worshipped besides Allah’</span>and the affirmation with His words, <span class="quran">‘and believes in Allah’</span>. And for example His sayings:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“And when Abraham said to his father and his people: Indeed I am free of what you worship except He who created me.”</span>[<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 43:26-27]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“And We did not send a Messenger before you except that We revealed to him: that there is none worthy of worship but Me, so worship Me.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 21:25]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span class="quran">“Ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides Allah.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 43:45]</strong> And other verses.</span></p>
<h4 class="quran" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“YOU ALONE WE ASK FOR HELP”</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning that we do not seek aid from anyone but You because the command / affair in it’s totality is under Your control Alone, no one else has even an atoms weight of control over it. And in this statement’s following His saying, <span class="quran">“You Alone we worship”</span> lies an indication that it is not permissible to put our trust in anyone except the One that deserves worship because no one else has control over the command / affair. This meaning which is indicated here is clearly explained in other verses, like His sayings:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“So worship Him and put your trust in Him.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 12:123]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“But if they turn away, say: Allah is sufficient for me, none has the right to be worshipped but Him, in Him I put my trust.”</span>[<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 9:129]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“The Lord of the East and the West, none deserves to be worshipped but Him, so take Him as the Disposer of your affairs.”</span>[<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 73:9]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“Say: He is the Most Beneficent, we have believed in Him and put our trust in Him.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 67:29]</span></strong></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span class="quran">“THE PATH OF THOSE WHOM YOU HAVE FAVOURED”</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no explanation here as to who are the ones that have been favoured, but this is explained in another place with His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“And whosoever obeys Allah and the Messenger then they will be in the company of those that Allah has favoured: of the Prophets, the Truthful Ones (<em>Siddiq</em>), the Martyrs and the Righteous – what an excellent company!”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 4:69]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Addendum 1: the correctness of the Caliphate of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq can be derived from this noble verse because he is included amongst those that Allah has commanded us, in the Great <em>Qur’an</em> and the Seven Oft-Repeated Verses – I mean <em>Al-Fatihah</em>, to ask Him that He guide us to their path thus indicating that their path is the Straight Path.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This lies in His saying, <span class="quran">‘guide us to the Straight Path, the Path of those whom You have favoured’</span> and He explained who these favoured people were and included amongst them the <em>Siddiqin</em>. And he (<em>peace be upon him</em>) explained that Abu Bakr (<em>may Allah be pleased with him</em>) was from amongst the <em>Siddiqin</em>, so it becomes clear that he is included amongst those that Allah has favoured – those that Allah has commanded us to ask Him to guide us to their path. So there remains no doubt that Abu Bakr as-Siddiq was upon the Straight Path and that his Caliphate was correct.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Addendum 2: you have come to know that the <em>Siddiqin</em> are from those that Allah has favoured. And Allah has made clear that Maryam the daughter of Imran was a <em>Siddiqah</em> in His saying, <span class="quran">‘and His mother was a <em>Siddiqah</em>‘</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 5:75]. So is Maryam included in His saying, <span class="quran">‘those whom you have favoured’</span>or not? The answer: whether or not she is included amongst them is dependent upon a foundational principle which has a well known dispute over it. This is – does the sound masculine plural and it’s likes which occurs in the<em>Qur’an</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em> include the feminine gender in all cases or only in those cases for which there is a specific evidence?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A group of scholars took to the opinion that it does – so according to them Maryam is included in the above verse. And these scholars depended upon two proofs:</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The consensus of the people of the Arabic Language that the masculine gender takes prevalence over the feminine.<span id="qtip3" class="toggle">4</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">There a number of verses which prove that the females are included in the sound masculine plural, like His saying concerning Maryam herself, <strong><span class="quran">“she testified to the truth of the Words of her Lord and His Books, and she was of those obedient to Allah (<em>Qanitin</em> – a sound masculine plural)”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 66:12]</strong>, and His saying concerning the wife of Al-Aziz, <strong><span class="quran">“O Yusuf! Turn away from this! (O Woman!) Ask forgiveness for your sin, indeed your were of the sinful (<em>Khati’in</em> – a sound masculine plural)”</span>[<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 12:29], and His saying concerning Bilqis, <span class="quran">“And that which she used to worship besides Allah has prevented her (from Islam), for she was of a disbelieving people (<em>Qawm Kafirin</em>)”</span></strong> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 27:43], and His saying, <strong><span class="quran">“We said: get down (<em>ihbitu</em>) all of you from this”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 2:38]</strong> and this includes <em>Hawa</em> by consensus. And the majority of scholars took to the opinion that the females are not included in the sound masculine plural unless there is a specific evidence, and they depended upon a number of verses like His saying, <span class="quran">“indeed the male Muslims and the female Muslims, the male believers and the female believers. Allah has prepared for them a forgiveness and a great reward”</span>, and His saying, <strong><span class="quran">“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and protect their private parts. That is purer for them”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 24:30]</strong> following this with, <strong><span class="quran">“and tell the believing women to lower their gaze and protect their private parts”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 24:31]</strong>. So their following the mention of the men indicates that they are not included amongst them. And they replied to the proponents of the first opinion by saying that the fact that the masculine gender takes prevalence over the feminine is not a matter of dispute. What is disputed is whether the masculine plural includes the females in every case. And they replied to the verses (the first group) used by saying that it is known by the context of these verses and the meaning of the wordings that the females are included in the male plural – and that their inclusion in the male plural in the case of their being an evidence that they are included is not contended.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So according to this opinion Maryam is not included in the verse.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this difference of opinion was pointed out in ‘<em>Maraqi as-Sa’ud</em>‘ with his saying, <span class="salaf">“There is nothing untoward in including the feminine (amongst the masculine gender) For this is a matter in which the Muslims have differed.”</span></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span class="quran">“NOT THE PATH OF THOSE WHO HAVE EARNED YOUR ANGER, NOR OF THOSE THAT WENT ASTRAY”</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The majority of the scholars of <em>tafsir</em> said that <span class="quran">‘those who have earned Your Anger’</span> are the Jews, and<span class="quran">‘those that went astray’</span> are the Christians, and their is the <em>hadith</em> of the Messenger of Allah (<em>peace be upon him</em>) reported from Adi ibn Hatim (<em>may Allah be pleased with him</em>) concerning this<span id="qtip4" class="toggle">5</span>. And the Jews and the Christians even though both of them are misguided and both of them have Allah’s Anger on them – the Anger is specified to the Jews, even though the Christians share this with them, because the Jews knew the truth and rejected it and deliberately came with falsehood, so the Anger (of Allah being upon them) was the description most befitting them. And the Christians were ignorant, not knowing the truth, so misguidance was the description most befitting them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So with this the saying of Allah,<strong> <span class="quran">‘so they have drawn on themselves anger upon anger’</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 2:90]</strong> clarifies that the Jews are those that <span class="quran">‘have earned your Anger’</span>. And likewise His sayings:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“Say: shall I inform you of something worse than that, regarding the recompense from Allah: those (Jews) who incurred the Curse of Allah and His Anger.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 5:60]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“Indeed those who took the calf (for worship), anger from their Lord and humiliation will come upon them.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em>7:152]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the saying of Allah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="quran">“And do not follow the vain desires of people (i.e. the Christians) who went astray in times gone by, and misled many, and have themselves strayed from the Straight Path.”</span> [<em>Al-Qur’an</em> 5:77]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Clarifies that it is the Christians who are astray.</span></p>
