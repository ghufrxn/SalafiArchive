<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Raza Ali Khan and Naqi Ali Khan (The grandfather and father of Ahmad Raza Khan, respectively)</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us look at the father of Ahmad Raza Khan, Naqi Ali Khan and his views. He was of course an ardent Sufi and had ijazah from the infamous Zaini Dahlan (see al-Ijazat al-Mutayinah p.67, Usul al-rashad liqamah mabani al-fasad p.19)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">a baralvi researcher, Muhammad Hanif Khn Rizvi Barelvi, writes in the introduction to one of Naqi Ali Khan&#8217;s book,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>&#8220;He despised the british rule and always opposed the british all his life. He continued efforts in uprooting british rule and pushed his efforts in writing to liberate the motherland from british rulership. In this regard Chanda Shah Hussaini writes, &#8220;Mawlana Raza Ali Khan had become famous for his Jihad against the british with his speech and pen, the british feared the efforts and fervour of the Mawlana. His son, Mawlana Naqi Ali Khan was also active in jihad against the britishers and the Mawlana had a high status amongst the scholars, furthermore, in this regard he had extensive and virtuous efforts against the british.&#8221;</em> (Shams al-Tawarikh, Usul al-rashad liqamah mabani al-fasad p.22)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">In order to expel the british out of India, the scholars of India formulated a Jihad Committee and issued a Fatwa of Jihad against the britishers and their rule. At the head and the first and foremost who issued the fatwa was Mawlana Raza Ali Khan, (a few other names) and Mawlana Naqi Ali Khan&#8230;&#8221; (Mish&#8217;al Rah &#8211; The Story of the Brtish Oppressors by Abd al-Hakim Akhtar Shahjanapuri, First chapter, the affect of the Clashes of 1857c p.126, Usul al-rashad liqamah mabani al-fasad p.23)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Mawlana Naqi Ali Khan would send horses to the mujahidin, who were wajing jihad against the british. In his speeches and sermons he would incite the people to wage war and jihad against the british. The people of Bareli were successful in their jihad against the british, who had to flee Bareli without choice. (Hayat Mufti Azam, Usul al-rashad liqamah mabani al-fasad p.23) </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course we are not here to debate and scrutinise the realities of these claims and how accurate they are based on historical records, but the point is how have the Sufi Barelvis of England overlooked the views and positions of the Sufi Barelwi elders and Churchfathers. On one hand we have the calamitous absurdities one could ever put on paper i.e. the dismantled report from the Henry Jackson society, who not only were falling short on payday but are also a shamble to academic research, who raised fallacious allegations against Ahl al-Sunnah, while on the other hand they outrightly ignored historical facts embodied within the Sufi Barelwi renegades. These people have places of worship in their droves in the United Kingdom and they preach the same points as their forefathers did, so why are the likes of Henry Jackson society silent on such findings?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well this obviously leaves us with two possible realities which are perhaps closest to the truth, 1. The Henry Jackson Society are either intellectually challenged and have the most despicably shoddiest research on the face of this planet or 2. They act as a front for the neo-con and new world oder agenda. The fact of the matter and reality dictates that both are true in synchrony, we will inshAllah address their disastrous culminations at a later date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We find dear readers, on on hand these Sufi Barelwis hurl allegations against the &#8216;Wahhabis&#8217; and Saudi Arabia while their on forefathers were at the forefront of Terrorism and extremism against the britisher rule. The irony and the most funny thing about these treacherous lying individuals is that they promote these teachings behind closed door in private gatherings and circles and then show another face of peace their with placards of peace and unity to the british public. We are in no doubt if these people had any real power and authority they would take active physical steps  against the Salafi&#8217;s and Ah al-Hadith.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Taken from: <strong><span style="color: #000080;">al-Barelwiyyah; Their History and Beliefs Volume 2, <em>Expounding The Belief of the Pious Ancestors and Ahl al-Sunnah w’al Jama’ah</em><em> </em><em>&amp; </em><em>What Opposes it from the Wicked Deviation of the Barelwi Renegades</em></span></strong></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Historical Overview &#8211; Sufi Barelwi Renegades &amp; Their Origins in Extreme Terror and Kharijism; The Barelwi Ancestry and Lineage</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We begin by looking at the Barelwi Ash’arite and Sufi Churchfathers and their affect on the muslim society. It is common knowledge and a specific and particular hallmark of the Barelwi underlings and global sufi sympathisers that the Saudi Wahabis are government funded, they rebel and murder people, Khawarij and all sorts of fallacious delusional points.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will show how the Barelwi forefathers were themselves upon the methodology of killing innocent Muslims and how they colluded against the Muslims. We will also show how some of them were renegades themselves,  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the lineage of Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Naqi Ali Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Raza Ali Khan son of  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Kazim Ali Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Azam Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’adat Yar Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’idullah Khan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Zafar al-Din Qadri Bihari, <em>Hayat A’la Hazrat</em>, (Karachi: Maqtabah Rizviyya, 1:2 Muhammad Sabir al-Qadiri Nasim al-Bastawi, <em>Ahwal wa Athar Hazrat Mujaddid Islam</em> (Lahore: Raza Academy, 1998) p.34 </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Sa’idullah Khan</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He hailed from Kandahar which in present day Afghanistan, he was a pathan belonging to the Barech tribe. He eventually migrated to Lahore with Sultan Muhammad Nadir Shah as part of his war expeditions. He was given prestigious and high ranking positions within Nadir Shahs Safavid Dynasty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then moved to Delhi whilst he was minister of a department. He received the accolade and title of ‘Bravery of war,’ an official title from the Ruler, ie Muhammad Nadir Shah for his bravery and ardent loyalty (Muhammad Sabir al-Qadiri Nasim al-Bastawi, <em>Ahwal wa Athar Hazrat Mujaddid Islam</em>, p.34) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Nadir Shah (d.1747) was the ruler or Iran of the Safavid Dynasty and had the title The Shah of Iran. He was, naturally of Iranian descent belonging to the Afshar tribe hailing from Khurasan. He was born a Shi’i as an Itha Ashari and was an ardent follower of the Jafari school of thought. Due to the political turmoil at the time he would often say to people he was also sunni in order to keep his cohorts to support him and also to keep the opposing Ottoman empire from fighting him. In fact, numerous people serving and working with him failed to highlight whether he was sunni or shi’i, such was his deception</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He attempted to mix the two and made his own madhab called the jafari madhab so that the ottomans would accept him. His aim was to allow the persians to perform Hajj which was under Ottoman control and administration, and his only aim behind this was to make this a revenue stream. (Michael Axworthy&#8217;s, <em>The Sword of Persia</em> (I.B. Tauris, 2006), Tucker, Ernest, &#8220;Nadir Shah and the Ja&#8217;fari Mazhab reconsidered&#8221;, in <em>Iranian Studies</em>, vol. 27, 1-4 (1994), pp,163-179.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He continued to fight for the Safavid dynasty which was in decline at the period and thus Nadir Shah seized the opportunity to launch his own house. Nadir Shah continued to lead numerous military expeditions throughout the lands, which he was successful in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the time Ghilzai Afghans had control of the southeast regions, namely Kandahar. This was later controlled by the Hotaki dynasty. Nadir Shah defeated the Hotaki dynasty in approximately 1738 and took control of Kandahar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is where Sa’idullah Khan joined Nadir Shah and became a part of his dynasty war campaign for domination. Nadir Shah then went onto fight the Mughals and their empire and in the process captured cities like Ghazni, Kabul, Peshawar, parts of Sindh and Lahore.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Nadir Shah’s history and campaign were a far cry from innocence, one only needs to read the annals of history and they will come to know the wicked and evil nature of his deviation, theologically and socially.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The aim is not to present a reading into the evil actions of certain individuals or a history lesson but to show if one makes erroneous and fabricated claims against Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and al-Saud family, the closet will yield some home truths! (For further reading on the generosity and life of Muhammad Nadir Shah Read, Michael Axworthy&#8217;s, <em>The Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from Tribal Warrior to Conquering Tyrant</em>. (I.B. Tauris, 2006), Ernest Tucker, <em>Nadir Shah&#8217;s Quest for Legitimacy in Post-Safavid Iran</em> (Florida, University Press, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the likes of whom the forefathers of Ahmad Raza Khan colluded with, to cause havoc and rampage in muslim territories, the atrocities, genocide, pillaging land, and philandering of wealth and woman of unprecedented levels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to ask the barelwi sympathisers what do they make of the claim, which they often hurl at Ahl al-Sunnah, petrol dollars, the illegal al-Saud state, corroborating with the British, killing innocent muslims, mass murdering and declaring Muslims to be disbelievers. Of course this is sheer nonsense which has been answered in great detail, however the ignorant wandering mind will always have difficulty focusing on the truth and facts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This said, Barelwi Sufi narrow mindedness and genius level of reasoning fails to see and acknowledge how the forefathers of their Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan were part of such acts which were absolutely heinous and catastrophically evil.  </span></p>

I know not that you have an ilâh (a god) other than me, so kindle for me (a fire), O Hâmân, to bake (bricks out of) clay, and set up for me a Sarh (a lofty tower, or palace) in order that I may look at (or look for) the Ilâh (God) of Mûsa (Moses); and verily, I think that he [Mûsa (Moses)] is one of the liars.&#8221; </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Al Qasas:38]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Fir&#8217;aun (Pharaoh) said: &#8220;O Hâmân! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways, (36) &#8220;The ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the Ilâh (God) of Mûsa (Moses) But verily, I think him to be a liar.&#8221; Thus it was made fair-seeming, in Fir&#8217;aun&#8217;s (Pharaoh) eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the (Right) Path, and the plot of Fir&#8217;aun (Pharaoh) led to nothing but loss and destruction (for him).</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Ghāfir: 36-37]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are various points of benefit from these āyahs of which some are:</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The prophets and messengers of previous nations also held the creed that Allāh is above the heavens.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">To reject Allāh being above the heavens is to follow the way of Fir’aun the accursed.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed, to reject Allāh being above the heavens is that which leads to misguidance and a removal from the straight path of guidance.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Such a baseless creed of rejecting Allāh being above the heavens makes one’s evil deeds as seem fairing to the person.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Such a creed leads a person to find ways to reject and alter the Shari’ah revealed by Allāh [as was perpetrated by Fir’aun].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">However, Allāh destroys all false ways and alterations made by the person of false creed.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Tahāwī states:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Those from the Jahmiyyah sect who reject Allāh being high above are Firawnī [upon the way of Fir’aun]. Then those who affirm Allāh being high above are upon the way of Mūsa and Muhammad”.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">[Sharh Aqīdah Tahāwiyyah, pg:259]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And in the heaven is your provision, and that which you are promised.” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Adh-Dhāriyāt:22]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;You worship besides Allâh only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allâh have no power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allâh (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back.” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[al-Ankabūt:17]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is thus clearly established that the provision of sustenance is with Allāh and He is above the heavens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4] </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Do you feel secure that He, who is over [fī] the heaven (Allâh), will not cause the earth to sink with you, and then it should quake?” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[al-Mulk:16]</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5]</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Or do you feel secure that He, who is over [fī] the heaven (Allâh), will not send against you a violent whirlwind? Then you shall know how (terrible) has been My Warning.” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[al-Mulk:17]</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imām al-Bayhaqī comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The word [Fī] in these ayaat means over and above. It is saying are you not afraid of your Lord who is above the heavens? Similar to this is the meaning when Allāh says in the Qurān “so travel [Fī] the earth” also ‘and I will crucify you on [Fī] the trunks of palm trees’ [which is what Fir’aun said to the magicians when they believed in Mūsa]. It is clear that the ayah of travelling upon the earth means that the thing ‘above’ is the heavens and Allāh is above them. Therefore, the meaning of these ayaat shall be ‘Are you not afraid of the one who is above His Throne’ as is established in many other ayaat”.</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Al-Itiqād of al-Bayhaqī, pg 42]. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He also states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Abū Abdullah al-Hāfidh said the Shaikh Abū Bakr Ahmad Bin Ishāq Bin Ayūb the Jurist said that ‘The specialist linguists of the Arabic language have said that the word ‘Fī’ is used interchangeably with the word ‘alā’ [above/over] in the language. Allāh said ‘“so travel [Fī] the earth” and ‘and I will crucify you on [Fī] the trunks of palm trees’ here the word Fī in these ayaat means ‘alā’, i.e., over/above. It is likewise with this in mind we understand Allāh’s words in Quran when he says ‘Fī’ the heavens, i.e., it means above His Throne, above the heavens as has been mentioned in numerous prophetic traditions.”</span></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>SHIRK.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Shaikh has mentioned twenty chapters under how shirk is manifested in the Ummah. From amongst them he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">To seek help assistance from other than Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Mankind in the world through their dealings assist and cooperate with one another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Allāh almighty has said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“Cooperate with one another upon good and god fearing” [Al Māidah:2]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">However, concerning those issues in which one has no control or ownership and which belong solely to Allāh by way of his qualities then to seek help from the creation expecting from them these qualities is to make shirk with Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Allāh says:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“Do you not know that the owner of the heavens and earth is none other than Allāh, And besides Allāh you have neither any Walî (protector or guardian) nor any helper.” [Al-Baqarah: 107]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Since there is no guardian or helper other than Allāh then how can one seek such help from other than Him? In fact, to do so is to make shirk with Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Shirk has become so embedded in our society that certain people when they meet each other instead of giving the Islamic greetings of salām one will say “O Alī [the companion and 4<sup>th</sup> Caliph] help me” and the recipient will say “My guide and protector Alī help me”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Do these people not see that Alī could not help his son in the travesty of Karbalā in which he was martyred? Nor could he save himself against his killer Ibn Muljim. In reality, Alī himself was always in need of Allāh and did not have the power to benefit and protect himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Those that have abandoned the legislated salām of salutation have shown a clear opposition and enmity to the Lord of all Mankind, Allāh. Allāh says,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">“If Allāh helps you, none can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, who is there after Him that can help you? And in Allāh (Alone) let believers put their trust.” [Āli-Imrān:160]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Muhammad Bin Ishāq al-Mutaalibī said concerning this ayah:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">“If Allāh is aiding you then no person can overcome or humiliate you and the opposite is also the case. Thus do not leave the commands of Allāh for the sake of another but instead leave others instead of the commands of Allāh. The believers should rely only on Allāh and not on others”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">[Durr Manthūr [2:1] as reported from Jarir, Ibn Mundhir and Ibn Abī Hātim]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This ayah shows that even in affairs in which a person has ability help another in this world cannot do so unless Allāh wills and allows. Therefore, to ask creation in that which they have no ability or control is furthermore inconceivable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Then this is why we have been commanded to read in every prayer the Fātiha which has within it:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything).” [Fātiha:4]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Therefore, without doubt the Muslims creed should be based on only seeking help and aid from Allāh but even in this regard some people from amongst those who should know better fell short!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The famous Deobandī sect scholar Mahmūd ul Hasan who they refer to as the ‘Shaikh of India’ said in his tafsīr of this āyah that:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">“This āyah shows that to seek help from other than Allāh’s being is completely impermissible. However, if one was to find a pious person who is accepted and purely to gain the Mercy of Allāh one was to put him before Allāh [as an intermediary] then this is permissible. To seek help from this person will actually be as if one is seeking help from Allāh”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">[Meaning of the Qurān with notes of benefit. V1/2]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">So we say that such explanations open wide the door of shirk with Allāh; and it is with such explanations that the people use to justify to call upon other than Allāh with words such as calling upon the Prophet “Yā Muhammad”, the Angels, Abdul Qādir Jīlāni or other than them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In the battle of Badr when Allāh sent the angels to help the Muslims and the resulting happiness of that Allāh says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">“And Allāh made it not except as [a sign of] good tidings for you and to reassure your hearts thereby. And victory is not except from Allāh, the Exalted in Might, the Wise” [Āli Imran:126]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Explanation</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This means that the sending of the angels has been mentioned just so to reassure the companions and to change their anxiety into happiness and tranquillity. Otherwise, in reality it is not the angels who helped but Allāh alone as is evident from the ayah, and the angels being sent was only by Allāh’s authority and command and He can decide to help whomsoever and however He wants.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“And those whom you call upon besides Him (Allāh) cannot help you nor can they help themselves.&#8221; [Al-Arāf:197]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In reality those who are in the mausoleums, graves and various places where people gather to call upon other than Allāh are in need of the caretakers of the graves and mausoleums to protect the food, wealth and money that the ignorant people leave at their graves. They cannot help themselves from the thieves so how can they help others?</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“And they have taken besides Allāh âlihah (gods), hoping that they might be helped (by those so— called gods). (74) They cannot help them, but they will be brought forward as a troop against those who worshipped them (at the time of Reckoning).” [Yā-Sīn:74/75]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It means those who have fallen into shirk are hoping for assistance and help from those that they call upon and thus to call upon them is completely futile. Then from amongst these people who call upon others is the like of the Deobandī spiritual guide, scholar, Hāji Imdādullāh Muhājir Makki Hanafī Chishtī Qādrī Naqshbandī Sohrwardī says about his own guide Pīr Shāh Nūr Muhammad whilst addressing him the following couplets of poetry:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“You O Nūr Muhammad a special beloved of Allāh</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In India are the deputy of prophet Muhammad</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Whilst you are the helper then what is there to fear</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Due to the love you have of the prophet you shake and are in awe</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><u>Now is the time to help us O Shāh Nūr Muhammad</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">[Shamāim Amrādiyyah pg: 83]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">I say, if so called scholars have corrupt beliefs such as this then what can one expect of the ignorant lay person? Then it should be known that there is no doubt that such a call for help is shirk with Allāh as is evident from the verses above.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong><u>Some narrations:</u></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ubādah Bin Sāmit narrates that in the time of the Prophet there was a hypocrite who continued to hurt the believers. Some people said let us go to Prophet Muhammad to seek help in this affair. The Prophet upon hearing this said help is not sought from me but only from Allāh alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">[Fath ul Majīd Sharh Kitāb ut-Tawhīd pg: 178-79].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">So if help cannot be sought from the Prophet then how is it conceivable one can ask for those who are less than him in rank and status?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abu Huraira reported:</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000"><strong> </strong>حَدَّثَنَا قُتَيْبَةُ بْنُ سَعِيدٍ، وَزُهَيْرُ بْنُ حَرْبٍ، قَالاَ حَدَّثَنَا جَرِيرٌ، عَنْ عَبْدِ الْمَلِكِ بْنِ عُمَيْرٍ، عَنْ مُوسَى بْنِ طَلْحَةَ، عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ لَمَّا أُنْزِلَتْ هَذِهِ الآيَةُ ‏{‏ وَأَنْذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الأَقْرَبِينَ‏}‏ دَعَا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قُرَيْشًا فَاجْتَمَعُوا فَعَمَّ وَخَصَّ فَقَالَ ‏&#8221;‏ يَا بَنِي كَعْبِ بْنِ لُؤَىٍّ أَنْقِذُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِنَ النَّارِ يَا بَنِي مُرَّةَ بْنِ كَعْبٍ أَنْقِذُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِنَ النَّارِ يَا بَنِي عَبْدِ شَمْسٍ أَنْقِذُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِنَ النَّارِ يَا بَنِي عَبْدِ مَنَافٍ أَنْقِذُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِنَ النَّارِ يَا بَنِي هَاشِمٍ أَنْقِذُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِنَ النَّارِ يَا بَنِي عَبْدِ الْمُطَّلِبِ أَنْقِذُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِنَ النَّارِ يَا فَاطِمَةُ أَنْقِذِي نَفْسَكِ مِنَ النَّارِ فَإِنِّي لاَ أَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا غَيْرَ أَنَّ لَكُمْ رَحِمًا سَأَبُلُّهَا بِبَلاَلِهَا</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">When this ayah was revealed:&#8221; And warn thy nearest kindred (al-Qur&#8217;an, xxvi. 214), the Messenger of Allāh called the Quraish; so they gathered and he gave them a general warning. Then he made a particular (reference to certain tribes) and said: O sons of Ka&#8217;b b. Luwayy, rescue yourselves from the Fire; O sons of Murra b. Ka&#8217;b, rescue yourselves from the Fire: O sons of Abd Shams, rescue yourselves from the Fire; O sons of Abd Manaf rescue yourselves from the Fire; O sons of Hashim, rescue yourselves from the Fire; O sons of Abd al-Muttalib, rescue yourselves from the Fire; O Fatimah, rescue thyself from the Fire, for I have no power (to protect you) from Allāh in anything except this that I would sustain relationship with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">[Sahīh Muslim no:204]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In another hadith he said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">وَحَدَّثَنِي حَرْمَلَةُ بْنُ يَحْيَى، أَخْبَرَنَا ابْنُشَيْئًا يَا بَنِي عَبْدِ الْمُطَّلِبِ لاَ أُغْنِي عَنْكُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا يَا عَبَّاسَ بْنَ عَبْدِ الْمُطَّلِبِ لاَ أُغْ وَهْبٍ، قَالَ أَخْبَرَنِي يُونُسُ، عَنِ ابْنِ شِهَابٍ، قَالَ أَخْبَرَنِي ابْنُ الْمُسَيَّبِ، وَأَبُو سَلَمَةَ بْنُ عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ أَنَّ أَبَا هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم حِينَ أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ‏{‏ وَأَنْذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الأَقْرَبِينَ‏}‏ ‏&#8221;‏ يَا مَعْشَرَ قُرَيْشٍ اشْتَرُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ لاَ أُغْنِي عَنْكُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ نِي عَنْكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا يَا صَفِيَّةُ عَمَّةَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ لاَ أُغْنِي عَنْكِ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا يَا فَاطِمَةُ بِنْتَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ سَلِينِي بِمَا شِئْتِ لاَ أُغْنِي عَنْكِ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا ‏&#8221;‏ ‏.‏</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abu Huraira reported:</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">When (this ayah) was revealed to him:&#8221; Warn your nearest kinsmen.&#8221; the Messenger of Allāh said: O people of Quraish, buy yourselves from Allāh, I cannot avail you at all against Allāh; O sons of Abd al-Muttalib. I cannot avail you at all against Allāh; O Abbas b. &#8216;Abd al- Muttalib, I cannot avail you at all against Allāh; O Safiya (aunt of the Messenger of Allāh), I cannot avail you at all against Allāh; O Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, ask me whatever you like, but I cannot avail you at all against Allāh.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">[Sahīh Muslim no:206]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In this hadith the prophet has explained to his close tribespeople and relatives that he has informed them of the correct path to attain salvation and have no control or authority over saving his relatives and own daughter before Allāh unless they have the correct deeds [which she does undoubtedly]. So how can then any Shaikh or saint help his followers in times of distress when the Prophet cannot do so?</span></p>

<span style="color: #000000"> وَفِي رِوَايَةِ غَيْرِ التِّرْمِذِيِّ: &#8220;احْفَظْ اللَّهَ تَجِدْهُ أمامك، تَعَرَّفْ إلَى اللَّهِ فِي الرَّخَاءِ يَعْرِفُك فِي الشِّدَّةِ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ مَا أَخْطَأَك لَمْ يَكُنْ لِيُصِيبَك، وَمَا أَصَابَك لَمْ يَكُنْ لِيُخْطِئَك، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ النَّصْرَ مَعَ الصَّبْرِ، وَأَنْ الْفَرَجَ مَعَ الْكَرْبِ، وَأَنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Abu al-‘Abbas ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhu) reports:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">“One day I was riding (a horse/camel) behind the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, when he said, ‘Young man, I will teach you some words. Be mindful of Allāh, and He will take care of you. Be mindful of Him, and you shall find Him at your side. If you ask, ask of Allāh. If you need help, seek it from Allāh. Know that if the whole world were to gather together in order to help you, they would not be able to help you except if Allāh had written so. And if the whole world were to gather together in order to harm you, they would not harm you except if Allāh had written so. The pens have been lifted, and the pages are dry.’”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This hadith informs us that we should at all times direct our seeking aid and assistance to Allāh alone seeking His pleasure as He is the only one who can assist.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Allāh says:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Shaikh Abdul Qādir Jīlānī after mentioning the above hadith says,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>“Every Muslim should keep this hadith in his heart like a reflection at all times.

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Imran bin Husain narrated:</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><em>“The Prophet said to my father: ‘O Husain, how many deities do you worship now?‘ He said: ‘Seven. Six in the earth, and one above the heavens.’ He said: ‘So which of them do you take for your ardent requests and fears?’ He said: ‘The one above the heavens.’ He said: ‘O Husain, if you would but accept Islam, I would teach you two phrases that would benefit you.’” He said: “So when Husain accepted Islam, he said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, teach me the two phrases you promised me.’ So he said: “Say: O Allah, inspire me with my guidance, and protect me from the evil of my soul (Allāhumma alhimnī rushdī, wa a`idhnī min sharri nafsī).’”</em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">[Tirmidhī no:3483]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Whilst in a state of kufr the father of Imrān confirmed that it was only Allāh that should be called upon with all requests being made to Him and Him alone being feared. Hence, this was the creed of the disbelievers. What a calamity that today so called Muslims do not even have this same belief and instead seek help, assistance and show reverence and fear to the ones who are dead in the graves!! This companions story should be a lesson to all and we learn clearly that the one true Lord above the heavens should be called upon alone with no partners at all times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Allāh says,</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order, and invoke Him with fear and hope; Surely, Allâh&#8217;s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good-doers.” [Al-Arāf:56]</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">In conclusion, these narrations substantiate that no one can assist, aid, remove a calamity, or with whom trust, love hope and fear should be placed in other than the Lord of the Almighty Throne Allāh Himself. No prophet, angel, saint, scholar or any part of creation as a matter of fact can assist as they do not control the affairs, nor do they have the authority from Allāh to assist nor are they deputies of Allāh to whom Allāh has designated His Power to assist. Indeed, all creation itself is always in need of Allāh so we should therefore only call upon Him.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Ahl-ul-Hadeeth By Dr. Muhammad Deeya ar-Rahman al-Azamee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahl-ul-Hadeeth: Shaykh ul-Islaam said: ‘We do not mean to limit Ahl-ul-Hadeeth just to those who convey hadeeth, write them or narrate them but we mean by them: everyone who rightfully memorises the hadeeth, knowing them and understanding their apparent and hidden meanings and following them in what is apparent and hidden, and also the people of al-Qur’aan.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘The least of their traits is: love of the Qur’aan and hadeeth, researching them, seeking their meanings and practising that which they know is binding upon them. The Fuqaha of hadeeth are better informed about the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- than Fuqaha other than them.’[1]
<p style="text-align: justify;">He mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Ahl-ul-Hadeeth are those about whom the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘What I am upon and my Companions.’ And in another narration: ‘It is the Jamaah, The Hand of Allaah is over the Jamaah.’[2]
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahl-ul-Hadeeth are the best people of the Duniya, as Hafs bin Ghayaath said.[3]
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shafi’ee said: ‘If I see a companion of Hadeeth then it is as if I see a man from the Companions of the Prophet, sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, he is of that status.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">He also said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘May Allaah reward them with goodness on our behalf, they preserved the foundation for us so they have an excellence over us.’[4]
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Alee bin al-Madini said: ‘There are no people better than the companions of Hadeeth. The rest of the people were in search of the Duniya while they were establishing the Deen.’[5] i.e. the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hafidh Ibn Rajab said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Ahl-ul-Hadeeth are an authority in knowing hadeeth and knowing the authentic from the weak hadeeth.’[6]
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Prophet, sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, supplicated for illumination of the one who busies himself with the knowledge of hadeeth, memorizing it, conveying it and understanding it. He, sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, said: ‘May Allaah illuminate the person who hears a hadeeth from me and memorizes it until he conveys it. Perhaps a person who carries Fiqh conveys it to someone with more Fiqh than that person and perhaps the carrier of this Fiqh is not a Faqihi.’[7]
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hafidh Abu Bakr Ahmad bin ‘Alee al-Khateeb al-Bagdadi specifically authored a book which he called ‘Sharf Ashaabul-hadeeth’ (the nobility of the companions of hadeeth). In it mentions Ahadeeth and Athaar from the Companions, Ta’bieen, kings, ministers and others from those who followed them about the excellence of knowledge of hadeeth, being busy with it and the nobility of its people over those of Ahl-ul-Bida’ and those of misguidance from the Zinaadiqa (heretics) who concerned themselves with the knowledge of rhetoric and philosophy. This book is a masterpiece in this subject.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">* Taken from ‘Mu’jam Mustalah al-Hadeeth wa laataif al-Assaneed’ p.61-63</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Umar bin al-Khattab, on the authority of Abdurrahman bin Abaan, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Zayd bin Thabit, RadhiAllaahu anhu, Marfoo’. It was also narrated by Ibn Majah (1/84) a different way on the authority of Zayd bin Thabit. Tirmidhee said it was Hasan and he also said: ‘and in this chapter it is also narrated on the authority of Abdullaah bin Mas’ood, Muadh bin Jabal, Jubayr bin Mut’im, Abu Darda and Anas, RadhiAllaahu anhum Jameean.’</p>
