				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">The one that curses the Sahabah is categorised as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The first category: If he curses all of them or accuses the majority of them of disbelief and apostasy, except for a small group¹, then this indeed constitutes an act of disbelief due to him rejecting the testimony of Allah (Mighty and Majestic) as expressed in His Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>&#8220;Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you ˹O Prophet˺ under the tree.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Fath, 48:18]</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And surely it has been established that those that pledged allegiance under the tree were numbered one thousand and four hundred, with some narrations mentioning them to be one thousand and five hundred.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The second category: As for those that curse some from amongst them, then this issue has details; If he curses some from amongst them due to a belief, i.e., perceiving that they had erred, that they were negligent, and that they were afflicted with whatever had befallen them, from the angle of belief (I&#8217;itiqad) &#8211; similar to the beliefs held by the Khawarij, then verily this is from the major sins, and it does not constitute an act that removes one from the Religion. If one curses some of them out of rage and hatred for them, then verily this is disbelief and apostasy. The People of Knowledge say, &#8216;Allah (Mighty and Majestic) has said in description of the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;&#8230;that He may enrage the disbelievers with them.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Fath, 48:29]</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hence, anyone who harbours rage in his heart for the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is characterised as being among those whom Allah (Mighty and Majestic) has identified as disbelievers.&#8217;²</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Regarding the Mothers of the Believers, then the ruling on cursing them is the [same] ruling on cursing the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them all). As for slandering the Mothers of the Believers, or one from amongst them, such as &#8216;A&#8217;isha (may Allah be pleased with her) or other than her, by claiming she was not chaste, then this constitutes an act of disbelief in Allah. Thus, whoever slanders a wife from the wives of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has disbelieved due to rejecting the statement of Allah (Mighty and Majestic) and what He has decreed for his Prophet ﷺ. However, this differs from the state of those that slandered [&#8216;A&#8217;isha (may Allah be pleased with her)] during the time of the Prophet ﷺ, as the Ayat vindicating her innocence were revealed after the famous incident of Al-Ifk. As for after the Ayat declaring her innocence were revealed, after the revelation of His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;Allah forbids you from ever doing something like this again, if you are ˹true˺ believers.&#8221;<br />
[An-Nur, 24:17]</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Then He made that a condition of Al-Iman, so whoever slanders a wife from the wives of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ after that has surely disbelieved by that, as the People of Knowledge have established.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>[Sharh Lum&#8217;atu&#8217;l-I&#8217;tiqad of Shaykh Salih Aal Ash-Shaykh, may Allah preserve him,<br />
</em><em>p. 145-146]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> The Rafidhi Iranian scholar, &#8216;Ali An-Namazi Ash-Shahrudi, said, &#8220;The sixth benefit: The large number of narrations necessitate the apostasy [of the Sahabah] other than three or four after the Prophet ﷺ, <strong>and it is the &#8216;asl [i.e., default ruling] for every Sahabi that remained after the Prophet ﷺ </strong>and did not die as a martyr during his time ﷺ, due to giving precedence to [Abu Bakr] in the matter of leadership over [&#8216;Ali].&#8221; <a href="https://ar.lib.eshia.ir/12156/1/67">[Mustadrakat &#8216;Ilm Ar-Rijal Al-Hadith, p. 67]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:]</strong> Al-Baghawi in Tafsir of this Ayah narrated, <strong>&#8220;Malik bin Anas said, &#8216;Whoever wakes up with hatred in his heart towards the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, then this Ayah surely applies to him.&#8221; </strong>[Tafsir Al-Baghawi, under 48:29]

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the Allaah’s salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow their path until the Day of Resurrection. The title <em>fitnah of Takfeer</em>: The Trials and Tribulations associated with imputing kufr (disbelief) on Muslims (rulers or ruled), is one of the most dangerous fitan in our times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This misleading thought has spread amongst many of the youth in the Muslim world, east and west, north and south. Many of these youths are greatly motivated by their emotions and their vigilant care concerning the deen. As such, they took many of that which they received from the followers of desires. These followers of desires have renewed the principles and thoughts of the early <strong>Khawaarij (dissidents)</strong> and have become an extension of them. This has led to declare takfeer on the Islamic societies at large and on all Muslim leaders, without exception. The consequences of this have been very terrible. Blood is being shed.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Definition of Kufr:</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To better understand takfeer, it is necessary to first define kufr. Linguistically, the term kufr means, “<strong>covering and shielding</strong>.” If an object covers something, then that object kafarahu (covered and shielded it). Similarly, it is said that the farmer when he puts the seed in the ground and covers it with soil is a kafir from the linguistic aspect, since he covered the seed with dirt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the Islamic meaning, sometimes the word kufr means the major kufr, which takes a person out of the fold of Islaam. Kufr could also refer to the lesser type, which does not take a person from the fold of Islaam, known as al-kufr al-asghar. Islamically, the kafir is called a kafir because he covered and shielded the favor of Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala). Therefore, the kafir did not recognize the favor of Allaah upon him and did not give thanks to Allaah. Rather, he denied the favor of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahlus-Sunnah (adherents to the Sunnah) is on the medium course, with respect to all fundamental matters in Islaam. They are between the two extremes, the excessive ones who exceeded the limits and the negligent ones. Allaah described this in Noble Qur’an (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>«Thus, we have made you a just nation» Surah al-Baqarah (2:143)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, regarding the matter of takfeer, Ahlus-Sunnah is on a medium course between extremism and negligence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kafir is of two types. The first type is <strong>al-kafir al-aslee</strong> (the orginal kafir). This includes all of those who are not Muslims including the Christians and the Jews. Anyone who doubts the kufr of al-kafir al-aslee is himself a kafir. The second type is the <strong>apostate</strong> who was born to two Muslim parents, who in the stage of adulthood rejected Islaam, either by speech or by action.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Views of Ahlus-Sunnah and the Different Sects Regarding Takfeer:</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The people are divided into three categories regarding takfeer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first category is <strong>al- Khawaarij</strong>. They impute kufr on the Muslim due to major sins; with some have gone to the extent to impute kufr on the Muslim due to minor sins. Similarly, they impute kufr on any Muslim who does not believe the same as them. As such, they have made the blood and wealth of most Muslims permissible. This group has an extension in our time and exists in many parts of the Muslim world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second group is <strong>al-Murji’ah</strong>. They claim that eeman (faith) is not affected by any sinful act, even if the Muslim commits a major sin. They say all Muslims are believers, and nothing affects faith. Although the beliefs of al-Murji’ah comprise different positions, this is an overall summary of their views.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ahlus-Sunnah</strong> are on a medium course between the two extremes. They don’t rush to impute kufr on the Muslim while not refraining from imputing kufr on him if the person commits that which Allaah and/or His Messenger declared to be kufr. However, they note, “<em>The Muslim who may say or do that which is considered kufr should not have kufr imputed on him specifically until the evidence is established on him, with all the conditions of imputing kufr fulfilled and all the impediments removed.”</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Important Matters Regarding Takfeer</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>First</strong>, before takfeer can be established, all conditions must be fulfilled and all impediments removed. From the conditions of making takfeer are: knowledge, choice, intent, deliberate action or saying of kufr, and its acceptance. This implies determining whether the person knows his action is kufr, and he has chosen it, without being compelled. Moreover, it must be shown that the person was deliberate in his action and is content with it. From the impediments of takfeer are: affirmation of an error, ignorance, compulsion, and misinterpretation. Ahlus-Sunnah checks into both the impediments and conditions before imputing kufr on a specific person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>second</strong> important matter is that imputing kufr on someone is an extremely dangerous matter. No one should indulge in takfeer, except those who are firmly established in knowledge and fulfill certain criterion. This arises from the fact that takfeer is the right of Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). Therefore, it can only be established by those who are the inheritors of the Prophets, the ulama (scholars) who make clear the ruling of Allaah and His Messenger; they are the only ones qualified. Anyone else who involves himself in takfeer is on a dark path of transgression and claims for himself a special right with Allaah. Hence, it is not permissible to make takfeer on anyone expect the one whom Allaah and His Messenger declared to be as such. Due to the seriousness of takfeer and its limits as established by Allaah and His Messenger, Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, rahimahullah, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“That is why the people of knowledge and Sunnah did not resort to making takfeer on those who opposed them, even if the opponent makes takfeer on them. This is because the matter of kufr is a legal right established by shariah, and therefore, the person can not punish by the like, just like if someone who belies you and makes lies against you, you can not spread lies about him, or if someone fornicates with members of your family, you can not fornicate with members of his family. This is because fornication and lying are haraam (unlawful) being <strong>Allaah’s right</strong>. Similarly, takfeer is a right that belongs to Allaah. Hence we do not impute kufr except on whom Allaah and His Messenger declared as such.” [Ar-Rad ‘Alal Bakri, v. 3, p. 381].</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The danger involved with takfeer is not limited to the transgression against the right of Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’ala). The person who imputes kufr on the others also risks falling into that which he accused his brother with. This is in line with the hadith of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallaam),</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Any person who calls his brother, ‘Ya Kafir (Oh Unbeliever), has in fact done an act through which this unbelief would return to one of them. If it were so as he asserted, then the kufr of the man was confirmed, but if it was untrue, it returns to him (the one who labeled it on his Muslim brother).” [Reported by Muslim and At- Tirmithi.]</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, in another narration, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If somebody accuses another of Fusuq (by calling him ‘Fasiq’ i.e. a wicked person) or accuses him of Kufr, such an accusation will revert to him (i.e. the accuser) if his companion (the accused) is innocent.” [Bukhari].</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>third</strong> important matter is that takfeer causes hate amongst people, especially amongst those who are referred to as kafir since no one likes to be labeled as a kafir. In fact, this can lead to fights and bloodshed, which will inflict evil on the individuals involved and the society at large.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, rahimahullah, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“And it is not the right of anyone to impute kufr on anyone of the Muslims even if he errs and does wrong until evidence is established upon him and the matter is made clear to him. And the one whose Islaam is affirmed with certainty then it ceases not to exist with him due to doubt. Rather his (state) of Islaam comes to an end only after the establishment of the proof and the elimination of the unclarity.” [Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, v. 12, p. 501]</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Takfeer Practiced in Our Times:</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>First</strong>, a type of takfeer practiced in our time is the unrestricted takfeer on the Muslim rulers who do not rule by the rule of Allaah. This generalization, without details, has led many of the young Muslims to conclude that it is permissible to rebel against these rulers by force. Consequently confrontations, bloodshed and other problems arising from this are still growing. Moreover, it is bringing chaos and instability to the Muslim world as it is evident to everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, this thought did not stop at the rulers but has been extended to the government employees, security forces, and others. It has also reached many imams of masajid (mosques), muadhineen (those who give adhan), and scholars. This arises from the pretext that these are all collaborators with the government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This pretext has even been extended to the Muslim society at large. Those who do not hold to the belief of these groups are considered kafir. This is not an issue in a vacuum; this is real. As such, one is not surprised as to why they kill Muslims or bomb places where there are many Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has reached the extent that these groups have called for the complete disassociation from their societies, thinking that all of the society is kafir so they can not stay with them. They even abandon their wives if they do not adhere to the same belief as the person holding the takfeer principle; similarly, if a wife holds this takfeer principle, they say it is incumbent upon her to leave her husband if he does not agree with that. Furthermore, they tell their followers not to make the congregation prayers in the mosques claiming these are not real mosques, and that the imams of these mosques are not Muslims since they were assigned by the government. This is happening in some Muslim countries.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Solution:</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The solution to this problem is to <strong>spread the knowledge of the righteous predecessors, alilm ash-shari’ saheeh (the correct knowledge of Islaam)</strong>. This comes from the knowledge taught by the reliable scholars and the books of the salaf. The young should return to the ulama to seek their advice instead of following these so-called thinkers and their takfeeri books. All of those who write advocating this methodology are not even known for being from the true ulama holding to the path of the salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Muslim societies and governments should take the <strong>corrective approach</strong> of adhering to the shar’eeah. Once this is done for the sake of Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’ala), then the promise of Allaah to bestow strength and steadfastness upon the ummah will surely be manifested.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, there should always be a <strong>hand extended to our youth who may have influenced by takfeer</strong>. There should be useful discussions in this matter and a refuting of the views held by them based on evidences and proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is anything we need to emphasize every now and then, whether regarding this matter or the understanding of Islaam as a whole, it is that people should be very serious about knowing Islaam from its two sources, the Qur’an and the way of the Rasool Allaah (Messenger of Allaah) in accordance with the understanding of the companions. This is the criteria of safety; this is the path that every Muslim should give his utmost effort to learn; this is the true safeguard mechanism for the individual and thus for the family and the society at large.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">And Advice to the Youth:</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, we all know that emotions are real, and care for Islaam is a strong motivation to its adherents. The motivation by care, sincerity, and emotion if not guided by the following of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in accordance with the way of the salaf, then it can turn into a blazing fire of destruction. Hence, a sincere advice is stressed again for all of our youth: seek knowledge from its reliable sources and from the ulama who are on the path of the companions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May Allaah the most High guide us and our Muslim youth to be on the path of righteousness and wisdom, and may Allaah, the Most High, safe guide this ummah from the fitnah of takfeer.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu az-Zubayr Harrison</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A Comparison between Those Obsessed with Takfīr &amp; Bombings and Those Who Call for Peace &amp; Well- Being1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Today, many non-Muslims have entered the Arabian Peninsula for a specific set time (jobs, etc.). And many people from this country have also begun telling them about Islam, spreading offices throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia called “Taw’iyyah al-Jāliyāt” or “Community Enlightenment” offices. This has been going on for a long time now, and because of it, many people have accepted Islam. According to a comprehensive report by the “Community Enlightenment” office in Buraidah, Qaseem (a city near Riyadh) for example, as many as fifteen thousand people entered Islam between 1407 (C.E. 1986) and the beginning of 1424 (C.E. 2003). And the completion of such people’s guidance, after Allāh guided them to Islam, is that they meet sincere and righteous callers to peace and well-being, those who teach them the understanding of the religion according to the righteous predecessors, those far removed from evil innovations and issues foreign to Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, beginning in the year 1424 (C.E. 2003), some young people in this country (Saudi Arabia) were afflicted with the trials of renouncing obedience to the leaders and government and the audacity to kill non-Muslims who’ve entered our country and were promised safety and security. They claim they are “ridding the Arabian Peninsula of the disbelievers.” By doing that, they’ve brought evil upon themselves, their religion and its people, and their nation. In the “al-Qabas al-Muwaytiyyah” newspaper (no. 11137) dated the 23rd of Rabī’ al-Ākhir, 1425 (C.E. 2004), an article by Dr. Ḥamad Ibn Ibrāhīm al-‘Uthmān was published by the title: “The Ideology of Bombing in the Spotlight”. Within this article were many statements from such misguided youth (the terrorists) that have been published on a well-known internet site. The fifth reported statement says:</span></p>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Everyone must know that if they want to make us leave our ideology, the very ideology for which we were created, with which we were commanded, because of which we’ve spilled our own blood – if they want us to leave this, then let them dig up Muhammad from his grave and let him say to us, ‘Do not expel the disbelievers from the Arabian Peninsula!’ Dig him up to tell us, ‘Do not make Jihād against the disbelievers from the Arabian Peninsula!’ Dig him up to tell us, ‘You are all sinners, extremists, terrorists! You should instead renounce  ( this and repent from it.’ Only then will we listen and obey, and only to him ”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Anyone who reflects on these statements full of utmost wickedness, the extreme, harsh- heartedness of these people becomes apparent as does their blunt, discourteous manners, and their petrified, intolerant ideology. I do not even think many of the misguided youth bent on destruction within this country would approve of such speech that calls to nothing but an evil end. These people should repent and return to guidance and pay no attention to the likes of such vile statements that only show the filth, evil, meanness and shamelessness of whoever said it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The following is a summarized comparison between the actions of these misguided youth and the actions of sincere callers to peace and righteousness:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided youth accept and approve of disbelief from a nonbeliever and therefore rush him to the Fire (by killing him). They bring him out of darkness into darkness, from torture to torture. As for the sincere callers to well-being, they work to bring a nonbeliever out of darkness and into light, so that he may triumph, thereby gaining happiness and contentment in this life and the next.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided youth, by killing a nonbeliever (residing in this land) send him back to his family in a coffin so that they may be filled with hatred and resentment towards Islam and Muslims, so they may attribute to Islam what it is actually free and innocent of – all because of these misguided people. As for the sincere callers to righteousness, by inviting others to Islam, a person may return to his family as a Muslim. He becomes a member of Islam, inviting his own family and others to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided youth subject themselves to the punishment reported in the statement  of the Prophet</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Whoever kills a Muā’hid (a non-Muslim promised safety) will not even smell the fragrance of paradise even though its scent can be smelled from forty years away.”2</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As for the sincere callers, by their invitation (to Islam), they hope for rewards  promised in the statement of the Prophet</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Whoever calls to guidance, there is for him a reward for anyone who follows him without diminishing their own rewards at all.”3</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 3">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided ones, their family and relatives live in grief, distress, worry, and sadness; they regret the condition of their wicked children. The sincere callers, their family and relatives live in happiness, delight, and approval with the condition of their noble children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided ones, by their disgraceful actions, prevent people from entering Islam, damaging the reputation of the pure monotheistic religion. The sincere callers, by</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">their noble actions and their enthusiasm for Islam, work to bring nonbelievers out of darkness and into light.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided youth are a threatened people by Allāh’s statement: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>إنَّ اللّهَ َلا ُي ْصِلحُ َعمَ َل الْمُفْسِدِين </strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Certainly, Allāh does not amend the work of corruptors.[Sūrah Yūnus, 10:81]</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4"></div>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5; color: #000000;"> The misguided people were not even able to perform Jihād against their own (evil) inclinations. And they ruined themselves and others in that they’ve fallen into a form of corruption they call “Jihād”. As for the sincere callers, they perform Jihād against their own inclinations and perform a form of Jihād (struggle) with others by inviting them to Islam.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided ones, by their horrible actions, become keys opening the doors to evil, locking the doors to all good. The sincere callers, by their noble actions, become keys opening the doors to all good, locking the doors to evil. In “Sunan Ibn Mājah” Anas said that Allāh’s Messenger said:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Certainly, among people are those who are keys to (the doors of) good, locking (the doors of) evil. And certainly, among people are those who are keys to (the doors of) evil, locking (the doors of) good. So, Ṭūbá (a rewarding tree in paradise) is for whomever Allāh places the keys to good upon his hands, and woe (beware or a pit in Hell) to those Allāh places the keys to evil upon his hands.”4</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And the sincere callers are a promised people by Allāh’s statement:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ينِِإَّنا َلا نُضِيعُ َأجْرَ الْمُ ْصلِح </strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Certainly, We will not allow to be lost the reward of the good-doers. [Sūrah Al-‘Arāf, 7:170]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> The misguided ones can expect a portion of what’s come in the prophet’s statement</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Whoever rebels against my nation, killing both the righteous and wicked (indiscriminately), not even sparing the devout believers, and not fulfilling the obligation towards those given a pledge (of security) – then he is not from me and I am not from him.”5</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And the sincere callers can expect a portion of what’s come in the prophet’s statement </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There are three traits a Muslim’s heart never resents: sincerity in doing actions for Allāh, offering sincere advise to those in authority, and sticking to the mainstream community (of Muslims) because certainly their supplication encompasses all around them.”6</em></span></p>
