				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this article we wish to present the verification of the famous ḥadīth of “Prophetic Khilāfah will be for 30 years” so that the general people are aware of it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Dawūd as-Sijastānī in his Kitāb as-Sunan 2/290 Kitāb as-Sunnah, Bāb Fil-Khulāfa no.4646), Imām Abū Eesā Tirmidhī in Kitāb as-Sunan 2/46, Abwāb al-Fitan Bāb Mā Jā Fil Khilāfah no.2226), Imām Abū ʿAbdur Rahman Nasā’ī in Kitāb as-Sunan al-Kubrā 5/47 no.8155, Kitāb al-Manāqib Bāb 5, Imām Abū Ḥātim bin Ḥibbān Bastī in as-Ṣaḥīḥ (al-Ehsān no.6623, 6904, Mawārid az-Zamān no.1534,1535 and many other scholars of ḥadīth via various chains from Saʿīd bin Jamhān from Safīnah Abū ʿAbdir Rahman the servant of the Messenger of Allāh narrates</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Messenger of Allāh said “The Prophetic khilāfah will remain for 30 years and the Allāh will give power to whom He Wills. Saʿīd said Safīnah said to me “count the years, 2 years of Abū Bakr and 10 years of Umar and 12 years of Uthmān and Alī so on (i.e. 6 years). Saʿīd said “I said to Safīnah these people say that Alee was not a khalīfah to which he replied “The backs of Banū Zarqā and Banū Marwān have lied.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the wording of Abū Dawūd which differs slightly from the others  however the meaning is the same.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Ḥadīth Imām Tirmidhī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth is Ḥasan.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Ḥadīth of Safīnah concerning the Khilāfah is authentic and it is my position regarding the Khulāfa.”</em> [Jāmʿe Bayān al-ʿIlm Wa Faḍilihi [2/225], see also Kitāb as-Sunnah of ʿAbdullāh bin Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal [2/590 no.1400]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Abī ʿĀṣim said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth in terms of being written is </em><em>established. Saʿīd bin Jamhān narrates from Ḥamād bin Salamah, a-ʿĀwām bin Ḥaushab and Ḥashraj (bin Nabātah)”</em> [Kitāb as-Sunnah [2/549-550 no.1181,1185]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Ibn Taymīyyah has also graded this narration to be authentic [as-Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/744] of Shaikh al-Albānī]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ḥākim also graded it authentic [al-Mustadrak [3/71]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The narrator Saʿīd bin Jamhān was declared to be trustworthy Imam Yaḥya bin Maʿīn, Imam Nasā’ī, Imam Ibn Ḥibbān and Imam Aḥmad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abū Dawūd also declared him to be trustworthy</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdīyy said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“According to me there is no harm in him”</em> [Tahdhīb ut-Tahdhīb [1/14]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ḥāfiẓ Dhahabī said</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Truthful from the middle (level of narrator).</em>” [al-Kāshif [1/282].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Truthful individual”</em> [Taqrīb ut-Tahdhīb no.2279]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In contrary to these Imāms, Imām Abū Ḥātim ar-Rāzī said, <em>“Write his ḥadīth but he cannot be used evidence.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This criticism is rejected due to a number of reasons:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] This opposes the praise of the majority</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] Zailaʿī’s Naṣb ur-Rāyah mentions [2/439]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abū Ḥātim’s saying “He is not evidence” is not harmful because he has not mentioned the reason for this criticism, he has used these words for many of the trustworthy and established narrators of the authentic books of ḥadīth without mentioning the reason, e.g. Khālid al-Ḥada and others, and Allāh knows best.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Dhahabī said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When Abū Ḥātim declares someone to be trustworthy, then hold onto it because he only declares someone trustworthy who is in the Ṣaḥīḥ Ḥadīth. Similarly when he declares someone to be weak or if he he says “he cannot be used as evidence” then hold back until you know what others have said. If someone says they were trustworthy then do not take Abū Ḥatīms criticism as he was firm with regards to the narrators. He has said about a group of narrators from the Ṣaḥīḥs they were not evidence and not strong and other similar statements.”</em> [Siyar Āʿlām an-Nabūla [3/260]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence this criticism is rejected.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Some scholars have alleged Imām Abū Ḥātim was harsh hence his statement is rejected compared to Imām Aḥmad bin Ḥanbals statement who was balanced and investigative.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Sājī&#8217;s statement, <em>&#8220;His Ḥadīth have no supports.&#8221;</em> Is also general and it is rejected because it is not detailed neither is it severe jarḥ. When someone’s honesty is established not being supported does not affect him. As it has already been established that Saʿīd bin Jamhān is trustworthy with definitive evidences, him being alone in reporting this Ḥadīth does not affect it it anyway.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Deceit of the Ḥadīth Rejecters.</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The real aim and objective of the Ḥadīth rejecters through their deceitful plots and treachery it to show the authentic Ḥadīth of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) are fabricated. This is to lead the general Muslims away from the fundamentals of the dīn and to create doubts so that the people begin to think the dīn as unreliable and then they eventually stray from the straight path.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With this they then want to express and impose their deficient opinions amongst the people, which will eventually lead to no one acting on the Qurān or Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One person from amongst the rejecters and deniers of Ḥadīth is Tamannā ʿAmādī Phalwārī, he writes in his fabrication of a book, &#8216;Intizār Mahdī Masīh&#8217; [Awaiting The Mahdī Messiah] whilst vilifying and rebuking this very same Hadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;You have seen the name of Ḥashraj bin Nabātah Al-Kūfi with regards to these narrations. He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl, he is not evidence and rejected in Ḥadīth and you do not generally find any supports for his Hadīth.&#8221;</em> [pg.57]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like to say regarding Hashraj bin Nabātah Imām Ahmad said, <em>&#8220;Trustworthy.&#8221;</em> And Ibn Ma&#8217;īn said, <em>&#8220;Good, trustworthy and there is no harm in him.&#8221; </em>Abū Zurʿah said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him and he is grounded in Ḥadīth.&#8221;</em> Ibn ʿAdīyy said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him.&#8221;</em> Tirmidhī graded his Ḥadīth Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the other hand Abū Ḥatīm said, <em>&#8220;Good write his Ḥadīth but he is not used as evidence.&#8221;</em> as-Sājī said, <em>&#8220;Weak.&#8221;</em> Ibn Ḥibbān said, <em>&#8220;He has a few Ḥadīth, his narrations are rejected and it is impermissible to use his reports as evidence when he is alone in reporting them.&#8221;</em> Nasā‘ī said he is not strong and criticised him another time he said there is not harm in him and praised him. [Summarised from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥākim and Dhahabī authenticated one of his Ḥadīth. [Mustadrak [3/606], ʿAlī (I think Ibn Al-Madīnī) also declared him to be trustworthy [Mizān Al-‘Eitidāl [1/551]. Hāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr said, <em>&#8220;Truthful but errs.&#8221;</em> [Taqrīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The conclusion is, this narrator is trustworthy and truthful according to the majority of the scholars of Ḥadīth. Hence, Tamannā ʿAmādī is a liar in his claim that, <em>&#8221; He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are so many lies in Tamannā ʿĀmādī’s book that a collation of them would result in a book. For example in the same book on [pg.54] this individual writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Muʿammar bin Rāshid of Yemen was a freed slave who died in the year 154H. He was active in compiling and collating Ḥadīth, he would narrate from the well known liar Ābān bin ʿAbbās. Whilst narrating from him he would put forward the name of Thābit al-Banānī instead [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101] yet the scholars of Ḥadīth still considered him to be trustworthy.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say let us look at the referenced page from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb and it clearly says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Khalīlī has transmitted in in al-Irshād with an authentic chain from Aḥmad that he said to Yaḥya ibn Maʿīn when he was copying the manuscript of ʿAbdur Razzāq from Muʿammar from Ābān, “You are writing this when you know Ābān is a liar?” He (Ibn Maʿīn) replied, “May Allāh have mercy on you Oh Abū ʿAbdullāh, I am writing it in order to memorise it so that when a liar (like Tamannā ʿĀmādī) narrates on Muʿammar from Thābit from Anas, I will say to them you have lied the chain is via Ābān (and not Thābit).”</em> [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask the readers now, why is Muʿammar to blame here and what is his fault? What he heard he narrated it in the same way, when he heard from Ābān he would say Ābān and when he heard from Thābit he would say Thābit. If he scholar of Ḥadīth do not consider him to be trustworthy what should they consider him (meaning he was honest)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of Tamannā ʿĀmādī are liars whose tongues and pens are free, if they want to, they can try to prove the day as night and night as day but they must remember a day will come when there will most definitely be punishment. On that day one will be taken to account for every deed big or small.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this was the research into the correct position of Ḥashraj bin Nabātah, it must be remembered here that he is not alone in reporting the Ḥadīth, rather the following individuals support him</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] ʿAbd al-Wārith [Abū Dawūd no.4646]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] al-ʿAwām bin Ḥūwshab [Abū Dawūd no.4647]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Ḥamād bin Salamah [Musnad Aḥmad [5/220-221]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus the criticism against Ḥashraj is rejected from every angle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islām Ibn Taymīyyah said concerning this Ḥadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth is well known from the narrations of Ḥamād bin Salamah, ʿAbd al-Wārith bin Saʿīd and al-ʿAwām bin Ḥūwshab and others on the authority of Saʿīd bin Jamhān. Imām Aḥmad relied on this narration for evidence for the Khilāfah of the four Khulāfa ar-Rāshidīn and he also authenticated it. He would also use it as evidence against those people who would remain silent with regards to the Khilāfah of ʿAlī as the people began to differ. To the extent that Aḥmad said, “Whoever does not consider ʿAlī as the fourth Khulāfa is more astray than is domestic donkey.” He also forbade in establishing wedlock with such people. This issue is agreed upon by the jurists, scholars of the Sunnah, the people of knowledge and insight and the righteous people, this is also the position ie madhab of the general people. Some of the people of desires have opposed them in this, from them are the people of theological rhetoric and like them the Rāfidah who rebuke and censure the first three Khalīphs. Likewise, the Khawārij who abuse the Khilāfah of two son in laws ie Uthmān and ʿAlī (of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) or like some of the Nāṣibīs who attack the Khilāfah of ʿAli or like some of the ignorant ones upon the Sunnah who remain silent of the Khilāfah (of ʿAlī)”</em> [Majmūʿa Fatāwa [35/18-19]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The following scholars graded the Ḥadīth to be authentic and strong,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] at-Tirmidhī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Ibn Jarīr at-Ṭabarī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4] Ibn Abī ʿĀsim</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5] Ibn Ḥibbān</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6] al-Ḥākim</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7] Ibn Taymīyyah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8] ad-Dhahabī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9] Ibn Ḥajr al-ʿAsqalānī (Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/745 no.459] All praise be to Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some scholars have mentioned two supporting narrations for this Ḥadīth</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[1] On the authority of Abī Bakra (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) as transmitted by Baihaqī in Dalail an-Nabūwwah [6/342] the chain is weak due to ʿAlī bin Zaid bin Jadʿān</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[2] On the authority of Jābir bin ʿAbdullāh (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) [al-Wāhidī in al-Wasīṭ cited from as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/745] and its chain is weak.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Benefit</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the later people claim this Ḥadīth of Safīnah opposes the Ḥadīth of Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim which Jābir bin Samurah (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) narrates from the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This affair will not cease until there are 12 Khalīphs…. And all of them will be from the Quraish.”</em> [Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, Kitāb al-Imārah, Bāb an-Nās Tabʿa Li-Quraish Wa Khilāfah Fil Quraish [no.1821] and its origin is in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī [no.7222-7223]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is lack of knowledge on the part of the claimants because both authentic Ḥadīth can be reconciled. The Ḥadīth of Safīnah refers to the Khilāfah of the Khulāfa Rāshidīn and the Khilāfah on the Prophetic Manhaj and the Ḥadīth of Jābir refers to the unrestricted Khilāfah. Thus the first Ḥadīth restricts and negates any more years than the 30 years of the Khilāfah of the Khulāfa ar-Rāshidīn and the second Ḥadīth establishes the Khilāfah of the non Rāshidīn hence there is contradiction between the two Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr has alluded to this reconciliation in Fath al-Bārī [13/212 under Ḥadīth no.7223] as well as Hāfiẓ Ibn Taymīyyah in Majmūʿa Fatāwa. This is what is correct and for further details refer to Shaikh Muḥammad Nāṣir ud Dīn al-Albānī’s book Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/742-749 no.459] as he has discussed this issue in great detail.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Zubair ʿAlī Zai</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ahlul Bayt Refuting the Koofee Rafidhah Shee’ah – What Really Happened At Karbala – Who Was Responsible (b)</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) whilst supplicating against the Rafidhah shee’ah said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Oh Allaah if you keep these people alive then divide them into more sects and separate their paths and do not make their leaders happy with them. These people called me (to Koofah) and told me they would help me but they just showed hostility and enmity towards me and also killed me.”</em> (al-Irshaad <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.231</span> of al-Mufeed Shee’ah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence in this regard Sayyid Muhsin al-Ameen said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“20,000 people from Iraaq gave Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) pledge of allegiance (via letters and on the hand of Muslim Ibn Aqeel) and then they betrayed and deceived him and then came out in the open opposing him (at Karbala). Their pledge of allegiances are around their necks because they killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu).”</em> (A’ayaan ash-Shee’ah Part 1, <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.34</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zain ul-Aabideen said to the people of Koofah, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Are you unaware that you yourselves wrote letters to my father and then you treacherously betrayed him whereas you people had vehemently promised your pledge of allegiance. You people fought with him and defeated him. So then, now tell me with what face do you look at the Household of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallaahu Alayhee Wasallam)? So that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallaahu Alayhee Wasallam) can say to you that you are the people that brutally killed my family and attacked my honour and dignity, you people (ie Rafidhah Shee’ah) are not from my Ummah.”</em> (al-Ehtijaaj 2/32 of Shee’ah Tabrasee)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“These people are crying over us now, but who other than them killed us.” </em>(al-Ehtijaaj 2/29 of Tabarasee Rafidhah Shee’ah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fatima Sughra said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Oh People of Koofah (ie Rafidhah Shee’ah), oh you deceivers, you treacherous arrogant people, Allaah has tested you with our affair ie the Ahlul Bayt and he also tested us. Did we not pass this test? You people lied to us, disrespected us, believed it was permissible to kill us, you considered our wealth to be lawful. You also did this to our forefathers and your swords are still bloodied with the blood of Ahlul Bayt. May Allaah destroy you, wait for his punishment and curse as this has become obligatory upon you. You will begin fighting with one another as a form of punishment and you will continue to be punished with severe torment until the day of judgement for oppressing us, beware as the curse of Allaah is upon the oppressors. May you people be destroyed, you people betrayed Alee bin Abee Taalib (RadhiAllaah Anhu), you betrayed my grandfather, his sons and this righteous household.” The people of Koofah heard this and said, “Yes! We killed Alee and both of his sons with our swords and spears, we captivated their women and we severely wounded them.”</em> (al-Ehtijaaj 2/28)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zainab, The daughter of Alee (RadhiAllaah Anhu) said to the treacherous people of Koofah, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Oh you people of Koofah, you are a group of coward treacherous people your example is like that woman who cut her meat and separated it into different parts. What do you people have other than lying, having animosity and enmity for us. You (ie Rafidhah Shee’ah) thought it was easy and cheap to kill the children of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallaahu Alayhee Wasallam)”</em> (al-Ehtijaaj 2/29-30)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Matters related to the Sahabah Fatwa no. 1466<span id="more-1220"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Question:</strong></span>  Many Turkish Muslims continually revile Mu`awiyyah and his son Yazid. Are they correct in doing this or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Regarding Mu`awiyyah (may Allah be pleased with him), he was one of the Prophet’s Sahabah (Companions) and one of the scribes who wrote down the Revelation. The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were the best Mu’mins (believers). There are many reported prohibitions against reviling or cursing them. It is authentically reported in the two “Sahih (Books of Authentic Hadith)” that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “The best people are my generation, then those who follow them, and then those who follow them.” It is also authentically reported that he (peace be upon him) said, “Do not curse my Sahabah, because if any of you spent gold equal to (Mount) Uhud (in Allah’s Cause), it would not be equal to a Mud (a dry measure of half bushel, 543 grams) or even a half Mud of one of them.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has been related with a good Sanad (chain of narrators) concerning Mu`awiyyah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “O Allah! Teach him (the knowledge of) the Book, reckoning, and protect him from an evil punishment.” This was mentioned by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As this is known, the basic `Aqidah (creed) of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community) with regard to the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) includes the following:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Firstly: Anyone cursing a Sahaby (Companion) of the Prophet (peace be upon him), whether Mu`awiyyah or another (may Allah be pleased with them), deserves a severe punishment. This is agreed upon by Muslim scholars, but they differ whether they should be killed or receive a less severe penalty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Secondly: The hearts and tongues of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah are free of any hatred towards the Sahabah, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: And those who came after them say: “Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful. Thirdly: Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah believe that some of the Athar (narrations from the Companions) that are reported concerning their shortcomings are</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">lies, others have been exposed to additions, subtractions, and alterations in their texts. The fact is that the Sahabah are excused if these narrations are true, as they were Mujtahids (scholars qualified to exercise juristic effort to infer expert legal rulings), who, if they were correct in their Ijtihad (juristic effort to infer expert legal rulings) will receive two rewards, and if they were wrong they will be rewarded for their Ijtihad and forgiven for their mistakes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah do not believe that the Sahabah were infallible as far as major and minor sins are concerned, rather they were liable to commit sins and will be held accountable for them, but due to their preceding good deeds and virtues they will be forgiven for things that later generations will not. During the Reckoning, some of their sins will be erased in a way that will not happen for those after them. It has been authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that they were the best generation, and that a Mud or half a Mud given in charity by them is better than a mountain of gold given by others, as was explained previously.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If any of the Sahabah committed a sin, they may have performed Tawbah (repentance to Allah) from it, performed good deeds that erased it, and they will be forgiven due to their preceding merits, through the intercession of Muhammad (peace be upon him), as they were the most deserving to receive it, or they may have been inflicted with a disaster in this world that expiated their sins. This is in regard to the sins that they actually committed, so what will be the case when it comes to matters of Ijtihad? If they were correct they will receive two rewards, and if they got it wrong they will be rewarded for their Ijtihad and forgiven for their mistakes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">But the degree of abhorrence that will be felt regarding any of their sins will be minimal next to their virtues and merits, from their belief in Allah and His Messenger, their Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah), their Hijrah (migration) with and support of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and their beneficial knowledge and good deeds. Fourthly: Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah speaks moderately about matters related to the Sahabah;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">they refrain from talking about the disputes that occurred among them, and do not say that one group is infallible and another is sinful, other than in relation to those who made innovations in the religion, such as the Shi`ah (Shi’ites) and Khawarij (separatist group that believes committing a major sin amounts to disbelief). They exceeded the limits in opposite extremes in terms of infallibity and sins. Between them they produced the Bid`ah (innovations in religion) that was cursed by the Salaf (righteous predecessors), and they declared them to be Fasiqs (those flagrantly violating Islamic law) and Kafirs (disbelievers), except for a few, in the same way Khawarij regarded both `Aly and `Uthman as Kafirs and deemed it lawful to fight them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They were the group about which the Prophet said, “In time a group will secede from the Muslims and the group that is nearer to the Truth will kill them.” They were the group that killed `Aly after they had deserted him and declared all those who followed him as Kafirs. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said with regard to Al-Hasan ibn `Aly: “This son of mine is a Sayyid (i.e. a noble) and may Allah make peace between two big groups of Muslims through him.” And indeed, he did reconcile between the followers of `Aly and Mu`awiyyah, which shows that he did what Allah and His Messenger loved, and that the two groups were not like the Khawarij, whom the Messenger of Allah commanded to be fought. This was why `Aly was happy to fight the Khawarij, and was grieved and pained about the Battles of Siffin and Al-Jamal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The two groups have therefore to be freed from the charge of Kufr and Allah should be supplicated to be merciful with their dead, as this matter is agreed upon. All those who belonged to those two groups were Mu’mins (believers) and the Qur’an attests to the fact that those who fought were</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">believers, and it did not take them out of Islam. Allah (Exalted be He) says: And if two parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both. The Hadith that states that if two caliphs fought and one of them is cursed, is false and fabricated, as it is not reported by any of the Hadith scholars. Mu`awiyyah did not claim the caliphate for himself and the Ba`yah (pledge of allegiance) was not made to him when he was fighting against `Aly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He did not fight `Aly because he considered himself to be the rightful caliph or that he thought he deserved to be. Neither he nor his supporters wanted to initiate a fight with `Aly, it was only when `Aly told them to swear allegiance and obedience to him, so there would not be two caliphs, that they refused their obedience. It was then that `Aly had no alternative but to fight them, to force them to obey him and maintain the Muslim community, as Mu`awiyyah and his supporters were saying that this was not obligatory on them until `Uthman’s (may Allah be pleased with him) rights had been taken from those in `Aly’s army who had rebelled and killed him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Yazid ibn Mu`awiyyah, the people differed concerning him, and they split into three groups, two extreme and one moderate. One of them was that he was one of the Muslim rulers, who did good deeds and bad ones. He was not born until the caliphate of `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him). He was not a Kafir, but it was due to him that the death of Husayn occurred, and what happened to the people of Al-Harrah. He was not a Sahaby, nor was he one of the `Awliya (pious people). This is the view held by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him), the general opinion of most of the intelligent</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and knowledge people, and the view of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah. As for cursing him, people are equally split on this into three groups: One that cursed him, another that loved him, and a third that neither cursed nor loved him. Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him) said, “This is what was reported from Imam Ahmad, his fair-minded followers, and others from the Muslim community.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This moderate opinion is based on the fact that his Fisq (flagrant violation of Islamic law) was not established in a way that makes cursing him permissible, or that the specified Fasiq (one flagrantly violating Islamic law) is not entitled to be cursed, whether due to a prohibition or out of respect. It has been authentically reported in “Sahih Al-Bukhari”, on the authority of `Umar – in the story about `Abdullah ibn Himar, who regularly drank Khamr (intoxicants) and was whipped for it by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) – that when some of the Sahabah cursed him, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Do not curse him, as he loves Allah and His Messenger.” He (peace be upon him) also said, “Cursing a Mu’min is like killing them.” (Agreed upon by Muslim and Al-Bukhari).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These texts, as the other that include warnings are general, such as those concerning consuming orphans’ wealth unlawfully, Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage), and theft, are not to be taken as proof that the person concerned will be one of the dwellers in the Fire, due to the possibility of the absence of binding conditions for a predominating reason. This reason may be due to Tawbah (repentance to Allah), good deeds, expiating circumstances, an accepted intercession, or any other cause for expiation of sins. All the above reasons make it prohibited to curse him, but as for not loving Yazid, because he did not perform the good deeds that necessitate loving him, and accordingly, he was one of the Muslim rulers,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">but loving this type of person is not lawful, because he performed actions that testified to his Fisq and injustice and these are evident from his biography and in the matters related to Husayn and the people of Al-Harrah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Rafidhah Shee’ah are famous to promote and boldly attest to their love and affiliation with the Ahlul Bayt.<span id="more-1205"></span> The Madhab of the Rafidhah Shee’ah is established on the essence of the Ahlul Bayt and their love, friendship, hatred and animosity for anyone is based on the Ahlul Bayt, the Ahlul Bayt are their criteri</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is on this basis they hate the companions more so the 3 rightly guided Khulapha (May Allaah be pleased with them), all the Rafidhah Shee’ah from amongst the men, women, teenagers, old and young all hate our companions (May Allaah Guide those who hate our companions. Ameen) because in their narrow bigoted minds they think the companions oppressed the Ahlul Bayt, killed and dishonoured them. These are obviously all lies and fallacies but lying with the Rafidhah Shee’ah has no bounds or limit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However looking whilst looking deeper in to the books of the Rafidhah Shee’ah they show and prove the Rafidhah Shee’ah actually really deep down hate and have enmity for the Ahlul Bayt and this also ties with our opinion that the Rafidhah Shee’ah are the ones who really unjustly killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and the Ahlul Bayt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So from the books of the Rafidhah Shee’ah we have</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If I were to mention a characteristic of the Shee’ah then it is that they just like to talk, if I was to coerce them into a trials or tribulations they would become murtad (ie apostate) and if I wanted to test their sacrifice (ie with their lives) then not even one from amongst a thousand (1000) would be able to fulfil this.”</em> (al-Kaafee, ar-Raudah 8/338)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Oh you wannabe men who imitate men, oh you who have the intelligence of children and oh you, you group of opinionated entertainers, I wish I had never seen you people nor had any acquaintance with you. I swear by Allaah you have afflicted and depressed me, may Allaah destroy and ruin you. You have saddened my heart and filled my chest with sorrow and grief. You have always shown me enmity and always opposed and failed by advice and plans at every instance based on your continuous disobedience and cowardliness. To the extent that people from amongst the Quraish are saying Abee Taalibs son (ie himself ie Alee) is a brave person but he has no experience or expertise in war but in reality there is no goodness in the opinion or plans of such person who is not obeyed.”</em> (Nahj al-Balagha <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.70-71</span>)      </span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) further said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“They are deaf besides having ears, speechless besides having a tongue, blind besides having eyes, they meet people without love and sincerity. They are people who not help other people at times of need, you people abandoned Ibn Abee Taalib (ie himself ie Alee RadhiAllaahu Anhu) in times when he needed their help just as menstruation flesh leaves a woman.”</em> (Nahj al-Balagha <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.132</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people are the very same people who killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), these Koofee Rafidhah Shee’ah who in this current era shift blame from themselves to the so called Yazeedee group, when in reality it is an established fact based on narrations and reports from Shee’ah books that the koofee Rafidhah Shee’ah themselves killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu). What is further interesting ins the people who allege the koofee Rafidhah Shee’ah killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and the Ahlul Bayt are the surviving members of Ahlul Bayt them themselves quoted in the own books of the Rafidhah Shee’ah!!!!!! (Refer to the Part 8)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is also the reason why other Rafidhah Shee’ah authors have elucidated further to this fact and it must be known to the dear reader there is no bigotry or staunchness from our part, we are merely reproducing statements from Rafidhah Shee’ah books and authors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hasan (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I swear by Allaah I find Mu’awiyyah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) much better than these people who attribute themselves to my group (ie Rafidhah Shee’ah), they tried to kill me, confiscated my wealth, It is better that my family are safe that these people kill me and my Ahlul Bayt are spared. I swear by Allaah if I had fought Mu’awiyyah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) these people (ie Rafidhah Shee’ah) would have captured me and wringed my neck, therefore I consider a life of reconciliation much better than being captured deceptively and being killed.”</em> (al-Ehtijaaj 2/10 of Tabarasee Shee’ah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Baaqir (Rahimahullah) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If you people become our Shee’ah (became our group) then one third 1/3 of them would stabs us in the back and another part them would be a group of stupid foolish people.”</em> (Rijaal Kashee <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.79</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ja’afar Saadiq (Rahimahullah) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If there were not three people from amongst you who do not hide what I say then I would not even consider it permissible for them to even hide one thing.”</em> (Usool al-Kaafee 1/396)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the above statements show what the members of Ahlul Bayt really thought of these koofee Rafidhah Shee’ah, their morals, their integrity, their disloyalty and their deceptive treacherous nature.</span></p>
