<h5 align="center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, no long introductions straight to the point. 6 scholars &#8211; 3 fathers and 3 sons who spent decades upon calling to Tawhid and Sunnah, teaching hadith, reprimanding Madhhabism and the associated bigoted taqlid. If anything take the benefit of nurturing your children on the pure pristine Salafi Manhaj and keep away from blind fanaticism of madhhabs and take evidence when it comes to you. Same people who fall prey to technical fiqhi buzz words and think they have a defence!</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[1] Shaikh al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Muhammad Sa&#8217;id Muhaddith Banarasi</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was born in a sikh household in 1274H and died in 1322H/1904CE. He was born as Mawl Singh in Gujrat and his father’s name was Karak Singh. He was a sikh and converted to Islam. He first sought knowledge in Deoband but later became Ahlul Hadith and eventually studied with major Salafi Ahlul Mashaykh like Shaykh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi who he studied hadith and tafsir with as well as Shaykh Abdullah Ghazipuri and Shaykh Muhammad Ibrahim Arawi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then went to the Banaras (Varanasi) the holiest city of the idol worshippers and set up Madrasah Sa&#8217;idiyyah in 1297H and taught for a few decades until he died. He also set up a printing press called Matba&#8217;a Sa&#8217;idiyyah and printed thousands of pages of amazing books that promoted the Madhhab of Ahlul Hadith and Salafis and refuted the bigoted Madhhabists</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From Sikhism to establishing a Salafi Madrasah built upon Tawhid and Sunnah in the holiest place of the idol worshiping Hindus and a phenomenal printing press.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaykh Abdur Rahman al-Faryawa&#8217;i said about him, <em>&#8220;He had numerous works and treatises most of which were fierce and vehement refutations of the muta’ssub Madhhabists and the bigoted staunch Muqallidin he also had a book on Fatawa in 2 parts.&#8221;</em> (al-Harakatus Salafiyyyah wa Dawriha Fi Ihya as-Sunnah (p.44)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He died in 1322H/1904CE. He had a son, who he nurtured on the Quran and Sunnah with care, affection and diligence and he was,</p>

Muhsin Ansari.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He began teaching in his father&#8217;s Madrasah Sa&#8217;idiyyah where he taught Bukhari and Muslim 30 times (each) during his life. He spend his life defending and spreading hadith. When a Hanafi bigoted muqallid wrote a book called <em>&#8220;Jarh Alal Bukhari&#8221;</em> and 6-7 other books criticising and disparaging Sahih al-Bukhari and hadith in general. Shaykh Abul Qasim Sayf Banarasi answered and refuted all of them in overwhelming detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He defended and spread the Madhhab of Ahlul Hadith and Salafis through his numerous works. He was a prolific author and wrote books in Arabic and Urdu which number more than 65. Some of them include,</p>
