				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Jalal al-Din Ahmad Hashimi Ja’fari Banarasi (d.1279/1863)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was born in 1221H/1806 and hailed from the surrounding area of Banaras. He was born into a family of learned scholars and his father Shaykh Abdul A’la (d.1274) was also a learned man. A year after the Shaykh’s birth his mother passed away. His lineage as an Hashmite can be traced back. (Tazkirrah al-A’la, 3)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He sought knowledge from his father and also from Shaykh Ahmadullah Muhaddith Banarasi. He then travelled to Delhi and sought knowledge from the scholars, which included the well known scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith, Shaykh Shah Muhammad Isma’il Shahid (InshaAllah) (d.1246/1831) and Shaykh Abd al-Haq Muhaddith Banarasi (d.1286/1869). He studied important texts as well as the books of hadith with the aforementioned scholars of hadith and also received his ijazah from them. It was these two scholars who instilled the love of Amal bil-Hadith and following of the Sunnah in him. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 345)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Abd al-Hayy al-Hasani said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He received sanad in hadith from Shaykh Abd al-Haqq bin Fadhalullah al-Uthmani al-Niyutayni and he followed his way in rejecting taqlid and acting on the apparent texts. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir, 7:136)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had a powerful memory, as such that he would memorise a Juzz during the day in Ramadhan and then recite it in the evening in Tarawih. He also participated in the 1857 mutiny war but evaded capture. (Tazkirrah Ulama Hindh, 41; Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 346; Marqa’a Banaras, 244).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Despite being a scholar of the Din, he was an exceptional debater. He was a defender of the Sunnah and subdued innovations, and as such he didn’t tolerate anything contradicting the Sunnah. He debated with Mawlana Khurram Ali on the issue of reciting Fatihah behind the Imam and also authored the book, Fatihah al-Sawab Fi Qir’ah Fatihah al-Kitab in 1256H, which he translated into Urdu as, Zubdah al-Bab. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 345).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also authored, Zubdah al-Qawanin, Inbasat Ibarah al-Kafiyyah bil-Bayan al-Shafiyyah, Farahing Ikhwan al-Safa, Qawa’id Urdu, al-Qawl al-Mansur, Rakah Tarawih. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 346).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This outstanding scholar of the Ahl al-Hadith died in 1279H/1863CE.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(See, Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 345+; Tazkirrah al-A’la, 3+; Tazkirrah Ulama Hindh, 41; Marqa’a Banaras, 244; Tarajim Ulama Hadith Banaras, 71)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the existence of a remarkable scholar of the Ahl al-Hadith who died over 150 years ago, which again repudiates the tedious claim that the Ahl al-Hadith have only been around for 100 years. Likewise, it also answers the modern day understanding that Salafiyyah is a movement that started in the early 1900’s by Shaykh Muhammad Rashid Ridha and Muhammad Abduh, when we clearly have a scholar of the Ahl al-Hadith who died in the middle 19<sup>th</sup> century.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[9] Taqwiyatul Iman</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Allamah Shah Muhammad Isma’il (1246H)</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shirk Will Never Be Forgiven. </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<h3></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Third Chapter</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Evilness of Shirk</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shirk (Polytheism) Will Never Be Forgiven</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The First Sub-chapter in saving oneself from Shirk, meaning that this chapter is a summary of the evilness of Shirk</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Verily! Allah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners in worship with Him, but He forgives whom He pleases, sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, has indeed strayed far away (Surah an-Nisa:l16)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the ways of straying from path of Allah Is not to differentiate between the permissible and impermissible, being involved in stealing and fornication, abandoning the prayer and fasting, neglecting the rights of the wife and children and disrespecting ones parents. However the one who is engrossed in Shirk is the most naivest of individuals because he has involved himself in such a great and tremendous sin that Allah will never forgive it, however, Allah may even forgive all of his other sins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This, we find from this ayah that shirk will never be forgiven and the punishment that is decreed for it will be surely direly incumbent. If the shirk is extreme (ie major) such that it leads a person to be a disbeliever, he will be punished such that he will remain if the fire of Hell forever, he will never leave it and nor will he ever experience any comfort therein.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Note of clarity the Imam here means and is referring to Shirk Akbar and Shirk Asghar, however the ayah is clear and no matter what level the shirk is, the punishment will remain the same as per the verse, this is the explanation of Shaikh Ataullah Hanif Bhojiyani)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the shirk that is of a lesser level (ie minor shirk) he will be punished according to that which Allah has decreed. With regards to other sins, some of the punishments have already been ordained by Allah, hence the affair is with Allah, whether he choses to punish or to forgive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Taqwiyatul Iman (pg.34)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[8] Tanwir ul-Aynain Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Allamah Shah Muhammad Isma’il (1246H)</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Bigoted Staunch Taqlid and Blind Following of the Imams Over Authentic Texts</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh, the Imaam al-Allamah Muhammad Isma’il said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Chapter Exaggeration in Taqlid and Ta’assub (bigotry).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">People have exaggerated a lot in the taqlid of one particular individual and have made rigid bigotry obligatory upon themselves to the extent that they have prohibited an individual from performing ijtihad and from doing taqlid of other Imams. And this is that non-curable illness which destroyed the shi’ahs and these people (ie the muqallidin) have also reached the realms of destruction but the only difference is that the shi’ahs have reached a greater level of destruction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They (the Shi’ahs) started to find texts to back up the statements of their Imams and these people (ie the muqallidin) have also adopted this way and begun to figurative explain well known narrations that opposed the statements of their Imams. However they should have weighed and presented the statements of their Imams to these narrations and texts and if they (the statements) coincided with the text they should have accepted them or otherwise rejected them. (Tanwir ul-Aynain Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain (pg.44-45)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said, “And I am amazed when I see a person has the ability to return to a clear and conclusive hadith of the Messenger of Allaah (Saalalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) which opposes the statement of his Imam and yet they still hold doing taqlid permissible and I wonder how is this permissible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So if he does not leave the statement of his Imam in such a situation then he has with him Shirk Fir-Risalah (Association partners in the Messengership of the Prophet.).” then the Shaikh goes onto mention the hadith of Adiyy bin Hatim in Jame at-Tirmidhi in regards to the verse of Allaah,<strong>“They have taken their monks and rabbis Lords besides Allaah.”</strong> (Soorah at- Taubah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say further, “So we find from this hadeeth that if a person comes to know the evidences from the Book and the Sunnah and he still adheres to the statement of a specific Imam and begins to figurative explain these evidences, then such a person has traits of Christianity in him and there is the danger that he may have taken some aspects of Shirk in him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And there is extreme amazement on such a nation, who instead of fearing such taqlid they declare those who abandon this taqlid to be great oppressors. Then how well does the following verse fit such people, “How shall I fear those whom you associate and yet you do not fear that you have associated partners with Allah for which Allah has not revealed any evidence, so which of the two are upon the truth, if only but you knew.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So think and be just and do not be from those people who have doubts and we seek refuge in Allah from being amongst those who have bigotry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Tanwir ul-Aynain Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain (pg.49-51).</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Ma’ayar ul-Haq Fi Tanqid Tanwir ul-Haq</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh al-Kul al-Allamah Nazir Hussain Muhadith Dehlawi (1320H)</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Muqallid Excuse Of Not Being Able To Act On The Quran and Hadith</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence it is proven a scholar upon the way of Hadith (non muqallid) whilst making knowledge based deductions should not make Taqlid of a Mujtahid in the texts of an issue, even though the mujtahids statement is in accordance with the Hadith. Yet the people who prohibit us from acting upon ahadith and even though clear manifest truth does not concur with them, one of the lame excuses they put forth in their defence is that acting upon ahadith in current times is extremely difficult.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They say the Quran and Hadith is an ocean of knowledge without any shores and hence understanding and acting on them is the duty of a Mujtahid only (ie not the common people). They say it is not in their permit to understand the Quran and Hadith and even if they were to read and understand the literal translation, they would not know whether a particular Hadith was abrogated or not, what the actual meaning of a text is or if there were any conflicting ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we say we answer this excuse from two angles</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first angle is that the Quran and Hadith is not as difficult, such that no one other than a Mujtahid mutlaq can understand them. On the contrary it is indeed very easy and whoever knows arabic especially and particular the scholars, who will easily and compressively understand the intent and meaning of the Quran and Hadith as is the saying of Allah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And We have certainly made the Quran easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?” (Soorah al-Qamar:17)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His ayaat and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom – although they were before in clear error.” (Soorah al-Jumu’ah:2)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient.” (Soorah al-Baqarah:99)</span></strong></p>
