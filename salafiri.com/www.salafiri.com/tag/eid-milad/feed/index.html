				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In this article, we shall be discussing with evidences which all celebrations that are reoccurring (whether yearly, monthly or weekly) are allowed for us Muslims to engage in and celebrate thereby.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||Meaning of &#8216;Eid||</strong><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Al-Azhari (D. 370) said in Tahdhīb al-Lughah (3/84):<br />
<strong> “And ‘eid for the ‘Arabs means: the time wherein happiness and sadness is (frequently) returned”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">al-Nawawī (D. 676) said in Al-Majmū’ (5/2):<br />
<strong> “’Eid is from ‘Awd which means to return as it repeats”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ibn Manẓūr (D. 711) said in Lisān al-’Arab (3/319):<br />
<strong> “Any day where there is a (repetitive) gathering”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ibn Taymiyyah (D. 728) said in Iqtiḍā al-Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqīm (1/496):<br />
<strong> “’Eid is a name for what repeats with a general gathering and repetition”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">al-Fīrūzabādī (D. 817) said in Al-Muḥīṭ (p. 302):<br />
<strong> “what repeats from distress, sickness or sadness etc. Or a day where people gather”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">And other scholars whose mentioning would prolong the article</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||Number of ‘Eid in Islam||</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ibn Ḥazm (D. 456) said in al-Muḥallā (3/293):<br />
<strong> “They are ‘Eid al-Fiṭr of Ramadan which is the first day of Shawwāl and the day of (‘Eid) al-Aḍḥā which is the tenth day of Dhul Ḥijjah. There is no ‘Eid for the Muslims apart from them except Friday and the three days (tashrīq) after the day of al-Aḍḥā as Allah Ta’ala has not made for them an ‘Eid other than what we mentioned, nor His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and there is no dispute between the people of Islam over that”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">We know that Ijmā’ (consensus) is one of the proofs of our religion, perhaps I may write an article on that too if Allah allows</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>(1) ‘Eid al-Fiṭr and ‘Eid al-</strong><strong>Aḍḥā </strong><br />
<strong> Narrated &#8216;Āishah رضي الله عنها that once Abu Bakr entered upon her on the day of &#8216;Eid al-Fiṭr or &#8216;Eid al-Aḍḥā while the Prophet (يصلى الله عليه وسلم) was present and there were two girl singers with her, singing songs of the Ansar about the day of Bu&#8217;āth. So Abu Bakr said twice: &#8220;Musical instrument of Satan!&#8221; But the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, &#8220;Leave them Abu Bakr, For every nation has an &#8216;Eid and this day is our &#8216;Eid.&#8221; </strong>[al-Bukhāri 3931 &amp; Muslim 892]
<p style="text-align: left">Anas رضي الله عنه reported:<br />
<strong> Allah&#8217;s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم arrived in Medina during two days in which they were celebrating. The Prophet said, “What are these two days?” They said, “We would celebrate these two days in the time of Jāhiliyyah (before Islam)” The Prophet said, “Verily, Allah has replaced these two days with two better days: Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr.”</strong> [Abu Dawud 1134 &amp; Nasai 1556 both with Sahih isnad]
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin al-&#8216;Āaṣ رضي الله عنهما said that Allah&#8217;s messenger said to a man:</strong><br />
<strong> “I have been instructed to take the day of al-Aḍḥā as an &#8216;Eid which Allah, &#8216;Azza wa Jall, has ordained for this Ummah.”</strong> [al-Nasai 4365 &amp; Abu Dawud 2789 with Hasan Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>(2) Friday</strong><br />
Ibn Khuzaymah (D. 311) named a chapter in his Sahih:<br />
<strong> “The evidence that Friday is an ‘Eid”</strong> (before hadith 2161)</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Ibn Abbas رضي الله عنهما recited: “&#8217;This day, I perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and chose for you Islam as your religion&#8217; [5:3] and a Jew was with him who said: ‘If this Ayah was revealed to us then we would have taken that day as a day of celebration.’ So Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: “Indeed it was revealed on two &#8216;Eids: On Friday, and on the Day of &#8216;Arafah.” </strong>[al-Tirmidhi 3044 with Sahih Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>(3) Days of Tashrīq (the three days after ‘Eid al-Aḍḥā)</strong><br />
<strong> Narrated Uqbah bin &#8216;Amir رضي الله عنه that Allah&#8217;s messenger said:</strong><br />
<strong> &#8220;The day of &#8216;Arafat and the day of sacrifice and the day of At-Tashriq are our ‘Eid, the people of Islam, and they are days of eating and drinking.&#8221;</strong> [al-Nasai 3007, al-Tirmidhi 773, Abu Dawud 2419 all with Hasan Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left">Note: Just because they are named as &#8216;Eid does not mean all the rulings of the two &#8216;Eid also apply</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||It is not allowed to engage in any other festival||</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Allah said: <strong>&#8220;<span id="verse_2662_language_6_content">For every religion We have appointed rites which they perform.</span>&#8220;</strong> [al-Hajj 22:67]
<p style="text-align: left">Thābit bin  al-Ḍaḥḥāk رضي الله عنه reported:<br />
<strong> A man in the time of the Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه وسلم made a vow to sacrifice a camel at a placed called Buwanah. He came to the Prophet and he said, “I have made a vow to sacrifice a camel at Buwanah.” The Prophet said, “Were there any idols worshipped there in the time of ignorance?” They said no. The Prophet said, “Were any of their idolatrous festivals celebrated there?” They said no. The Prophet said, “Fulfill your vow, for a vow in disobedience to Allah must not be fulfilled, nor a vow over which the son of Adam has not control.”</strong> [Abu Dawud 3313 with Sahih Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left">We know the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم does not ask a question without any reason, this shows that sacrificing at a place where festivals of the disbelievers are held is a preventive factor, even if the intentions are pure, for we do not engage in what the non-Muslims do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ibnul Qayyim (D. 751) said in Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah (2/246):<br />
<strong> “And indeed Allah Subhanah has named their festivals (the mushrikeen) as falsehood and falsehood is not allowed to be attended. Allah said: ‘And those who do not witness falsehood, and when they pass by ill speech, they pass by with dignity’”</strong> [25:72]
<p style="text-align: left">And he said in the next page:<br />
<strong> “It is impermissible for the Muslims to attend the festivals of the mushrikeen or help them upon it, according to the consensus of the scholars whose words carry weight. The fuqaha’ who follow the four schools of thought have stated this clearly in their books”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Al-Khallal (D. 311) named a chapter in Ahkam ahl al-milal (before no. 126):<br />
<strong>“impermissibility of Muslims to go out on the festivals of mushrikeen”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">al-Bayhaqi (D. 458) named a chapter in his sunan al-Kubra (9/234):<br />
<strong>“impermissibility of Muslims entering on ahl al-Dhimmah in their churches and imitating them on their Nawruz and Mihrajaan”</strong> (these are two festivals of the Persians)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||Any other festival is either imitating them or an innovation||</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Allah said: “And for every nation We have appointed religious ceremonies”</strong> [al-Hajj 22:34]
<p style="text-align: left">Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said:<strong><br />
“Whoever imitates a people is one of them.”</strong> [Abu Dawud 4031; Hasan]
<p style="text-align: left">‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas رضي الله عنهما reported:<br />
<strong> “Whoever lives in the land of non-Arabs and engages in their Nawruz (persian new year) and Mahrajan (persian festival) and imitates them until he dies upon that, he will be resurrected with them on the day of judgement”</strong> [al-Sunan al-Kubra li al-Bayhaqi 18896 with Hasan Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left">The history of the festivals other than the ones permitted in Islam either go back to the disbelievers or due to an innovation which the Muslims performed without the Salaf preceding them. We shall present some examples.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Birthdays:</strong><br />
<strong>&#8220;The highest of all holidays in the Satanic religion is the date of one&#8217;s own birth&#8221;</strong> [Satanic Bible, ch. Religious holidays, p.53]
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Independence day:<br />
</strong><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10008" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/independance.png?resize=300%2C164" alt="independance" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/independance.png?resize=300%2C164 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/independance.png?w=613 613w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
<strong>&#8220;I am apt to believe that it (decleration of independance) will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.&#8221;</strong> [Letter from John Adams to Abigail Adams, 3 July 1776, p. 3]
<p style="text-align: left">The Prophet’s birthday يصلى الله عليه وسلم:<br />
<strong> It was started by the Fatimites, A sect from the Shi’ah</strong> [see al-Mawa’idh wal I’tibar (2/436) by Taqi al-Din al-Maqrizi (D. 845)]
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>||Conclusion||</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">As a Muslim, we should be steadfast according to what our creator has commanded with, as He said:<br />
<strong> “So remain steadfast as you are commanded”</strong> [11:112].</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Do not look at what the people do as Allah said:<br />
<strong> “And if you obey majority of those on earth, they will mislead you from the way of Allah”</strong> [6:116]
<p style="text-align: left">and do not be surprised by their numbers for you have a great reward. Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said:<strong>“Islam initiated as something strange, and it would revert to being strange. so good tidings for the stranger.”</strong> [Muslim 145]
<p style="text-align: left">and he said:<br />
<strong> “The nations were shown to me and one or two Prophets would pass by me with a group (of followers), and a Prophet who had no one with him…”</strong> [al-Bukhari 5705, Muslim 220]
<p style="text-align: left">Remember that Islam is a complete guideline of one&#8217;s life, we must implement Islam even when it comes to celebrating. Allah said: <strong>“Enter into Islam completely”</strong> [2:208]
<p style="text-align: left">Therefore my beloved brother/sister, leave these celebrations for Allah’s sake, He will reward you with something better. Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said:<br />
<strong> “Verily, you will never leave anything for the sake of Allah Almighty but that Allah will replace it with something better for you.”</strong> [Musnad Ahmad 23074 with Sahih Isnad]
<p style="text-align: left">Do not worry about others being displeased with you if Allah is pleased with you. Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“Whoever pleases Allah with the displeasure of the people, Allah will suffice him. And whoever displeases Allah with the pleasure, Allah leaves him to the people”</strong> [al-Ihsan fi taqrib Sahih Ibn Hibban 277 with Sahih Isnad]

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">READ PART 38</span> &#8211; </span><a href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-38-mawlid-beginnings-historical-origins-rafidhi-fatimids/"><span style="color: #008000;">Mawlid Beginnings &amp; Historical Origins – Rafidhi Fatimids</span></a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Th historians differ greatly as to when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born ie the exact date however most of them opine it was the 9th of Rabī Al-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Sa‘īd Muzaffar Kaukabūrī was himself unsure of the exact date of the Mawlid due to the difference of opinion, he Kawkaburi, who was considered the chief Mawlid innovator, would celebrate the Mawlid on the 8th of Rabi ul-Awwal in one year and on the 12th the following year. (al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah 1:552)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Dahiyyah, the one who wrote one of the earliest books promoting the Mawlid, was of the opinion the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 8th of Rabi ul-Awwal and he refutes the notion of it being the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal (<em>al-Tanwir Fi Mawlid al-Bashir wal-Nazir from al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah</em> 2:260)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Dahiyyah also mention the 17th of Rabi ul-Awwal as another potential birth date (<em>al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah</em> 2:260)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is strange how the Barelwis use Imam Ibn Kathirs al-Bidayah to support their views in other things but in such instances they turn a blind eye to such remarks and research. The likes of Saqid Shami are happy to use Ibn Kathir on Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and his alleged book on the Mawlid, so we are we using here too?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The founder of Baraliwism Ahmad Raza Khān said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 12th of Rabī Al-Awwal and he died on the same day.&#8221;</em> (Malfūzāt 2:220)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Qādir Jilānī said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Prophet ﷺ was born on the 10th of Muharram.&#8221;</em> (<em>Ghuniyyah al-Tālibīn</em> 2:392).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan said about Shaikh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The illustrious son and descendant of the Glorious Prophet ﷺ and the true representative and inheritor of Prophetic Bounties, the great Ghawth Shaykh Sayyid ‘Abd al-Qadir Jilani (d 561/1164) states: ‘I see all the cities of Allah as I see a mustard seed in the centre of my palm.’ The Grand Ghawth also states: ‘The pupil of my eye is set on the Luhe-Mahfuz.&#8221;</em> (Malfuzat 1:35-36, Barelwi translation)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is deception at its highest level, on one hand they have this belief about Abdul Qadir al-Jilnai while at the same time reject his view regarding the birth date and hence the Mawlid. The conclusion, Ahmad Raza was categorically lying when he made this statement about Shaykh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another Barelwi writer, Muhammad Umim Ehsan al-Mujaddadi al-Barkati said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on a Monday in the year of the Elephant, either on the 8th, 9th or the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Awjaz al-Siyar Mulhiq Bi-Mishkat al-Masabih</em> 1:586)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdul Haq Dehlawi also mentions the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal being the birth date of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ (<em>Ma Thabt Bil-Sunnah</em> p.288, <em>Madarij al-Nabuwwah</em> 2:23)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qādi Muhammad Suleimān Mansūrpūrī said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Prophet ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī Al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant, corresponding to 22nd April 571ce, corresponding to the 1st Jith 628 Bikrami in Makkah in the early morning before sunrise. &#8220;</em> (<em>Rehmah Al-Alamīn</em> p.40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The historians have differed with regards to the birth date, Tabari and Ibn Khaldun said the 12th, Abu Fida said the 10th. However all are agreed the Monday (of the birth) on that year corresponds to the 9th and this is why the 9th of Rabi ul-Awwal seems to be most accurate date of birth.&#8221;</em> (<em>Rehmah Al-Alamīn</em> p.40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Suleimān Nadwī said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;As regards to the birth of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ Egypt&#8217;s Mahmūd Pashā the astronomer authored a treatise in which he proved mathematically that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 9th Rabī Al-Awwal corresponding to 20th April 571ce.&#8221;</em> (<em style="color: #000000;">Sirah al-Nabī</em> 1:171)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Indian historian Akbar Shah Najibabadi said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant corresponding to the 40th gathering of Kisrah Naushirwan corresponding to the 22th April 571ce in the morning before sunrise.&#8221;</em> <em style="color: #000000;">(Tārīkh Al-Islām</em> 1:76)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The leader of the Sufi&#8217;s, Yusuf bin Ismail Nabahani said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;And what is famous and well known and what the majority (of the scholars) are agreed upon is that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Hujjatullah Alal A&#8217;lamin</em> p.231)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Deobandi church father, Ashraf Ali Thanwi has also mentioned a difference of opinion with regards to the exact birth date. (<em>Nashr al-Tayyib</em> p.28)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of the well known scholars were of the view that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal. Imam Nawawi mentioned,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away on the Monday morning on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal after the 12th year after the Hijra.&#8221;</em> (<em>Taqrib Ala Ibn Salah</em> 2:251)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti, who is revered by the proponents of the Mawlid because of his generic reverence of the birth of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, said in explanation of the words of Imam Nawawi,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The majority (of the scholars) are upon what the author (i.e. Imam Nawawi) mentioned, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tadrib al-Rawi Sharh Tarib al-Nawaw</em>i 2:51)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Tal&#8217;at, the author of <em>Tarikh Dawal al-Arab wal-Islam</em> was also of the view the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabi ul-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdur Rahman Mubrakpuri in his <em>Tuhfa</em> brings the statement of Hafiz Ibn al-Jawzi from his <em>al-Tanqih</em> in which he says,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;They are agreed the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the Monday in the year of the elephant in the month of Rabi ul-Awwal, however, they differ with regards to the exact date of the month and there are four views, (1) 2nd Rabi ul-Awwal, (2) 8th Rabi ul-Awwal, (3) 10th Rabi ul-Awwal and the (4) 12th Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tuhfa al-Ahwadhi Sharh Tirmidhi</em> 4:295)</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Neşet Çaǧatay goes on to mention how the Mawlid was part of intricate Turkish life and how they would label the month of Rabi al-Awwal as the Month of Mawlid. She also mentions such Mawlid recitations were rich with Turkish heritage which were part pf the dailies lived and beliefs of the Turks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">[Neşet Çaǧatay, <strong>The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey</strong>, [pp.130-131 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]
<p style="text-align: justify;">She also mentions an interesting point; that the Mawlid eulogies, from the first ones in the Turkish language were composed of verses and prose text. The style they were composed in suggested the rhyming would lead to chanting rather than recitation. This again is a reprimand on the Sufi’s, especially the Barelwis, who often thoughtlessly like to argue and say what is wrong in such recitations when the reality and fact of the matter is that such Mawlid recitations were designed to be chanted in unison which is unlegislated in the Shari’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-5635 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/siyer-nebwi3.png?resize=410%2C153" alt="siyer-nebwi3" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/siyer-nebwi3.png?resize=300%2C112 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/siyer-nebwi3.png?resize=768%2C287 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/siyer-nebwi3.png?w=946 946w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Neşet Çaǧatay then explains the history of the origins of the Turkish Mawlid and how the Ottomans played a pivotal role in the spread of the Mawlid and the associated celebrations and festivities. She explains how the Mawlid (eulogy of praise) of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) was authored in the beginning of the 9<sup>th</sup> century Hijri / 15<sup>th</sup> century Gregorian. They began to recite the Mawlid poems in the Palaces of the Ottomans and the part the Ottoman rulers played in the spread of the Mawlid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She also goes onto show how the Ottoman rulers ordered for Minarets and houses to be illuminated with lights and so on and so forth. [Neşet Çaǧatay, <strong>The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey</strong>, [pp.131 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/kadi-darir4.png"><img class=" wp-image-5636 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/kadi-darir4.png?resize=434%2C454" alt="kadi-darir4" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/kadi-darir4.png?resize=287%2C300 287w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/kadi-darir4.png?resize=768%2C803 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/kadi-darir4.png?w=938 938w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is exactly the same in our era and in current times. You will see the houses of these people ornate with bright flashing green lights or lights that’s cover the whole house which are often green or in the shape of a sandals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was a brief reading and discussion on the Mawlid having Turkish Pre-Islamic origins which the Sufi and Barelwi’s have adopted as part of their Religion.  Neşet Çaǧatay in great detail, methodically and systematically goes through the history of the Mawlid and shows its Turkish roots and also shows how the celebrations and festive gatherings evolved as we see today in Europe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The similarities are strikingly similar, in fact there is hardly any difference in these practices which have nothing to do with the Quran and Sunnah or the practise of the Salaf al-Saleh ie the pious predecessors.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muzaffar al-Dīn would get up such acts ranging from engaging and promoting music and musical instruments, gathering Qawalī gatherings, dancing, oppressing his people etc. The Milād gatherings were organised under such pretences and under such anti-Islamic atmosphere. These gatherings also commonly known as Mehfils were not based on anything from the Qurān or Sunnah but rather everything that was organised was totally contradictory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muzaffar al-Din inadvertently advocated and pushed the ideas of Wahdah ul-Adyān ie the unification of religions. He attempted to push the concept of syncretism ie synchronising the different religions as well as pre Islamic practices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to Neşet Çaǧatay, she argues and says the origins and roots of Milād are Pre Islamic of Turkish persuasion and custom, which have been essentially modified over the centuries to take on an Islamic appearance. She says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-5623 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/turkish-religion1.png?resize=394%2C240" alt="turkish-religion1" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/turkish-religion1.png?resize=300%2C183 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/turkish-religion1.png?resize=768%2C469 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/turkish-religion1.png?w=945 945w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Neşet Çaǧatay, <strong>The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey</strong>, [pp.129 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This clearly shows how pre Islamic Turkish custom and practices were utilised introduced with other innovations to be something praiseworthy and rewarding, however they are pure innovations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In current times the Mawlid or Milād celebrations have become more heretical with the extravagant lighting, the music and dancing which is very much open without any shame of the vulgarity. This is evident from some of the videos on youtube.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again we find this is nothing new, although Neşet Çaǧatay makes some assertions, not all of them are entirely correct or on point in fact they are just emotions and personal opinions. Nonetheless she asserts,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mevlevi2.png"><img class=" wp-image-5624 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mevlevi2.png?resize=417%2C217" alt="mevlevi2" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mevlevi2.png?resize=300%2C156 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mevlevi2.png?resize=768%2C400 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mevlevi2.png?w=939 939w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Neşet Çaǧatay, <strong>The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey</strong>, [pp.130 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī was also instrumental in pushing the idea of the Mawlid. He was famous poet and Sūfi Master who was the Sūfī patron of the Melviyyah (Mawlawi) who often referred to as the whirling dervishes. They believed in making zikr and dancing at the same time which is known as Sama in Sūfī terminology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Melviyyah would whirl continuously and lose their minds in an abstruse trance in an attempt to achieve unison and unity with Allāh which is again known as Wahdah ul-Wajūd in Sūfī terminology. This shows the Sūfī’s, especially the whirling dervishes known as the Melviyyah (Mawlawiyyah) and their head, Maulāna Jalāl al-Dīn al-Rūmī were instrumental in shaping the Mawlid we see today,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, during the Mawlid or Milād season, you will find heavy involvement of music, clapping of the hands to create sounds and rhythmic beats, drums and tambourines. In other parts of the world professional singers and musicians are hired for the festive to play religious esoteric trance type of music, commonly known as Qawalis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Most of the ardent and staunch supporters of the Mawlid hail from the sub continent and whilst settling in the western world, they have progress and evolved in such an alarming rate that they forced us to produce more Mawlid papers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Highlighting the regression of these people, in the western world Eid Milād al-Nabī was unheard of. There were no lights, no processions and no such gatherings. Such practices were unheard until recently in the last 5-10 years. This yet again is another outright evidence and reality that Mawlid and Milād celebrations are clear innovations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ottomans further spread the Mawlid during their reign and further designated specific customs and practices. Neşet Çaǧatay highlights in the following words</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-5625 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kadi-Darir3.png?resize=449%2C199" alt="kadi-darir3" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kadi-Darir3.png?resize=300%2C133 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kadi-Darir3.png?resize=768%2C341 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kadi-Darir3.png?w=939 939w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Neşet Çaǧatay in her paper asserts the Shī’te leaders of the Fatimids had such Mawlids recited for the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and ʿAlī RaḍiAllāhu Anhu, this is precisely the Mawlid and Milād celebrations we have today. The Shīʿtes also have their own ideas and concepts of Milād, which they celebrate, in fact there is not much difference between how the Barilwī’s, Sufī’s and Shīʿtes celebrate the Milād, two faces of the same coin. She says under the heading of the history of the recitations of Mawlid,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The historian Ibn Khalkān also enforces this view, he gives a firsthand account of what used to really happen at a Mawlid gathering in his <em>Wafyāt</em>, which will be cited later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yāqūt al-Hamawī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He would seriously oppress his people and subjugate them, he would always be inclined to forcefully take their wealth without reason. Similarly he would also feed the poor and destitute and offer them charity. He would also spend a lot of money to free those enslaved by the disbelievers.”</em> [Muʿajam al-Buldān [1:138]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muʿjam al-Buldān goes on to mention a couplet of a poet where he says, he was similar to the prostitute woman who gives charity from the money she earns, oh Woman woe to you, neither commit Zina nor give in charity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The first person to innovate (the Milād or Mawlid) was the ruler or Erbil, Malik Muẓaffar Abū Sa</em><em>ʿ</em><em>īd al-Kaukabūrī.”</em> [al-Ḥawī Lil-Fatāwa [1:189]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It must be noted here that Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭi’s assertion and support of the Mawlid  in his <em>‘Ḥusn al-Maqsid Fī A</em><em>ʿ</em><em>mal al-Mawlid’</em> which is a part of his <em>‘al-Ḥawī Lil-Fatāwa’</em> was mere reciting of poems and narrating ahadith and athar of his virtue ie his Shamaʿil and nothing of the nature of the current day corruptive heretical practises.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, the Barailwī’s and Sūfī’s scampering and scuttling in order to shield themselves behind Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭī is futile because he did not advocate nor propagate any of the things this lot gets up to. It must be said based on what we know of Ḥafiẓ Suyūṭi and giving him the benefit of the doubt and with books like ‘Miftaḥ al-Jannah Bi-Ihtijāj al-Sunnah’ and al-Amr al-Ittiba etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Neşet Çaǧatay further presents Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭī’s opinion which also ties in with what other historians have stated with regards to the origins and beginnings of the Mawlid.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is what Shaikh Ibn Khalkān said after witnessing a gathering of Mawlid and Milād celebrations and festivities. This is a first hand direct account, he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“His people were well aware of his extravagance and belief in the Milād and the people from the surrounding towns and areas ie Baghdād, Moṣul, Jazirah, Sinjār, Naṣibīn and other neighbouring countries would visit him. From amongst these people were Jurists, the Sūfi’s, admonishers, reciters and poets. The people would begin visiting him from Muharram and this would continue until Rabī al-Awwal. Malik Muzaffar al-Dīn Kaukabūrī would instruct his people to make 20 wooden mobile dome and each dome would have 4 or 5 levels. He would reserve one for himself and the remaining ones would be for his ministers and advisers. He would decorate them making them flamboyant, he would place musical instruments on them, from the Tabla and other violin based instruments on the different levels of the domes. The people would close their businesses and visit the festivities and celebrations. The domes would be lined in an open area starting from his palace and ending at the Khanqah (Sufi Convents). Sulṭān Muzaffar al-Dīn would visit every dome on a daily basis after Asr, he would listen to the music and look at the drama. He would eventually retire to the Khanqah where gatherings of Music (Qawali – Shirki trance esoteric type of music) would be in full swing and then eventually after the morning prayer he would go hunting. He would return to his Palace before Ẓuhr and this would be his norm during the Milād days. He would celebrate the Milād on the 8<sup>th</sup> of Rabī al-Awwal one year and then on the 12<sup>th</sup> of Rabī al-Awwal in the following year due to the difference of opinion regarding the Prophets birthday. A few nights before the Milād, he would march into the open field with his musicians, camels, cows and other animals. He would then sacrifice them and then instruct various types of dishes to be cooked. Then after Maghrib on the evening of Milād he would organise a gathering, thousands of candles lit, some of them were huge which he would use in the procession. The Palace would be decorated and he would make a grand entrance. The huge candles would be places on a platform supported by a person which would eventually make their way to his chambers via procession for the festivities.”</em> [Wafyāt al-A’yān Wa Anbā Ibnā al-Zamān [4:117]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sabṭ Ibn al-Jawzī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“A person who visited the Milād gathering and celebrations of Muzaffar al-Dīn Kaukabūrī said the food entailed 5,000 cooked goats, 10,000 hens, 100 horses and 100,000 plates of sweets and 30,000 plates of sweet pudding. Well-known and famous learned men and Sūfīs would visit his Milād gatherings, who would be gowned with specific dress wear. He would generously gift them and would also organise sittings of music infested Qawalis from Ẓuhr until Fajr for the Sufīs. He would participate and dance with them. He would spend approximately 300,000 Dinārs every year on the Milād gathering.” </em>[Mirāh al-Zamān [8:681], see also Suyūti, al-Ḥawī Lil-Fatāwa [1:189-190]. Ibn Kathīr, al-Bidāyah Wan-Nihāyah [12:124] and Subl al-Hadī al-Rashād [1:362].</span></p>
