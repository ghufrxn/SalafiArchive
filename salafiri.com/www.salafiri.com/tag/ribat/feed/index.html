Performing the ablution thoroughly despite difficulties, taking a lot of paces towards the Masjid, and waiting for the next prayer after observing a prayer, and that is Ribat (Preparation for Jihad which is performed by guarding the Muslim borders), that is Ribat, that is Ribat.</span><br />

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES] &#8211; [MUSLIM]</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (1/161 hadith no.385, book 9, chapter 18, hadith no.55), at-Tamhid (20/222) al-Istidhkar (no.355)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Muslim (no.251) from the hadith of Malik </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) The scholar can ask his students questions in order to make them understand an issue. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) This is an excellent hadith from the many ahadith which are to do with virtuous deeds. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) The meaning of performing the ablution thoroughly is to do it in accordance to the Sunnah of the noble Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) so that no body part is left dry and no Sunnah is left out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The meaning of difficulties is the cold (water or weather) etc. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) The meaning of Ribat is to guard the Muslim borders and likewise preparing for the Salah and waiting for the next Salah is also Ribat. Walhamdullilah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">T.N &#8211; There are two meanings of Ribat. One is to provide security and defense on the Islamic borders. The other is to prevent your nafs from those desires which are not allowed and not failing in this. Just as someone performs Jihad upon the nafs and this Mujahadah on the nafs is equivalent in reward to Jihad in Allah’s cause. Therefore it is mentioned in the Qur’an, “…She was very near to disclose his (case, i.e. the child is her son), had We not strengthened (and fortified) her heart (with Faith)…” (28:10) and Allah says, “…and to strengthen (and fortify) your hearts…” and there is also an indication to this meaning in another place in the Qur’an, “…For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Ruh (proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself…” (58:22) because their hearts were not like this previously, “…and their hearts are empty like the wind…” and from this the expression ‘Fulanun Rabitul Ja’sh’ is derived, which means a person who has a firm and strong heart. So by performing the above mentioned actions in the hadith one&#8217;s heart will remain firm and strong on the religion of Islam. For more details see the letters Raa Baa Taa in Imam Raghib al-Isfahani&#8217;s book Mufradatul Qur&#8217;an. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) The longer the distance it is to reach to the Masjid for you the more reward you will obtain. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) Abu Bakr Ibn Abdurahman (Tabi&#8217;i) said, &#8220;Someone who goes to the mosque in the morning or the afternoon with no intention of going anywhere else, either to learn good or teach it, is like someone who does jihad in the way of Allah and returns with booty.&#8221; (al-Muwatta 1/160, 161 hadith no.383 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Sahih]</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) Abu Hurairah (Radi Allahu Anhu) used to say, &#8220;If any one of you prays and then sits down in the spot where he has prayed, the angels ask blessings on him saying, &#8216;Allah, forgive him. Allah, have mercy on him.&#8217; And if he moves from the spot where he has prayed and sits elsewhere in the Masjid waiting for the prayer, he remains in prayer until he prays.&#8221; (al-Muwatta 1/161 hadith no.384 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Sahih]</em>)</span></p>
