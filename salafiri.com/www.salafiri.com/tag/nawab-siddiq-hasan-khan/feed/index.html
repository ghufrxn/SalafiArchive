				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This fatwa of the great Ahl al-Hadith Shaykh, Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan shows the methodology of the Ahl a-Hadith. He clarifies mixing and sitting with people who hold such belief and ideas, let alone cooperating with them. And if Shaykh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan is not from the Akabarin, then I don&#8217;t know who is! Let me warn you dear readers, this Fatwa is not for the faint hearted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Sayyid Nawab Muhamamd Siddiq Hasan Khan Rahimahullah (d.1370/1890) was asked:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) Will the scholars of the Din and the Shari’ah clarify: the muqallidin group who perform taqlid of only one Imam, are they considered to be from Ahl al-Sunnah or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) And is the prayer behind them valid or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Is it permissible or impermissible to let them enter our Masjid and to have sittings and mixing with them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muqallidin of this type in India who have the obvious trait of having enmity and hatred against the people who act on Hadith, hurling slanderous lies and false accusations against them, being irritated with them for saying Amin loudly, raising their hands, placing the hands on the chest and reciting al-Fatihah behind the Imam, which are all established and proven from the authentic ahadith, that are not abrogated and are from raised reports that are not figuratively explained. Likewise, those who commit innovations like Milad, Urs (annual commemorative celebrations for saints) and going into seclusion for 40 days (like Sufis do for meditation and maraqabah) as well numerous other innovations, then they are out of the fold of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah and are like the other deviated sects like the Jahmiyyah, Murjiyyah and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is because they oppose Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l Jama’ah in hundreds of issues, in both Aqidah and actions. In fact, at times some of their beliefs and actions seem to be exactly like that of the Jahmiyyah and the Murji’ah, which will not be hidden from the reader of this treatise. What is to follow, are a few example of the issues, with regards to their Aqidah and actions (a few examples from a whole catalogue) in order to support my claim concerning them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqa’id</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They believe Iman does not increase or decrease, in fact they believe the Iman of an open wicked sinner, the Iman of the Prophets and the Angels is on the same level and equal, which is the Madhhab of the Murji’ah, which is a sect from among the misguided deviated sects as Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal as written in his treatise on Aqidah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>SECONDLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They believe that in all issues of the Din it is obligatory and compulsory to do taqlid of only one Imam, even if it opposes and contradicts the Quran and Hadith, whereas the Hanafi scholars have declared this type of taqlid to be shirk and have discoursed this under the ayah, <strong>“They took their rabbis and monks as lords beside Allah.”</strong> (Surah al-Tawbah, 9:31).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THIRDLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we find from Tafsir Mazhari of Qadhi Thanullah Panipati that the doors of ijtihad were closed with the four Imams and no one can be a mujtahid now, as Fatawa Durr al-Mukhtar mentions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>FORTHLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Isa Alayhis Salam descends, he will do taqlid of Imam A’zam (i.e. Abu Hanifah and this point is mentioned in Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:34.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We see refuge in Allah from these corrupt beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ACTIONS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(They say and hold the view)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) It is permissible for the Muslims to take interest from the non-Muslims in Dar al-Harb (a land that Muslims are at war with) (Sharh Waqayah, 3:130 Urdu) as it is also mentioned in the Farsi translation of Hidayah, published in Nawal Kishore, 3:96. (Durr al-Mukhtar, 3:149-Urdu, 1:43-Arabic).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) If someone has a nose bleed and the bleeding does not stop, then it is permissible for him to write the Quran on his forehead with either urine or blood. This is their respect for the Qur’an (Alamghiri, Delhi Print, 5:134, Arabic 1:154, Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:120-Urdu, Alamghiri, 3:404)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Masturbation does not break the fast as Fatawa Qadhi Khan states as mentioned in volume 1. (Qadhi Khan, 4:361)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) If a person is very aroused and fears fornication, then masturbating is obligatory as Radd al-Mukhtar the notes to Durr al-Mukhtar, Mujtabia Delhi print, p.165.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) If a man wraps his private part (male organ) in a cloth and has sexual intercourse with a woman while fasting and if the cloth is strong, he doesn’t have to repeat the fast nor have a bath for ritual impurity, as is mentioned in Barahana printed Matb’a Husami Lahore, 2:18.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) If a man conducts a wedding ceremony, marrying a man from the west to a woman from the east (meaning there is a difference of one year of journey time by walking) and then the women gives birth in 6 months, the man from the west will be considered to be the father and this will be considered his karamah (i.e. Miracle) even though the man and woman have not met. As mentioned in Fath al-Qadir in the notes to Hidayah, Nawal Kishore, 2:338. (Tablighi Behshiti Zewar, p.240 Lahore)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) Any animal bred while eating pig meat, is Halal as Ghayatul Awthar urdu translation of Durr al-Mukhtar, Nawal Kishore print, 4:196, mentions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) The revenue generated from fornication (i.e. prostitution) is lawful as Chalpi notes to Sharh Waqayah, Nawal Kishore Print mentions, p.298 in the footnotes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) Tanning pig skin purifies it and selling it is also permissible, as Muniyyah al-Musalli, Lahore print, p.32 states (Arabic edn. P.49, Mujtabai print).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10) the permissibility of doing tricks with Zakat. Meaning that if a person gives his wealth to either his wife or gifts it someone else, before the year is complete with the intentions that he doesn’t need to pay zakat, and then the wealth is returned to him after the year is complete, then this is permissible. Imam Abu Yusuf used to do this (Ihya al-Ulum, Arabic Nawal Kishore, 1:11, Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:505, Alamghiri, 10:334-335)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">11) If a man enters (i.e. sexually) a four legged (i.e. Animal) or a dead person and he does not ejaculate, it does not break his fast nor does he have to make ghusl, as Fatawa Qadhi Khan states, Nawal Kishore print, 1:105.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">12) Legal punishments ordered by the Qadhi are implemented inwardly and outwardly. For example, if a person claims that another mans wife is his wife and he gives a false testimony and then wins the trial, the woman will be his. Therefore, she will be lawful for him according to Allah’s law and the people and it is permissible for him to sleep with her and he will not be imprisoned according to Allah’s law. (Hidayah Matba Mustafai, 2:125, Sharh Waqayah, 3:59),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">13) If a person deliberately passes wind after reciting the Tashahhud, his prayer will be complete. (Sharh Waqayah Arabic Matb’a Nawal Kishore, 1:43, urdu 1:401).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">14) If someone borrows someone’s female slave and then commits fornication with her, there is no legal punishment on him despite knowing the female servant is unlawful for him i.e. an illicit sexual relationship. Hidayah Farisi translation, Nawal Kishore, 2:302-303.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 2</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The prayer behind such muqallidin will not be permissible, because we find from what has preceded that the beliefs and actions of these people oppose the way of Ahl al-Sunnah, in fact some beliefs and actions necessitate shirk and some corrupt the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 3</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Letting such muqallidin into your Masajid is impressible according to the shari’ah according to the ayah <strong>“</strong><strong>Expel them from wherever they have expelled you.”</strong> (Surah al-Baqarah, 2:191) and according to the command in the ayah, <strong>“Then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people.”</strong> (Surah al-An’am, 6:68). Therefore, mixing with them, sitting with them, marrying them, being with them in times of sadness and other interactions and connections are all unlawful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be clearly noted the commissioner of Delhi reconciled both parties and also issued a written tract which both parties agreed too, curbing the animosity and to pray behind each other as long as the prayer in not invalidated in order to preserve peace and prevent chaos. However, the muqallidin rejected this reconciliation again and concocted some baseless points. So, they returned to their original ways and began issuing posters and treatise against the people of Tawhid without caring for the reconciliation agreement.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Milad Gatherings and Reciting Fatihah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Sayyid Nawab Muhamamd Siddiq Hasan Khan Rahimahullah (d.1307/1890) was asked:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>QUESTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What do the scholars of the Din and legal verdicts say regarding the following issues:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is is permissible or not to praise and venerate the leader of mankind, Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and to conduct the eulogy recitations of the Mawlid in such a manner that the gathering is ornate with lights and decoration while the people recite poetry as if the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was present in the gathering and was being being addressed directly? Is it also permissible or impermissible to stand in veneration when his birth is being mentioned and furthermore, what do the scholars of legal verdicts says with regards to attending such gatherings?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also is it permissible or impermissible from the viewpoint of the Prophetic Hadith to recite al-Fatihah while raising the hands (i.e. making dua) over food on the day of Eid, Shab Barat and other days with the intent of the reward reaching the deceased? Please explain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also is it permissible or impermissible for people to gather on the third day after the death of an individual in order recite the Quran and to recite the Kalimah and five ayat on roasted chick peas? Please explain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Organising Milad gatherings and its likes is an innovation. Organising Milad gatherings and standing when the birth of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam is mentioned is not established or proved from the first three best generations. Therefore, it is an innovation and thus moving along the same line of argument, we do not find any evidence for raising the hands and making dua by reciting al-Fatihah on the days of Eid, Shab Barat and other special days.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, on behalf of the deceased, if food is given to the poor and destitute for the sake of Allah without the restriction and specification mentioned in the question, with the intent of reward for the deceased [as sadaqah], supplicating and seeking forgiveness, then we hope that is it beneficial (for the deceased). The same applies to other restricting and specifying other days after the death, for example the the third, the tenth and the fortieth. (i.e it is impermissible on any day after the death).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for reciting five ayats on roasted chick peas and other things, then we do not find any evidence for this whatsoever in the books of Hadith and the Din, therefore in conclusion these affairs are innovations and thus disliked in the shari’ah. And our resort is in Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Shaykh Nawab Sayyid Muhammad Siddiq Hasan Khan al-Qinawji al-Bukhari, Fatawa, 177-178.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Abd Al-Jabbar Umrpuri (d.1334/1916) On The Omnipresence of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam During the Mawlud Recitations</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abd al-Jabbar Umrpuri was the grandfather of Shaykh Abd al-Ghaffar Hasan Rehmani)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>READ HIS BIOGRAPHY &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span> <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/biography-shaikh-abdul-jabbar-amrpuri-1344h/?fbclid=IwAR0K88P48URiNwGT26kKSjiKt7HRGbRi9RgyFVtbNMBUL3L_R846uJBfeDg">http://www.salafiri.com/biography-shaikh-abdul-jabbar-amrp…/</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Believing the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam i.e. having the Aqidah about him that he Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam travels to wherever the Mawlud’s are recited is indeed Shirk. Only Allah is everywhere in terms of knowledge and power, and he has not given his attributes to anyone and Allah knows best.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>[3]</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Imam Muhammad Fakhir Za’ir Ilabadi</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>1120H-1164H</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(1708c-1751c)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari </strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His full name is Muhammad Fakhir and known as Za’ir, the son of Shaikh Muhammad Yahya. His title is as ash-Shaikh al-Alim al-Kabir al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir bin Muhammad Yahya bin Muhammad Amin al-Abbasi Ilabadi. (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence is Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir bin Shaikh Muhammad Yahya Ilabadi. (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.334)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had two brothers, one was Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Ilabadi who was a reputable scholar of the Din. His maternal grandfather was Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi, whose lineage could be traced back to Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhu).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find that Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was from a family of learning who valued and gave Islamic education great importance. The family were known amongst the people for their knowledge and attachment to the sacred Islamic sciences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From an early age Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir started learning from his father, grandfather and older brother and benefited greatly from them. It led him to acquire knowledge quickly and thereby becoming highly proficient and competent in the sacred Islamic sciences. (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>A Brief Overview of his Family</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(1) His father; Shaikh Muhammad Yahya Ilabadi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a major scholar of his day and the author of <em>Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram</em> praised him by saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was an ocean of knowledge in the sciences, once that sent waves of this knowledge resounding with the people and he authored a number of books and treatises.” (</em>Ma&#8217;athir Al-Kiram (2:218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had three sons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(i) Shaikh Muhammad Tahir</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(ii) Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(iii) Shaikh Shah Muhammad Hasir Afsali</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All three sons and father were keen poets and enjoyed poetry.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(2) His grandfather; Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No detailed information could be obtained regarding his biography.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(3) His brother; Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Ilabadi (b.1110H &#8211; d.1143H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the older brother of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir, he was a person of knowledge and virtue, Shaikh Muhammad Ra&#8217;is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was upon the Salafi Madhab and an Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith just like his brother as we find from his writings.&#8221;</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.193)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hasani said he was well aware and acquainted with the Madhabs of the Salaf and Khalaf and that his brothers sought knowledge from him. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:332-333 no.615)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Seeking the Knowledge of Hadith from Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi [1163H]</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir studied with Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi in the year 1149H when he travelled to the 2 sanctuaries and visited Madinah. At the time Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami was also studying with Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi and hence both were of similar stature in terms of their sittings. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339-340), Taqsar Junud al-Ahrar Min Tazkar Junud al-Abrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Fakhir studied and read <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em> on Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi to the extent that he gained great credibility and heights which conjured up immense love for Hadith in his heart, such was the case that he became rigid and firm on the Quran and Hadith his whole life. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.141)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi also gave him Ijazah for the two Sahihs as well as other books. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349), Sarwar Azad (p.213), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.141)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Under the Tutelage of Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir studied with Shaikh Azad Bilgirami, as another beneficial point it is sufficient to note that Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlavi also studied under Shaikh Azad Bilgirami, meaning that Shaikh Azad Bilgirami was a teacher of both of them however their period of study was different. (Sarwar Azad (p.213+), Itihaf an-Nabula (p.406-407), Ma&#8217;arif (22:339)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Stay in The Two Blessed Sanctuaries</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir had special love for the 2 blessed lands and hence for the purpose and intent of seeking and consolidating his knowledge he remained there for a few years. During this period, he performed 2 Hajjs. After returning to India, he intended to perform his third Hajj in the year 1154H and whilst he set out, some goons captured him near Surat and stole all of his belongings except his books and eventually gave him a ride to the city of Surat. (Sarwar Azad (p.214), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He attempted to perform Hajj again in the year 1156H and whilst travelling by ship, the journey was short lived due to ship wreck. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir ended up residing in Bandar Faha for a few days and then eventually reached his destination of Hijaz safely in the same year and then finally returned back to India in 1159H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In one of his journeys to Hajj he returned with an edition of <em>Sahih Muslim</em>, which was copied by Mawlana Ruh al-Amin Khan, which is preserved in Habin Ganj library. (Ma&#8217;arif (23:91-92), Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349), Sarwar Azad (p.214), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335, 340).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After seeking the traditional knowledge and sciences he began to teach his students with great vigour and fervour. He was known to have reached the status of being a Muhaddith at a very young age and thus a large number of people benefited from his knowledge and understanding.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This can easily be deduced and understood from the fact that when Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan sent Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati to study with Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlavi, he later sent him to Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir to seek knowledge of Hadith and its sciences. This clearly shows Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was a great scholar of Hadith of his era and was highly proficient as a Hadith master.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From his students were his two sons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Shaikh Qutb ud-Din (1187H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(2) Shaikh Muhammad Ajmal (1236H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and also</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Shaikh Qadhi Thanullah Pani Pati (1225H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Shaikh Murtaza Bilgirami (al-Zabidi) (1205H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Shaikh Ghulam Haidar Khan Kakawri (1252H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(6) Shaikh Ghulam Safdar Khan (1283H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(7) Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi (1234H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(8) Shaikh Muhammad Nasih</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(see Mashahir Kakawri (p.300), Tazkirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140), Siratul Bukhari (p.37-38).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Shaikh Qutb Al-Din bin Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir (b.1138H &#8211; 1187H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the Shaikhs eldest son, and was often responsible for teaching the people as well delivering regular lessons, he essentially took over his father’s role in teaching, more so when his father would travel to perform Hajj. He has been mentioned with great virtue with regards to his command of the various sciences and disciplines, especially the knowledge of <em>Fiqh</em> and its principles ie <em>Fiqh</em> and <em>Usul al-Fiqh</em> and other areas of learning. He died while he travelled to Makkah to perform Hajj and was thus buried there. He also authored some books. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:235-236 no.437).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra&#8217;is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was upon the way of his father and uncle, on the Madhab of Ahl al-Hadith.&#8221;</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.192)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The affect of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir on his students was so profound that it was manifest in their writings. This was more so in adhering and abiding by the ahadith and rejecting any form of blameworthy and rigid staunch Taqlid which is prevalent with the muqallidin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An example of this is what Shaikh Qadhi Thanullah Pani Pati said in his will, in that Surah Fatihah is to be recited after the first takbir and opening supplication even though he is famously attributed to the hanafi madhab. (<em>Wasiyat Nama</em> printed with <em>Majmu&#8217;a Wasaya</em> Number 4 (p.146).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi (1234H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi authored a book on raising the hands in the prayer titled, <em>&#8216;Nur Al-Aynayn Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain.&#8217;</em> This maybe an addendum to his Shaikh work or his own personal work and Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is said about him that he was exemplary and unmatched in speaking the truth and being vocal in this and he spent a large part of his life strictly following the Quran and Hadith and adhering to the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says in one place in his book, <em>&#8216;Nur Al-Aynayn Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain&#8217;,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When I have obeyed and followed the Messenger of Allah </em><em>ﷺ</em> <em>I am totally unconcerned with the statements of Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Sufyan ath-Thawri and Imam at-Zuhri.&#8221;</em> (Tarajim Ulama Hadith (p.383), Tazkirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (pg.142), Siratul Bukhari (p.37-38)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Will</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was firm and strong in adhering to the Quran and Sunnah and thus vehemently abhorred grave worship and so he willed that he was to be buried next to Shaikh Abdul Latif in Burhanpur. This was due to the fact it was only his grave that was not venerated and worshipped. Hence, according to his wish he was buried next to Shaikh Abdul Latif.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Status and Position</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was a mujtahid, a Salafi and not a muqallid. We find by looking at his books that he was undoubtedly an Ahl al-Hadith and refrained from doing Taqlid of anyone. He was a mujtahid in his own right and this supported by the statement of Shaikh Abdul Hay al-Hasani which is to proceed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah blessed Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir with a great station and status.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He studied with numerous teachers and began teaching at the tender age of 20. He achieved the title of Shaikh. He then went to Haramayn Sharifayn in 1149H to perform Hajj and Umrah. He visited The Prophets Masjid and eventually sought knowledge of hadith and other disciplines from the Shaikh of the Shaikhs, Muhammad Hayat Sindhi and eventually returned back to his native land. He would visit Haramayn Sharifayn numerous times.”</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh (p.195)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Author of Risalah Najatiyyah of Shaikh al-Fazil Al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir with the title of Za&#8217;ir Ilabadi.&#8221;</em> (Ittihaf an-Nabula (p.84) Also refer to Intiqad at-Rajih (p.84), Taqsar Junud al-Ahrar Min Tazkar Junud al-Abrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At another instance Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He detested venerating the holy men ie the pirs and he would write in refutation of them. He would encourage adhering to the Quran and Sunnah. It is sufficient testimony for Shaikh Muhammad Fakhirs trustworthiness and uprightness that Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan and Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami bore witness to his great virtue, immense noble character and extensive knowledge.&#8221;</em> (Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said at another place,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was the Imam of the Imams of the followers of the Sunnah in India and he was from amongst the Shaikh of the Shuyukhs from the major and well known scholars.&#8221;</em> (Taqsar al-Junud al-Ahrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ismail Salafi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is apparent from the authors poems that he was a fearless caller to Tawhid and the Sunnah, and at the same instance he would rebuke the customary staunch bigoted Taqlid. This would inevitably lead to some harshness but nonetheless he was very intelligent and the scholars would respect him highly.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Azad Bilgrami said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan said, &#8220;I have seen many notable people but after 11 hundred years I saw the likes of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir and I found him to conform and agree with the Quran and Sunnah.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram Fi Tazkirrah Ulama Bilgiram (2:218), (Sarwar Azad (p.218), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.337)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He (ie Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan) would would visit me with respect but with Shaikh Fakhir he was even more respectful and humble.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan would go to visit Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir Ilabadi himself which was not the norm for him.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati praised Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir with the following words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ash-Shaikh al-Ustadh Muhammad Fakhir al-Muhaddith Rahimahullah said that it was unlawful to make a masjid next to a grave whilst deducing from the Hadith of Abi Lahaij in Sahih Muslim.&#8221;</em> (Tafsir Mazhari (6:23)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati undoubtedly, was a non staunch open minded Hanafi Scholar searching for the truth such that the current day Hanafis would not bat an eyelid except to shun and ostracise him and label him as a pseudo Hanafi as the word pseudo is often used and accustomed on the tongues of the bewildered retractors. So despite this Shaikh Thanullah Pani Pati would would still have great respect for him despite him being an Ahl al-Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whereas in our times it is the total opposite and the present day Hanafis have left the teachings and mindset of their forefathers and abuse the Ahl al-Hadith. (Refer to Nur us-Sunnah (p.5-6)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Abdul Hayy al-Hasani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ash-Shaikh Al-Alim Al-Kabir Al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir bin Muhammad Yahya bin Muhammad Amin Al-Abbasi al-Salafi Ilabadi, one the well known and famous scholars.&#8221;</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349 no.641)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;All the people were agreed in praise of him and his noble characteristics, he was someone who was referred to in such affairs. He did not restrict himself to only one specific madhab nor did he do taqlid of anyone in the affairs of the Din rather he followed the texts of the Quran and Sunnah and did Ijtihad which he was well qualified and capable to do.&#8221;</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:350)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Atthar Mubarakpuri said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was a major Muhaddith of his era.”</em> (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is Nadwi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“…We can see just from the titles of his books that it is apparent he was Ahl al-Hadith and upon the Salafi Madhab, he would openly say he was an Ahl al-Hadith and would spread the Manhaj of Ahl al-Hadith…..In summary, this Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith of the twelfth century, who was accepted and praised by whose who were not from the Ahl al-Hadith. The Imam was an outspoken, formidable and fervent propagator of the Madhab of Ahl al-Hadith, coupled with the fact that he was accepted by both the Ahl al-Hadith non Ahl al-Hadith, thus it is not impossible a large group of the muqallidin did not adopt and change to the Madhab of the Ahl al-Hadith due to the arduous efforts of this Imam of Ahl al-Hadith.”</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.196)     </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Allamah Azad Bilgrami&#8217;s (1294H) Praise for Imam Muhammad Fakhir.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Azad Bilgrami wrote a poem in Farsi on the death of Imam Muhammad Fakhir&#8217;s in respect of him and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was known as Za&#8217;ir (in the poets circles) and his name was Muhammad Fakhir, the son of Shaikh Muhammad and the grandson of Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi, and we empowered the three, he assumed the role of the Musnad of his elders. In doing so he was very noble, virtuous and reached a high rank as well as having lofty characteristics.&#8221;</em> (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>An Expert Master in the Sciences</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was an excelled master in the Islamic principles and far ahead in the sciences of texts and their comprehension from his counterparts, this was also applicable to some of the scholars prior to his era.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir excelled and was a specialist in Hadith and its various sciences as well has having the rank of a mujtahid in issues of <em>fiqh</em> ie jurisprudence.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Writings and Works</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir authored a number of treatises. The Hanafite biographer, Shaikh Abdul Hayy said,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">some of them are</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(1) Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqa&#8217;id Al-Hadithiyyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the scholars referred to this book as <em>Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqa&#8217;id Al-Athariyyah</em>. There is probable cause for this as Imam Muhammad Fakhir authored this book on the methodology Ahl al-Hadith and hence the Athari creed. It has only been printed twice and Walillahil Hamd we have published it for a third time.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Risalah Najatiyyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we have already mentioned some scholars referred to this book with two equally interchangeable names. This classical 12th century text on Salafi creed was authored by Imam Muhammad Fakhir when he had to reside in Chittagong in Bangladesh for between 3-4 months in the year 1161H ie 3 years before his death. The original book is preserved in Mawlana Abdul Ghani al-Baqi’s library in Dinajpur in Bengal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treatise as also mentioned before is based purely on the Salafi Creed and Manhaj and hence the Quran and Sunnah and it is from Imam Muhammad Fakhir last works. One can gauge the importance and significance of this book from the fact that Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan translated the book from Farsi into Urdu as Farsi was the original language it was written in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-8048 alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=306%2C343" alt="najatiyyah old" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=268%2C300 268w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=768%2C861 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=913%2C1024 913w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?w=1040 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan produced a summarised transation and included it in his book <em>&#8216;Al-Mu&#8217;taqad Al-Muntaqad&#8217;</em> which was printed in the year 1305H from Matba&#8217;a Al-Ansari in Delhi. Furthermore, he included the whole book in Farsi in the beginning of another book, <em>&#8216;an-Nahj Al-Qubul Min Shara&#8217;i ar-Rusul.’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the importance of the status of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir, if a great scholar of the likes of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan summarized his book and reproduced them in his books of Aqidah, it for sure shows his status and calibre.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was an accomplished poet in Arabic and Farisi. Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan summarised Shaikh Muhammad Fakhirs poems in his two books, <em>&#8216;Nafah at-Tayyib&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;ar-Rawdh al-Khasib&#8217;</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thi book is pertaining to the prayer which is to be performed in accorda<span style="color: #000000;">nce with the Quran and Sunnah. The importance of this book can be deduced from the words of the g</span>reat scholar of Hadith, Shaikh ul-Hadith Muhammad Isma&#8217;il al-Salafi when he said, students should be taught this book in the beginning in the Ahl al-Hadith Institutes. (Muqaddimah Nur as-Sunnah (p.6)<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Qurratul Aynayn Dar Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is authored in poem form in Farsi. Imam Muhammad Fakhir addressed the issue of Raf ul-Yadain in a scholarly manner and proved the raising of the hands in the prayer and refuted the weak evidences for not raising the hands.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-8049 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/qurratul-ayn.png?resize=298%2C505" alt="qurratul ayn" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/qurratul-ayn.png?resize=177%2C300 177w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/qurratul-ayn.png?resize=768%2C1305 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/qurratul-ayn.png?resize=603%2C1024 603w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/qurratul-ayn.png?w=964 964w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is Nadwi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Most of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhirs books were in poetry form. He died and was buried in Burhanpur in Maharashtra. We can see just from the titles of his books that it is apparent he was Ahl al-Hadith and upon the Salafi Madhab, he would openly say he was an Ahl al-Hadith and would spread the Manhaj of Ahl al-Hadith.”</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.196)     </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>The Scholars of During Imam Muhammad Fakhirs Era</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir was calling to the the Quran and Sunnah without Taqlid and adhering to the Salafi Manhaj at a time when the people and the scholars of the era were engrossed in Taqlid or the madhahibs. It also shows the status of Imam Muhammad Fakhir as well as his call based on the notable and praiseworthy scholars that were around during his era, it includes the likes of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab (1114H-1206H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(2) Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlavi (1114H &#8211; 1176H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi (d.1163H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati (1145H &#8211; 1225H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Shaikh Abul Hasan Sindhi (d.1138H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(6) Shaikh Abdullah Salim al-Basri (d.1134H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(7) Shaikh Ibrahim al-Kurdi (d.1145H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(8) Shaikh Murtaza al-Zabidi Bilgrami (1145H &#8211; 1205H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(9) Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il bin Amir San’ani (d.1182H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(10) Shaikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Saffarini (d.1188H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also very plausible that he may have met Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab during his visits to Makkah and Madinah.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>When Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir Met Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is also a well known incident when Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir met Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi. The incident mentions that once when Imam Muhammad Fakhir visited Delhi, while praying he said Amin loudly in the prayer in the Jamia Masjid. This was a disturbing event in Delhi. The general people because angry and began to oppress Imam Muhammad Fakhir to the extent they were on the verge of beating him. Imam Fakhir explained to them that this was established from the Sunnah and if you were to go to any of your major scholars of Hadith they will affirm this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the end they took Imam Muhammad Fakhir to the gathering of Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi and mentioned the incident to him.  So Shaikh Shah Waliullah told the people that this was also established from the Sunnah and the people were silenced. Thereafter Imam Muhamamd Fakhir said to Shaikh Shah Waliullah what don&#8217;t you tell these people openly what the Sunnah is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To which Shaikh Shah Waliullah replied that if I was to tell these people openly about such issues how would I have saved you today. Meaning that the people were so engrossed and staunch in the Hanafi madhab and fixed in their ways that they failed to accept anything else. (Taqsar al-Junud al-Ahrar (p.115), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339), Mawj Kawthar (p.63) of Shaikh Muhammad Akram)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Death</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1164H Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir prepared for Hajj again but became very ill, he had just reached the town or Burhanpur when he breathed his last and returned to our creator on the 11th Dhul Hijjah 1164H. Shaikh Azad Bilgirami expressed his sorrow and sadness at the demise of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir. (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218), Sarwar Azad (p.218), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.336)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This formidable Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith, spent his very short life in spreading Tawhid and the Sunnah, reprimanding grave veneration, grave worship and blind taqlid. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir spent almost quarter of a decade in calling to adhering to the Quran and Sunnah in an era which was filled with ardent bigoted hanafi muqallids, who were ferociously vicious and violent. The legacy of this Imam of Ahl al-Hadith who was upon the Madhab of the Salaf still remains as radiant and bright as ever around the globe even after 250 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The existence of this impressive Scholar of Ahl al-Hadith, his efforts and struggles are a testimony and a tremendous rebuttal of the modern madhabists who claim the Ahl al-Hadith are a new sect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah have mercy upon Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir and forgive his sins, Amin   </span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[1] </strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1250H-1326H </strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(1834c-1908c)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the early 2000’s we compiled short biographies of some of the scholars of the sub continent, we also mentioned they were summaries of detailed biographies which were delayed in being published for some reason or another. In additional to the fact that in recent years, unfortunately some imprudent ignorant people from Birmingham began to say our dawah was to the scholars of ‘India and Pakistan,’ despite the sheer ignorance of such people and being totally clueless and oblivious of the dawah of the scholars before, we thought it was time and most pertinent to share some of the biographies of these great luminaries of the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafi’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was the summarized biography which has been since amended and updated by this biography.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[Biography] – Allamah Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani [1326H]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">http://www.salafiri.com/biography-allamah-muhammad-bashir-Sahaswani-1326h/</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is Allamah Kabir Muhammad Bashir bin Hakim Muhammad Badr al-Din bin Sadr al-Din al-Faruqi al-Sahaswani. He is not in need of any introduction, he is the renowned Scholar, the <em>Muhaddith</em>, the jurist, the debater, the teacher, the <em>mufti</em>, the admonisher and speaker. <em>(Forty Scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65 and Hayat nazir p.173 both of Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whenever Sahaswan is mentioned Shaikh Muhammad Bashir is the first one who comes to mind. <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab bayna mu’idihah wa mu’aridahah fi shabbah al-qarihah al-hindiyyah p.63 of Shaikh Abul Mukarram bin Abdul al-Jalil)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Family Roots and Background</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His lineage traces back to Umar ibn al-Khattab (RadhiAllahu Anhu). His grandfather was a resident of Thanesar which is in western Punjab, which he left and settled in Sahaswan. He had studied with various scholars and was known to be upright and righteous. <em>(Dabistan hadith p.216 of Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father, Hakim Muhammad Badr al-Din Faruqi was a Doctor and resided in Lucknow due to his work in the early years of the Shaikh’s life and this is where he received his early education, under the guidance of his father. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250 of Shaikh Imam Khan Nawshahri, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.379-380 of Muhammad Qadi Aslam Sayf Fairuzpuri)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father was a renowned physician who had learnt and studied Medicine at the hands of the experts of the Day which included the likes of Shaikh Shah Rafi al-Din Muhaddith Dehlawi. He also studied Ibn Sina’s classical Medical magnum opus <em>‘al-Qanun.’ </em>The Shaikhs father would treat everyone ranging from poor to the elite and even received honorary titles from the ruler of Oudh. He also had knowledge and had studied the Islamic sciences. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dabistan hadith p.216, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237 oh Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi, Forty Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith p.65)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father died in approximately 1260H/1844c and at the time Shaikh Muhammad Bashir was approximately 10 years old. Thereafter he returned to his native area of Sahsawan with his mother.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Birth of the Allamah Kabir</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani was born in approximately 1250H/1834c in Sahsawan which is in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Sahaswan is an old city with rich history. Sahsawan had always been a city of learning and Islamic sciences and a great number of scholars hailed from there. Likewise, and similarly a large number of Ahl al-Hadith scholars used to live in Sahaswan <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.379-380, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237, Forty Scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The historians and biographers have differed with regards to his exact date of birth. Shaikh Idris Nigrami mentions his birth to have been in 1240H in <em>‘Tazkirrah Ulama Hal’</em> where as Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hassani mentions 1254H in his <em>‘Nuzhat al-Khawatir.’</em> Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions that he was born approximately in the middle of the century and he was no more 8-9 years old when his father died. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:437)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abul Muakkaram mentions his birth day to be 1245H <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous Ahl al-Hadith historian, Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti mentions his date of birth as 1252H (1836-1837c) <em>(Dabistan hadith p.217)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The biographers have generally accepted his birth to have been around the years 1250H-1251H based on the statement of the Shaikhs student.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some Ahl al-Hadith historians and researchers have mentioned another Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani who died in 1321H who authored <em>‘Tabsirah al-naqid,’ </em>we were unable to find anything on this Shaikh and perhaps it is a mistake in the citation of the name and also the potential difficulty in reading the hand writing and script from books of that era. <em>(Was Islam Spread in the Subcontinent due to the efforts of the Sufiyyah, p.154 of Shaikh Ghazi Uzair)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani, who spend a lot of time under the tutelage of Shaikh Sahaswani authored a book on the biographies of the scholars of Sahaswan titled, <em>‘al-Yaqut al-marjan fi zikr ulama Sahaswan.’</em> Which is often referred to as ‘<em>Hayat al-ulama’ </em>and we will also refer to it with the same name here on in.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Pursuit of Knowledge</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Early Days in Sahaswan and Lucknow</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh began his studies with his father who had himself studied in Delhi and thus spent time with notable luminaries of the era. After returning to Sahaswan he began to study under Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan for approximately 10 years or so. Then in 1273H/1856c, just after the period of mutiny was subsiding he travelled to Lucknow and studied with the Scholars of Farangi Mahal from the likes of Shaikh Hidayahtullah Khan Rampuri, Shaikh Wajid Ali Banarasi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also studied with his paternal cousin, Shaikh Nur al-Hasan Sahaswani whilst in Matharah. He studied the Islamic sciences of tafsir, hadith, fiqh and usul <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.217, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Studies with Shaikh Muhaddith Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After Lucknow the Shaikh travelled to Delhi to study with Allamah Imam Sayyid Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, he studied Hadith, Fiqh and Tafsir with him and also obtained chains for ahadith from him Ie ijazat. He studied the two Sahihs and the four sunans. He also obtained (isnad) chains of hadith from Allamah Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin Ansari al-Yamani who was the Qadi of Bhopal. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Dabistan hadith p.217, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237-238, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Teachers from the Najd</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Shaikh travelled to the Hijaz and Najd to perform Hajj he studied with the likes of Shaikh Ahmad bin Ibrahim bin Isa al-Sharqi al-Najdi (d.1329H) and Shaikh Muhammad bin Abd al-Rahman Saharanpuri who migrated to Makkah and respectively attained ijazahs in hadith. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Transformation</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was upon the way of taqlid in his early years until his studies and the constant diligent nurturing of his first teacher, Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan Sahaswani who instilled the love and admiration of the Quran and Sunnah. Thereafter the Shaikh abandoned taqlid and held firmly onto the Kitab and Sunnah and the manhaj of the Salaf. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90-91, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani said when Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani studied the books of Ulum Aqliyyah, Mantiq, philosophy, Fiqh and Usul he leaned towards taqlid and the hanafi madhab and would issue legal edicts based on it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, when he sat in the lessons of Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan and benefitted from his manhaj, Shaikh Sahaswani’s inclination for research grew stronger, leading him to follow the Quran and Sunnah, he would refer to it in every issue. He adopted the manhaj of Amal bil-Hadith and believed it was obligatory to abandon the taqlid of specific people and opinions. <em>(Hayah al-ulama p.91, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Spreading the Quran and Sunnah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani was essentially a teacher and spent all of his life learning and teaching.  Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il al-Salafi also comes to this conclusion in his introduction to Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi’s <em>‘Ma’yar ul-haq,’he </em> categorises the Shaikhs students into, writers, debaters, teachers and so on where he says Shaikh Sahaswani was more of a teacher and educationalist. <em>(Introduction to Ma’yar ul-haq</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the beginning he spent a year teaching in Bangladesh and then another year in Bihar. This was followed by 15 years of teaching as a professor in Akbarabad, Agra in a college. This is what he would do in the day and then in the evening he would teach Quran and Hadith and conduct lessons at his house. There would be a constant flow of students to his gatherings of learnings during the day and the evening, the students would benefit greatly from his knowledge. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Time in Bhopal </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During this era Shaikh Allamah Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan was active in Bhopal due to his family. At the request of Allamah Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan in 1295H/1878ce Shaikh Sahaswani was appointed as a teacher in Madrassah Shah Jahaniyyah in Bhopal after leaving Agra and he remained there for sometime. Shaikh Sahaswani was given great respect and a high position in the teaching circles and was essentially made the head of all the learning faculties. <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst in Bhopal the Shaikh would deliver lectures and sermons and the Shaikh was such a prolific speaker and orator, most of the gathering would cry due to the fear of Allah due to the Shaikh reminding them of the affairs of the Din and Dunya. He would also deliver lectures in the residence of the leaders, who would also cry to the power of his admonitions. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:251, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani had been in Bhopal for approximately 12 years. In these 12 years both scholars worked together. Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan would write books and Shaikh Sahaswani would answer all the question that were presented and in this was why Shaikh Sahaswani was known as the Mufti. At the same time Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin Ansari al-Yamani was also in Bhopal and he was the Qadi. Bhopal flourished with Ilm and became a powerful learning centre for the Salafi’s and Ahl al-Hadith. <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.376-380, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Later around 1307H/1890c after the death of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan, the atmosphere of Bhopal was changing and Shaikh Sahaswani thought it was time to move on to Delhi. The family of Shaikh Siddiq Hasan Khan were unhappy with his decision due to the great benefit and knowledge he would propagate to the people and therefore he remained in Bhopal for longer. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The historians and biographers differ how long Shaikh Sahaswani’s stayed in Bhopal with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hassani saying 30 years and Shaikh Imam Khan Nawshahri saying 24 years. It seems more appropriate that he stayed in Bhopal for approximately 24 years because this is in line with other information. Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti mentions 25 years.  After Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan’s death Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani remained in Bhopal after another 12 years making his total time in Bhopal as 24 years. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252-253, Dabistan hadith p.220, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During this period Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan and Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi had an exchange of a book debate, where they both wrote books against one another. Shaikh Lucknowi alleged that Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani was the actual one writing the books under Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan’s name. Shaikh Sahaswani crushed this false allegation and clarified he was not the one writing the books. Shaikh Lucknowi later accepted this. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.93, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:251, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the wife of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan died in 1319H/1901c, the situation of Bhopal had changed with the new authority having a different approach to the Islamic sciences. It was at this time Shaikh Sahaswani thought it was time to move on. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.94, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Time in Delhi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh left Bhopal in approximately 1319H and spent approximately 6-7 years in Delhi where he taught Tafsir and Hadith, he also published some books and engaged in answering the general questions of the people ie Ifta. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.381)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh continued to teach in the place of his teacher, Shaikh Muhaddith Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi after his death in Delhi and he remained in this position until he died. Allamah Sahaswani was an exceptional orator, he gave circles in explanation of the Quran for years in Delhi and many scholars of that time would sit in his lessons.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>An Example of His Exemplary Character and Being Firm Upon Islam</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh only had a one son who was born in 1288H whose name was Nazir Hussain upon the name of his teacher Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi.  The Shaikh concentrated on the well being and nurtured his son upon the Quran and Sunnah and was fervently diligent in educating and teaching him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Eventually the Shaikh married his son off at the tender age of 17. However, after just 6 months the Shaikhs son died in 1305H. This was a very difficult and testing time for the Shaikh, losing an only son at such a young age and even that after 6 months of marriage. The Shaikh remained patience and continued his teaching and worship of Allah. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255-256)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh also set a precedent in his era which was unheard of and in fact was frowned upon due to the Hindu culture and practices that were prevalent in society at the time which did not bother the Shaikh nor did he care. The Shaikh arranged another marriage for his daughter in law with his own expense. Even during this era, the Muslims were affected by the hindu culture and they would think it was a bad and disliked practice for the woman to get married again. In this way the Shaikh put into practice what he had learnt and studied with his teachers.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What the Scholars Said About Him</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Bashir was well known for his knowledge and deep insight into the affairs of the Quran and Sunnah and numerous scholars testified to this including his teachers, from there were the likes of,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi praised Shaikh Sahaswani for his knowledge of the Quran and asks the family of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan to instruct Shaikh Sahaswani to start writing a tafsir of the Quran as others will not be as capable as him. <em>(Makatib naziriyyah p.159)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hussian bin Muhsin Yamani wrote in a letter to Shaikh Shams al-Haq A’zimabadi,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“May Allah have mercy on our brother al-Allamah Muhammad Bashir who is an Alim and Muhaqqiq who holds onto the Quran and Sunnah.”</em> <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams al-Haq A’zimabadi considered Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani from amongst the foremost students of Shaikh Sayyid Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi. <em>(Ghayah al-maqsud fi hal sunan abi dawud 1:59)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allamah, the Shaikh was the epitome of knowledge and the pride of the Khalaf to the Salaf in his virtue and good qualities. He was a mujaddid of the Din in the late era, the Imam of the time and a mujtahid mutlaq.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Sahaswan in an area which has produced scholars for years and if a scholar did emerge from there, it would not be unusual or something unheard of. However, a scholar of his caliber being born in the 13/14<sup>th</sup> century gave his era radiance and his area of Sahaswan such recognition that it will be forever remembered.” (Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Rashid Rida said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was the Shaikh, Muhammad Bashir al-Sahaswani, May Allah have mercy on him, he was from the powerful Scholars of India and from the major scholars of hadith, he encompassed the various science of the Shari’ah and other than it, coupled with actions based upon knowledge, taqwa and righteousness.”</em> <em>(Muqaddimah siyanah al-insan p.14)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hassani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Shaikh al-Fazil al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Muhammad Bashir al-Umari al-Sahaswani, a famous and well know scholar of India. … he was from the major scholars. He had piety and taqwa, he was righteous and upright. He was a genius with lofty manners and he had complete mastery over Usul al-Fiqh.”</em> <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:437-438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions great praise for him, his excellent and loft qualities he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I benefitted from the Shaikh with regards to knowledge of the texts and interpretation whilst he was in Agra and Bhopal. A whole group of students in fact the whole city of Dehli would benefit from his knowledge as we would deliver lessons and lectures on various sciences and disciplines. He would deliver a lesson every day for two hours after Fajr on the explanation of the Quran and Haidth and the people would travel far and wide to come to listen to him.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi goes onto say he would would teach the students the Quran and Hadith directly and he would answer questions on various in great depth and research like a mujtahid. He would also deliver lessons after jumu’ah on the Quran and Hadith in Masjid Qadi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was only interested and fervently followed the Quran and Sunnah and he was only interested in the victory of the truth. He set the precedence of knowledge in Bhopal and in fact in the whole of India and thereby established his rank and status in terms of his knowledge and powerful deductions of ijtihad. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Badi al-Din Shah al-Rashidi al-Sindi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Shaikh of the Mashaykh. The one and only, The Muhaddith of his time, the embodiment of taqwa, the revered scholar, the one who acted upon Islam completely, Shaikh, the well known Muhammad Bashir bin Badr al-Din Sahaswani he died in 1306H (this is a typo in the book it should be 1326H) , he authored ‘Siyanah al-Insan an waswasah al-shaikh dahlan’ which caused devastation in the circles of Ahl al-Bid’ah, he also wrote 3 treatises on the visitation of the Prophets (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) grave, ‘al-Qawl al-muhkam, al-Qawl al-mansur and al-Sa’i al-mashkur (Itmam al-hujjah)’(Muqaddimah hidayah al-mustafid p.96-97) </em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Shaikhs as a Debator</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Book Debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Shaikh Sahaswani went to the Hijaz to perform Hajj he saw some of the practices of the people in their veneration of the Prophets grave and saying the visiting of the grave was pillar of Hajj. Upon his return to India he authored a book on the subject titled, <em>‘al-Qawl al-muhaqqiq al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em> Some authors have cited the book as, ‘<em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani cites the book as <em>‘al-Qawl al-muhaqqiq al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em> This is essentially a primary source as it comes directly from the Shaikhs students. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.91</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri cites the name as <em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhaqqiq al-Muhkam…</em>’ <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Indian Shaikh and researcher Shaikh Uzair Shams perhaps also relied on the latter two Mashaikh and thus also mentions the name of the book as <em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhaqqiq al-Muhkam…</em>’ Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti also mentions the book with the same name. <em>(Dabistan hadith p.219)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This led to a book debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hanafi Lucknowi of Farangi Mahalli who was of the fervent opinion of the obligation and necessity to visit the Prophets grave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi wrote a reply titled <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mubram Fi Radd al-Qawl al-Muhkam’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani wrote a counter replied titled, <em>‘al-Qawl al-Mansur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi wrote his reply to the counter reply titled, <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur Fi Radd al-Qawl al-Mansur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Lucknowi in <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur’ </em>failed to answer the the main pivotal points and in return relied heavily on Subki’s arguments and <em>‘Shifa al-Siqam.’</em> Shaikh Sahaswani knew of Hafiz Ibn Abdul Hadi’s answer to al-Subki, ie <em>‘al-Sarim al-Munki’ </em>however Shaikh Sahaswani did not have the book. After a lengthy and exhausting search the Shaikh found the book wrote a follow up titled, <em>‘Itmam al-Hujjah Ala Man Awjab al-Ziyarah Mithal al-Hujjah al-Ma’ruf al-Madhab al-Ma’thur Fi Ziyarah Sayyid al-Qabur’ </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi replied with <em>‘al-Sai’i al-Mashkur Fi Radd al-Madhab al-Ma’thur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The latters reply was all regurgitation and repetition of the same arguments. Shaikh Lucknowi relied heavily on Subki’s <em>‘Shifa al-Siqam’</em> as mentioned and on the writings of Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Haithami. Shaikh Lucknowi overlooked the counter replies and arguments and thus in this regard the book <em>‘Itmam al-Hujjah’</em> remains by far the most comprehensive reply to all of the Sufi arguments even today. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani showed the contradictions, inconsistencies and irregularities from the own words of Shaikh Lucknowi from his books and then showed Shaikh Lucknowi’s contradictions from his other books. The discussions ranged from Usul al-Hadith, Usul al-Fiqh and rijal. Shaikh Sahaswani would first quote Shaikh Lucknowi from his book <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur’</em> and then answer all of his arguments in a writing style showing a written debate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani also wrote the reply to Shaikh Lucknowi’s <em>‘Madhab al-Ma’thur’</em> but it was never published and also due to the fact that Shaikh Sahaswani felt the arguments were just irrelevant repetitions and that he had already answered the claims anyway and also penned answers in his other book <em>‘Siyanah al-Insan’</em> as his student Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92, </em><em>Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:254)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both Scholars had mutual respect for each other and did not leave the realms of the Quran and Sunnah whilst addressing each other and the detailed issues.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Debate with the Mulhid Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani was an excellent debater and was very sharp Alhamdulillah. When the disbeliever Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani Hanafi challenged Allamah Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi for a debate, however as Allamah Nazir Hussain was very busy and also frail due to age. All of his students gathered to debate and he chose and Allamah Sahaswani to have a written debate with Mirza Qadiyani Hanafi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani came to Delhi around 1312-1313H and had issued a poster challenging for a debate as Shaikh al-Allamah Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi was one of the first scholars in the whole world to declare him to be a disbeliever. In those days sometimes they would have a written debate someone would be challenged and then they would respond to each other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The responses would usually be sent to each other via messengers depending on the place of residence. What was interesting is that Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani in order to show his bold nature in an attempt to fool the people of India thought he would come to Delhi as in go to the lions den in popular proverbs.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani came from Bhopal for the debate and began the written debate with Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani. One of the treacherous tricks of Mirza Qadiyani was when the other party would accept his challenge for a debate, he would digress and diverge into the conditions of the debate so that he would have an option to runaway from the debate. The Sufis and Barelwis of today also do the same, big mouths with little actions. Anyhow, Shaikh Sahaswani was an erudite Scholar and knew of such tricks so he said at the very beginning I agree with all of your conditions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence the debate took place which was concerning the living of the Messiah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mirza Qayani presented the ayah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>when Allah said, &#8220;O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve (Surah Ale Imran:56)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani recited</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>And there is none from the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe (in Jesus) before his death. (Surah al-Nisa:159)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This obliterated Mirza Ghulam Qadiyanis points which left him to resort to red herrings and illogical and stupid distortions and manipulation. It is said Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani tried to make different excuses to leave he was unable to answer and counteract the evidence of Allamah Sahaswan, he said he had to go to the train station to pick up his father in law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate continued for a period of 6 days and after the disgraceful fleeing of Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani, Shaikh Sahaswani remained in Delhi for another 2 days and then returned to Bhopal and Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani Hanafi never set foot in Delhi again. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.94-95, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.382, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate took place approximately around in either 1309H or 1312-1313H, showing he was from amongst the first people to refute and rebut the fallacious claims of the Mulhid Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani. This was the position of the Ahl al-Hadith at the very onset and then years later the Hanafi quarters followed, perhaps because he was one of their own. The book was published around 1313H titled <em>‘</em><em>al-Haq as-sarih fi hayat al-masih.’</em> <em>Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63-64)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ahl al-Hadith historians and biographers have differed as to when the debate took place, some have said it took place in 1309H whilst others seem to think it was later in 1312H-1313H <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi, the famous Ahl al-Hadith historian and biographer said he read the book in Shaikh Abdul Majid Seharwardi’s library and that it was printed by Matba’a Ansari in Delhi in 1309H and it was 136 pages. <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66-67)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is possible and plausible, the actual written debate took place in 1309H and the book was later published in 1312-1313H.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Well Known Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh had a huge number of students due to his constant teaching in the various places he taught and travelled to and numerating all of them would be impossible however, some of them were major scholars of Hadith in their own right who themselves produced many other scholars. Some of the students include,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ahmadullah Muhaddith Partabghadhi and Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Sa’id Sharf al-Din Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il Ansari Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Iqtidar Ahmad Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Amir Ahmad Sehswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mazhar Ali Sahaswani (the Shaikhs younger brother)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Wahhab Nabina Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid E’jaz Mu’jiz Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Sattar Umrpuri (The father of Shaikh Abdul Ghaffar Hasan Rehmani)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdur Rahman Bastawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Uthman Aligharhi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Taqi Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdus Samad Bastawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mubarak Ali Akbarabadi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ma’sum Ali Akbarabadi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And manu more</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Sahaswani an an Author</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was a prolific writer as we have already mentioned in his book debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi. The Shaikh was essentially a teacher however he did write some books and what outstanding and monumental books they were. From them we have the revolutionary book which caused havoc amongst the Sufi’s, making them feel things besides their usual wajd (Sufi dances) and esoteric trances!!! </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Siyanah al-insan an waswasah al-shaikh </strong><strong>dahlan &#8211; </strong><strong><em>Protecting The Human From The Satanic Whisperings of Shaikh Dahlan.</em></strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Shaikh Sahaswani went to Hijaz to perform Hajj he had a debate on Tawhid with the Ash’arite and Shafi Mufti Shaikh Ahmad bin Zaini Dahlan. The later also authored <em>‘</em><em>Durar al-saniyyah fi radd ala al-wahhabiyyah.’ </em>Shaikh Sahaswani upon his return to India authored his book answering all of the allegations and distortions of Dahlan as well as his slanderous aspersions against Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. The book is in debate format and contains some very detailed discussions. It was first printed in 1324H/1906c has been printed many times. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92-93, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.64, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.68)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is very important to understand is that after the debate with Shaikh Dahlan, Shaikh Sahaswani returned to India and Shaikh Dahlan also authored his <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah.’</em> Some people may argue Shaikh Sahaswani’s book was only a summary of the verbal debate they had in Makkh and that <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> is not an answer to <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah.’</em> It is very evident that Shaikh Sahaswani’s book more than likely was authored after he looked a <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah’</em> because he answers it in <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> and also the fact that it was published just two years before his death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another clear evidence which supports the aforementioned point is that Shaikh Ahmad Zaini Dahlan died in 1304H, way before Shaikh Sahaswani died and therefore it naturally leads to the conclusion that Shaikh Dahlans book <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah’ </em>was authored at least before 1304H </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Rashid Rida in his introduction to the book said,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In summary it can be said about this book, not only is it a refutation of Shaikh Dahlan or the jurists who have been cited for example Shaikh Taqi al-Din al-Subki and Shaikh Ahmad bin Hajr al-Haithami al-Makki but rather it is also a refutation of all of the grave worshippers and innovators of our time and those to come.”</em> <em>(Muqaddimah siyanah al-insan p.17, cf. </em><em>Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.65-66)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> is still used and it is of great benefit due to its depth and precision in answering the claims and distortions of the innovator grave worshippers. To add the book to date has not been answered!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad bin Zaini Dahlan had other issues, one was his position on the british colonialists, his edict can be read here</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>The Wahabis – Zainee Dahlans Real Opinion &amp; The British</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-wahabis-zainee-dahlans-real-opinion-the-british/">http://www.salafiri.com/the-wahabis-zainee-dahlans-real-opinion-the-british/</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">also this is a refutation of Subki and Dahlan from the <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>Shaikh Sahaswani [1326H] on Subki &amp; Dahlan – Venerating the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam’s) Grave and the False Ijma</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/shaikh-sehsawani-on-subki-dahlan-venerating-the-messenger-of-allah-sallalahu-alayhi-wasallams-grave-and-the-false-ijma/">http://www.salafiri.com/shaikh-Sahaswani-on-subki-dahlan-venerating-the-messenger-of-allah-sallalahu-alayhi-wasallams-grave-and-the-false-ijma/</a></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> al-Burhan al-u’jab fi faridah umm al-kitab</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is on the obligation of reciting fatihah behind the Imam and again it is a very detailed book answering the points of those who say otherwise. The Shaikh would deliver a lesson everyday after Fajr on this issue for approximately 3 months. The well known hanafi scholars of Delhi would be in attendance and would note every word. The Shaikhs student Shaikh Ahmadullah Dehlawi also noted every word and later published it as a book with this title. This book was published 1327H/1909c <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252-253, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.381, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.68)</em></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Jawaz al-adhiyyah ila akhir dhul-hijjah</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is on the issue of the permissibility of sacrificing on Eid al-Adha until the end of the month, this was an odd opinion of the Shaikh in which he opposed the people of knowledge. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The contentions that is well known amongst Ahl al-Sunnah is whether it can be done for 4 days. We have already translated Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is al-Nadwi’s <em>‘Ghayah al-tahqiq fi tadhiyah ayam al-tashriq’ &#8211; </em><em>The Final Research into the issue of Slaughtering on the Days of Tashriq</em> which evidences the later view. The reader can refer to if here</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-final-research-into-the-issue-of-slaughtering-on-the-days-of-tashriq-allamah-muhammad-rais-nadwi-1430h/">http://www.salafiri.com/the-final-research-into-the-issue-of-slaughtering-on-the-days-of-tashriq-allamah-muhammad-rais-nadwi-1430h/</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh initially published a general poster in Bhopal on this issue after the death of Shaikh Nawab siddiq Hasan Khan. This was one such view which Shaikh Sahaswani erred on and his teacher Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin al-Yamani wrote a treatise answering Shaikh Sahaswani’s points as did another prominent student of Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, none other that the Imam of Hadith and Rijal in his own right, Shaikh al-Allamah Abul Mukarim Muhammad Ali Mu’i titled <em>‘Umdah al-tahqiq fi ithbat al-dhihayah ila akhir ayam al-tashriq’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani mentions Shaikh Sahaswani wrote a book collecting the evidences as well as his research into a book, however it was never published in reply to some of the points raised by the aforementioned scholars. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.95) </em></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> <em>al-Qawl al-muhkam fi ziyarah qabr al-habib al-akram</em></strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">

</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The discussions concerning these book has preceded. All three discuss the issue of visiting the Prophets (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) grave.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> al-Qawl al-mahmood fi radd jawaz as-su’d</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an answer to those who made interest and usury permissible. This book was written whilst the Shaikh was residing in Delhi and it was never published during Shaikh Sahaswani’s lifetime, it was eventually published in 1358H/1939c. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Risalah fi ithbat al-ba’iyah al-maraujah</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is concerning the permissibility of common transactions that were prevalent in greater in India during the Shaikhs time.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="9">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> al-Haq as-sarih fi hayat al-masih</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate which Shaikh Sahaswani had with Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani on the issue whether the messiah was alive, this was authored in book form with some additional points and printed with this title around 1313H.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="10">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> A’lam al-ahbar wal-ahlam innadin endal islam</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We could not find details about this book. <em>(Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.68). </em>Shaikh Badi al-Din al-Sindhi has mentioned this as the work of another author.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="11">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> al-Sayf al-maslul</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We could not find any information about this book.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="12">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Risalah fi tahqiq al-riba</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is also on the issue of interest and usury.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="13">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Ayam al-safar</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi mentions this as one of the works of Shaikh Sahaswani, other biographers have not mentioned this. <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said Shaikh Sahaswani wrote many books, some which were lost and other unprinted. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahsawani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani, who was also his student during his time in Bhopal and Delhi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He wrote many other treatises on the affairs of the Din which were attributed to some of his students.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Death</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh felt ill whilst in Delhi and passed away on the 29<sup>th</sup> of Jumada al-Ula/ Thani 1326H / 29<sup>th</sup> June 1908c at the age of 74. He was buried next to his teacher Shaikh Allamah Sayyid Nazir Hussain, in the Shaidipura graveyard. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hassani has yet made another mistake in his biographical entry for Shaikh Sahaswani where he says that he died in 1323H. <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Salafis and Ahl al-Hadith lost a great scholar who truly answered the grave worshipping innovators. It is therefore without a doubt that Shaikh Sahaswani is considered and will be known as one of the scholars who subdued and kept them at bay.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was from the scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith who they all respected. It is a shame just as the learning places and institutions were deprived of someone to replace the scholars, it was the same case with Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani, that there has been no one like him from Sahaswan or from the general Ahl al-Hadith”</em> <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah forgive him and shower him with her mercy, Amin</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Last Month, Yusuf Engineer asked the Dajjal Kazzab, Zulfiker Memon to respond to some false and absurd allegations of Muḥammad Yāsir al-Ḥanafī. These allegations were nothing but profanities, wishful thinking and an awful attempt to confuse the people with regards to the pristine and overwhelming history of the Salafīs and the Ahlul Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Dajjal Kazzab Zulfiker Memon was too busy with other “extra curriulcum activites”, he asked Yusuf Engineer to refer the matter to Abū Ḥibbān and Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī which led to the 2 part answer on the website. <strong>[edited]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Low and behold, another new and totally unknown Ḥanafī apologist going by the alias Ibn Nūr al-Shantī, desperately scampered in the defence of Muḥammad Yāsir al-Ḥanafī who was no where to be found except that he may have flapped it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What follows is a brief and quick response to the vivid imagination, deficient knowledge, distortions and total ignorance of the understanding of the scholars of their own madhab, of none other than the miskīn Ibn Nūr al-Shantī and the one who was nowhere to seen, Muḥammad Yāsir al-Ḥanafī by the brothers, Abū Ḥibbān and Abū Khuzaimah Ansārī.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>BLACK</strong> = Our response</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A dear friend, Shaykh Mohammad Yasir al-Hanafi recently shared a few of his many thoughts regarding the Salafi sect of the modern era on social media. In this post, he commented upon the false claims of this sect and demonstrated that although they attach themselves to the noble salaf in name, they are in no real terms attached to them. Rather, we say as we have been saying for some time now, that they should rightly be named pseudo-salafis. Within his post Shaykh Mohammad Yasir al-Hanafi made a point that the so called salafis of this age, who claim to be the saved sect known as Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah, are in actual fact a modern reformist movement which cannot trace its origins beyond a hundred years. It was upon this point that two crass, insults to Islamic scholarship by the names, Abu Hibban and Abu Khuzaimah whose real names are Kamran Malik and Imran Masoom, began spewing putrid lies and confusions in reply to my noble friend. These two dimwits are well known to us. A simple internet search shows that they have already been the sorry victims of a Shaykh known as Dr. Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed (hafizahullah) numerous times.2  In an attempt to defend their sect, they twisted and misrepresented many statements of the scholars of the past as well as presenting red-herrings to prove that their ilk existed at least more than a hundred years ago. They took the statements of the Imams regarding the pious salaf and those who adhered to their methodology, only to distort them to further their claims. Although they are not worthy of being responded to, for the sake of saving the general masses from the confusions they have presented, below I have clarified some issues and demonstrated; their lack of intellectual capacity, their misrepresentations, contradictions and even an example of them tampering with the words of the scholars of the past!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Well well well, it first must be said it seems like Muḥammad Yāsir al-Ḥanafī has flapped his wings all the way back to deoband and sent another new unknown “intellectually” capable representative and “noble friend” who is another new kid on the block, Ibn Nūr al-Shantī who is not only new but also has very friendly personality. We will look at his demonstrations and his intellectual capacity. Furthermore, using derogatory language will not really change the course of the discussion or the true reality, historical facts and digressive tactics. So this type of speech is nothing but a clear example of their desperation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The response is so poor which again is not surprising as the reader can gauge from the amateur title and this alone essentially seals the credibility this poor and desperate attempt to conjure up an answer, weak and feeble as it is. As such we have devised an equal and appropriate title in order for him to have a reality check.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Nūr al-Shantī being another one of the numerous deceptive alias they use and the people know all the previous alias they have been using, whereas we have always responded in the same way for years, constantly changing their names and alias which is yet another prime example and elucidation of their weakness and their inability to stand their ground, utterly shameful and embarrassing to say the least.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Also a big JazākAllāh Khair for the first time admitting their association with the deobandi scholars and their abhorrent ‘Aqīdah, more on this to follow.         </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Just a brief recap with added benefit about whether the Ahlul Ḥadīth/Salafīs are no more than a 100 years old.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Firstly, there is no basis amongst the scholars past and present to say that the Ahlul Ḥadīth or Salafīs are new movement which cannot be traced more than a hundred years back. Over a thousand years back Aḥmad Ibn Ḥanbal has said <em>“According to us the people of ḥadīth are those who act upon ḥadīth”</em> [Khatīb, al-Jām’e]. (do you want to even give you references for these well known quotes)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Over 700 years back Imām Ibn Taymīyyah has further expanded on this saying <em>“Ahlul Ḥadīth are not merely those who narrated, recorded and reported ḥadīth but also those who learnt, understood and acted upon ḥadīth”</em> [al-Majmū’]. In later times, Imām Suyūtī acknowledged that <em>“There is no greater status for the Ahlul Ḥadīth seeing that they have no other Imām save Muḥammad(</em><em>ﷺ</em><em>)” </em>[ar-Radd A’la Min Akhlad].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, a revered Imam of the deobandīs Idrīs Khandhelwī said <em>“All the Ṣahāba were Ahlul Ḥadīth” </em>[Ijtihād wat Taqlīd]. So was he mistaken when he wrote this? Why did he not say they were all deobandī or Ḥanafī? Were the Ṣahāba or the Tabi’īn Ḥanafī and if not what were they in ‘Aqīdah and furu?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of the above the Ahlul Ḥadīth have been around for over 100 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Secondly, the pillars of the dīn are built upon ikhlās. Indeed no action is accepted without sincerity as is evidenced by all the past and present books of the muhadithīn. bearing this in mind, we advise our brothers to stop hurling insults and abuse as if they are truly seeking the truth their abuse and sinning will act as a barrier.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thirdly, As for calling us dimwits etc then we can call you far worse but this would not benefit anyone, especially those who are following your attempted response to us and our response thereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, if you would like to hear from us the &#8216;deception&#8217; the ḥanafī and Deobandī scholars have committed in the dīn and it&#8217;s texts then please let us know we will write a short treatise on it especially for Oh young brothers??</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You apply mention the refutation of the “Shaikh,” seriously is there any shame left brothers, just because the “Shaikh” does not post under this pseudonym there is no denial these same individuals go around posting under all sorts of names and and now aptly praise each other, very shameful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Oh by the way are you referring to this “shaikh,” the self styled shaikh and his brothers go around posting under pseudonyms and praise him!!!! What class and men.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://almuftari.wordpress.com">https://almuftari.wordpress.com</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://ijazahfraud.wordpress.com">https://ijazahfraud.wordpress.com</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://abulhasanmuftari.wordpress.com">https://abulhasanmuftari.wordpress.com</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you so called “shaikh” had any decent knowledge he would have by now refuted, <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.asharis.com">www.asharis.com</a> and <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.maturidis.com">www.maturidis.com</a>, is it the case that his “shaikh” becomes “shakiness”. A lack thereof clearly demonstrates his true reality and depth of knowledge.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part One</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">[Their feeble “refutation” was posted as two parts on their website]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They began by making a personal, uncouth remark regarding us, saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“The perpetrator of these remarks were carried out by neonate, new kids on the block with new found levels of testosterone, namely Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Strange it is that men in their late thirties should feel threatened by youngsters, even more so that they worry their own diminishing testosterone levels are struggling to keep up. Perhaps by the end of this rebuttal they will be booking in for hormone replacement therapy in order to conjure a reply to us. By virtue of such an introduction one can already assert that their “refutation” will not carry much substance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They then advise the brethren of their ilk not to engage with us as they also fear their incompetence in keeping up with us, a compliment we will accept graciously:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alhamdullilāh, since you have accepted you are &#8216;youngsters&#8217; then know your position and manzilah in the circles of ilm. The reality is that you are youngsters in more ways than one not least that your manzilah in ilm is extremely weak and your statements very generalised, loose and weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Everyone knows what new kid on the block refers too and it has nothing to do with age, if we must mention it for clarification, mundane as it seems – it refers to new people on the scene which also fits Ibn Nūr al-Shantī. Also we will see how you apply your own words oh young one, <span style="color: #ff0000;">“Perhaps by the end of this rebuttal they will be booking in for hormone replacement therapy in order to conjure a reply to us.”</span> Or did you mean Muḥammad Yāsir al-Ḥanafī has already gone and undergoing his treatment!!! In Deoband!!! Tut tut dreadful, anyhow was he incapable of responding? This feeble response is a testimony of his lack of knowledge and the need for you to run to his aid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Inshallāh we will show this further on. So Oh young ones!! know your station and security will be for you if you remain silent for &#8216;the one who remains silent has indeed reached salvation&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thumma Alhamdullilah we have never feared in keeping up with you and anyone who seeks with justice shall see that we have refuted and responded to your elders for around 20 years and have had very little by way of worthy response, if at all and that which has been authored by your “shaikh” and Amīr is disgraceful and a travesty on the sacred sciences as you shall come to know inshaAllāh. Once again please speak to your elders before you open the hornets nest with us as your elders know us well by what we have written in the past, wa lillah hil hamd.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“The brothers should understand that attempting a refutation against the aforementioned individuals, the Deobandis and Hanafis will result in a subsequent response from them which may be difficult for those brothers to rebut and thereby causing embarrassment on behalf of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah. It is indeed easy quoting what Ashraf Ali Thanvi said etc but when accusations are levied against us these brothers are nowhere to be seen.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Besides portraying the ahnaf as villains and falsely proclaiming to be adherents of Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah, they admit that their clan members are good for nothing other than hurling taunts and misquoting the noble elders of Deoband when they themselves live in glasshouses. What a shame it is that they did not take their own advice, a lesson they are about to learn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">OUTRIGHT LIE! we have never admitted that <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;clan members are good for nothing other than hurling taunts and misquoting the noble elders of Deoband&#8221;</span>. please show us where you have taken this as our quote from us? If you cannot show us this you have either lied upon us, misquoted us or at the least are not capable of writing anything worthy of note from the bāb of ‘ilm, let alone to refute us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">we wait for your repentance for this lie.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A quote is then given of a Sheikh Muhammad Fakhir attempting to refute Ash’ari’s. This quote is then fallaciously utilised in order to support the claim that the salafi sect was around two-hundred and seventy-two years ago. There is no mention of salafi in the quote, not even as a word never mind in reference to an entire sect of people. Abu Hibban and Abu Khuzaimah simply claim that this man was a “bona fide salafi” and by that expect a person to believe that the salafi sect is over 100 years old. They then link a bogus document compiled by them claiming that the founding ulama of Deoband were supporters of the East India Company. This document is not worth the pixels it is presented upon, simply by the fact that the struggles of the ulama of Deoband, for the liberation of India against the British are well known. Perhaps they should address why the founding father of the pseudo-salafi movement in the Indian Subcontinent, Nawab Siddiq Hassan Khan of Bohpal was under employment by the British.3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed, this is dodging the main points and glossing over a pivotal point, Ibn Nūr al-Shantī statement is riddled with oceans of confusion when he attempts to say the quote is fallacious, not only did he fail to understand the point but goes on another wild goose chase and making some horrific claims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Firstly, he should have bothered to check the biography of Shaikh Muḥammad Fākhir (1164H) and he would have learnt that he was a bona fide Salafī and now we have to show these young scholars and Ḥanafī apologists the basic of the basics just because they are so intellectually capable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That’s some homework for you and let us see your actual levels of scholarship that you so desperately wanted to demonstrate but yet failed miserably.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">as-Salafī !!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">as-Salafī !!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">as-Salafī !!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">last time we checked, Mawlāna Abdul Haȳ al-Ḥasanī was a Ḥanafī and he very clearly said that Shaikh Muḥammad Fākhir was a SALAFĪ,  ok one more time, just in case you missed it,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture3.png"><img class=" wp-image-1902 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture3.png?resize=391%2C244" alt="Picture3" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture3.png?resize=300%2C187 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture3.png?resize=100%2C62 100w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture3.png?w=706 706w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is even more astonishing and another outstanding example of Ibn Nūr al-Shantī’s scholarship is that, the author of Nuzhatul Khawāṭir, Mawlāna Abdul Haȳ al-Ḥasanī died in 1341H / 1923ce which is just under 100 years and thus he must have authored Nuzhatul Khawāṭir prior to that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This leads to the point that let alone the Salafīs and Ahlul Ḥadīth being 100 hundred years old, an author who died almost a hundred years old mentions an Imām of the Salafīs, namely Shaikh Muḥammad Fākhir who was born in 1120H and died in 1164H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask the young new kid on the block, Ibn Nūr al-Shantī, when are you going to join your comrade, Muḥammad Yasīr al-Ḥanafī for hormone replacement therapy, surely you remember what you said, <span style="color: #ff0000;">“Perhaps by the end of this rebuttal they will be booking in for hormone replacement therapy in order to conjure a reply to us.”</span>  Let us know we will pay for the therapy!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This said, the statement of this great Salafī Imām in his book on ‘Aqīdah is a refutation of the Ashā’irah and at the same instance shows the existence of the Salafīs and Ahlul Ḥadīth two hundred and seventy-two (272) years ago, which again proves our initial point. We pray this is has quenched your search for ilm Mr. Ibn Nūr al-Shantī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Two quotes are given of Allamah Sam’ani and Allamah Ibn al-Athir stating that people held the titles of salafi by way of attributing themselves to the salaf. This still does not prove the claim that this sect as a collective movement and the things that they teach is more than a hundred years old.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They then say;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Rather Allamah Safarini has explained that the later scholars who adopted the way of the companions, Tabieen and Taba Tabieen are known as the Salaf (Lawameh al-Anwar (1120).”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">First of all, it seems Abu Hibban and his chum have no idea how to reference; either that or they took the above quote from a secondary source because it is so poorly cited.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nonetheless, the quote was located and we found that this is a complete distortion of what Allamah Safarini said! What he actually said was;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“What is intended by the term “madhab of the salaf” is what the noble sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were upon, as well as the tabi’een, those who followed them and the Imams of the deen who witnessed them and recognised their greatness and virtue in the religion and from whom people took speech before them [those who came after the Imams] from.” Scan below</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Further on they say;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Imam Ibn Taimiyyah (728H) and Hafidh ibn Rajab (795H) have included Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal (241H), Imam Shafi’ee (204H), Ishaq Ibn Rahawaihah (221H) and Imam Abu Ubaid (224H) to be from amongst the Salaf.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Here they very clearly acknowledged that the first 3 generations of people were referred to as the salaf and then further on they gave references to Lawam’i of Allamah Saffarini! If Allamah Saffarini was stating here that those from the first 3 generations were regarded as the salaf then what of their claim earlier that Allamah Saffarini said that those who follow the 3 generations are the salaf? Correct your alteration of Allamah Saffarini’s text and you’ll correct your contradiction. Bear in mind that earlier they used somebody refuting the Ash’aris as evidence for the age of this Salafi sect, further on we’ll demonstrate what Imam Saffarini said regarding the Ash’aris.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A list of books is then given in which Abu Hibban and his stooge Abu Khuzaimah claim that they and their co-cultists have taken their religion from.  Claiming to be an adherent of the way of Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (rahimahullah), this can be enumerated in many directions and insha’Allah will be done so by many more writers soon. Simply claiming to adhere to a set of books from the salaf does not then prove that his sect originated from that time, this is a red-herring that the swindler has put forward.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">An attack is then placed upon Shaykh Mohammad Yasir al-Hanafi on why he. as well as the elders of Deoband, adhered to the methodology of Imam Abu Hanifah in fiqh yet follow Imam Abul Hasan al-Ashari (rahimahullah) and Imam Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (rahimahullah) in aqidah. He questions;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“&#8230;we ask you, what is wrong with the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">May Allah help these poor men; they don’t even have that much understanding. Luckily for them Shaykh Mohammad Yasir al-Hanafi has already clarified this long before we were aware of this feeble attempt at a refutation:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Most of you will probably have heard the pseudo-salafis saying to you: &#8220;Akhī! Why don&#8217;t you follow Imām Abu Hanīfah (rahimahullah) in Aqīdah? You only follow him in Fiqh. In Aqīdah you are Ashā&#8217;irah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This sort of rhetoric, I&#8217;ve heard several times and to be honest, it&#8217;s getting rather boring.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In my series, &#8220;Is Allāh above the Throne?&#8221;, I&#8217;ve proven that Asha&#8217;irah/Māturidiyyah were the people who protected the Aqīdah of the Ahl Al-Sunnah, including the Creed of Imām Abu Hanifah, Imām Abu Yusuf and Imām Muhammad (rahimahumallah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There was a typo in the reference it should have been (1/20), exactly the same way your disastrous spelling of Salafī Research Institute (see later), neither is there any distortion yet since you have nothing academic to say but to refer to typo errors, which shows your actual level of scholarly research and your apology skills, just a joke to be quite frank but what can one expect from such “scholars.” Furthermore, explain to us from where are you obtaining the creed of Abū Ḥanīfah and which books? This is so that we can respond to you fully when you question whether Allah is above the Throne or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Just like Allāh had taken the work of the Qurrā in Qira&#8217;āt, e.g Imām &#8216;Asim Al-kūfi etc, and we attribute ourselves to them in Qira&#8217;āt, in hadith Allāh has taken the work of the Muhaddithūn. Similarly in creed, Allāh has used these noble people to protect the aqidah of Ahl al-Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Please evidence with asanīd your claim by establishing that the Ash’arī creed and interpretation of it was exactly like Abū Ḥanīfahs? We await your scholarly research on this Oh young One.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">There is NO CONTRADICTION between the creed of Imām Abu Hanifah (rahimahullah) and the Ashā&#8217;irah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sorry but that is just a blatant lie. According to Mawlāna Anwar Shāh Kashmirī Deobandī this is certainly not the case, see below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If Ash’arī &#8216;interpreted&#8217; the creed then how can you be certain there is &#8216;no contradiction&#8217; as we assume you did not have an &#8216;interpretation&#8217; from Imām Abū Ḥanīfah himself in the first place? Or Did Imām Abū Ḥanīfah have his own interpretation in which case what was the need for Ash’arīs interpretation?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The reason we attribute ourselves to Ashā&#8217;irah is because, compared to the deviated sects that occurred in the time of Imām Abu&#8217;l Hasan Al-Ash&#8217;arī (who came AFTER Imām Abu Hanifah), we take his interpretations, which is the interpretation of Ahl Al-Sunnah. It doesn&#8217;t mean our creed is now contrary to Imām Abu Hanifah&#8217;s! It is merely because Imām Al-Ash&#8217;arī did that work which was needed at his time, just as Imām Abu Hanifah compiled Fiqh, which was the need in his time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hence, in creed ALL FOUR schools are the same, they are all Ahl al-Sunnah, whether they are Ashā&#8217;irah, Maturidiyyah or true Athariyya.”4</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You are hiding behind the generality of the term of Ahlus Sunnah and in actuality have no substance to your claim. Please be specific. Maybe you are ignorant of the differences in creed between these three sects?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We mentioned earlier that we would show what Imam Saffarini’s views were upon the Ash’ari and Maturidi schools. Let us present to you exactly what he said from the very book, Lawami al-Anwar, that the two amateurs quoted (or misquoted) above. One may then wonder whether they’ve actually even read this book:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah are three groups: The Athariyya (textualists) and their Imam is Ahmad bin Hanbal (may Allah be pleased with him), the Ash’aris and their Imam is Abul Hasan al-Ash’ari (Allah have mercy upon him), the Maturidis and their Imam is Abu Mansur al-Maturidi.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Please tell us who are the Atharīyyah that Saffarini is mentioning? Your own quote shows that the Salafī/Atharī/Ahlul Ḥadīth were all around well over a years ago? Or do you now dispute with that which you have quoted?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They make an attack on the ulama of Deoband and their affiliations to the Sufi tariqahs, he says;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Also can you explain which book of the Salaf or their teaching did the Deobandi’s acquire the Sufi tariqah, Chistiyyah or the Naqshbandiyyah from?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is not a matter that needs to be proven from the salaf,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, it does. Is it not part of the Sharia’h and are the turuq not seen as part of the deen? why is it that your elders from deoband have claimed that the turuqs can be traced back to the 4 rightly guided Khulāfa yet you claim they need not proving from the Salaf? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> the turuq are methodologies of tasawwuf which were developed later and used as a means to the science of tasawwuf, the both of them should read volumes 10-11 of Ibn Taymiyyah’s Majmu al-Fatawa where he has discussed this issue and others like it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You are misleading in your quote. Does Imām Ibn Taymīyyah say that the turuq are based on Sunnah? Or has he in fact not authored works against the Ṣūfīyyah and their turuq let alone being from one himself as you allege?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This issue will be discussed in detail in Shaykh Mohammad Yasir’s series on tasawwuf which is due to be released on the Hanafi Fiqh Channel. Nonetheless, since you’ve asked where the ulama of Deoband took these tariqahs from, please ask the following Imams also:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Muwaffaq Ibn Qudamah – a follower of the Qadiri Tariqah5</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abd’al Ghani al-Maqdisi – a follower of the Qadiri Tariqah6</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah – a follower of the Qadiri Tariqah and others7</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Dhahabi – a follower of the Suhrawardi Tariqah8</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Shawkani – a follower of the Naqshbandi Tariqah9</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once again you have done a very good cut and paste job and this is not part of scholarly research. You have mentioned these scholars and have not quoted any chain or transmission report to show the basis of the claim. As an example, it is very widely known that Imam Ibn Taymiyyah explained the Ṣūfī being the Ṣiddīq one who strived to excel in Zuhd and worship as discussed in his Majmū’ al-Fatāwa wherein he discussed the Ahlus Ṣuffa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Unfortunately, new wannabe scholars on the block like yourself misused used his words and have attempted to attach him to a Ṣūfī Tarīqah. You can refer to his numerous Fatāwa and Rasā’il about tasawwuf, Ṣūfism and his Kalām on the likes of Mansūr al-Halāj to see where he placed Ṣūfism that was around in his era.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> You have failed to mention evidence of what you rely on to say he was a Qadrī but the likes of yourself usually rely on the points that have been made by the likes of George Makdisi as recorded in the American Journal Of Arabic Studies [for some reason you did not reference this properly, why?] that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyahs teachers are traced back to Mūwafaq ud-Dīn Ibn al-Qūdāmah who was a student of Abdul Qādir Jilānī and that Imām Ibn Taymīyyah praised Abdul Qādir Jilānī and benefitted from his works. Surely even you can agree that this does not of itself make Imām Ibn Taymīyyah a follower of the Qādrī Tarīqah? Please provide direct evidence with sanad to show that Imām Ibn Taymāyyah said that he was a Qādrī and then we can investigate this issue further. This example just shows the level of your scholarly research.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah was very clear on the Ṣūfīs and George Makdisi himself writes about him quoting from Imām Ibn Taymīyyah&#8217;s al-Fatāwa, Kitab ‘Ilm al-Sulūk, that he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“That corruption in beliefs and actions that befell these people (the Sufis) necessitated that many groups totally rejected the original path of the Sufis until those who erred were of two types: one type that affirms its being right and also wrong and another type that negates its being right and wrong, positions on which there are the people of theology and fiqh. The only correct position is affirming that which is, in this matter and others, in agreement with the Book and the Sunnah, and rejecting that which is, in this matter and others, contrary to the Book and the Sunnah.” </em>[translation taken from deobandī website]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is abundantly clear for Imām Ibn Taymīyyah&#8217;s benchmark was that which was in agreement with the book and Sunnah and he criticised the later Ṣūfīs and their innovations.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan al-Qinnawji (Bhopali) [founder of the ahle-hadith/salafi sect of the Indian Subcontinent] – a follower of the Naqshbandi Tariqah. He himself states that he and his forefathers were all Naqshbandi sufis as well as having authorisations in other tariqahs also. In the same passage, he too attests to the fact that Imam al-Shawkani was a Naqshbandi sufi (he had great admiration for him).10 Scan below:</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Many more examples can be given but for the sake of brevity we end it here. Please give us your verdicts on these a’immah for following the sufi tariqahs, especially the founder of your sect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Then in response to Shaykh Mohammad Yasir al-Hanafi stating that the salafiyya do not have any proper madaris in the UK except for a few crash courses, he says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“The Salafis and Ahlul Hadith have been teaching in their respective madrassahs for years well before Bury and Dewsbury appeared on the scene. Madrassah’s were and are well established throughout the United Kingdom with names like Madrassah Salafiyyah. We would surely know as we studied in them in the early 80’s and the teaching was regular and consistent from the mid 70’s&#8230;The level and methods of teaching were evident and widespread where students would deliver lectures and sermons as training in the annual conferences.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We found no official records of any established madrasah by the name “Madrassah Salafiyyah” and what classes they have been running since the 70’s. We looked for your “YouTube videos” that you spoke of and found nothing except Green Lane Masjids usual suspects. Where can we find the evidences that these are official and regular lessons? Even more so where is the proof that these classes have been running since the 70’s? Send us a nice prospectus if you get the chance. These lectures and sermons you speak of seem to be very much the “crash course halaqas” that Shaykh Mohammad Yasir mentioned. Your Friday khutba’s and evening maktab classes don’t count as official madaris on par with the various Darul Ulooms up and down the country. You claim there are well established Salafi madrassahs throughout the UK yet you only named one which is not even on record. The Darul Ulooms up and down the UK teach their students the sahih sitta with the chains of narration all the way back to the Imams. What is the proof that this Madrassah Salafiyya taught the sahih sitta. We challenge you to come forward and provide your chains just as Shaykh Mohammad Yasir and his fellow Deobandi graduates have.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And where were you hoping to find these &#8216;official records&#8217;? Are you sure you did not pop down to your local council house and check instead the register of births and marriages? This of course would not surprise us at the least seeing the level of your scholarly research.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We Alhamdullilāh can collect lists of names and witnesses of people who attended Madrasah Salafīyyah since the 70&#8217;s but simply do not have the &#8216;spare time&#8217; like you to waste on trying to establish this point for you. It&#8217;s not a matter from the pillars of the dīn or fiqh so you can carry on &#8216;researching &#8216; it and then produce your findings which we can then look at.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, since when has this even been an issue, but when nothing ilmi is found an ignorant point such as this is presented. How will you having more madāris make any difference. Little do you remember or realize even if such as the case as you argue then how come a very small few number of us that have no ilm according to you, that you have yet to answer us till this day and our dawah is getting stronger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A vast number of Deobandīs are becoming Salafīs everyday and you know it when the reverse is far and few, if that!!!! So we wonder what affect your madāris are having</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The two salafi stooges, Abu Hibban and Abu Khuzaimah begin their nonsensical tirade with the following words:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“In response to our dedication and efforts the hanafis deobandis of Bury and Dewsbury decided to setup Tablighi organisations against the Salafi Dawah.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">No tablighi organisation was set up solely as a response to the salafi dawah. The efforts of tabligh have been present in the UK as early as the 70’s and that is documented unlike their earlier claim!11 </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They then make a very strange claim without any evidence, they say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“It is a historical fact that the people of truth are always less in number”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What you say is a very strange claim is actually very well documented, Aare there not a vast number ḥadīth in the ṣihā and other than them which talk of the 73 sects and one being the saved one? Are there not many āyahs which state that the majority do not remember, understand and believe? Were the companions not a minority in nearly all their struggles including the battle of Badr? In reality it is you who has decided to be blinded and take our words out of context.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, Abdullāh Ibn Mas’ūd (may Allaah be pleased with him) said to ‘Amr ibn Maymūn:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “The Jamā’h is that which is in accordance with the truth, even if you are on your own.”</em> [Narrated by Ibn ‘Asākir 2/322/13, Sharḥ Usūl al-‘Eitiqād Ahlus Sunnah of Imām al-Lālikā’ī no:160]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By quoting the above we do not mean that the masses are innovators or upon kufr. Rather what is intended is that those upon the truth in any given time are always attached to the book, Sunnah and Salaf of the ummah, regardless of there number. Then this is what Imām Ibn Taymīyyah was referring to in the quote you have given of him below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is another fallacious claim that the pseudo-salafis like to present in order to justify and explain away to their followers as to why they are always few in number in every place. They make this claim that the people of truth are few just to satisfy themselves. However there are various ahadith to prove that the people of truth, the victorious group are always in the majority. Let the pseudo-salafis of this age ponder over the following statement of their hallmark of haq, Ibn Taymiyyah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“The saved-sect is described as being Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah. They are the overwhelming multitude and the great majority (al-jumhur al-akbar wa’l sawad al-a’zam). The remaining sects are followers of aberrant opinions, schism, innovations and [deviant] desires. None even comes near to the number of the saved sect, let alone its calibre. Rather, each such sect is extremely small (bal qad takunu’l firqatu minha fi ghayati’l-qillah)” [Majmu al-Fatawa, 3/345-346]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If by your quote you mean that Imām Ibn Taymīyyah is saying, for example, that out of a hundred men from various sects of Islām one claims that Allah is above the throne and 99 claim he somewhere other then that and by default the 99 are the Sawād al-A&#8217;zam [the great majority and saved sect] then this is misguided and a lie upon Imām ibn Taymīyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Please refer to numerous writings of Imām Ibn Taymīyyah not least including his Iqtiḍa, al-Qā’idatul Jalīlah and that which has been mentioned in his Fatāwa. What Imām Ibn Taymīyyah is clearly NOT DOING, but which you are trying to establish through him is that the vast majority of the UMMAH regardless of creed and belief are the saved sect or Ahlus Sunnah Wal jamā’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Scans below:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Furthering on with their nonsense, they say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“In light of this one may ponder how the Salafi Dawah is gaining strength if they lack the Madaris as Mr Yasir claims. A further point to note is to ponder how is it that Hanafis are embracing the Salafi Dawah and not the reverse?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The salafi dawah is gaining strength due to the lies and propaganda that you spread! Distorting issues and presenting them to the lay people to beguile them and capture them into your web of lies. You dupe them by asking questions such as “Are you Muhammadi or Hanafi?” and their likes. Many pseudo-salafis are now returning back to the traditional methods of Islam after the nakedness of the lies the pseudo-salafis tell has been exposed, the inconsistencies in their methodologies and the twisted beliefs that they hold. In fact, it must be the authors in question to whom this is in reply to who are shivering in their “cotton khuffs” at the major turnaround that is taking place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They then pick up on Shaykh Mohammad Yasir’s comment that they have no link to the salaf. This is brushed aside by them claiming that this has already been dealt with. In reality they have not addressed what Shaykh Mohammad Yasir said and resort to their usual use of red-herrings to escape. Shaykh Mohammad Yasir was indicating towards their lack of asaneed back to the salaf. How can one claim to be upon the methodology of the salaf yet not have any physical connection to them? What is the guarantee that what these pseudo-salafis claim to be upon, has been conveyed to them authentically? Simply claiming to adhere to a set of books does not ensure that they are understood correctly and it certainly does not ensure any real connection to the authors, a very devious way of avoiding a very strong challenge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once again you have misunderstood what was being said and are so blinkered in your own madhab that you have forgotten your own principals. You talk of &#8216;lack of asanīd&#8217; so we ask that the bulk of your so called fatāwa in your fiqh books ascribed to Imām Abū Ḥanīfah do you have an isnād for them? The answer is no, so you have fallen on your own sword. As for our methodology having no isnād back to the salaf then you have just made this assertion and not provided evidence for this baseless claim. Please provide evidence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A claim is then made;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Meanwhile we the Salafis can bring forward our proofs which emphasises that our Manhaj and Aqidah has not been diluted but rather it is a mirror reflection of the Companions, Tabieens and Taba-Tabieens.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We’ll take you up on that and we question you, why out of all of the issues that we have put forth in our videos starting from the “True Creed of The Salaf” series where it has been shown that Ibn Taymiyyah held anthropomorphic beliefs such as saying Allah is seated upon His Throne,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Do you mean the oft quoted report from Taqī al-Ḥiesnī from Alī Ḥasan &#8230;&#8230;.? If so even you will know that this is a major fabrication on Imām Ibn Taymīyyah.  Clarify your allegation against Imām Ibn Taymīyyah so we can respond accordingly. Scholarly research and writing should not be done in such haste as you have done throughout without any referencing. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, Imām Ibn Taymīyyah in discussing the saying of Imām Mujāhid about the sitting on the Throne states:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is incumbent to differentiate between what has authentically been reported from the words of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and what has been authentically relayed from other than him…” </em>[Daru at-Ta’āruḍi al-‘Aql Wan-Naql [5/238]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then what is stated above is what Imām Ibn Taymīyyah believed. As for the sitting then Imām Ibn Taymīyyah and the creed of the Salaf is clear that we take Allāhs attributes and actions without making any similarity or explaining its kayfīyyah. So why are you assuming sitting here is like the sitting of creation? In actual fact it is you who has the anthropomorphic mentality and not Imām Ibn Taymīyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">that Allah moves etc, the taymiyyun (which the pseudo-salafis of today are) claiming that Allah’s attributes are to be taken literally;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafī scholar Shaikh Mullā Alī Qārī clearly says the one who denies the Istiwa of Allāh Haqīqatan is a Mu’ṭail ie a Jahmī one who denies the Ṣifāt of Allāh and then goes on to mention this is in full agreement and conforms exactly to what Imām Abū Ḥanīfah said (see scan below)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you now say Mawlāna Anwar Shāh Kashmīrī was an anthropomorphic and that he is like the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> &#8220;the taymiyyun (which the pseudo-salafis of today are) claiming that Allah’s attributes are to be taken literally, that allah moves etc&#8221;;</span> He also says the nuzūl is Haqīqī totally contrary to what these new kids are claiming. One advice would be to at least get your positions in order or is it a case that your totally confused as per usual and misleading and beguiling the general Ḥanafī brethren!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Please respond to this point.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also critiques the ASH’ARĪ creed in relation to Ṣifāt and announces that ibn Taymiyyah was upon the correct way. What will you respond to him</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As a side point, note well, Ibn Nūr al-Shantī’s “shaikh” Abul Ḥasan Ḥussain Aḥmed’s paternal grandfathers brother, Shaikh Assadar Alī [d.2005ce] who he learnt from and gained an ijāzah from, took ijāzah and fawā’id from Mawlāna Anwār Shāh Kashmīrī. Thus Abul Ḥasan Ḥussain Aḥmed has a strong connection with Mawlāna Anwar Shāh Kashmīrī yet here find things quite the opposite. Ibn Nūr al-Shantī hope you noted that well!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people are filled with so much hatred and animosity for the Salafīs and Ahlul Ḥadīth that they can not even add the name Muḥammad to Shaikh al-Albānī’s name and they always do this deliberately and they do not even have the common decency to add the word Shaikh to his name. The readers will note, disrespecting and using derogatory terms are the norm for these people and Alhamdulillāh we will always refer to their grandfather as Shaikh Assadar Alī and May Allāh have mercy upon him, Amīn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">regarding which 50 quotes from the salaf and khalaf were given to prove the contrary, all the way down to a “scholar” of the ahle-hadith sect by the name of Inayatullah al-Athari claiming that Isa (alayhisalaam) was born with a father (nauzubillah)!12  Also their chief scholar, Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan praising Ibn Arabi and quoting him saying that Rasulullah (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) hugged Ibn Hazm and became united into one entity with him, then later claiming that this is nothing strange!13  Or how about him innovating a type of salah known as “salah kun faya kun”?14  Bear in mind that he has claimed in his introduction that all the practices in his book are proven from the Qur’an and sunnah, please do defend your Imam and show us how this is so.There is much for you to answer, let us concede for arguments sake that the salafi sect is older than 100 years, why pick on this minute issue and not address the more pressing issues which we have already challenged you upon?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What an ignorant statement, this has been addressed by the publishers in the introduction and thus the reason for the response. We do not need to answer anything of yours because it well known on the internet world that you people are arch liars and you demonstrate this yourselves but constantly changing your pseudonyms and to this today you are not men enough to write anything thing with your kunyahs attributed to your real name, this is the men that you are.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of your stuff has been answered in the aforementioned websites Asharis.com and Maturidis.com, we wait for your answer to them or even better let see if you run to your “shaikh’ who has till day not answered the most vehement refutation on the 2 sects mentioned above. In fact we know that he will never have the guts to answer anything fro the 2 websites above as he is scared.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We the Salafīs have no madāris and we have not been taught but at the same time you can not answer or detailed arguments to you, this is very shameful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Would you like us to mention the hundreds of statements of the deobandī ḥanafī scholars and their abhorrent ‘Aqīdah filled with shirk and kufr for example,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlāna Aḥsan Ghilānī writes, <em>“We do not deny or reject seeking help from the souls of the Auliyā, hence so if a believer inflicted with troubles seeks help from good souls then what verse of the Qurān or Hadīth refutes this.”</em> (Hāshīyah Suwāneh Qāsimī 1/332)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and Mawlāna Gangohī said, <em>&#8220;With regards to Sayyid Sahib, Allāh was incarnate in him (i.e. he was in annihilation with Allāh).!!!&#8221;</em> (Arwah at-Thalātha (pg.185) and Sayyīd Sāhib is non other than the infamous Shaikh Imdādullāh Muhājir Makkī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and the statement a student of Mawlāna Rashīd Aḥmad Gangohī said, <em>&#8220;I saw in a dream the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) took me to the bridge of Ṣirāṭ and I saw the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) was falling over the bridge so I saved him.&#8221; </em>(Balāgahtul Khairan pg.15) of Mawlāna Ḥussain Alī of Bicharan from the district of Mianwali, Punjāb Pākistān)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And here is more just in case you have time on our hands which we think you do because your vivid imagination and wishful thinking, read the following, <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-aqidah-of-the-deobandis-shaikh-talib-ur-rehman/">http://www.salafiri.com/the-aqidah-of-the-deobandis-shaikh-talib-ur-rehman/</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And how about the following, what your deobandī scholar Mawlāna Muḥammad Amīn Safdar Okārwi said, the Qaḍi’s that were violent against Imām Aḥmad ie ordered his lashes were Mu’tazilī in ‘Aqīdah and Ḥanafī in furu. See scan</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Tajallīyāt Safdar [2/68], Edn ? arranged by Mawlāna N’aīm Aḥmad, Maktabah Imdādīyyah, Multān, Pākistān]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So what are you on about, you have Mu’tazilī’s in your chains who were mulḥids and heretics infact Kāfirs!!! You are definitely going to need 2 doses of hormone replacement therapy now!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Take a look now at this interesting trap that they threw themselves into. In a desperate attempt to attack the ulama of Deoband via our adherence to the Hanafi fiqh, they attack an individual who is found in certain chains of transmitting legal rulings, they say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;Only one needs to read the books of rijal and history to understand the Salaf within the deobandis and hanafis. For instance we can study the example of Abu Mute’a al-Balkhi and his beliefs (Refer to Lisan ul-Mizan Vol. 2, Mizan ul-E’tidaal Vol. 1 and Kitab al-Kunna Vol. 2 of ad-Daulabi).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;Yes Abu Mutee al- Balkhi is a questionable individual but the dim-witted salafis fail to realise that this individual is present in the chain of a narration they like to utilise to further their twisted aqidah; the alleged statement of Imam Abu Hanifah in which he apparently subscribes to the view that Allah is literally above His Throne! They use this in their lessons and attacks on those who do not hold the same twisted beliefs that they do and they print this on their propaganda leaflets. Shaykh Mohammad Yasir al-Hanafi has already clarified this issue and demonstrated that the self-taught muhaddith Nasir al-Din al-Albani, among his many contradictions, has classified Abu Mutee al-Balkhi weak in one place when it suited him but then has authenticated him in another place when it suited him!15 Point fingers at the ahnaf for utilising his narrations in fiqh but can you explain why you accept him in aqidah? We look forward to your answer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not accept Balkhī as a narrator but the fact remains that you are trying your utmost to run away from him and his quote in relation to Abū Ḥanīfah making hukm of kufr on the one who does not say Allah is above the Throne. It is amazing that you have abandoned not only Balkhī but also Fiqh al-Akbar which until recently was hailed as one of Abū Ḥanīfahs ‘Aqīdah works and you can refer to your “shaikhs” work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You have even opposed your own major scholars of ḥadīth. Please explain why your Mawlāna Anwar Shāh Kashmirī states in his explanation of Tirmidhī that the ‘Aqīdah of is found in Fiqh al-Akbar and that Abū Muṭ’i al-Balkhī according to him is truthful. SubhanAllāh it is thus established that Mawlāna Anwar Shāh Kashmīrī held this saying of Allāh being above his Throne. We disagree with some of the language and the usage of his terminology in his explanation of this ḥadīth but this quote is sufficient to break your back and abandon your founding fathers inshaAllāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is so baffling that Ibn Nūr al-Shantī from his scholarship and research has great difficulty in understanding basic points, is not Abū Muṭ’i al-Balkhī trustworthy and truthful according to you, if not then please mention your clear position on him and no vague terms like questionable. Secondly he was cited as an evidence against you and lastly as mentioned above Abū Muṭ’i al-Balkhī was declared truthful according to your Ḥanafī Mawlāna Anwar Shāh Kashmīrī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is more, the Imām of the Ḥanafīs in ‘Aqīdah, Abū Mansūr al-Māturīdī clearly says that Fiqh al-Akbar is authentically attributed to Imām Abū Ḥanīfah which subsequently contains the famous statement, whoever says I do not if Allāh is above the Heavens or on the Earth he is a Kāfir. Thus, this is authentically established from Imām Abū Ḥanīfah as per the Imām of ‘Aqīdah of the Hanafīs, Abū Mansūr al-Māturīdī. See scan below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is indeed a sufficient reason for these new kids on the block to know their manzilah and it also abrogates everything this young one because it seems he has no idea what he is talking about. Now the onus lies with you, make your bayan on this issue.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, this constant foul mouthed language and calling us dimwits etcetra will not change the facts and reality but if it makes the young ones feel more mature, masculine and macho then all we can say is to join your comrade for hormone replacement therapy, we are sure he must be feeling lonely and tired after flapping his wings all the way back to deoband.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Not only can we respond appropriately but we know how to deal with the likes of these unknown new kids on the block, Ibn Nūr al-Shantī, who besides being totally unknown has nothing to show his worth and if he wants to know ours then let him ask his “shaikh” about his discussions with us spanning years back.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have inshaAllāh responded to the points without digressing however at times even the ignorant ones warrant some sort of response and stern words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">After much further specious statements with no validity or reality, they come onto a closing remark that I would like to pick up on;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“This is the very deoband which was established in a Hindu city where their respective goddess would be worshipped and venerated. It is also the very deoband which was formed through the donations of Hindus and the British East India Company.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If Deoband is to be criticised due to it formerly being a Hindu city where idol worship took place, shouldn’t Makkah al-Mukarramah also be criticised by them since no less than 360 idols were worshipped there during the days of ignorance? No evidence is provided to prove that Deoband was a Hindu city but even if it was, it is a matter of pride that our forefathers were capable of taking it from a Hindu city of idol worship into a bastion and fortress of Islamic practice and teaching. I sense some strong scents of jealousy from the envious ones that I write in response to. As for the claim that Deoband was funded by Hindus and the East India Company, once again no evidence is provided yet there is evidence which I have provided above that their sect was indeed funded by the very East India Company that they speak of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No point refuting your scholarly research and qiyās above. Is this the same Deoband where it is claimed the Prophet regularly visits? Let us know if you would like the evidence for this statement?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also what an ignorant point which shows that when you have anger and animosity you forget the basics. If you remember the basics of Islām you will remember that Ādam Alayhis Salām built the house of Allāh first and then subsequent Prophets, when there was no idol worship which is a stark contrast to deoband and furthermore, there are still hindus living in Deoband so what bastion and fortress!!!! How ignorant are you oh young one?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You are probably so engrossed in your misguidance that the very same article your scathingly referenced as not worth the pixels, then if you had bothered to read that you would have found evidence. As for the state of Bhopal the real historians with an open and insightful mind would know the real state of affairs. For example let us give you one example and that is the referring and reporting of the Wahābi activities of Nawāb Ṣiddīq Ḥasan Khān to the British government, which is well documented, even in English.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now, if you are ignorant and your scholarly research is extremely deficient and poor then it is better for you to retire before you get ahead of yourself because nothing comes to mind except sheer shoddiness. If you are ignorant then do not speak and if this is your best research, the deobandī ḥanafīs need to refute you for tainting them with your hilarious, hysterical and comical research.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">First tell us if you are ignorant of the facts and realities and that you do not know what you are talking about, once you have admitted this we shall be more than happy to provide you with ample proofs. As it stands we will not be wasting our time with the basics of the basics.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A closing advice to Abu Hibban and his stooge Abu Khuzaimah before they tuck their tails between their legs and run all the way back to their cells; spend more time researching and providing evidences for your baseless claims rather than exhausting the only 3 brain cells that you have between the two of you in order to mould your childish wisecracks. You call yourselves “Salafi Rsearch Intitute”, thank you for demonstrating the true extent of the “research” that you can do, we found it very amusing. We may be the “new kids on the block” but for a pair of men in their late thirties, you certainly sound like a pair of delinquent teens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reality is you have lied and twisted throughout your scholarly research and should refrain from doing so. We are being very amicable in our approach to you as we have hope that you will turn to the truth and leave the path you are upon of falsehood and innovation. Should we be harsh and tough in our response and just overwhelm you with evidences then we fear this will go above your head and not benefit you in the slightest. Hence, we have kept our response very short and simple.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At least spell Research and Institute correctly and remember when you were attempting to refute us that we did not how to reference, we bet you feel real clever now right?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask Allah to guide us and keep us upon the creed of the salaf. Amīn.</span></p>
