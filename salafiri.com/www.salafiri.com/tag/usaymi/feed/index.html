				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h4><span style="color: #000080">The Author (Shaykh Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhab, may Allah have mercy on him) said,</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #800000">&#8220;The Fourth Principle: That the Mushriks (Polytheists) of our time are more severe in their Shirk than [those Mushriks] that came before, for verily those that came before would commit Shirk in times of ease, whilst dedicating [their worship] solely to Allah in times of difficulty, whereas the Shirk of the Mushriks of our time is constant, in ease and in difficulty. The proof is the statement of the Most High:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #800000"><strong><em>&#8216;And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allâh, making their Faith pure for Him only: but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others.&#8217; [Al-Ankabut, 29:65]</em>&#8220;</strong></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080">The Explainer (Shaykh Salih Al-&#8216;Usaymi, may Allah grant him success) said,</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">&#8220;<strong>And the objective of this Principle is: </strong>To clarify the severity of the Shirk of the people during the time of the author, and whoever is after them is from the latecomers (Muta&#8217;akhirin), and verily they are more severe in Shirk than the ones that came before (Al-Awwalin).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>And the benefit of establishing its severity is: </strong>Realising that that the state they (i.e., the Mushriks of our time) is more worthy of Takfir (excommunication) and fighting than the Mushriks that came before, and this was declared by the author in another book of his, &#8216;Kashf Ash-Shubuhat&#8217;, and the Mushrikun were mentioned with the disbelief with which they were described previously in the initial statement of the author, <span style="color: #800000">&#8216;Verily the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ fought&#8230;&#8217;¹</span>, so they disbelieved by Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b>And a collection of Shari&#8217;i (legislative) evidences and events which have occurred due to the Divine Decree indicate that the Shirk of the later Mushriks is more severe than the Shirk of the earlier Mushriks in ten aspects:</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The First Aspect: <span style="color: #800000">&#8216;For verily those that came before would commit Shirk in times of ease, whilst dedicating [their worship] solely to Allah in times of difficulty.&#8217; </span></strong><span style="color: #800000"><br />
</span>As for the later Mushriks, then they commit Shirk in times of ease and difficulty alike. The author mentioned this aspect here in &#8216;Qawa&#8217;id Al-Arba&#8217; and additionally in &#8216;Kashf Ash-Shubuhat&#8217;, and he used the aforementioned Ayah as evidence from Surah Al-Ankabut, for travelling in the ocean on &#8216;Al-Fulk&#8217; &#8211; i.e., a ship &#8211; is a time of difficulty, for their hearts would be filled with fear and they would call on Allah alone sincerely. Then, when they would set foot on land and be in a state of ease, due to their safety from the harm which they had feared, they would return to their Shirk, calling upon other than Allah, and a group [of scholars] after the time of the author mentioned this, from them: his grandsons Sulayman bin &#8216;Abdillah and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Hasan, and &#8216;Abdullah Aba Butayn, and Sulayman bin Sahman.<br />
The aforementioned Ayah clarifies the state of the earlier Mushriks between times of difficulty and ease, as for the state of the latecomers, then they are continuous in their Shirk, rather they increase in it when calamities befall them and when their fear intensifies! So the matter has been clarified by those that have witnessed their condition, and the writings of their pens attest to their (i.e., the Mushriks of our era) precedence over the [earlier Mushriks] in Ash-Shirk with the Rabb of Al-&#8216;Alamin. Meaning: That the Ayat are evidence regarding the reality of the condition of the [earlier Mushriks]; For verily they would commit Shirk in times of ease whilst dedicating [their worship] solely to Allah in times of difficulty.<br />
As for the latecomers, then if you wish to know their reality with regards to them committing Shirk in both times of ease and difficulty, then upon you is to witness their condition if you are from the countries which have been afflicted with this [i.e., widespread Shirk], or to read into what has been written regarding them, and you will find their Shirk in every case, whether in ease or in difficulty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Second Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would call upon the Muqarrabun (those brought near to Allah) from the Prophets, Angels and Righteous besides Allah, or they would call upon trees or stones that are not sinful, and these later Mushriks call upon the Fussaq (wicked evildoers) and Fujjar (criminals) besides Allah. The author mentioned this aspect separately in &#8216;Kashf Ash-Shubuhat&#8217; as well, and Muhammad bin Isma&#8217;il As-San&#8217;ani attested to the actualisation of these events during his time in &#8216;Tathir Al-I&#8217;tiqad.&#8217;²<br />
The root cause of their supplications, whilst witnessing their sins, is fear of their evil, for verily they believe they have influence and control [over the creation] such that they can cause harm to them, despite them being in such a repulsive condition.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>The Third Aspect</strong><strong>:</strong> That the earlier Mushriks affirmed that what they were upon was in opposition to the call of the Prophets and Messengers, for verily they said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong> &#8216;Has he made the âlihah (gods) (all) into One Ilâh (God &#8211; Allâh). Verily, this is a curious thing!&#8217; [Surah Sad, 38:5]</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the later Mushriks, then verily they claim that their actions are in accordance to the call of the Prophets and Messengers, and &#8216;Abdul-Latif bin Abdur-Rahman mentioned this by meaning in his refutation on Dawud bin Jarjis, and likewise his student, Sulayman bin Sahman, mentioned it.<br />
So the earlier Mushriks denied the statement, &#8216;La ilaaha illAllah&#8217;, whereas the later Mushriks claimed to be from its people and did not deny its statement, so the earlier Mushrikun rejected it by wording and meaning, whereas the later Mushriks affirm its wording whilst rejecting its meaning. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Hasan brought this benefit in &#8216;Fath Al-Majid&#8217;, and Ibn Qasim in &#8216;Hashiyah Kitab At-Tawhid&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fourth Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would not commit Shirk with Allah in anything from the Dominion, nor in a completely unrestricted ability to dispose of affairs (At-Tasarruf Al-Kulli Al-&#8216;Am), rather they would say in their Talbiyah, <em>&#8216;Labbayk Allahumma Labbayk! (Here I am Allah, Here I am), Labbayk La Sharika Labbayk (Here I am, you have no partner), Except the partner that You have, You control him and that which he controls.&#8217; </em><br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they ascribed complete sovereignty and disposal of affairs of the cosmos to those whom they venerate, and they invoke them due [to their belief] that they have control of the creation and that which occurs in it, and this is Shirk which was not known in the time of Al-Jahiliyyah (Ignorance). &#8216;Abdullah bin Faysal bin Su&#8217;ud mentioned this aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Fifth Aspect: </strong>That many of the later Mushriks invoke their objects of worship besides Allah whilst believing they are independent (i.e., not dependent on Allah). As for the earlier Mushriks, then they would invoke their objects of worship in order to seek nearness to Allah, and they believed them to be intercessors and intermediaries, as opposed to many of those Mushriks that came after &#8211; even if they claim otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Sixth Aspect</strong>: That, generally, the Shirk of the earlier Mushriks was restricted [generally] to Al-Uluhiyyah (Worship), and would rarely occur in other than it. As for the later Mushriks, then their Shirk is much, in &#8216;Uluhiyyah, Rububiyyah (Allah&#8217;s actions), and Asma&#8217; w&#8217;as-Sifat (Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes). Rather, Sulayman bin Sahman declared [this] to be one of the differences between the Mushriks of our times who are in a far more evil state than the Mushriks of Al-Jahiliyyah; that the earlier Mushriks affirmed Tawheed of Rububiyyah, for verily their Shirk was only in Al-Uluhiyyah, and this confirms what we mentioned previously.³</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Seventh Aspect:</strong> That the later Mushriks claim that intending [acts of worship], invoking, and devoting [acts of worship] towards the Righteous is from their rights, and to abandon this is to loathe and disregard them, and the earlier Mushriks did not mention this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Eighth Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks used to affirm their Shirk, just as was mentioned previously in their Talbiyyah, and they used to call their Raghbah (Fervent Desire) towards those that they venerated &#8216;Ibadah (Worship)&#8217;.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they claim that they do not commit Shirk with their Rabb, and they call their Raghbah towards those that they venerate &#8216;Mahabbah (Love)&#8217;, and they are liars in this claim of theirs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> <strong>The Ninth Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would only ask their false-deities to fulfil their worldly needs, such as returning a missing person, and they would not take them as preparation for the Day of Judgement (Yawm Al-Din), due to their rejection of the Resurrection, or due to their belief that they will be rewarded with wealth and children after the Resurrection on account of their favour with Allah.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they desired from their objects of veneration fulfilment of their needs in this world, and in the Hereafter. Hamad bin Basir bin Mu&#8217;ammar mentioned this aspect, may Allah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Tenth Aspect:</strong> That the earlier Mushriks would venerate Allah and His symbols, so they would venerate oaths taken by Allah, and they would protect those that sought refuge by Allah and His House (i.e., the Ka&#8217;ba), and they would believe that Al-Bayt Al-Haram is greater than the houses of their idols.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then verily one of them may take an oath by Allah, truthfully or falsely, whilst he would not dare to falsely take an oath by the one he takes as an object of worship and veneration, nor would he protect the one that seeks refuge by Allah and his House, whilst protecting the one who seeks refuge by the one whom they venerate, or by his grave, and they believe that staying at the tombs of the saints is greater than staying in the Masjid. The majority of them believe that Istighatha (seeking aid) by their false-deities, by their graves, is more beneficial and more successful than Istigatha with Allah in the Masjid! And this aspect was derived from the various speech of Sulayman bin &#8216;Abdullah in &#8216;Taysir Al-&#8216;Aziz Al-Hamid&#8217;, and some of it from the speech of Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandson (Taqi&#8217;uddin), and the author [himself], and As-San&#8217;ani, and Hamad bin Nasir bin Mu&#8217;ammar, and &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Aziz Al-Husayyin, and &#8216;Abdul-Latif bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Hasan, from the scholars of the Rectifying Da&#8217;wah, may Allah have mercy on them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>(Sharh Qawa&#8217;id Al-Arba&#8217; of Shaykh Salih Al-&#8216;Usaymi, may Allah preserve him, p.29-33,<br />
</em><em>Transcribed from his lesson on the 29th of Rabi&#8217; Al-Awwal, 1436H, in Masjid An-Nabawi)</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: left"><span style="color: #000080">[TN: The Shaykh, may Allah preserve him, added two more aspects in his lesson the following year:]</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">&#8220;<strong>The Eleventh Aspect: </strong>That the earlier Mushriks would not seek from their false-deities everything which they sought from Ar-Rahman, for they had requests which they would seek from their false-deities, and requests they would seek from none other than Allah, out of veneration for Allah (Perfect and Exalted He is), so they made the most lofty requests specifically for Allah.<br />
As for the later Mushriks, then they would seek from their false-deities that which they do not [even] seek from Allah, and made their greatest requests for those that they deify, and would not seek them from Allah, Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandson, mentioned this aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Twelfth Aspect:</strong> That within the later Mushriks are those that claim that Allah manifests in the image of their objects of worship from the creation, so they worship them for verily [they believe] that Allah manifests in them, and not a single one from the earlier Mushriks believed that Allah manifests in an image other than His Self from the creation. Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandson, also mentioned this in meaning. His companion, Ibn Al-Qayyim, relayed this from him in &#8216;Rawdhatul Muhibbin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> The Author, may Allah have mercy on him, said, <strong>&#8220;The First Principle: That you know that verily the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ fought would affirm that Allah, Exalted is He, is the Creator and the One who controls all affairs, and that [this belief] did not enter them into Islam.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Qawa&#8217;id Al-Arba&#8217;)</em></p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:] </strong>Imam Amir As-San&#8217;ani, may Allah have mercy on him, said, <strong>&#8220;Rather, it has reached such a state that they flee to the graves of the oppressors&#8230;&#8221; </strong><em>(Tathir Al-I&#8217;tiqad p.99, Matkabah Al-Wadi&#8217;i edn.)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan expained, <strong>&#8220;When oppression and injustice occurs from the rulers or other than them, they would seek refuge with [the occupants of] these graves to spare them from the injustice and oppression, so this is seeking refuge with other than Allah, to the extent that a poet said:</strong></p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: center"><strong><em>&#8216;O those who fear the Tatar, seek protection by the grave of Abi &#8216;Umar<br />
</em></strong><em><strong>Seek refuge by the grave of Abi &#8216;Umar, he will save you from harm.'&#8221;<br />
</strong></em><em>(Sabil Ar-Rashad fi Sharh Tathir Al-I&#8217;tiqad p.191)</em></p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: left">³ <strong>[TN:]</strong> Allah, Most High, says,</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md" style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;Who provides for you from the sky and the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs?&#8221; They will say: &#8220;Allâh.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Will you not then be afraid of Allâh’s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allâh)?&#8221;&#8221;<br />
</strong></em><em>(Surah Yunus, 10:31)</em></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>بسم الله الرحمان الرحيم</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Praises are for the One Who Sent the Bringer of Glad Tidings and the one who came as a Warner. The illuminating lantern with a Sharee’ah which is clear and pure. A monotheistic religion which has wide-spread acceptance, predominant and inviting in its message. Its people are the carries of the Sunnah, irradiating its radiance removing by it all traces of darkness and despondency.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To proceed from:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The humble servant, Muhammad bin ‘Alee ash-Shawkaanee<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> &#8211; may Allaah Forgive his and his father’s sins &#8211; was asked about the celebrating of the Prophet’s [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him] birthday<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. He said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: thus far, I have not found affirmative evidence from the Book, nor for the Sunnah, nor from scholarly consensus (Ijmaa’), nor from al-Qiyaas (analogy with pre-established rulings in the Sharee’ah), nor from al-Istidlaal (the process of derivation)<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> to support the Mawlid. Rather, there is scholarly consensus that celebrating the birthday of the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him] was not present at the time of the best generation (i.e. the Companions – may Allaah be Pleased with them all), nor those after them (i.e. the students of the Companions &#8211; may Allaah have Mercy on them all) nor those after them (i.e. the times of the four Imaams and those like them – may Allaah have Mercy on them all). Scholars throughout the generations have all agreed that celebrating the birthday of the Prophet is an innovation which was invented by Sultaan al-Muthhafar Aboo Sa’eed Kawkboonee bin Zayn ad-Deen ‘Alee bin Sabaktayn<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, in a place called Irbil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, the first time such a celebration was practiced was some six hundred years after the Hijrah of the Prophet in the seventh century, thus none of the scholars have denied the Mawlid being an innovation<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Based on these facts, the person who believes it to be permissible to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him], knowing it to be an innovation and that all forms of innovation are misguidance, then they have become misguided by the very statement of al-Mustaphaa [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him]. They are only introducing something which will oppose his purified Sharee’ah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The only proof they may perhaps rely on is the fact that some scholars have divided innovations intro various types, however, this again has no real tangible proof to help establish it. Therefore, I cannot accept the opinion of those who hold it permitted to innovate such a practice (or use innovated principles to try to support it), except until they are able to present clear proof to authenticate such an innovation<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for taking the opinion of such-and-such scholar or such-and-such individual then this is not academic. The truth is greater than the statement or opinion of any scholar. If we were to make rulings based on the statements of scholars (alone, without any evidence) then in actual fact we will be basing our rulings on hearsay and anecdotes. So none can permit such an innovation except those who have anomalies from the Muslims<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for what is pure and noble (i.e. the way of the Salaf) and those who follow them, then one will not be able to find from them a single utterance to support this innovation. Rather, their statements are all in agreement that anything invented into the religion is an innovation. It is from the most contemptible vices which lead the Sharee’ah becoming eroded to corruption. For this reason, you will see this land (Yemen in the time of the Shaykh) baring the fruits of it being purified from the cult of the Soofees, those who practice wicked actions introduced into the religion, and all Praises are due to Allaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After its introduction, eventually the practice of Mawlid under the caliph al-Mahdee ad-Deen al-‘Abbaas bin al-Mansoor [may Allaah have Mercy on him], was eradicated. He banned the Mawlid and he ordered that tombs and shrines that the people had become devoted to, be destroyed and leveled. He returned the nation back to Allaah, the Most High, and to follow the path of the Salaf as-Saaleh (the pious predecessors).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sparks of innovation spread like wildfire, especially the innovation of the Mawlid, because the masses from the common folk are always allured to innovation and at times gain a passion for it. Most laypeople only follow that which leads to degeneracy and they take up all paths to achieve its aims. They divulge in whatever is Haraam (prohibited) until they end up falling into immorality, similar to the implications found with the celebration of the Mawlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So whoever is able to attend these celebrations, from the people of knowledge and that their word will be accepted by them, then he should explain to them their wrongdoing – even though it may seem like they are doing something commendable. He must preach to laymen and those who are misguided. He must try all means to distance them from this innovation and show rejection of it, and by this, they can advise the general masses to leave the opinions of the person they are (blindly) following. Some of even believing that their pious saints visit them during these celebrations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Where is the honour of our religion? If the religion disappears then where would our modesty, piety and intellect go? Do they not realise that laypeople will accept these practices which will lead to all forms of immorality. They will adopt any measure to celebrate this event in the name of enjoyment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From this, we realise the mistake that some have fallen into when they claim that these celebrations are only a praiseworthy event of Dhikr and sharing of food between Muslims. There is no harm in this, they claim. Just because we are celebrating the Mawlid it doesn’t mean anything Haraam will take place, they say.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say: celebrating the Mawlid is an innovation, this is something you admit to, and thus innovations can only increase a person in what is foul and immoral. It is a means to corruption<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>. Rather, saying the Mawlid is prohibited involves both gatherings where you think nothing wrong will happen with gatherings which are clear in its misconducts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A principle known as “Blocking the Means” (سد الذرائع) is a principle which takes the objectives of the Sharee’ah and thwarts all means that lead to whatever that is not permissible. This principles is extremely important to which the majority of the scholars have agreed to and adopted<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If all of this becomes clear to you, and if you have a shred of justice within you, you will not disagree to what is being said here. We have explained above that none of the People of the Household of the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him] ever permitted the Mawlid<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>, and it is likewise upon you (if you are just) to know the evidences and arguments presented by those who reject such a celebration<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we say to you (supporter of the Mawlid), you have agreed with us that there is scholarly consensus that the Mawlid is an innovation. It was introduced by kings in the seventh century and it was only after then did people believe it to be a part of the religion and adopted by religious personalities. After it became apparent, the scholars authored books in rejection for such an innovation. From them include:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Mawrid fee al-Kalaam ‘ala ‘Amal al-Mawlid by the Faqeeh Taaj ad-Deen al-Faakihaanee al-Maalikee (d. 734AH)<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>. In this treatise he describes and exposes its wickedness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the above book there is also a Fatwaa by al-Faakihaanee’s Shaykh, al-Allaamah, the Imaam &#8211; Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eed (d. 702AH) prohibiting the Mawlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Aboo ‘Abdillah bin Haaj, the Faqeeh of Egypt in his time (d. 737AH) wrote a book called al-Madkhal fee ‘Amal al-Mawlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdillah al-Jazaree ash-Shafi’ee (d 660) wrote a book called at-Ta’reef bil Mawlid ash-Shareef.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam and Haafidh Shams ad-Deen bin Naasir ad-Deen ad-Dimishqee wrote Mawrid al-Saadee fi Mawlid al-Haadee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Allaamah as-Suyootee also wrote a book called Husn al-Maqsid fi ‘Amal al-Mawlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of these book clearly describe the prohibition of the innovation of the Mawlid, whilst some of them seek to permit it, despite the fact that all those who authored books on this topic are all in agreement that the Mawlid is an innovation. They admit that there is no direct evidence to support the Mawlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of them try to use the following evidences<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Hadeeth where the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him] came to al-Madeenah and he found the Jews fasting the Day of ‘Aashooraa, so he asked them about it. They replied by saying, “We are fasting this day because it is the day in which Allaah drowned Fir’awn and saved Moosaa. So we fast out of thanksgiving to Allaah, the Most High (i.e. specifying special acts of worship in thanks to Allaah for the birth of the Prophet).<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajar and others also used the Hadeeth in which it states that  the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him] gave ‘Aqeeqah for himself after he became a Prophet<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Hadeeth is also used by Suyootee also in trying to prove the validity of the Mawlid<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>. However what is strange is that these two scholars are now guilty of supporting innovation<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In summary, those who seek to permit the Mawlid have anomalies in their opinion and their arguments, compared to the vast majority who prohibit it. The majority have prohibited whilst those who permit it have only made the exception to celebrations which only entail Dhikr and sharing of communal food between Muslims. However as we have stated above, all paths to mischief must be blocked as a principle agreed to be all scholars. None of the scholars have differed on this point<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even if we were to argue that Mawlid is merely eating and Dhikr, then we know that now the celebrations of the Mawlid are not reduced just to eating and Dhikr. The Mawlid today entails many acts which are prohibited, which would lead to an agreement in its prohibition between the scholars. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the answer the question and I think what has been said is sufficient.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, it is important to expose some of the practices that happen during such events. I have been informed that some laypeople take the Mawlid as an occasion where they supplicate or seek blessings from the deceased or even stones in some cases.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no doubt that all of this is disbelief, even worse of those who worship idols. Idol-worshippers (especially at the time of the Prophet)  maintained that they are worshipping Allaah and only worshipped these idols in order to gain closer to Allaah in times of difficulty. However, grave-worshippers worship supplicate and seek the inhabitants of the grave during all measures – in times of difficulty and ease. So what Kufr can equate to this!? What act of criminality is greater? How can they leave al-Qaadir (the All-Able, Allaah) and take their affairs to anything else, and then claim to be a believer? Your Muslim brothers who have practices this have fallen into clear acts of Kufr, and to Allaah we belong and to Him we will return<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So may Allaah have Mercy on al-Mahdee ad-Deen al-’Abbaas bin al-Mansoor who put a stop to such practices, as much as he was able.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">End of abridged Fatwaa of Aboo ‘Alee Muhammad bin ‘Alee ash-Shawkaanee – may Allaah have Mercy on him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May the Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon His Messenger, his family and companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Written Rabee’ al-Awwal, 1206 – 1784 Gregorian.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Shaykh Saaleh bin ‘Abdullah al-‘Usaymee [may Allaah Preserve him] said about him: He is the Shaykh, al-Allaamah Aboo ‘Alee Muhammad bin ‘Alee Shawkaanee (1170-1250). He is also known as Shaykh al-Islaam of Yemen, so if the scholars of Yemen (post 1250AH – 1834 Gregorian) use Shaykh al-Islaam then they are referring to him. He is also known as the Shawkaanee &#8211; the Father, as his children were also scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> TN: the very origin of celebrating has many reservations. The Encyclopedia Americana (1991 edition) states: “The ancient world of Egypt, Greece, Rome, and Persia celebrated the birthdays of gods, kings, and nobles.” Authors Ralph and Adelin Linton reveal the underlying reason for this; in their book The Lore of Birthdays, they write: “Mesopotamia and Egypt, the cradles of civilization, were also the first lands in which men remembered and honoured their birthdays. The keeping of birthday records was important in ancient times principally because a birth date was essential for the casting of a horoscope.” So, there is a direct connection between the Pagan practice of birthday celebrations and shirk i.e. astrology (horoscopes and fortune-telling). Even the early Christians deny celebrating birthdays: The World Book Encyclopaedia states: “The early Christians did not celebrate His [Christ’s] birth because they considered the celebration of anyone’s birth to be a pagan custom” [Volume 3, page 416]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> TN: Imaam ash-Shawkaanee [may Allaah have Mercy on him] states that the difference between al-Qiyaas and al-Istidlaal is that Qiyaas may be direct analogy or analogy based on the understanding. Whereas al-Istidlaal is purely what the Mujtahid (the scholar) deems to be a realistic derivation. Also, al-Istidlaal has more to do with the overall meaning or reason for a particular ruling whereas al-Qiyaas would be more implicit. [Irshaad al-Fuhool ila Tahqeeq al-Haqq min ‘Ilm al-Usool (Pg. 579)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Shaykh Saaleh bin ‘Abdullah al-Usaymee [may Allaah Preserve him] explains: the scholars differed on who initially innovated this practice. Some of the scholars said it was innovated by Sultaan al-Muthhafar as Shawkaanee is saying here.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Others said it was his son, and this is the opinion of many of scholars like as-Suyootee in his book on the Mawlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Others said it was the ‘Ubaaydiyoon also known as the Faatimids in Egypt (these were a group of Raafidah (Shia) who had despicable beliefs and practices) as stated by Ibn Katheer and adh-Dhahabee. This is the correct opinion as stated by our Shaykh Ismaa’eel al-Ansaaree [may Allaah have Mercy on him].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Imaam Aboo Qaasim Ahmad ash-Shaatibee  [may Allaah have Mercy on him] said, “Innovations are way of inventing something new and ascribing it to the religion. They seek by it to introduce new forms of worship to gain closer to Allaah, the Glorified…such as taking the day of the birth of the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him] as a day of worship and celebration and the likes. These innovations are either set in a specific time or in a specific place in which there is no precedence to be found in the Sharee’ah.” [al-‘Itisaam (1/37-39)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> TN: the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him] said, “Beware of newly-invented matters, because all innovations (practices into the Sharee’ah) are innovations. Surely, all innovations (practices into the Sharee’ah) are misguidance and every misguidance is in the fire.” [Reported by Muslim (867) and an-Nasaa’ee (1578)]. Imaam Aboo Qaasim Ahmad ash-Shaatibee  [may Allaah have Mercy on him] said, “All acts here have been described as being innovated (thus there is no such thing as a good innovation).” [al-‘Itisaam (2/353)] He also said, “With these evidences, we know that the innovator who practices innovation is a sinner.” [al-‘Itisaam (1/286)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[7]</a> TN: even if it be a well-respected and firmly grounded scholar, humans are bound to make mistakes and one’s correctness is judged against the proof he brings. Imaam Ibn Munthir said in al-Awsat, “It is not possible for all of the Sunnah to exist in one man (besides the Prophet).” [al-Awsat fee as-Sunnan wa al-Ijmaa’ wa al-Ikhtilaaf (1/469)] Shaykh Muhammad Ameen ash-Shinqeetee said in Adwaa al-Bayaan (adapted from 7/341): that the whole of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and the meanings within them is gathered in the opinion of their chosen Imaam to follow. Nothing is hidden from its meanings from him. So if he had an opinion on an issue which went against either of the texts from the Qur&#8217;aan or the Sunnah, then they defend their blind following by perceiving that his contradictory opinion has been based on his understanding of the texts. Based on this, the texts and all of the correct meanings can be found in the opinions and judgments of this given Imaam. However, this is obviously something false and a clear lie, without any shadow of a doubt. End quote with slight adaptations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8">[8]</a> TN: Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah [may Allaah have Mercy on him] said, “Changing the religion of Allaah, to the extent that truth and falsehood is not recognised from one another is the state of the Jews, the Christians and all the people who have innovated in to the religion. They have changed the commands and prohibitions of Allaah, changing by it the religion of Allaah.” [Jaami’ ar-Rasaa’il (2/317)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9">[9]</a> Ibn al-Qayyim [may Allaah have Mercy on him] said, “The Sharee’ah takes into consideration statements and actions which lead to a greater good or a greater harm. So if the harm is greater, then the act becomes prohibited, this is called سد الذرائع in order to prevent the greater harm. ” [‘Ilaam al-Muwaqi’een (see: 3/135-159)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10">[10]</a> TN: the Shaykh came from the Raafidee (Shia) background and up until today Yemen has a large Shia community. Soofees and Shia alike take the Mawlid as an even to celebrate, that’s why it seem as if he has mentioned the wording, “People of the Household of the Prophet”. And Allaah Knows Best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11">[11]</a> Shaykh Saaleh al-‘Usaymee explained, “This is an important point because some claim that they are not worshipping or introducing something new into the Sharee’ah. However, we say in response that anything which leads to Haraam is Haraam even if it initially something permitted. Therefore, they have no argument here.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12">[12]</a> TN: previously translated here:<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://ahledhikr.blogspot.com/2013/01/milad-nabi-mawlid-un-nabee.html">http://ahledhikr.blogspot.com/2013/01/milad-nabi-mawlid-un-nabee.html</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref13" name="_ftn13">[13]</a> TN: as preceded, scholars are in agreement that there is no evidence to support the Mawlid thus being an innovation. However, some have sought to draw an analogy (Qiyaas) with other acts of worship. However, the majority of the scholars, especially the Hanfee school are agreed that there can be no analogy in acts of worship. Taaj as-Subkee explains, “It is not possible to make Qiyaas in acts of worship because Qiyaas requires a feature (‘Ilah) in which the analogy is based upon. Acts of worship don’t have this as acts of worship are set by divine instructions.” [see: Sharh al-Mahalla (2/257)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref14" name="_ftn14">[14]</a> TN: its origin is reported in al-Bukhaaree (2004) and Musim (1130) on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbaas [may Allaah be Pleased with him and his father].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref15" name="_ftn15">[15]</a> Reported by at-Tabaraanee in al-Awsat (994, al-Bazaar (2/74) who said it contains a narrator called ‘Abdullah bin al-Muharrar who is very weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref16" name="_ftn16">[16]</a> TN: meaning when he was born, Peace be upon him, his parents/guardians didn’t offer an ‘Aqeeqah for him so when it became legislated in the Sharee’ah, he did it for himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref17" name="_ftn17">[17]</a> N: there is also another evidence that is used in order to seek proof (al-Istidlaal) for the Mawlid. It is reported that Aboo Lahab manumitted Thuwaybah, a wet nurse, due to the birth of the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him]. It is said in this reported that Aboo Lahab will receive a lesser punishment in the Hereafter in return for this action. However, Ibn Hajar [may Allaah have Mercy on him] points out that the narration is Mursal (disconnected; without mentioning the Companion in the chain of narration), thus it is weak.  Even if we were to assume that the chain is connected then the narration has no prophetic revelation behind it, rather it reports that Aboo Lahab was seen in a dream with his punishment lessened. It is well known that rulings in the religion cannot be derived from dreams. [see: Fath al-Baaree (9/145-146)] About the fact that this information was passed via a dream, Aboo Zur’ah al-‘Iraaqee said, “If the Shaytaan can take the form of anyone except the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him], then it is highly likely that he took the form of Aboo Lahab (who was cursed and doomed to the fire in Surah al-Masad).” [at-Tarh at-Tathreeb (8/215)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref18" name="_ftn18">[18]</a> Shaykh Saaleh al-’Usaymee [may Allaah Preserve him] in exposing the evidences brought forward by as-Suyootee and Ibn Hajar [may Allaah have Mercy on them both].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In response we say that the scholars are agreed that there is no Qiyaas in acts of worship. Therefore, acts of worship must be legislated by divine evidence otherwise known as at-Tawqeef.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, the very fact that the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him] forbade going into extremes in worship, warned against worshipping him and taking his grave as a place of worship, shows that he forbade us from returning to the ways of Jaahiliyyah. If we take these points then we can see that Qiyaas and Istidlaal to say it is prohibited is stronger than Qiyaas and Istidlaal to say it is permitted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref19" name="_ftn19">[19]</a> Shaykh Saaleh as-‘Usaymee summarises:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a difference of opinion between the scholars which can be summarized by the following:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">-Some said it is permitted on the condition that it doesn’t lead to anything that is prohibited in the Sharee’ah (such as grave worship, worshipping of saints, abandoning of the Salaat, music, intoxication, free-mixing between genders etc.) like as-Suyootee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">-Some said it is Makrooh and not Haraam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">-The majority have said it is Haraam and this is the correct opinion based on the evidences. All innovations are prohibited in the religion. Also, small sins lead to big ones, so if one starts off with a meaningless innovation now, undoubtedly it will spiral and be abused. Lastly, the date of the Mawlid has not been agreed upon or set by the scholars. Some said he was born in the beginning of Rabee’ al-Awwal, others said in the middle of the month such as the 10<sup>th</sup> or 12<sup>th</sup> and others said he was born in Rajab, a complete separate month altogether! Therefore there is no proof to set the date. All of this shows its falsehood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref20" name="_ftn20">[20]</a> Shaykh Saaleh al-‘Usaymee [may Allaah Preserve him] pointed out that this point mentioned here by ash-Shawkaanee is proof that their Taqleed (blind-following) is not only of their so-called perceived pious saints, but also of the people of Shirk. They make up special acts of worship by specifying certain innovated times and places.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For more information on this, one should refer to al-Qawaa’id al-Arba’ by Shaykh Muhammad bin ‘Abdul-Wahaab [may Allaah have Mercy on him]</span></p>
