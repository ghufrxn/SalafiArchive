<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ash-Shaykh al-Musnad Kamaludeen Aboo Nasr Abdulazeez Ibn Abdilmun’im Ibn al-Khadir Ibn Shibl Ibn Abdil Harithee reported to us – he recited it and I heard him on the day of Jumah (Friday) sixth of Sha’baan in the year 669 Hijri at Jami’ Dimashq that Al Hafidh Aboo Muhammad al-Qaasim Ibn al-Hafidh Abil Qasim Alee Ibn al-Hasan Ibn Hibatillah Ibn Asaakir reported to us – he read it in Rabial Aakhir in the year 596 Hijri: that Abul Fadha’il Naasir Ibn Mahmood Ibn Alee al-Qudsee as-Saa’igh and Aboo al-Qaasim Nasr Ibn Ahmad Ibn Muqaatil as-Soosee reported to us – they both read it and said that: Abul Hasan Alee Ibn Ahmad Ibn Zuhayr al-Malikee reported to us that: Abul Hasan Alee Ibn Muhammad Ibn Shujaa’ ar-Rib’ee  al-Malikee narrated to us that: Abu Bakr Muhammad Ibn Abdurahmaan Ibn Ubaydillah al-Qattaan reported us that: Khaythamah narrated to us that: al-Abbaas Ibn al-Waleed narrated to us that: Uqbah Ibn Alqamah narrated to us that: Sa’eed Ibn Abdilazeez narrated to us that: from Atiyyah Ibn Qays from Abdillah Ibn Amr (Ibn al-Aas) (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>the Messenger of Allah </i><i>(Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) </i><i>said, “</i><i>I saw</i><i> the spine of a</i><i> book under my pillow</i><i>, </i><i>then I saw an </i><i>eminent </i><i>nur (light</i><i>) moving towards Sham (Syria]</i><i>. For verily when the fitan</i><i> (trials and tribulations)</i><i> arise. </i><i>iman (belief) will be in Shaam.” </i> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He was born in the year 589 Hijri and</span><span style="color: #000000;"> died in Sha’baan, year 672 Hijri. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[GRADING AND REFERENCES]</span></strong> – [<i>Hasan-</i> good] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Asaakir narrated this from Muhammad Ibn Abdurahmaan Ibn Ubaydullah al-Qattaan (Tareekh Dimishq (1/102)) and Abul Abbaas Muhammad Ibn Ya’qoob al-Asam narrated this from Abbaas Ibn Waleed Ibn Mazeed (Juz al-Asim: (no.51), also Haakim (4/509) hadeeth (no.8554) Bayhaqee (Dalail an-Nubuwah (6/448)) and Aboo Na’eem al-Isbahaanee (Hilyatul Awliyaa (5/252) and other than them have transmitted it from the chain of Sa’eed Ibn Abdul Azeez from Yunus Ibn Maysarah Ibn Halbis from Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and both Haakim and Dhahabee have declared it authentic on the conditions of Bukharee and Muslim! </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Both of these chains (of Bayhaqee and Asim) are <i>[Hasan]</i> good.  </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[BIOGRAPHY OF THE NARRATOR OF THE HADEETH]  </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A Summarised comprehensive discussion of Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) is as follows: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Name and lineage:</b>    </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Muhammad Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas Ibn Waa’il Ibn Haashim Ibn Sa’eed Ibn Sa’d Ibn Sahm Ibn Amr Ibn Hasees Ibn Ka’b Ibn Lu’ay Ibn Ghaalib al-Qurashee as-Sahmee al-Makkee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Students: </b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Aboo Umaamah As’ad Ibn Sahl Ibn Haneef (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), Anas Ibn Maalik (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), Jubayr Ibn Nafeer al-Hadhramee, al-Hasan al-Basree, Humayd Ibn Abdurahmaan Ibn Awf, Zar Ibn Jaysh al-Asadee, Saalim Ibn Abee al-Ja’d, as-Saa’ib Ibn Furookh ash-Shaa’ir, Sa’eed Ibn Musayyab, Shuayb Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas Waalid Amr Ibn Shuayb, Ta’oos Ibn Kaysaan, Aamir ash-Shu’bee, Abdullah Ibn Buraydah al-Aslamee, Abdullah Ibn Ubaydullah Ibn Abee Maleekah, Ataa Ibn Abee Rabaah, Ikrimah Mawlah Ibn Abbaas, Amr Ibn Deenar al-Makkee, Qaasim Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abee Bakr as-Siddeeq, Mujahid Ibn Jabr, Masrooq and Abu Burdah Ibn Abee Musa al-Ash’aree and other than them. Rahimahullah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Virtues:</b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) gave Abdullah Ibn Amr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) permission to write his hadeeth. (Sunan Abee Dawood: (no.3646) and its chain is authentic, Musnad Ahmad (2/162) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. Aboo Hurayrah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, “There is none among the companions of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) who has narrated more Hadiths than I, except `Abdullah bin `Amr (bin Al-`As) who used to write them and I did not.” (Saheeh Bukharee (no.113) His written collection is famously known as as-Saheefah as-Saadiqah from the chain of Amr Ibn Shuayb from his father from his grandfather. (Also see al-Muwatta, Ibn al-Qaasim’s narration with my verification (pg.49-50) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. Handhalah Ibn Khuwaylid al-Anmbaree (al-Ghazzee/<i>Thiqah</i>) narrated: “I was with Mu’awiyah (Radiullahu anhu) and two men came arguing about the (cutting off the) head of Ammaar (Ibn Yassaar (Radiullahu anhu), both of these men were claiming to have killed him. Then Abdullah Ibn Amr (Radiullahu anhu) said, “Whichever one of you wants to be happy, then be happy (!) because I heard the Messenger of Allah (Sallalaahu Alayhee wa sallam) say, “a rebel (rebellious, insurgent) group will kill him (Ammaar (Radiullahu anhu).” Mu’awiyah (Radiullahu anhu) said, “Why are you with us (in the battle of Sifin)?”  He (Abdullah Ibn Amr (Radiullahu anhu) replied, “My father complained to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalaahu Alayhee wa sallam) about me, so he said (to me), “whilst your father is alive then obey (listen and follow him) and don’t disobey him”. So (that’s why) I am with you and I don’t kill and fight.” (Musnad al-Imaam Ahmad (2/164-165) hadeeth (no.6538) and its chain is authentic). Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, “What is my connection with Sifin and what is my connection with killing and fighting the muslims? I wish that I died 10 years ago. By Allah! I didn’t strike a sword in this (battle), nor throw a spear and neither did I shoot an arrow. (Tabaqaat Ibn Sa’d (4/266) and its chain is authentic)    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Knowledge of narrations:</b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The number of his narrations is 700 from which 7 are in the in the Saheehayn (TN. Saheehayn means the two Saheehs i.e. Saheeh Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Death:</b><b> </b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the incident (event) of Hirrah, Dhul Hijjah 63 Hijri (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a major difference of opinion as to when he died and the writer of this book has given preference the saying of Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. And Allah knows best. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The dar ut tahqiq website have published a few articles on the proficiency of Imām Abū Ḥanīfah in Ḥadīth, sure they have the prerogative as they are his ardent, muʿtassub and bigoted blind followers. This is a brief response to it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As the readers knows, we are currently publishing Shaikh Irshad ul-Ḥaqq al-Athari’s book ‘Asbāb Ikhtilāf al-Fuqahā’ which is an answer to Shaikh Muḥammad Awwamahs ‘Athar al-Ḥadīth Sharīf.’ Whilst translating this many years ago, at the time I added some detailed notes to the proceeding narration which is what you will be reading insha’Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, this narration will be uploaded again without the notes in the series of the book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Irshād ul-Ḥaqq al-Atharī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Ḥanīfah’s own statement has been transmitted from him by his student, Imām Abū ʿAbdur Rahmān ʿAbdullāh bin Yazīd Muqrī who said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;I heard Abū Ḥanīfah say the Ahadīth he generally narrates are incorrect.&#8221; [Tārīkh Baghdād [13:402]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, [al-Kāmil [7:2473]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The chain of this statement from the Imām is authentic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Khaṭīb Baghdādī transmitted this statement with the following chain, “I was informed by <strong>Ibn al-Faḍal</strong> who was informed by <strong>Da</strong><strong>ʿ</strong><strong>laj bin Aḥmad</strong> who was informed by <strong>Aḥmad bin </strong><strong>ʿ</strong><strong>Alī al-Ābār</strong> and it was narrated to them by <strong>Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān</strong> and <strong>Ibn Muqrī </strong>narrated to them saying he heard <strong>Abū Ḥanīfah </strong>say&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the narrators are trustworthy and upright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Muqrī is Muḥammad bin ʿAbdullāh bin Yazīd. Hafiẓ Khalīlī said, “Trustworthy with agreement.” [Tahdhīb [9:284], Taqrīb [pg.456]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān is also trustworthy and a preserver, he is also a narrator of Ṣaḥīḥ Bukhārī and Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim [Tahdhīb [10:64], [Sīyar ʿAlām an-Nabulā [12:223]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, [Tadhkirah ul-Ḥuffāz [2:475]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Aḥmad bin ʿAlī al-Ābār is also a trustworthy Imām and a preserver ie Ḥāfiẓ. [Tārīkh Baghdād [4:306], Sīyar [13:443] [Tadhkirah ul-Ḥuffāz [2:639]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dʿalaj bin Aḥmad is a well known trustworthy scholar of Ḥadīth and a jurist. Imām Ḥākim said he was an Imām of the Ahlul Ḥadīth of his time. [Sīyar [16:30]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>, Tārīkh Baghdād [8:387]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>, Tadhkirah ul-Ḥuffāẓ [3:881]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Faḍal is Muḥammad bin al-Ḥussain bin Muḥammad bin al-Faḍal al-Baghdādī al-Qaṭṭān. He is a well known teacher of Imām Baihaqī and Imām Khaṭīb Baghdādī. Imām Dhahabī said that he was trustworthy with agreement. [Siyār [17:331],<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> Tārīkh Baghdād [2:246]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> others. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, the narrators of this chain are all trustworthy; however, Ibn al-Muqrī hearing from Imām Abū Ḥanīfah is debatable. Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy has transmitted the same statement from ʿAbdullāh bin ʿAbdul ʿAzīz via the chain of Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān from al-Muqrī. In fact Imām Tirmidhī has also transmitted it from Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān and said he heard it from al-Muqrī [al-ʿEllal al-Kabīr [2:966].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What this means is that Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān did not narrate from Ibn al-Muqrī but rather from his father whose name is ʿAbdullāh bin Yazīd al-Muqrī. As for ʿAbdullāh bin Yazīd he is the famous Muhaddith, Imām Bukhārī’s teacher as well as a trustworthy Imām. [Tahdhīb [6:83]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>, Sīyar [10:166]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy also transmitted the same statement via Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Saʿīd from Muḥammad bin ʿAbdullāh bin Suleimān from Salamah bin Shabīb from al-Muqrī-and this chain is also Ḥasan. Salamah bin Shabīb al-Nīsābūrī is trustworthy [Tahdhīb [4:146]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> and others. Also note Al-Kāmil mentions Maslamatah which is incorrect and needs to be corrected.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muḥammad bin ʿAbdullāh bin Suleimān is the famous trustworthy scholar of Ḥadīth from Kūfa. [Sīyar [14:41] and others. Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Saʿīd is Ibn ʿUqadah who is a famous Hāfiẓ of Ḥadīth however, some have spoken against him whereas others declared him to be trustworthy. [Sīyar [15:340], Tārīkh Baghdād [5:14], Līsān [1:263]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> and others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However he is not alone in this narration, nonetheless this narration is authentically established from Imām al-Muqrī and Allah knows best.)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Difference Between The Salafi’s and The Ashari’s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated, Compiled and Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So know dear reader that when an Asharee who attempts to use his intellect over the authentic sunnah and attempts to say that an authentic hadeeth which confirms a particular Attribute, name or action of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala is not accepted because it is in contradiction with the Qur’an, then know that he is upon misguidance and away from all of the Muslims in his creed and the consensus of the blessed companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great imam al-A’ajuree d.360H spoke concerning those people who leave off the Sunnah from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam because they think that there is a contradiction with the Qur’an and instead they follow their own intellects, he has said that they are Mulhids (heretics), please refer to his book ash-Sharee’ah. (Ash shariyyah lil-Ajuree pg 350-351)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From amongst another deception of the Ashaairah is that they say <em>‘even if the hadeeth is authentic concerning the Attribute of Allah then many of them we cannot take as they are khabarul Ahad which are not like the Qur’an or have not come in mutawaatir form. In essence, this means that there is a doubt on the khabarul ahad hadeeth (which is a narration reported by less than the mutawaatir form and therefore for them that does not give the benefit of certain knowledge). The belief in the Attributes of Allah is based upon certain knowledge and not upon knowledge which has doubt within it’</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The asharis of past and present have used a particular narration which is very famous amongst them in order to substantiate this weak principle and that is a hadeeth which is mentioned in current modern times by the likes of Kawtharee and in earlier times by the likes of Imaam Baihaqee.  The hadeeth is from Abdullah bin Urwah Bin Zubair al-Awaam that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Verily Zubair bin al-Awaam </em><em>Radiallahu ‘anhu heard a man narrate a hadeeth from the Messenger of Allah </em><em>sallahu alaihi wasallam, so Zubair began to listen very attentively up until the man completed the narration. Thereupon, Zubair said to the man ‘did you hear this narration from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam?’. The man replied, ‘yes’. Zubair said, ‘We have heard similar to this from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam and because of this we refrain from mentioning hadeeth from the Messenger. By Allah I was present when the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam informed us about this narration and when he started to inform us of this narration he said in the beginning that he is narrating this to us from a man from the previous times who was from the ahlul kitaab (the people of the book) and on that day you came late and did not hear the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam mention that this narration was from the people of the book and therefore you took the words of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam as being an authentic narration from the Prophet  yet it was from the previous times of the people of the book and not from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam”. (</em>Kitabul asma wa sifaat of Baihaqee pg.258, Kawtharees footnotes to Baihaqee’s Asma was- Sifaat pg.358)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After mentioning this narration, Baihaqee said, <em>“And this narration is one of the reasons why our scholars of our madhab have said that to take the akhbaarul ahaad concerning the Attributes of Allah and to base belief upon this, is abandoned, due to this being a single narration and not like the Book of Allah or consensus. And due to this our scholars became engrossed in making figurative interpretation and ta’weel concerning the Attributes.”</em> (Baihaqee asma wa sifaat pg.450)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So it is clear from this that some of the ashaa’irah try to substantiate their aqeedah and at the most they try to take it back to the likes of Imaam Baihaqee by saying that, Baihaqee himself says that the scholars from the mutaqallimeen and the ashaa’irah at that time did not take the authentic narrations as khabrul ahad concerning the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala. However, this is incorrect for many reasons:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The narration which Bahaiqee himself relies upon from Zubair bin al-Awaam is unsubstantiated and rejected and there are 3 reasons for this.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">In the chain is a man known as Abu Ja’far A’raabee or al-Azaa’mee he is unknown as was mentioned by Shaykh Abdur Rahman bin Yahyaa al-Muallamee al-Yamaanee who said, <em>“I do not know of him.” (</em>al-Anwar ul Kaashifah pg.60)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Another narrator within the chain is Abul Abbas as-Sabaghee Muhammed bin Ishaaq bin Ayub. There is no tawtheeq for him. In fact his more established and trustworthy brother Imaam Abu Bakr Ahmad bin Ishaaq as-Sabaghee an-Nisapooree would make disparaging remarks about him for being a lewd man and a vagabond, he would stop people from narrating or listening to ahadeeth from him. (Haafiz Dhahabee’s Siyaar A&#8217;alaam An-Nubalaa vol.15 pg.489)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">This narration is not from Urwah bin Zubair but it is from his son Abdullah bin Urwah bin az-Zubair (Al-Anwar ul-Kashifah of Imaam Yamaani pg.60). This is important because Abdullah bin Urwah Rahimahullah was born in the year 45A.H. (Taqreeb at-Tahdhib no.3485) and the companion Zubair bin al-Awaam was martyred on his return from the battle of Jamal in the year 36A.H (Taqreeb at-Tahdhb of Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaani no.2003) .Therefore this narration is disconnected (Munqati’) and the disconnected (Munqati’) narration is known to be weak and unacceptable. In summary, Abdullah the son of Urwah was born after his grandfather’s {Zubair bin Awaam} death so he could not have narrated this from him.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, there are various other authentic narrations which are akhabarul ahad which have been accepted by consensus of the salaf which substantiate the Attributes of Allah. For example, the Attribute of a Foot for Allah is in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (Kitaab at-Tawheed hadeeth no.7384, Saheeh Muslim: the chapter of paradise and it’s attributes and blessings for those who are in it no. 2848, Sunan Tirmidhee no. 2558 who said this hadeeth was Hasan Saheeh, Saheeh Abee Awaanah no.344, al-Mukhtaar of Dhiyaa al-Maqdisee no.2486, Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan al-Ehsaan no. 268).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And just as a benefit to those readers who want even more confirmation concerning this Attribute, then know that Imaam Ishaaq bin Masoor al-Koosaj asked Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal about the narrations concerning the Foot of Allah and other Attributes, Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal replied, <em>“All of this is substantiated from authentic narrations”</em> and Imaam Ishaaq bin Rahawaihah said, <em>“This narration concerning the foot is authentic and those who have weak intellect and are from Ahlul Bid’ah are the ones who make distortions and negation concerning it.</em> (Ash-Shariyy’ah of al-Ajuree vol. 3 pg.1128 and he said the chain is saheeh)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Mandah said concerning the Foot of Allah, <em>“And this narration is accepted by consensus.” (</em>Radd Alal Jahmiyyah vol.1 pg.19)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore it is clear that from amongst the Khairul Quroon (that is approximately up to the year 300H) there is not a single scholar or companion or a mujtahid who rejected the authentic akhbaar ul ahaad concerning the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Instead, all the companions, the tabi’een, the taba tabi’een and the scholars of hadeeth accepted the Attributes as they came whether it was from an ahad narration, the Qur’an or mutawaatir form from various ahadeeth and this was part of their faith. It is therefore clear that the ashaa’irah of past and present have no basis for creating yet another obstacle for rejecting the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala in the way that they have come and to accept them literally, without taweel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we have seen that the ashaa’irah in the past and more so in the present have fallen into the grave sin of rejecting and making figurative interpretations of the Names and the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala, especially where they created their own principles in order to promote their madhab. At times the ashaairah let their intellects overcome the text of the hadeeth to be taken upon its literal meaning, at times they rejected the saheeh hadeeth because it went against their madhab and therefore they made interpretations of it, at times they rejected the Attributes of Allah because they said that the ahadeeth which have come are in contradiction with the Qur’an and other than that which we have mentioned above.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the result of this is that the ashaa’irah continue to propagate various narrations in order to support their false beliefs. Concerning this we are going to mention a few narrations here which are a result of the innovated principles of the ashaa’irah regarding the Attributes of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the narrations which the ashaa’irah maturidiyyah and other than them from the deviated sects have brought based upon their weak intellect, they said that Allah Subhanahu wata’ala said about Himself,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I was a hidden treasure, nobody knew me, then I wanted for the people to get to know me, so I created the people, the creation and gave it my ma’rifah (ability to understand) then after this they got to know me.” (</em>This hadeeth has been given a particular paramount importance by the modern day ashari deobandis. Haji Imdaadullah Muhaajar Makkee in his book Shamaaim Imdaadiyyah pg.39 wherein he attempts to explain the correct way of the ashaa’irah and the murji’ah mu’tazilah concerning the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala based upon this fabricated narration!)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, we can see that this narration is nothing more than a fabricated narration which has been falsified by the deviant sects to prop up their own Madhab aswell as the Jahmiyyah.  We will not go into pages of evidence of who has called this fabricated, but it is sufficient to say that Hafiz Ibn Taymiyyah has said that this is fabricated (Tanziyah us-Sharriyyah of Kitaanee vol.1 pg.48).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Similarly Imaam Suyootee in his book (Dhail al-Lai’ee of Suyootee pg.203) has said that this verdict concerning the narration being fabricated is accurate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This narration has also been mentioned as a fabricated narration in (Mawdho’aatul Fitna pg. 11).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Sakhawee has also said that this narration is fabricated (al-Maqaasid al-Husna pg.153).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And furthermore the likes of Zarkhashee has also said that this narration has no basis and is fabricated (Tameez ut-Tayyib Minal Khabeeth pg.122).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Mulla Alee Qaaree has also said that this narration is fabricated (al-mawdhooaat lil fitna pg.54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So one can see the attempts by the ashaa’irah and the maturidiyyah who have tried to fabricate narrations in order to prove their creed by saying that how can we say Allah has a hand and Eyes and a Foot and Leg and various other Attributes if He Himself said about Himself that he was  unknown and then later on He became known to the people so the asl of Allah is that He is unknown and no one knows of Him except Allah Himself and through this the ashaa’irah and the muffawwidah who perform tawfeedh try to substantiate that Allah is unknown therefore His Attributes are meaningless and are not known. What a lie they made against Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and left the madhab of the salaf in order to substantiate that which was falsehood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith which the ashaa’irah, mu’tazilah, jahmiyyah bring in order to substantiate their false and rejected beliefs is,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The heart of a believer is the Throne of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“The heart of a believer is the house of Allah.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> So these narrations are brought so that they could say that the sifaat (Attributes) of Allah and Allah being above the throne have been explained by way of interpretation ta’weel by the Prophet himself!.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Read, This is fabricated. Sakhaawi said: <em>“It has no basis from the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam”</em> (al-Maqaasid al-Husna pg.144)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and likewise it is written in Tameez at-Tayyib minal Khabeeth (pg.114)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and likewise Ibn Taymiyyah said, “It is fabricated” (Tanzih ash-Shariyyah pg.148).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is similarly mentioned to be fabricated by Mulla Ali al-Qaari (al-Mawdhooaat pg.51). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Imaam Suyooti said that this is mawdoo (Dhail al-Lai’ee pg.203)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we can clearly see that the ashaa’irah and various other heretical sects including the jahmiyyah, maturidiyyah and others have traditionally in the past and continue in the present day to use various obstacles to go against the way of the salaf. But we say that salvation is only in the way of the salaf as-Saliheen and the correct aqeedah concerning the Attributes is as they have understood it and have mentioned in their books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah Subhanahu wata’ala forgive us for our sins and keep us upon the aqeedah and manhaj of the salaf us-Saliheen in making the aqeedah and manhaj clear from the doubts of the ahl ul ahwaa wal bidah. Ameen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The slaves of Allah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Difference Between The Salafi&#8217;s and The Ashari&#8217;s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise is for Allah the one with whose face the believers will be immensely rewarded in the hereafter as they will see his glorious face and between them and Allah there shall be no covering or barrier. We ask Allah with the waseelah of all of his tremendous names and attributes that he makes us from amongst those who will be honoured with such a blessing and not from those who deny and explain away that he does not have a face thus inviting the punishment of Allah upon themselves, misguiding themselves and misguiding others. May there be infinite blessings and salutations upon our master Muhammad and all those who follow him with righteousness until the last day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To proceed:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this short introduction to the book concerning the Ashaa’irah we will be discussing some of the fundamental points that the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah have alluded to when they have analysed the various sects that have reared their heads splitting away from the saved sect, the Ahlus Sunnah, The Ahlul Hadith, the Ahlul Athar, Salafiyeen. We will also be exploring the basic definition and implications of the term “Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah,” especially in relation to the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wa-Ta’ala and the stance of Ahlus Sunnah concerning those that have gone far away from the Ahlul Sunnah concerning their position on the Names and Attributes such as the Asha’irah and Mu’tazilah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will also attempt with the aid of Allah o delve into how some of the deviated sects such as the Asha’irah have tried to use the Qur’an and sometimes the Sunnah for their own benefit and have in fact even gone further in creating principles and rules when it comes to the Names and Attributes of Allah and the reader will come to know that these principles are based upon innovations which they have established  so that they can beguile other people whilst also fooling themselves!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The reader will come to realise that the Asharis and those splinter sects outside of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah have those from amongst them that even went to the extremities of lying upon the Messenger of Allah Salllahu alaihi wasallam and we shall discuss some examples where ahadeeth have been fabricated so that the Madhab and innovated principles of the Ashari’s can be pushed forward to the people concerning making Ta’weel (interpretations) in the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala which have not been accepted by the salaf being primarily the companions and the successors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Blessed are the Salaf and from amongst them the first and foremost the Messenger of Allah Sallalhu alaihi wasallam and the Companions May Allah be pleased with them all for they understood the Arabic language as it was meant to be taken and thus they accepted without any doubt whatsoever all the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wa ta’ala not having the need to make ta&#8217;wil, tamthil, ta&#8217;til or even ilhaid. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Blessed are the companions and their successors for none argued or disputed amongst themselves concerning the acceptance of the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and indeed they had a consensus concerning this issue and this is a consensus which was adhered to by the remaining Salaf of this ummah up until today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam said concerning the Khawarij and their father Dhul Khuwaisarah: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>They will read the Qur’an but it will not raise higher than beyond their throats and they will leave the religion the way an arrow leaves its prey.” </em>(Sahih Muslim hadith number 2316.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith is evidently about the Khawaarij but in it is a deeper meaning and that meaning is that the sects of the past and present who have gone away from the Madhab and the way of the Sahabah and the Salaf have clearly misunderstood the meanings of the Quraan and Sunnah, that is the religion, for the hadeeth in Saheeh al-Bukhaari says that they will read the Qur’an meaning outwardly they would profess Islaam and outwardly they would read the Book of Allah and even they will read the narrations of the Prophet Muhammad sallalahu alaihi Wasallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However this reading of theirs will be distorted and will be of no consequence to them in relation to benefitting them in their Aqidah because they will not be reading it with the understanding and eyesight of the Companions and the Salaf. No doubt this was one of the fundamental reasons for the deviations of the various sects who left the way of Ahlul Hadeeth like the Khawaarij who ended up making mass takfir upon many of the Muslims on account of major sins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly we can see that the Asha’irah and the Mu’tazilah and the modern day Deobandis, Barailwis, Sufis, Qadiris, Chishtis, Naqshbandis, Shadhilis, Habashis, and all the others including the Shi’ahs. ([1] The reader can refer to the excellent books by Shaikh Taalib ur Rehman, this one such book, and the books of the Allaamah Ehsaan Elaahee Zaheer, al-Barailwiyyah, ash-Shia was-Sunnah and at-Tassawuf)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They read the Qur’an and they tell the people that they read the hadeeth and they try to provide evidences from the sources of the Qur’an and hadeeth but they have their own interpretations and this is what this hadeeth refers to, reading the Qur’an or reading the hadeeth is not sufficient if it does not penetrate the heart or does not even go beyond throats and the only way that the hadeeth and the ayah of the Qur’an will be of benefit and penetrate the hearts and be part of Iman based actions upon the limbs is if the understanding and the fahm is taking by the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam, the blessed companions and the Salaf of this ummah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How beneficial would it have been for the past and the current day sects especially the Asha’irah to reflect upon and understand the tremendous saying of the Imam, the Zahid Imam Zuhri (Rahimahullah) who said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Islaam means, for Allah (</em><em>Subhanahu wata’ala)</em><em>to make the bayaan by way of revelation, for the Messenger of Allah (</em><em>sallahu alaihi wasallam) </em><em>to make the balaagh by way of spreading, explaining and conveying that revelation, and for us is the taslim, that is to accept without any hesitations and conditions.”</em> (Zuhd of Ibn Abi Aasim (pg.78), Hilyatul Awliyah of Abu Nu’aym (3/369), Aqidatus Salaf Wa Ashabul Hadith of Abee Isma’il as-Sabuni and Ibn Hajr has also recorded this in his al-Fath with an authentic chain.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we have some of the old Ashaa’irah in the past, so it is important to distinguish between the previous scholars who were influenced by the Ashari creed yet they affirmed Allah being above the Throne and many of his Attributes as they have come to us by way of the Salaf, whilst erring in some methodologies concerning the same, such as, Qadi Abu Bakr al-Baqilani, Imam Abu Bakr al-Baihaqi, Abul Hasan Ibn Mahdi at-Tabari, Abul Hasan al-Ashari, Ibn Kullab and the modern day Ashari’s who are not actually Ashariyyah but more Jahmi, Sufi, Mu’tazili and Murji.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All rolled into one, such as the Jahmite Zahid al-Kawthari, Abu Guddah Abdul Fattah, the Ghumari clan and leaders of the modern day Deobandi’s and Barelvi’s who are outright Mufawwidah and Mu’attilah rejecting the sublime attributes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The modern day Asha’irah who make various claims and arguments about why they feel the need to make interpretations in the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and they attempt to attribute their innovation back to the Salaf who of course are absolutely free from such beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> One of the things which the Asha’irah of past and present have tried to hide behind is the term Ahlus Sunnah and they claim that <em>“to make Ta’wil (metaphorical and figurative interpretations) of Allahs attributes and to make Tafwidh (not giving the attributes a meaning that was understood by the Salaf as they have come)  is the way of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah”</em> and in this they try to beguile the common people by making them think that this way is the way of the Sahabah and the first three generations. So we ask who are the Ahlus Sunnah? How did the Salaf understand this term and in general, what does it entail?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Rajab defined ‘Sunnah’ by saying </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“it is a way which is established in the beliefs and actions and it is a way that the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam and the rightly guided Khulafah were upon, this is known as Sunnah tul-Kamilah (the complete Sunnah) and this is what the Salaf would call Sunnah and it would all be included within this definition.” </em>(Jam’e al-Ulum Wal Hikam of Ibn Rajab (pg.282)</span></p>
