				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[8] Tanwir ul-Aynain Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Allamah Shah Muhammad Isma’il (1246H)</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Bigoted Staunch Taqlid and Blind Following of the Imams Over Authentic Texts</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh, the Imaam al-Allamah Muhammad Isma’il said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Chapter Exaggeration in Taqlid and Ta’assub (bigotry).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">People have exaggerated a lot in the taqlid of one particular individual and have made rigid bigotry obligatory upon themselves to the extent that they have prohibited an individual from performing ijtihad and from doing taqlid of other Imams. And this is that non-curable illness which destroyed the shi’ahs and these people (ie the muqallidin) have also reached the realms of destruction but the only difference is that the shi’ahs have reached a greater level of destruction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They (the Shi’ahs) started to find texts to back up the statements of their Imams and these people (ie the muqallidin) have also adopted this way and begun to figurative explain well known narrations that opposed the statements of their Imams. However they should have weighed and presented the statements of their Imams to these narrations and texts and if they (the statements) coincided with the text they should have accepted them or otherwise rejected them. (Tanwir ul-Aynain Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain (pg.44-45)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said, “And I am amazed when I see a person has the ability to return to a clear and conclusive hadith of the Messenger of Allaah (Saalalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) which opposes the statement of his Imam and yet they still hold doing taqlid permissible and I wonder how is this permissible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So if he does not leave the statement of his Imam in such a situation then he has with him Shirk Fir-Risalah (Association partners in the Messengership of the Prophet.).” then the Shaikh goes onto mention the hadith of Adiyy bin Hatim in Jame at-Tirmidhi in regards to the verse of Allaah,<strong>“They have taken their monks and rabbis Lords besides Allaah.”</strong> (Soorah at- Taubah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say further, “So we find from this hadeeth that if a person comes to know the evidences from the Book and the Sunnah and he still adheres to the statement of a specific Imam and begins to figurative explain these evidences, then such a person has traits of Christianity in him and there is the danger that he may have taken some aspects of Shirk in him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And there is extreme amazement on such a nation, who instead of fearing such taqlid they declare those who abandon this taqlid to be great oppressors. Then how well does the following verse fit such people, “How shall I fear those whom you associate and yet you do not fear that you have associated partners with Allah for which Allah has not revealed any evidence, so which of the two are upon the truth, if only but you knew.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So think and be just and do not be from those people who have doubts and we seek refuge in Allah from being amongst those who have bigotry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Tanwir ul-Aynain Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain (pg.49-51).</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haddad on <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.51</span> mentions the issue of thse who affirm that Allaah can lie, ‘Imkaan al-Kaadhib’ and claims Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel Dehlawee was the first of the Wahhabis of India to forward this heresy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto to say, “Refutation were published by Mulla Saahib Baghdadi and Mawlana Fadl al-Haqq Khayrabadi…” (Albani and his Friends <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.51</span>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the affair is that in about 1240H<span id="more-268"></span> some of the opponents of Ahlus- Sunnah started to raise some false allegation regarding the book Taqwiyyatul-Eemaan. Mulla Baghdaadee became influenced by them, that resulted in him writing a letter which he then sent to Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel in Kaanpoor So as soon as the objection was received by Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel, he immediately answered it and returned it back to him in Delhi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the people who witnessed this reply and also heard it were the grandson of Shaikh Abdul-Azeez Muhaddith Dehlawee Maulana Muhammad Ya’qoob, also Maulana Naseer ud deen, Maulana Mahboob Alee and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alhamdulillah, all praise be to Allaah the Rabb of everything that exists, we have this response of Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel and inshallaah if possible will present the full response later. So the opposers created doubts and confusion regarding Taqwiyyatul- Eemaan in the mind of Mulla Baghdaadee, as Taqwiyyatul-Eemaan was written initially written in Arabic as the book ‘Radd al-Ashraak’ which was later translated into Urdu, as the first chapter and was titled as the famous work of Taqwiyyatul-Eemaan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel sent the Arabic edition to a handful of people but the edition that became well known was the Urdu one and Mulla Baghdaddee did not understand the language and relied on translation and interpretation of others, the ones who caused the confusion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the response of Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel the doubts and confusion of Mulla were cleared and later Mulla Baghdaadee met Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel and personally apologised for his false allegations and admitted that his confusion was based upon what was incorrectly conveyed to him by the opposers of Ahlus-Sunnah. (refer to Tadhkirrah Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.235-236</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel mentions in his response that Mulla Baghdaadee himself praised the book Taqwiyyatul-Eemaan but argued that a particular statement was correct and from the aspects of Belief but mentioning it was disrespectful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“..All praise be to Allaah that he guided many a man and woman by this treatise and no one looked at it with doubt or revilement except a handful of ignorant opposers. I have also come to know this treatise of mines was read to you and you praised it. Also with this you said that from the creation of Allaah, he creating the idols and making them equivalent to the Prophets is something true and from the aspects of belief but it is a form of disrespect and dishonour….” (The Response to Mulla Baghdaadee’s Letter <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.1-2</span>).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel then goes onto answer this claim in great detail. So this is the affair of the “refutation” that WAS NOT published as falsely claimed by Haddad, by Mulla Baghadadee and his position regarding Imaam Muhammad Ismaa’eel.</span></p>
