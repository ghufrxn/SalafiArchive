<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[133] </strong></span><span style="color: #000080"><strong>From Malik from Al-&#8216;Ala Ibn Abdurahman from his father from Abu Hurairah (Radi Allahu Anhu) that (once) </strong></span><span style="color: #000080"><strong>the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) came to the graveyard and said: &#8220;Peace be upon you! (i.e. May Allah grant you peace) The abode of the believing people and we, if Allah so wills, are about to join you. I love to see my brothers.&#8221; They (the companions) said: Aren&#8217;t we your brothers, O Messenger of Allah? He said: You are my companions, and our brothers are those who have, so far, not come into the world and I would arrive at the Hawd (Kawthar) before them . They said: Messenger of Allah, how would you recognise those persons of your Ummah who will after you (and have not yet been born into the world yet)? He said: What do you think about a man who had horses with white faces and feet among horses which were all black, tell me, would he not recognise his own horses? They said: Certainly, O Messenger of Allah. He said: These people (my Ummah) will come ono the day of Judgement with white faces, arms and feet (due to the ablution), and I would arrive at the Hawd (Kawthar) before them. Then some people would be driven away from my Hawd (Kawthar) as the stray camel is driven away. I would call out to them (three times): Come here, come here, come here. Then it would be said (to me): These people changed (the Sunnah and the religion of Islam by Innovating things into it) after you (passed away), thus I would say: Get far away (from me), get far away (from me), get far away (from me).<br />

<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [IT&#8217;S CHAIN IS SAHIH]</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES] <span style="color: #000000">&#8211; [MUSLIM]</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (1/28-30 hadith no.57, book 2, chapter 6, hadith no.28), at-Tamhid (20/238, 239) al-Istidhkar (no.51)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Muslim (no.249) from the hadith of Malik </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Apart from specifically making special preparations to travel to a particular grave, it is highly recommended to visit the graveyard in order to make dua for the deceased Muslim people and to reflect and remember death. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Note that the prohibition of visiting graves has been abrogated. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Women are allowed to visit the graves of their close relatives such as their brother etc. just as it is established from the authentic ahadith. See Sahih Bukhari (no.1283) and Sahih Muslim (no.974, Darusalam no.2256)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">A&#8217;isha (Radi Allahu Anha) went to the grave of her brother Abdurahman Ibn Abi Bakr (Radi Allahu Anhuma). (See al-Mustadrak of al-Hakim 1376 hadith no.1392, and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Sahih]</em> and adh-Dhahabi authenticated it)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">However note that it is not allowed for women to go the graves of non-relatives such as the grave of a scholar who was famous amongst the general people. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">See Sunan Abi Dawud (no.3123 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Hasan]</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Rather the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) has cursed (sent La&#8217;nah) on those women who visit graves frequently. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">See Sunan Ibn Majah (no.1576, and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Hasan]</em>) and Sunan at-Tirmidhi (no.1056, and he said: <em>[Hasan Sahih]</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) Asalamu alaikum is a dua. In no way does this mean that the dead can hear because it is wajib for the one who hears the salam to reply back to it and there is no authentic hadith which mentions that the dead person gives the reply of salam. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The meaning of when the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said that those righteous believers who will come after him are his brothers was an indication of his great love and great kindness for them. On the other hand the The Prophet or Messenger (Alayhimusalam) is the Imam, guide, leader and the one who should be obeyed. He is not restricted to only being a big brother (!) it is noteworthy to understand this point fully. The righteous predecessors did not go around saying that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was our big brother and we should respect him (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) as a big brother is respected. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) The Hawd Kawthar is a reality. The people who innovate in the religion and the wrongdoers will be taken far away from it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) will recognise his followers from the Ummah on the day of Judgement because the body parts which they did ablution on will be shining. For example see at-Tamhid (20/261, 262 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Hasan]</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) did not have knowledge of the unseen rather Allah is the only One who has knowledge of the unseen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) It is a highly good deed to act upon the Quran and Sunnah in the era where there are severe amounts of Innovation in the religion, misguidance, disbelief and oppression. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"> </span></p>
