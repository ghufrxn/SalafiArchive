<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) Just like Makkah Mukaramah, Madinah Tayibah is also a forbidden sanctuary (haram) as it is established from the Mutawatir hadith. See Nazm al-Mutanathir Minal Hadith al-Mutawatir of Kittani (pg.212) hadith (no.244), other than</span><span style="color: #000000"> Abu Hurayrah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) the following companions (RadhiAllaahu Anhum) also narrated this:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In opposition to these authentic mutawatir Hadith, some people say, based on their self fabricated doubts that: “Madinah is not a sanctuary according to us.” (Rad al-Mukhtar &#8216;Ala Dur ul-Mukhtar (2/278), ad-Dur al-Mukhtar (1/184) [Trans Note: this is a reprimand of the hanafi position as mentioned by the 2 aforementioned books which clearly contradicts the authentic Sunnah]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) It is prohibited (haram) to hunt, cut trees and plants in Madinah except for lemongrass which has been permitted [Trans Note: The permissions is based on lemongrass being an asset]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) Abu Hurayrah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) was always ready to act on the hadith of the noble Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The hadith is also evidence (and an authority) just like the Qur’an, the hadith is an unapparent revelation.</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Publishers Introduction</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All Praise be to Allaah the Most High and Majestic and may there be abundant salutations upon the Messenger of Allaah (r) and his family.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the second treatise of Shaikh Taalib ur Rehman which Maktabah Ashaabul Hadeeth have translated. This books gives an insight into the real creed and beliefs of the destructive deobandee sect and their fellow ­madhabees, the bareilwees. The deceptive deobandees hide behind a cloak of innocence when in reality they also hold the same ill-beliefs as the bareilwees.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If a ­deobandee or bareilwee says something, which generally conforms to the Quraan and Hadeeth, it does not make their core beliefs and doctrines conform to the Aqeedah of Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jama’ah and neither does it make them innocent of the beliefs contained in their books. That is unless and until they warn againt these anti islamic beliefs</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of GF Haddad, Yaqoobee, Riyadh ul-Haq, Zaheer Mahmood, Asraar the Soofee Bareilwee Rasheed, Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed, Tahir ul-Qadiree, Hisham Kabbani, Nuh Haa Meem Keller, Hamza Yusuf, Zaid Shaakir (not forgetting the South African acadamies) and all of the adherents of the Soofee ideology are the proponets of such beliefs, if not openly then certainly secretly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Using polemics and rethoric is something the people of innovation and misguidance use often and it is no childs play to them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If these individuals or other than them, from the people we meet on a daily basis say, <em>“Well these beliefs are clear shirk and Kufr and we have no association with them, rather we believe in tawheed.”</em> Then we advise them to warn from these clear statements of shirk and misguidance and warn against the people who uttered these statements. Warning against Shirk and calling to Tawheed is the duty of every Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many innocent Muslims who call themselves bareilwees and deobandees, or sympathise with such ideologies are in essence totally unaware of the real beliefs of the founders of these 2 sub continent sects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book serves to highlight the beliefs of both sects and hence show to the reader that things are ­really not that black and white as these 2 sects have been claiming. Shaikh ­Taalib ur Rehmaan (Hafidahullaah) has brought statements from both sects ­of a corrupt belief side by side, showing the manifest similarities between these 2 sects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In his last conversation with the brothers just before Ramadhaan 1432H, Shaikh Taalib ur Rehmaan strongly advised them to print the book knowing they had translated the book 10 years peviously with his full support and encouragment. The Shaikh also encouraged them to translate other beneficial works and praised them for their extended efforts against the people of innovation and misguidance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly we hope this publication serves to aid the people in ­understanding the correct and clear meaning of Islaam, believing in the Oneness of Allaah and purifying themselves from Shirk and Kufr. Furthermore believing in ­Muhammad (r) as the final Messenger and following him in every way and abandoning abhorent taqleed. Ameen</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an E-Book publication, it can be downloaded in PDF format or alternatively read online.</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Authors introduction</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After writing <em>al-Deobandiyyah</em> I thought it would be beneficial to summarise it, making it easily readible for the average person. I also wanted to further mention some of the beliefs of the Deobandees that I was not able to mention in al-Deobandiyyah. This is the reason that led to me ­write the book, ‘Aqaa’id Ulama Deoband.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However after writing <em>‘Aqaa’id Ulama Deoband’ </em>I thought why not compare the beliefs of the scholars of Deoband with the scholars of Bareilee. So the reader does not have any difficulty in understanding, that the very reason verdicts of shirk and kufr are uttered at the bareilwees for adopting such beliefs, are infact also the beliefs of the scholars of Deoband.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In other words it is totally unfair and synonymously unjust in saying one sect is mushrik (associating deities in the worship of Allaah) whilst the other is muwahhid (believes in the Oneness of Allaah) when both sects uphold the same beliefs and doctrines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore in this book I have only mentioned the beliefs of both sects which are the same. Infact at certain times even the wording and incidences are similar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So if on the basis of these beliefs it is impemissible to pray behind the bareilwees and incorrect to maintain family ties, then what kind of justice is it to pray behind the deobandees and maintain family ties with them? Please think before you do certain actions as they can take you towards the Hellfire instead of Paradise.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Aqeedah of Wahdatul Wajood (ie Allaah is incarnate in everything) that Allaah Came To This Earth as Muhammad (r)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan wrote, <em>“lift the veils and show us your might, as the Noor of Allaah is veiled”</em> (Hadaaiq Bakhshish 1/80)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Muhammad Yaar Gharhee wrote, <em>“The one who used blow the flute all the time and say I am the slave, will come out on Gods throne and say ana inallaah (for I am Allaah)</em> (Deewaan Muhammadi pg.149)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Khawaja Ghulaam Fareed wrote, <em>“Ahmad (a name of the Messenger of ­Allaah) </em>(r)<em> to Ahad (ie the one Allaah) there is no difference as there is no ­attribute of oneness.”</em> (Kaafee no.99 pg.90)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah (the famous author of Fadhail Amaal) said whilst ­presenting the poetry of Qaasim Nanautwee, <em>“Remained the veil of being a man on your grandeur, we do not know who is what in the part of the veil”</em> (Tableegi Nisaab pg.810)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Zakariyyah writes about the very famous proponent of ­wahdatul ­wajood, Mansoor Hallaaj, <em>“And mansoor was hanged just on the basis of leaving ­etiquettes, his saying of annal-Haqq (I am the truth) was the Haqq (ie the truth) but one word too blasphemous.”</em> (Walee Kaamil pg.279)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> The close Soofee disciple of Zakariyyah, Soofee Iqbal writes <em>“Love, the loved and the lover say it as one, and so the oneness was explained.” </em>(Muhabbat pg.70)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[2]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Attributes Of Allaah Are Exclusive For Him And Even Messenger of Allaah (r) Cannot Have Them.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan writes, <em>“The enlightened one and the leader of the Helpers (ie Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee) is the complete inheritor, representative and a reflection of the essence of the Messenger of Allaah </em>(r)<em> in terms of all of his ­attributes, his grandeur, his might and his virtues, in the same ­manner Allaah is with all of his attributes and might that he reflected himself in ­Muhammad </em>(r)<em>” </em>(Fatwaa Ifreeqiyyah pg.101)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah writes, <em>“Allaah, the truth who is an encompassment of every grandeur and goodness then in reality there is none other than his ­grandeur.” </em>(Tableegi Nisaab pg.300)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Maulana Rasheed Ahmad Gangohee said, <em>“Sayyid Sahib had the attributes of the almighty incarnated in him.”</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.185)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Ashraf Alee Thanwee writes, <em>“The one who is complete has a position called Abul-Waqt and when he wishes to have Allaahs attributes to be incarnated in him he can do so. it is not strange that Shaah Sahib may have had attribute of al-Jabbar incarnated in him at that time and from his position of mazhariyyat he may have resolved it by this attention.”</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.68)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[3]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Mankind Can Only Claim to be the Worshipper of Allaah and Nothing Else As This Is Shirk.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan named himself as Abdul Mustafa (ie the worshipping slave of the Messenger Of Allaah (r) (Man Huwa Ahmad Raza pg.16 of Shujaat ­Qadiree)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haajee Imdaadullah Muhaajar Makkee writes, <em>“As the Messenger of Allaah </em>(r) <em>is the truth you can call the worshipping slave of Allaah the ­worshipping slave of the Messenger.” </em>(Shamaa’im Imdaadiyyah 2/71)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Manzoor Numaanee said about Shah Abdur Rasool that he was from the well known Auliyaas of Muhammad Mian.(Monthly ­al-Furqaan Shaikh ul Hadeeth no pg.66)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> </strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [4]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Only Allaah Alone Can Help And No Prophet Or Holy Person Can Help.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan writes, <em>“Seeking help and assistance from the prophets, Auliyaa and righteous scholars is permissible even after their deaths as the Auliyaa even after their deaths, have power and rights to help in this world.” </em>(Risaalah Hayaatal-Mawaat of Ahmad Raza Khan, from Fataawa Ridhwiyyah 4/300)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Another Bareilwee scholar said, <em>“The power and rights to help of the Auliyaa increase after their deaths”</em> (Fataawa Naeemiyyah pg.249)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maulana Ahsan Gheelanee writes, <em>“We do not deny or reject seeking help from the souls of the Auliyaa, hence so if a believer ­inflicted with troubles seeks help from good souls then what verse of the Quraan or Hadeeth refutes this.”</em> (Haashiyah Suwaaneh Qaasimee 1/332)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> The deobandee author Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah writes, <em>“The scholars of Deoband never say that no one other than Allaah can have knowledge of the unseen and similarly they also do not believe and accept that a man during his life or even after his death has no power to help.”</em> (Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah pg.101)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> In another place he writes, <em>“Every man whether in this world or in the state or barzakh needs the permission of Allaah and his spirituality. Up until there is permission some souls who are in the state of barzakh help the people, who are from this world and tell them some things.”</em> (Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah pg.152)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> the Deobandee author of Inkishaaf writes, <em>“The friendship of Allah and the miracles of the Auliyaa remain after their deaths with the permission of Allah and so with regards to this just understand that souls of the auliya can also come to this world with the permission of Allaah and can help the people with the command of Allaah.”</em> (Inkishaaf pg.67).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ayoob Ridhwi writes about Ahmad Raza Khan,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The remover of the  problems of the creation Ahmad Raza,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>He is my helper of calamities Ahmad Raza</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Who gives to me and who gave what</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no reference to this quote so we have not translated it, but it is a poem of Imdaadullah Muhaajir Makkee and Qaasim Nanautwee full of shirk.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan writes, <em>“There are certain people of Allaah whom he has singled out for the removal of calamities and the people whilst being worried and fearful go to them for help for the removal of their calamities.”</em> (al-Aman Wal Ula pg.29)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Ahmad Raza Khan further writes, <em>“And the respected (Messenger of Allaah </em>(r)<em> is there for help at difficult times and he is the one who gives the best help so call upon him humbily and he is the one to seek refuge in from every evil.”</em> (al-Aman Wal Ula pg.10)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Deobandee author of Inkishaaf writes whilst quoting a book on Soofee terminology, <em>“It is these people who are the inheritors of the Prophets and they are the ones who remove the calamities of the creation.”</em> (Inkishaaf pg.250)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Deedar Alee Bareilwee writes, <em>“There is a Gauth (helper) in every era and without him the Heavens and Earths cannot exist”</em> (Rasool al-Kalaam pg.129)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> In one place Ahmad Raza Khan writes, <em>“Because the Auliya are so wide spread, the system of the world is intact.”</em> (al-Aman Wal Ula pg.34)</span><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan writes, <em>“Once Shaikh Muhiy ud deen Ibn A’rabee went to an invitation and he saw a young boy who was eating and all of a sudden he starting crying and when he was asked why he was crying he said, “My mother has been ordained to go to Hell and the Angels are taking her right now.” Shaikh Muhiy ud deen had already recited the kalimah 70,000 times and so he transferred the reward of the deed to the boys mother. All of a sudden the boy started laughing so Shaikh Muhiy ud deen asked him why he was laughing and he replied, “I saw the Angels taking my mother to Paradise.”</em> (Malfoozaat Ahmad Raza Khan pg.82, see also Hakayaat Ridhwiyyah pg.48)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>Deobandee  Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Read the following incidence of a shaman having knowledge of the unseen, Mr Zakariyyah (the author of Fadhail Amaal) said <em>“Shaikh Abu Yazeed Qurtubee said, “I heard whoever recites the kalimah 70,000 times will be saved from the fire of Hell.” Upon hearing this I recited the kalimah 70,000 times for my wife and also recited the kalimah for myself as a means of salvation. A young boy used to live with us and it was well known that he had the power of Kashf (ie he could see apparitions) of both Paradise and Hell but I had reservations about this. One day we were eating and all of a sudden he started to scream and began to breath erratically and said my mother is being burnt in the Hellfire, I can see her.” Qurtubee said I was seeing his anxiety and thought I should transfer a set of 70,000 kalimahs to his mother and at the same time see if he is telling the truth about having the ability to see apparitions. So I transferred the kalimah to his mother and I did this inherently in my heart so no one knew of this except Allaah. The boy said, “Oh uncle my mother ie being removed from the Hellfire.” So I benefitted from this incident in 2 ways, firstly the benefit of the recitation of the kalimah 70,000 times as I saw an incident myself first hand and secondly the truth about the boy having the ability to see apparitions”</em> (Fadhail Tableegi Nisaab pg.576)</span></p>

None the less I went, as fulfilling the order was necessary. So I said to the river what I was told to say and all of a sudden the river gave me way.” When he reached the other side he gave the rice pudding to the auliya, who ate it and said, “Convey my greetings to your master.” So the servant said, “i’ll only be able to do that once I get across the river.” The auliya replied, “Go and say to the river, “I have been sent on the order by him who has never eaten in 30 years.” The servant was extremely shocked as the auliya had just eaten in front of him.

A holy shaman/nympholept lives over there in that small hut, so go to him and do whatever he says and be of service to him not leaving anything out. He may swear to you and even hit you but whatever he does do not hit him back. So this poor worried man went to this shaman and did as he was told and as he was told the shaman was rude and obtrusive and said, “Im not no god what can I do?” So the man continued to cry profusely (and crying is something important, may Allaah grant me blessing for me to cry[Zakariyyahs words]) so the shaman said to him, “Go to the river Jamna and say to it, “I have been sent by the man who has never eaten anything in his whole life nor slept with his wife so give me way.” So when this was said, the river gave way.”</em> (Fadhail Sadaqaat pg.528)</span></p>

<span style="color: #000000;"> Aashiq Ilaahee Meerthy writes, <em>“I have heard him say many a time upon his blessed tongue, “Listen the truth is that which is uttered from ­Rasheed Ahmad (Gangohees) tongue and I swear I am nothing but in this day and age guidance and salvation is lies in following me.”</em> (Tadhkiratur Rasheed 2/17)</span></p>

<span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [21]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is The Word Of Someone Other Than The Prophets Evidence</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A follower of Ahmad Raza Khan attributed prophethood to him in the following way, <em>“A’la Hazrat (ie Ahmad Raza) was Allaah’s evidence and proof on this earth.”</em>  (Anwaar Raza pg.33)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah said that Ilyaas said to me, <em>“Thanwees sayings are evidences and proofs for you and me.”</em> (Mahboob al-A’arifeen pg.30)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> In one place Mr Zakariyyah answers a question posed by a person by saying, <em>“You wrote the evidence should only be from the Quraan, Hadeeth or fiqh, as the statements of scholars will not be accepted. I say concerning this, an ­Al­laamah like yourself has the right not to take the statements of the scholars but for someone like me with little knowledge all the statements of the people of the truth and those who are trustworthy are evidence.</em>” (The Problems with the Books of Fadhail and their Answers pg.128)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [22]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Who Is The One Who is Really Disrespectful (Gustaakh) To The Prophet?</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bastawee writes, <em>“After the death of Ahmad Raza an Arab man came and said, “On the 25th of Safar in the year 1340H my destiny changed and I saw the Messenger of Allaah </em>(r)<em> in a dream. The Messenger of Allaah </em>(r)<em> has come and his companions are also waiting with him but there is a silence in the gathering and from the indicators I find out that they are waiting for someone. So I said to the Prophet </em>(r)<em>, “May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, who are you waiting for? He (the Prophet </em>(r)<em> replied, “Ahmad Raza.” I asked, “Who is Ahmad Raza.” The Prophet </em>(r) <em>replied, “A resident of bareilee in India.” After my dream I longed to meet Ahmad Raza so I went to India, Bareilee and found that Ahmad Raza was dead. It was the very same day of the 25th when I travelled and it was also the day of his death.”</em> (Bastawee pg.121, Fataawa Ridhwiyyah vol 2 Muqaddimah pg.13)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah said, <em>“I saw my dads sister when she was nearing death she shouted and said, “Hurry and make me sit up and the Prophet </em>(r)<em> is coming, then her soul left her. When my paternal grandfather Maulana Ismaa’eel died there was a crowd for 3 and a half miles from Nizaam ud Deen to Delhi. A man who had the ability to see apparitions saw that Maulana Ismaa’eel said, “Bury me quickly as I am very embarassed because the prophet is waiting for me with his companions.”</em> (Maulana Ilyaas and his Religious Dawah pg.48)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000080;"> [23]</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Who Disrespects The Companions?</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bareilwee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The one who disrespected the companions by saying the following about Ahmad Raza Khaan, <em>“Seeing A’la hazrat decreased my yearning to see the companions.”</em> (Wasayaa Shareef pg.24)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Munshee Muhammad Eesaa mentions the statement of Mr Thanwee concerning Mr Zakariyyah and his group, “(then Mr Thanwee) addressed the gathering and said, <em>“If anyone wants to see how the prophets companions were, then look at these people.”</em> (Tablighi Tahreek Kee Ibtidaa Aur Iske Bunyaadee Usool pg.51 <em>‘The Beginning Of the Tableeghi Movement &amp; Its Fundamental Principles’</em>)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</b></span></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Calling Upon Other Entities for Help is Shirk</span><span id="more-1261"></span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So asking holy saints, peers or anyone claiming to be able to help you, like you have these Moulvees on TV blowing on strings and objects and doing things for you via the TV screen, they are all impermissible with regards to aiding you and assisting you in your calamities and troubles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And your Lord says, “Call upon Me; I will respond to you.” Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell [rendered] contemptible.” (Soorah al-Ghaafir 40:60)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>And “Call upon your Lord in humility and privately..”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and his saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And invoke Him in fear and aspiration.” (Soorah al-A’raaf 7:55-56)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, <em>“Dua is worship.”</em> (Abu Dawood 2/161, Ibn Maajah 2/1258, Ahmad 4/267)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Infact Allaah reprimands and censured those who call upon other than him explaining how misguided these people are who call upon other than him for help, he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And who is more astray than he who invokes besides Allah those who will not respond to him until the Day of Resurrection, and they, of their invocation, are unaware.” (Soorah al-Ahqaaf 46:5)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the day of judgement when our deeds will be counted, the very same people that are called upon will deny everything, Allaah the most high and majestic said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And those whom you invoke other than Him do not possess [as much as] the membrane of a date seed. If you invoke them, they do not hear your supplication; and if they heard, they would not respond to you. And on the Day of Resurrection they will deny your association. And none can inform you like [one] Acquainted [with all matters].” (Soorah al-Faatir 35:13-14)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These verses indicate the dangers of asking other than Allaah for help and making dua to them. It is strange how we as Muslims are ignorant and lazy concerning these verses as we see may Muslims going to graves and making dua to the people in them, who they consider to be Auliyaa, holy saints and peer and they believe the people in these graves are actually listening to them, when in reality they will deny and reject everything on the day of judgement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How has shaytaan beautified this for them and they don’t even realise how bad and oppressive this is. Such people reject listening to the truth and repel it. How have we as Muslims become so ignorant and unintelligent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These foolish people, including groups of Muslims believe that these people in the graves will give them some benefit and will remove their calamity. Allaah the majestic said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Say, “Do you worship besides Allah that which holds for you no [power of] harm or benefit while it is Allah who is the Hearing, the Knowing?” (Soorah al-Ma’idah 5:76)</strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>From The Aspects of Shirk is Going to Peers and Soofee Saints And Pleading With Them</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Making istigathah is a form of dua. Istigathah is seeking help from a calamity or trouble that befalls you and pleading and supplicating to holy people at such times of distress. It is very common in our culture that as soon as some problems befalls us we run to our peers and Soofee saints pleading to them and asking them for help. Allaah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“when you asked help of your Lord, and He answered you,…” (Soorah al-Anfaal 8:9)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There used to be a hypocrite in Madeenah during the time of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) whose name was Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salool who used to harm and abuse the Muslims. So the Muslims thoughts let’s go to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and plea to him and get rid of this hypocrite. The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Verily Do not plea to me as you should plea to Allaah.” </em>(Majma’a az-Zawaa’id 10/159, Tabaqaat Ibn Sa’ad 1/387)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Hadeeth clearly shows it is unlawful to ask for help and to plea to other than Allaah. Without doubt the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) was able to help the companions by expelling the hypocrite from Madeenah but the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) rejected their pleading and thereby closed the doors to shirk. This Hadeeth also shows it is impermissible to seek help and to plea to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and to anyone else for that matter.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>From The Aspects Of Shirk Is To Sacrifice For Anything Other Than Allaah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is also a form of worship in which many Muslims are making mistakes and delving into shirk by sacrificing in the name of other than Allaah. Many Muslims sacrifice animals in the name of other than Allaah ie for the Auliyaa and people in graves. Sometimes they might offer other food or sweet dishes for the people in the grave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sometimes they may offer money for such acts to be performed with the intention of seeking reward. Such people claim they are not sacrificing for the dead people in the graves, tombs or shrines directly but rather for Allaah and we go through these people as means as they are holy saints and hence close to Allaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is exactly what the mushrikeen of Makkah used to say word for word and this is clear Shirk. Allaah said make all prayers and sacrifice for me alone, he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad ): “Verily, my Salat (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists).” (Soorah al-An’aam 6:162)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, <em>“Allaah cursed him who sacrificed for anyone besides Allaah.” </em>(Saheeh Muslim no.4876, Nasaa’ee 7/205, Musnad 1/108,118)</span></p>
