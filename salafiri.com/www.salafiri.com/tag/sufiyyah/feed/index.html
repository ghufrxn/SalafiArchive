<p class="list-group-item-text ftwa-single-q "><strong>We are students who are seeking knowledge. We study ‘aqeedah with some teachers who are teaching us Ash’ari ‘aqeedah. They interpret the hand of Allaah as meaning His power or His blessing, and His being above His throne (istiwaa’) as meaning His sovereignty, and so on. What is the ruling on studying with these teachers?</strong></p>
<div id="available-date">Praise be to Allaah.</div>
</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
<div class="list-group-item-text ftwa-single-answer font-nrmal">
<p>These people who interpret the Qur’aan in this manner, whether they are called Ash’aris or some other name, have gone astray from the path of the righteous salaf. Not even one letter of what these people say in their misinterpretations has been narrated from the righteous salaf. Let them bring one word from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or from Abu Bakr, or ‘Umar, or ‘Uthmaan, or ‘Ali, to say that they interpreted Allaah’s hand as meaning His power, or that they interpreted His being above the Throne (istiwaa’) as referring to His Sovereignty, or that they interpreted His Face as meaning reward, or that they interpreted His love as meaning reward, etc. Let them produce one word from them to show that they interpreted these aayahs and similar verses in the manner that these people interpret them. If they cannot produce any such thing, let it be said that either the righteous salaf, headed by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the leader of the pious, were unaware of the meaning of this tremendous ‘aqeedah (of Islam), or they did know it but they concealed the truth. But neither of these can be said of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or of any of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs, or of his Companions (may Allaah be pleased with them). If that is the case then we have to follow their path (the path of the Prophet and the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs).</p>
<p>My advice to these people is to fear Allaah and to abandon what So and so said, and to come back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the way of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs who came after him. They should know that there will come a Day when they will return to Allaah, when they will not be able to use the opinion of So and so as evidence. By Allaah, So and so will not be able to help them on that Day.  Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>“And (remember) the Day (Allaah) will call to them, and say: ‘What answer gave you to the Messengers?’”</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>[al-Qasas 28:65]</i></p>
<p>He did not say, Remember the Day when (Allaah) will call to them and say, ‘What answer gave you to So and so…?’</p>
<p>And Allaah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>“So believe in Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad), who believes in Allaah and His Words, and follow him so that you may be guided”</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>[al-A’raaf 7:158]</i></p>
<p>Allaah commanded us to believe in him and follow him. If this is the case then how can a person believe in Allaah and His Messenger in the true and complete sense, then turn away from the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the way in which he believed in his Lord, and misinterpret the way in which Allaah has described Himself in His Book or the way in which His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has described Him, simply because of illusions which they call rational thought?</p>
<p>I advise them to come back to Allaah and to abandon any other opinion, and follow what Allaah and His Messenger say, for if they die following that they will have died following the truth. But if they go against that then they are in grave danger and those whose opinions they are following will not protect them from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>“(Remember) the Day when every person will come up pleading for himself, and every one will be paid in full for what he did (good or evil, belief or disbelief in the life of this world) and they will not be dealt with unjustly”</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><i>[al-Nahl 16:111]</i></p>
<p> I repeat this advice to every believer, to come back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with regard to what he believes about his Lord and God, following the path of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the rightly guided khaleefahs who came after him, and the imams of the Muslims who led the people in following the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), without referring to rational thought, which is no more than an illusion, concerning issue that have to do with Allaah and His names and attributes. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah spoke well when he described the ahl al-kalaam (“Islamic” philosophers) as “having been given intelligence but not knowledge, and had having been given smartness but not sincerity.” So one has to deepen one’s knowledge on the basis of the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). I ask Allaah to help us all to have faith and to cause us to meet Him when He is pleased with us, for He is Able to do all things. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds, and may Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.</p>
<p>I call upon all seekers of knowledge to call their brothers to that which they have heard, for by Allaah it is the truth. Whoever claims to have truth other than this, we will accept it and adhere to it (if it can be proven to be true).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Fir&#8217;aun (Pharaoh) said: &#8220;O chiefs! I know not that you have an ilâh (a god) other than me, so kindle for me (a fire), O Hâmân, to bake (bricks out of) clay, and set up for me a Sarh (a lofty tower, or palace) in order that I may look at (or look for) the Ilâh (God) of Mûsa (Moses); and verily, I think that he [Mûsa (Moses)] is one of the liars.&#8221; </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Al Qasas:38]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Fir&#8217;aun (Pharaoh) said: &#8220;O Hâmân! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways, (36) &#8220;The ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the Ilâh (God) of Mûsa (Moses) But verily, I think him to be a liar.&#8221; Thus it was made fair-seeming, in Fir&#8217;aun&#8217;s (Pharaoh) eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the (Right) Path, and the plot of Fir&#8217;aun (Pharaoh) led to nothing but loss and destruction (for him).</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Ghāfir: 36-37]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are various points of benefit from these āyahs of which some are:</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The prophets and messengers of previous nations also held the creed that Allāh is above the heavens.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">To reject Allāh being above the heavens is to follow the way of Fir’aun the accursed.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed, to reject Allāh being above the heavens is that which leads to misguidance and a removal from the straight path of guidance.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Such a baseless creed of rejecting Allāh being above the heavens makes one’s evil deeds as seem fairing to the person.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Such a creed leads a person to find ways to reject and alter the Shari’ah revealed by Allāh [as was perpetrated by Fir’aun].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">However, Allāh destroys all false ways and alterations made by the person of false creed.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Tahāwī states:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Those from the Jahmiyyah sect who reject Allāh being high above are Firawnī [upon the way of Fir’aun]. Then those who affirm Allāh being high above are upon the way of Mūsa and Muhammad”.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">[Sharh Aqīdah Tahāwiyyah, pg:259]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And in the heaven is your provision, and that which you are promised.” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Adh-Dhāriyāt:22]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;You worship besides Allâh only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allâh have no power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allâh (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back.” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[al-Ankabūt:17]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is thus clearly established that the provision of sustenance is with Allāh and He is above the heavens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4] </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Do you feel secure that He, who is over [fī] the heaven (Allâh), will not cause the earth to sink with you, and then it should quake?” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[al-Mulk:16]</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5]</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Or do you feel secure that He, who is over [fī] the heaven (Allâh), will not send against you a violent whirlwind? Then you shall know how (terrible) has been My Warning.” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[al-Mulk:17]</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imām al-Bayhaqī comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The word [Fī] in these ayaat means over and above. It is saying are you not afraid of your Lord who is above the heavens? Similar to this is the meaning when Allāh says in the Qurān “so travel [Fī] the earth” also ‘and I will crucify you on [Fī] the trunks of palm trees’ [which is what Fir’aun said to the magicians when they believed in Mūsa]. It is clear that the ayah of travelling upon the earth means that the thing ‘above’ is the heavens and Allāh is above them. Therefore, the meaning of these ayaat shall be ‘Are you not afraid of the one who is above His Throne’ as is established in many other ayaat”.</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Al-Itiqād of al-Bayhaqī, pg 42]. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He also states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Abū Abdullah al-Hāfidh said the Shaikh Abū Bakr Ahmad Bin Ishāq Bin Ayūb the Jurist said that ‘The specialist linguists of the Arabic language have said that the word ‘Fī’ is used interchangeably with the word ‘alā’ [above/over] in the language. Allāh said ‘“so travel [Fī] the earth” and ‘and I will crucify you on [Fī] the trunks of palm trees’ here the word Fī in these ayaat means ‘alā’, i.e., over/above. It is likewise with this in mind we understand Allāh’s words in Quran when he says ‘Fī’ the heavens, i.e., it means above His Throne, above the heavens as has been mentioned in numerous prophetic traditions.”</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Al Asmā wa Sifāt of al-Bayhaqī, pg 299].</em></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>SHIRK.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Shaikh has mentioned twenty chapters under how shirk is manifested in the Ummah. From amongst them he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">To seek help assistance from other than Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Mankind in the world through their dealings assist and cooperate with one another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Allāh almighty has said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“Cooperate with one another upon good and god fearing” [Al Māidah:2]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">However, concerning those issues in which one has no control or ownership and which belong solely to Allāh by way of his qualities then to seek help from the creation expecting from them these qualities is to make shirk with Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Allāh says:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“Do you not know that the owner of the heavens and earth is none other than Allāh, And besides Allāh you have neither any Walî (protector or guardian) nor any helper.” [Al-Baqarah: 107]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Since there is no guardian or helper other than Allāh then how can one seek such help from other than Him? In fact, to do so is to make shirk with Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Shirk has become so embedded in our society that certain people when they meet each other instead of giving the Islamic greetings of salām one will say “O Alī [the companion and 4<sup>th</sup> Caliph] help me” and the recipient will say “My guide and protector Alī help me”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Do these people not see that Alī could not help his son in the travesty of Karbalā in which he was martyred? Nor could he save himself against his killer Ibn Muljim. In reality, Alī himself was always in need of Allāh and did not have the power to benefit and protect himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Those that have abandoned the legislated salām of salutation have shown a clear opposition and enmity to the Lord of all Mankind, Allāh. Allāh says,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">“If Allāh helps you, none can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, who is there after Him that can help you? And in Allāh (Alone) let believers put their trust.” [Āli-Imrān:160]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Muhammad Bin Ishāq al-Mutaalibī said concerning this ayah:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">“If Allāh is aiding you then no person can overcome or humiliate you and the opposite is also the case. Thus do not leave the commands of Allāh for the sake of another but instead leave others instead of the commands of Allāh. The believers should rely only on Allāh and not on others”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">[Durr Manthūr [2:1] as reported from Jarir, Ibn Mundhir and Ibn Abī Hātim]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This ayah shows that even in affairs in which a person has ability help another in this world cannot do so unless Allāh wills and allows. Therefore, to ask creation in that which they have no ability or control is furthermore inconceivable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Then this is why we have been commanded to read in every prayer the Fātiha which has within it:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything).” [Fātiha:4]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Therefore, without doubt the Muslims creed should be based on only seeking help and aid from Allāh but even in this regard some people from amongst those who should know better fell short!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The famous Deobandī sect scholar Mahmūd ul Hasan who they refer to as the ‘Shaikh of India’ said in his tafsīr of this āyah that:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">“This āyah shows that to seek help from other than Allāh’s being is completely impermissible. However, if one was to find a pious person who is accepted and purely to gain the Mercy of Allāh one was to put him before Allāh [as an intermediary] then this is permissible. To seek help from this person will actually be as if one is seeking help from Allāh”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">[Meaning of the Qurān with notes of benefit. V1/2]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">So we say that such explanations open wide the door of shirk with Allāh; and it is with such explanations that the people use to justify to call upon other than Allāh with words such as calling upon the Prophet “Yā Muhammad”, the Angels, Abdul Qādir Jīlāni or other than them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In the battle of Badr when Allāh sent the angels to help the Muslims and the resulting happiness of that Allāh says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">“And Allāh made it not except as [a sign of] good tidings for you and to reassure your hearts thereby. And victory is not except from Allāh, the Exalted in Might, the Wise” [Āli Imran:126]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Explanation</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This means that the sending of the angels has been mentioned just so to reassure the companions and to change their anxiety into happiness and tranquillity. Otherwise, in reality it is not the angels who helped but Allāh alone as is evident from the ayah, and the angels being sent was only by Allāh’s authority and command and He can decide to help whomsoever and however He wants.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“And those whom you call upon besides Him (Allāh) cannot help you nor can they help themselves.&#8221; [Al-Arāf:197]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In reality those who are in the mausoleums, graves and various places where people gather to call upon other than Allāh are in need of the caretakers of the graves and mausoleums to protect the food, wealth and money that the ignorant people leave at their graves. They cannot help themselves from the thieves so how can they help others?</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“And they have taken besides Allāh âlihah (gods), hoping that they might be helped (by those so— called gods). (74) They cannot help them, but they will be brought forward as a troop against those who worshipped them (at the time of Reckoning).” [Yā-Sīn:74/75]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It means those who have fallen into shirk are hoping for assistance and help from those that they call upon and thus to call upon them is completely futile. Then from amongst these people who call upon others is the like of the Deobandī spiritual guide, scholar, Hāji Imdādullāh Muhājir Makki Hanafī Chishtī Qādrī Naqshbandī Sohrwardī says about his own guide Pīr Shāh Nūr Muhammad whilst addressing him the following couplets of poetry:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“You O Nūr Muhammad a special beloved of Allāh</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In India are the deputy of prophet Muhammad</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Whilst you are the helper then what is there to fear</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Due to the love you have of the prophet you shake and are in awe</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><u>Now is the time to help us O Shāh Nūr Muhammad</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">[Shamāim Amrādiyyah pg: 83]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">I say, if so called scholars have corrupt beliefs such as this then what can one expect of the ignorant lay person? Then it should be known that there is no doubt that such a call for help is shirk with Allāh as is evident from the verses above.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong><u>Some narrations:</u></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ubādah Bin Sāmit narrates that in the time of the Prophet there was a hypocrite who continued to hurt the believers. Some people said let us go to Prophet Muhammad to seek help in this affair. The Prophet upon hearing this said help is not sought from me but only from Allāh alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">[Fath ul Majīd Sharh Kitāb ut-Tawhīd pg: 178-79].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">So if help cannot be sought from the Prophet then how is it conceivable one can ask for those who are less than him in rank and status?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abu Huraira reported:</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">When this ayah was revealed:&#8221; And warn thy nearest kindred (al-Qur&#8217;an, xxvi. 214), the Messenger of Allāh called the Quraish; so they gathered and he gave them a general warning. Then he made a particular (reference to certain tribes) and said: O sons of Ka&#8217;b b. Luwayy, rescue yourselves from the Fire; O sons of Murra b.

Six in the earth, and one above the heavens.’ He said: ‘So which of them do you take for your ardent requests and fears?’ He said: ‘The one above the heavens.’ He said: ‘O Husain, if you would but accept Islam, I would teach you two phrases that would benefit you.’” He said: “So when Husain accepted Islam, he said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, teach me the two phrases you promised me.’ So he said: “Say: O Allah, inspire me with my guidance, and protect me from the evil of my soul (Allāhumma alhimnī rushdī, wa a`idhnī min sharri nafsī).’”</em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">[Tirmidhī no:3483]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Whilst in a state of kufr the father of Imrān confirmed that it was only Allāh that should be called upon with all requests being made to Him and Him alone being feared. Hence, this was the creed of the disbelievers. What a calamity that today so called Muslims do not even have this same belief and instead seek help, assistance and show reverence and fear to the ones who are dead in the graves!! This companions story should be a lesson to all and we learn clearly that the one true Lord above the heavens should be called upon alone with no partners at all times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Allāh says,</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order, and invoke Him with fear and hope; Surely, Allâh&#8217;s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good-doers.” [Al-Arāf:56]</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">In conclusion, these narrations substantiate that no one can assist, aid, remove a calamity, or with whom trust, love hope and fear should be placed in other than the Lord of the Almighty Throne Allāh Himself. No prophet, angel, saint, scholar or any part of creation as a matter of fact can assist as they do not control the affairs, nor do they have the authority from Allāh to assist nor are they deputies of Allāh to whom Allāh has designated His Power to assist. Indeed, all creation itself is always in need of Allāh so we should therefore only call upon Him.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Ahl-ul-Hadeeth By Dr. Muhammad Deeya ar-Rahman al-Azamee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahl-ul-Hadeeth: Shaykh ul-Islaam said: ‘We do not mean to limit Ahl-ul-Hadeeth just to those who convey hadeeth, write them or narrate them but we mean by them: everyone who rightfully memorises the hadeeth, knowing them and understanding their apparent and hidden meanings and following them in what is apparent and hidden, and also the people of al-Qur’aan.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘The least of their traits is: love of the Qur’aan and hadeeth, researching them, seeking their meanings and practising that which they know is binding upon them. The Fuqaha of hadeeth are better informed about the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- than Fuqaha other than them.’[1]
<p style="text-align: justify;">He mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Ahl-ul-Hadeeth are those about whom the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘What I am upon and my Companions.’ And in another narration: ‘It is the Jamaah, The Hand of Allaah is over the Jamaah.’[2]
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahl-ul-Hadeeth are the best people of the Duniya, as Hafs bin Ghayaath said.[3]
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shafi’ee said: ‘If I see a companion of Hadeeth then it is as if I see a man from the Companions of the Prophet, sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, he is of that status.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">He also said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘May Allaah reward them with goodness on our behalf, they preserved the foundation for us so they have an excellence over us.’[4]
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Alee bin al-Madini said: ‘There are no people better than the companions of Hadeeth. The rest of the people were in search of the Duniya while they were establishing the Deen.’[5] i.e. the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hafidh Ibn Rajab said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Ahl-ul-Hadeeth are an authority in knowing hadeeth and knowing the authentic from the weak hadeeth.’[6]
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Prophet, sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, supplicated for illumination of the one who busies himself with the knowledge of hadeeth, memorizing it, conveying it and understanding it. He, sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, said: ‘May Allaah illuminate the person who hears a hadeeth from me and memorizes it until he conveys it. Perhaps a person who carries Fiqh conveys it to someone with more Fiqh than that person and perhaps the carrier of this Fiqh is not a Faqihi.’[7]
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hafidh Abu Bakr Ahmad bin ‘Alee al-Khateeb al-Bagdadi specifically authored a book which he called ‘Sharf Ashaabul-hadeeth’ (the nobility of the companions of hadeeth). In it mentions Ahadeeth and Athaar from the Companions, Ta’bieen, kings, ministers and others from those who followed them about the excellence of knowledge of hadeeth, being busy with it and the nobility of its people over those of Ahl-ul-Bida’ and those of misguidance from the Zinaadiqa (heretics) who concerned themselves with the knowledge of rhetoric and philosophy. This book is a masterpiece in this subject.’</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Umar bin al-Khattab, on the authority of Abdurrahman bin Abaan, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Zayd bin Thabit, RadhiAllaahu anhu, Marfoo’. It was also narrated by Ibn Majah (1/84) a different way on the authority of Zayd bin Thabit. Tirmidhee said it was Hasan and he also said: ‘and in this chapter it is also narrated on the authority of Abdullaah bin Mas’ood, Muadh bin Jabal, Jubayr bin Mut’im, Abu Darda and Anas, RadhiAllaahu anhum Jameean.’</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">*(<strong>Translator’s note</strong>: This article discusses the precise meaning of the word “fi” in Arabic as it applies to a particular ayah and hadith. Normally, the word “fi” is translated as “in” or “inside”. However, this translation is inaccurate when applied to those specific texts. For that reason, I have chosen to leave the word “fi” and some other words in transliterated form (fi as-samaa) while the rest of the text is translated into English.)*</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">أَءَمِنتُمْ مَّن فِى السَّمَآءِ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ فَإِذَا هِىَ تَمُورُ – أَمْ أَمِنتُمْ مِّن فِى السَّمَآءِ أَن يُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ حَـصِباً فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ كَيْفَ نَذِيرِ</span><br />
Allah the Exalted said: <span style="color: #ff0000;">{Do ye feel secure that He Who is (fi as-samaa) will not cause you to be swallowed up by the earth when it shakes? Or do ye feel secure that He Who is (fi as-sama)…} [67:16-17]</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hadith of the slave girl:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mu’awiyah as-Sahmi reported: «I had some sheep which I kept between Uhud and Juwaniyyah with a slave girl to look after them. One day, I went out to check on my sheep and discovered that a wolf had devoured one of them. Since I am just a human, (I became angry) and struck the girl. Later on, I came to the Prophet -Sallallahu alahi wa Sallam- and reported to him the incident. He terrified me with the gravity of my action. I said, “Messenger of Allah! Shall I free her (as an expiation of my sin.) He said ”<strong>Call her over</strong>.“</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I did, he asked her: ”<strong>Where is Allah?</strong>“ She said, “fi as-samaa.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then he asked her, ”<strong>Who am I ?</strong>“ She said, “The Messenger of Allah -Sallallahu alahi wa Sallam-“.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah -Sallallahu alahi wa Sallam- ordered me, ”<strong>Free her for she is a believer</strong>“ » [Sahih Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Reference: Sahih Muslim 537 a</em><br />
<em>In-book reference: Book 5, Hadith 39</em><br />
<em>USC-MSA web (English) reference: Book 4, Hadith 1094</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scholars have agreed that the phrase “fi as-samaa” in the ayah and the hadith of the slave girl does not mean inside the sky. Allah is Exalted above dwelling in His creation, or that the creation would surround Him. Such a meaning is absolutely invalid, and all the Imams of the Salaf are in consensus on that point. The scholars have explained the phrase in agreement with its meaning in the Arabic language, the many Islamic texts (Quran and Sunnah), sound intellect, and natural human instinct (fitrah).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The scholars explained “as-samaa” to be the Throne (`Arsh)</strong>, because the word “as-samaa” linguistically means the ceiling or roof of some object, and the Throne is the ceiling of all creation because it is above all creation, and all the creation is below it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Az-Zajjaj</strong> (d. 311 H.) said: “(As-samaa) linguistically is said about everything that is raised up and high above. Every ceiling is a ‘samaa’. For this reason the cloud is called the ‘samaa’ because it is high.” (1)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ibn Faris</strong> (d. 395 H) said: “(As-samaa) is the ceiling of the house, and everything that towers over is a ‘samaa’, to the point that the back of a horse is called ‘samaa’.” (2)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>“Fi” has been explained as (`alaa); i.e. on / over / above.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abu Bakr Ahmad As-Sibghi </strong>(d. 342 H.) said: «The Arabs would sometimes use the word ‘fi’ to mean ‘alaa’ (on/above). Allah the Exalted said: <span style="color: #ff0000;">{So travel ‘fi’ the earth} [9:2]</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">{I will crucify you ‘fi’ the trunks of palm trees} [20:71]</span>. The meaning is ‘on the earth’ and ‘on the trees’. The phrase ‘fi as-samaa’ is used in the same way, meaning on the throne and above the heavens, as it has authentically been reported from the Prophet peace be upon him. » (3)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Al-Harith al Muhasibi</strong> (d. 243 H.) said about its meaning: «It means above the throne, and the throne is above the sky, because whoever is above something which is above the sky is ‘fi as-samaa’» (4)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abu Bakr al-Bayhaqi</strong> (d. 458 H.) said: “He said <strong>{Do ye feel secure that He Who is (fi as-samaa)…}</strong> [67:16] and He meant “Who is above the sky”, just as He said <strong>{I will crucify you “fi” the trunks of palm trees} </strong>meaning: on the trunks of the palm trees. He also said <strong>{So travel “fi” the earth}</strong> meaning on the earth. Everything which is above is “samaa”, and the Throne is high above the heavens. So the meaning of the ayah, and Allah knows best, is: ‘Do you feel safe from the One who is above the Throne’, just as He clearly stated in all the other ayat.” (5)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>So the meaning of “fi as-samaa” in the ayah and the Hadith of the jariyah (slave girl) is: Above the heavens, on the Throne.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The pronoun “man” (Arabic for “who”) in the ayah is for Allah the Exalted:</span><br />
</strong><br />
– The slave girl’s answer to the question of the Prophet -Sallallahu alahi wa Sallam- “Where is Allah?” was: “fi as-samaa”, and he bore witness to her faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">– <strong>Muhammad ibn Yazid al-Mubarrad </strong>(d. 286 H.) said: “The question about what is understood from the word “man” (who) as in the ayah: <span style="color: #ff0000;">{Do ye feel secure that Who (Man) is ‘fi as-samaa’ will not cause you to be swallowed up by the earth}</span> indicated that “who” is being used for Allah the Exalted. (6)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">– <strong>Ibn Jarir At-Tabari</strong> (d. 310 H.) said: “<span style="color: #ff0000;">{Do ye feel secure that Who is fi as-samaa}</span>: it is Allah” (7)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">– <strong>Ibn Abi Zamanin</strong> (d. 399 H.) said: ” <span style="color: #ff0000;">{Who is fi as-samaa}</span> He means Himself” (8)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">– <strong>Abu al-Mudhaffar as Sam`ani</strong> (d. 489 H.) said about the explanation of the ayah: “Do you feel secure from your Lord.” (9)</p>
