				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 class="citation_title" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Early Manuscripts of Quran (Through Data of Hijazi Calligraphy and Archaeological Evidence)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Prof. Dr. Adnan bin Mohammed Shareef</strong> (Umm Al Qura University)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Prof. Dr. Yasser Ismail Abdul Salam</strong> (Cairo and Taif Universities)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>:|:|:- <em>This paper tackles the ambiguous doubts aired by Yasir Qadhi.  Some people are yet to grasp the fundamentals of Ahl al-Sunnah. This paper will leave you in awe, the detail in the research is phenomenal and Yasir Qadhi is left standing. Please, do leave your views in the comments</em> -:|:|:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This research tackled the manuscripts of the early Quran (through the data of Hijazi calligraphy and archaeological evidence), reviewing the spelling phenomena that characterized Quran writing in close relation to the reality of Arabic writing. It also attempted to enlist the characteristics of calligraphy in early Quran copies as influenced by Nabataean script or what might be called early Arabic calligraphy (Hijazi calligraphy), comparing it with early Arabic inscriptions. Moreover, the study identified the relationship between the spelling system used in writing early Quran copies and the one used in early Arabic inscriptions, and attempted to conceive ways of identifying and dating the early Quran manuscripts preserved in regional and international libraries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The study is mainly based on five copies of the Quran manuscripts preserved in international libraries and book houses; namely:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Quran manuscript preserved in Berlin National Library (Berlin Quran), the Quran preserved in Birmingham University Library (Birmingham Quran), Tübingen University Library Quran (Tübingen Quran), the Quran preserved in the National Library in Paris (Paris Quran), and the Quran preserved in the British Library in London (London Quran).</span><span style="color: #000000;">This is in addition to a collection of stone inscriptions and early dated papyrus received.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The identification of the origin of Arabic calligraphy is significant for researchers of ancient Arabic inscriptions and of the Quran, whether in terms of the manuscripts or the drawings and other related sciences. Such identifications also enables identifying the characteristics of this calligraphy, especially the early ones with which the first Quran was written to explain those sciences and others, and to resolve the debate on the origin of the calligraphy with which the Quran in the era of the Prophet peace be upon him was written and copied in the era of the Caliphs, may Allah be pleased with them all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are many trends and theories in determining the origin of the Hijazi Arabic calligraphy with which the Quran was written. A researcher of early dated Arabic inscriptions can easily identify a well-established writing system that writers followed, no matter how well that system resulted in conformity between what is written and what is pronounced.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The study concluded with a set of findings and recommendations, the most important of which are:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8211; The study proved that the early Quran copies received (samples of study) were copied and written in soft Hijazi calligraphy.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">&#8211; The study and the models of Quran manuscripts used proved the authenticity of the Holy Quran, despite the claims of Orientalists and skeptics.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">&#8211; The study revealed that most of the tithing marks were later on added in the early Quran manuscripts after their copying.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">&#8211; The study proved that among the main criteria that assist in dating the Quran manuscripts, especially the early ones, are their technical standards, as well as the linguistic standards in comparison with the cultural heritage, and then the radioactive carbon (C14) examination.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Debunking Yasir Qadhi(ism)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point by Point on Debunking Yasir Qadhi (ism) In light of his DISPATCH: Yasir Qadhi on Salafis and Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab, Science and Miracles, Yajuj and Majuj.</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Part 4</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Timestamp 1:00</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Host Mahin Says: I have heard, there is a guy in our WhatsApp group that calls him Sheikh ul-Islam of America, Ali al-Boriqi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Host SIM: oh Ali is very learned as well Mashallah that’s a huge compliment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Comment</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says in the glorious Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">[And they should consider that] when those who have been followed disassociate themselves from those who followed [them], and they [all] see the punishment, and cut off from them are the ties [of relationship], Those who followed will say, &#8220;If only we had another turn [at worldly life] so we could disassociate ourselves from them as they have disassociated themselves from us.&#8221; Thus will Allah show them their deeds as regrets upon them. And they are never to emerge from the Fire. (Surah al-Baqarah:166-167)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a prime illustration of how individuals like this Ali al-Boriqi, who are fanatical followers, fall into extremism, the very thing they irresponsibly accuse others of! This level of praise is if at all only for the major scholars of this Ummah. In fact, we don’t even find the students of the major scholars of our times referring to them with such loaded titles of eminence. How is then the case for someone who is only 45 and and has perhaps only studied Islamic sciences for around a decade, with most parts being centered on a corrupt methodological approach anyway.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We then see Yasir Qadhi at this moment of sheer humility letting off a smug smirk lasting for a good few seconds. There is obviously no uproar, nor a dare I say quote unquote remark, actually there isn’t even a weak sigh or gasp of dismay at the utterance of such a chilling testimony. This is Yasir Qadhi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Compare Yasir Qadhi to the humility of Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan. Yasir Qadhi during the course of the podcast stated that he started to deliver sermons when he was 16 and that he has been lecturing preaching and teaching for almost three decades and during this moment of enlightened self-amazement, he says “wow, Subhanallah” (Time stamp 11:15).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us now compare him to who the real scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah are, why? Because he has repeatedly asserted that the west should refer to the Scholars of the WEST. Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan was born in 1933 and in 1950 he was appointed as a teacher in a school in Buraydah. Therefore, Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan has been teaching the Islamic sciences, issues legal edicts ranging from creed to governance and so on for the best part of 69 years, yes dear readers 69 years. I am quite certain the intelligent person will see the enormous disparity between precision, depth and accuracy in the knowledge of Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan and the other scholars of our times and between the insignificant role Yasir Qadhi actually has in the West. Moving on, a scholar who has taught Islam, the true “strand” of Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah, Salafism or as Yasir likes to define as the Najdi Da’wah said the following when:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Questioner praises Shaykh Fawzan for his defence of the Islamic Aqidah and Shari’ah. He says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“May Allah show goodness to you, this questioner calls Allah to witness, as well as those present here, that he loves you for the sake of Allah, he asks Allah, The Exalted, The Most High that He forgives you, gives you Tawfiq and rewards you on Behalf of Islam and the Muslims, due to what you do in defending the Aqidah and the Shari’ah.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan replies:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Firstly we ask Allah that He loves you, just as you love us for His sake, as for your statement that I defend Islam, then in reality I am not of this rank. I am less than this, I am deficient and I Seek the forgiveness of Allah, however we hope in Allah, that he gives victory to Islam, a victory from Himself and He forsakes the enemies of Islam by his Honour and His Ability, may He Be Glorified, the Most High.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Example &#8211;  Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The questioner says: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah grant you good. How does one reach the level of knowledge possessed by Shaykh Ibn Baz and You?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan replies:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I don’t have knowledge! As for Shaykh Ibn Baz, yes he had knowledge, may Allah forgive him and have mercy on him. As for us, we are poor (in terms of knowledge) like you. However, it is obligatory upon us to learn.</span></p>

Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwJXSFuYsEc)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwJXSFuYsEc)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allahu Akbar, May Allah have mercy on the noble Scholars Ahl al-Sunnah, just look at their humility and simplicity, a true sign of knowledge which leads to Taqwa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Third Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A host introduces Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan during a lecture and he continues to praise him for almost one and a half minutes. When Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan finally speaks he says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim, Alhamdulillah Wassalatu Wassalam Ala Rasullillah Wa Ala Alihi Wa Sahbi wa Man Wala, to proceed: Indeed, you have EMBARASSED me, where you have lifted me to a place I have not reached, I’m to say the least just a seeker of knowledge just like one of you. Rather, perhaps amongst you there are those who greater and more noble.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fourth Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yasir Qadhi goes onto mention his Islamic achievements that he wrote books and delivered lectures on this i.e in defence and propagation of the Najdi Da’wah, like Kitab al-Tawhid, Kashf al-Shubuhat and Qawa’id al-Arba’a and propagation of the Najdi Da’wah. He goes onto say I quote unquote:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Quote <span style="color: #ff0000;">“Dare I say to this day NOTHING (emphasis his) has been written in the English language that is more of an advanced defence of the Najdi da’wah then my critical analysis of shirk which is still available in the English language.”</span> Unquote (Timestamp, 12:50)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan was asked:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Allah has blessed you to author many books; are there any books you deem better?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: which books?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Questioner Your Books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: (with some concern) You want me to praise my own book? (The Shaykh chuckles)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: I deem all of my books to be weak.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fifth Example –Shaykh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A host introduces Shaykh al-Albani for approximately two and a half minutes. Shaykh al-Albani while following the Sunnah of Allahs’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam begins by reciting the Khutbatul Hajah. He then thanks the host for his words and praise and then says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I have no answer to it except to follow the example of the First Khalifah, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq RadhiAllah Anhu, who was the first and true Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. When he heard someone praising him, and it is my belief that no matter how much the one who is exaggerating in his praise (it was the truth) since he was the Khalifah of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam yet. (THE SHAYKHS STARTS CRYING from timestamp 4:29 until 5:00 and in between says Allahul Musta’an and then continues) Yet he used to say “Oh Allah don’t hold me responsible for that which say, make me better then that which they think of me and forgive me for that which they don’t know” (The Shaykh is still shaken and upset) This is what the great Siddiq said. What is there for us to say after him? So I say Following his example (while the Shaykh is still upset) Oh Allah don’t hold me responsible for that which say, make me better then that which they think of me and forgive me for that which they don’t know” The truth is and I say the truth, I am not the person that was described by our noble brother but I am merely a student of knowledge, nothing else.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Sixth Example –Shaykh Muhammad b. Saleh al-Uthaymin</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yasir Qadhi proudly claims he was the student of Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin, is this the case? I will scrutinise this claim later. Let us look at the humility of Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin. A host asks Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin if it was permissible for a person to recite a poem, so Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin grants them permission. He starts reciting:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“My Ummah after this night comes</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Dawn that its light spread across the world</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Good is awaited and the opening is soon</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the truth will be victorious despite of the efforts of evil</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By a revival that Allah has blessed</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That is pure and free of any defects</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as Ibn Saleh (i.e. Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin) is amongst us</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as Ibn Saleh is amongst us</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh of our revival</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With his likes we wish for support and victory</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin interjects and says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I do not agree with this line, no I do not agree because I don’t want the truth to be attributed to individuals. Everyone makes mistakes and if we attribute the truth to individuals and then that person dies, the people will fall into desperation. If you wish (i.e) change that line to “As long as we have the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of his Messenger” It would be better.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reciter then continues his recitation:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as we have the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of his Messenger</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Uthaymin…</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin then interjects again: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“No Oh Shaykh (like I just told you) Don’t say this, no no, stop, stop.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reciter continues and it seems like he does not understand what the Shaykh is trying to point out:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Jurist..</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin stops them and they say let us continue by the will of Allah. Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“No, by Allah I don’t want, no I am not joking, you only have this? Then ask your question. The poem was absolutely uncalled for. I advise you from now and after, not to tie the truth to men. Firstly, men can deviate even Ibn Mas’ud RadhiAllahu Anhu said: “Whoever is to follow someone then follow those who have passed away because those who are alive are not safe from trials.” If you attribute the truth to men a person could be deceived by himself, we seek refuge of Allah from that and adopt wrong ways. Therefore, I advise you not to attribute the truth to men. Firstly, a man is not safe, I ask Allah to make us firm, a man is not safe from mistakes and trial. Secondly, he will die, no one remains alive, “We granted not to any human being immortality before you then if you die, would they live forever (Surah al-Anbiya, 21:34). Thirdly the sons of Adam, humans may be deceived if he sees people honouring and flocking to him. He might be deceived, he might think he is infallible or claim that he is and believe everything that he does is the truth and that every path he takes is permissible. This could lead him to destruction, a man praised another man a the presence of the Messenger of Allah Salallahu alayhi Wsallam, The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam told him: Woe to you, you have cut the neck of your friend (his back). I thank the brother in advance though I have not heard what he says about me to what he expresses of his feelings towards me I ask Allah to make me as he best sees me no more but I don’t like being praised, I will reward you inshallah and so I ask Allah to reward you and to recompense you”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(YouTube: Don’t Tie the Truth to Men – The Humility of Ibn Uthaymin. Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfKeWwSILvE)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfKeWwSILvE)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After these illustrative examples showing how our scholars displayed humility and how Yasir Qadhi displays the direct opposite. It would be most pertinent to remind the readers secondarily and Yasir himself primarily concerning the issue of Riya- the hidden shirk or polytheism. Yasir Qadhi is usually very quick in listing the names of his books relevant to the Sunni Salafi Aqidah but rarely if at all ever mentions his book on Riya – showing of. On page 43 of the book he mentions how the dangers of riya are the destruction of the Ummah and then on page 45 the love of praise and the most important on page 32, it increases misguidance. It seems likes Yasir Qadhi has not only left Salafism and the Najdi Da’wah but also the basic concepts of self rectification and personal purification of the soul and it is a must that he reads his book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly in this part I would like to leave the readers with words of Shaykh Abd al-Razzaq al-Badr where in he states and the aim to highlight the idea of being humble</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Mutarif ibn Abdillah ibn ash-Shik-kheer who was a scholar from Tabi’in, he saw a man wearing a cloak and walking or strutting boastfully. So, he said to the man: “Oh slave of Allah, this is the type of boastful walking or strutting of those whom Allah hates.” The man replied, “Don’t you know who I am? This man was wearing this beautiful cloak and his appearance was attractive and he was strutting, and someone has the nerve to speak to him in this manner?! Thus he replied, Don’t you know who I am?! Meaning if you knew who I was you would not speak to me like this. Mutarrif said: “On the contrary, of course I know who you are!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You started as a sprinkled drop of sperm</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You will end up as a soiled corpse</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in the meantime you are carrying faeces around (in your intestines)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So I know who you are</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the man went about his way and he no longer strutted and these words of Mutarrif taught this man some manners.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(YouTube: How to humble an arrogant person – By Shaykh Abdur Razzaq Al-Badr. Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee. Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv62pV2BOXw)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv62pV2BOXw)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The purpose of knowledge is that is saves a person from disobeying Allah and his Messenger. Allah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error. (Surah al-Ahzab:36)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hasan al-Basri said: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">there are two types of knowledge, one that which is in the heart which is beneficial knowledge. The second type of knowledge is that which is on the tongue which is Allah’s evidence against mankind. (Sunan al-Darimi, 1:350 no.374, Dar al-Tasil)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With this being said, it is first and foremost for us to be humble and know our status in terms of ilm. Secondly for my fellow Muslims, brothers and sisters to to sit back a little and realise that true scholarship, academia and knowledge is with the Rabbani scholars of this Ummah, their virtue and status is well universal and agreed upon. Thirdly, do not be naïve and let people play with your emotions and Islam, for indeed you alone are responsible for your actions when you have to stand before Allah without any leader, scholar or interpreter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the subsequent parts I will highlight many inconsistencies, contradictions and the true reality of Yasir Qadhi, InshaAllah.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Yasir Qadhi Acknowledges the Consistency of the Salafis (Madkhalis) Not rebelling Against the Ruler </strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Part 3</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The american &#8216;Scholar&#8217; <span class="posthilit">Yasir</span> Qadhi who is fond of telling people to stay in their lanes after having already crashed out!!!! And since then according to a very immature person &#8211; &#8220;Ali al-Boriqi&#8221; calling him Shaykh ul-Islam of the America. Now, what can any sane person say. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">he says in his infamous lecture titled, &#8216;Towards an Ecumenical Conception of Salafiyyah&#8217;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&#8220;Salafis need to realise, i&#8217;m going to be very blunt here, that if Umar Ibn al-Khattaab was amongst us right now and they gave him a quiz of aqeedah, the fact of the matter is, that the test you put in front him, he would fail it&#8221;</strong></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[Towards an Ecumenical Conception of Salafiyyah, Min. 34, Sec. 19+]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">and <span class="posthilit">Yasir</span> Qadhi says </span></p>
<blockquote class="uncited">
<div><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;If you were to ask `Umar about the realities of Eeman, about the pillars of Eeman he would not be able to answer it&#8221;</span></strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[Towards an Ecumenical Conception of Salafiyyah, Min. 39, Sec. 15+]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a class="postlink" style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdNOZOBjWuY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdNOZOBjWuY</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">This is a treacherous and slanderous lie on the Illustrious Companion, the Rightly guided Khaliph and the one who was promised paradise, and his virtues surpass the realm of any writing or discourse. Mr <span class="posthilit">Yasir</span>Qadhi questions if Umar ibn Khattab RadiAllahu Anhu would have known the realities of Iman and thereby trivialising the core aspects and belief system of Ahl al-Sunnah- yes the Salafis</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is one of the earliest treatises on Creed and low and behold it was by Umar bin al-Khattab RadiAllahu Anhu on the Issue of Qadr i.e. Faith in Predestination which is a fundamental aspect of Iman and Aqidah. This discussions does not warrant any lengthy discussion or explanation because the reality and level of knowledge of the said individual is clear and manifest. We hope the sincere and honest reader is at least honest and sincere to his soul and acknowledges the truth about these fundamental issues rather than taking from the so called &#8216;western scholar&#8217;, who let alone knows how to stay in his own lane but rather actually crashed out a while back but has the insolence to say otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This treatise is authentic with an authentic chain from Imam Ibn Mandah (d.470) back to Umar ibn al-Khattab RadiAllahu Anhu which he cites in his book <strong><em>&#8216;al-Radd Ala Man Yaqul Alif Lam Mim Harf</em></strong> (no.35) and the manuscript is in Maktabah al-Zahiriyyah in Damascus (no 101)</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Yasir Qadhi Acknowledges the Consistency of the Salafis (Madkhalis) Not rebelling Against the Ruler </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Part 2</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On Wednesday 10<sup>th</sup> April 2019 Yasir Qadhi (YQ) delivered a lecture at the al-Waleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU), Georgetown University titled Rethinking Salafism: Shifting Trends &amp; Changing Typologies Post Arab Spring. The link can be found below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt95RTAnVLg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt95RTAnVLg</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">YQ while attempting to define the quietist or purist trend of Salafism, as the western academia have come to broadly use this term mentions a definite fact which has a significant basis in the works of the early pious ancestors. YQ during his lecture at the Future of Salafism Conference in Oxford UK and also throughout the presentations of other speakers, was very vocal and outspoken and brazenly used the term Madkhali to describe the puritan or quietest trend of Salafism, as if he was obsessively fixated with the deranged term because of what and how it was related to Shaykh Rabi b. Hadi al-Madkhali.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At timestamp 20:17 YQ says, and we quote verbatim</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Some Quietest interpret the texts to indicate that supporting the ruler is an act of faith and a fundamental pillar of the religion and so if you do not support the ruler you are a heretic and of course a primary example of this is the Madkhalis, they make it a theological point of faith that you must support the ruler. Out all of the quietists, whatever my personal position might be about them they are the most consistent they will support the ruler regardless.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Jonathon Brown interjects and says <strong>“any ruler or just..”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">YQ continues and says any ruler as long as there is no kufr buwaha – open disbelief.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then at timestamp 36:37 he talks about the development and changes in the Salafi trend in Egypt and goes onto say that the only person who remained consistent was the small strand of Madkhali Salafism the most famous amongst them, (Shaykh) Muhammad Saʿid Raslan, Hafizahullah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point is, even YQ knows the Salafis are consistent in their matters of theology and faith because they use only the Quran and Sunnah as their source based on the understanding of the pious ancestors. The Salafis believe this as the one and only approach to understanding and practicing Islam, whether they are matters of theology, methodology and jurisprudence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This idea of the Salafis being consistent in their belief system is a hallmark of the Salafis or what academics incorrectly refer to as Madkhalis. The Salafis have a rich history and an illustrious legacy of being united. For instance, Imam al-Bukhari (d.256H) said:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I met more than a thousand men amongst the people of knowledge from the people of al-Hijaaz, al-Makkah, al-Madeenah, al-Koofah, al-Basrah, Waasit, Baghdaad, Shaam and Egypt. I met them numerous times, generation after generation and then generation after generation.’ I met them while they were ample and widespread for over forty-six years; the people of ash-Shaam, Egypt and al-Jazeerah twice, (the people of) al- Basrah four times in a number of years. (Those of) al-Hijaaz (over a period) of six years and I cannot enumerate how many times I entered (upon the people of) al-Koofah and Baghdaad along with the muhaddithoon of Khuraasaan, amongst them: al-Makkee ibn Ibraaheem, Yahyaa ibn Yahyaa, ‘Alee ibn al- Hasan ibn Shaqeeq, Qutaibah ibn Sa’d and Shihaab ibn Ma’mar. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And in ash-Shaam: Muhammad ibn Yoosuf al-Firyaabee, Aboo Mushir ‘Abdul-A’laa ibn Mushir, Abul-Mugheerah ‘Abdul- Quddoos ibn al-Hajjaaj, Abul-Yamaan al-Hakam ibn Naafi’ and those who came after them, (I met them) numerous times. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And in Egypt: Yahyaa ibn Katheer (or Yahyaa ibn Bukayr), Aboo Saalih &#8211; the scribe of al-Layth ibn Sa’d, Sa’eed ibn Abee Maryam, Asbagh ibn al-Faraj and Nu’aym ibn Hammaad. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And in Makkah: ‘Abdullaah ibn Zaid al-Muqri and al-Humaydee, Sulaymaan ibn Harb &#8211; the qaadee of Makkah and Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Azraqee. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And in al-Madeenah: lsmaa’eel ibn Abee Uwais, Mutarrif ibn ‘Abdullaah, ‘Abdullaah ibn Naafi’ az-Zubairee, Ahmad ibn Abee Bakr Aboo Mus’ab az-Zuhree, Ibraaheem ibn Hamzah az- Zubairee and Ibraaheem ibn al-Mundhir al-Hizaamee. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And in al-Basrah: Aboo ‘Aasim ad-Dahhaak ibn Makhlad ash-Shaybaanee, Abul-Waleed Hishaam ibn ‘Abdul-Maalik, Hajjaaj ibn al-Minhaal and ‘Alee ibn ‘Abdullaah ibn Ja’far al-Madeenee. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And in al-Koofah: Aboo Nu’aym al-Fadl ibn Dukayn, ‘Ubaydullaah ibn Moosaa, Ahmad ibn Yoonus, Qabeesah ibn ‘Uqbah, Ibn Numayr, and ‘Abdullaah and ‘Uthmaan, the two sons of Aboo Shaybah. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And in Baghdaad: Ahmad ibn Hambal, Yahyaa ibn Ma’een, Aboo Ma’mar, Aboo Khaithamah and Aboo ‘Ubaid al-Qaasim ibn Sallaam. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And from the people of al-Jazeerah: ‘Amr ibn Khaalid al- Harraanee. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And in Waasit: ‘Amr ibn ‘Aun and ‘Aasim ibn ‘Alee ibn ‘Aasim. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And in Marw: Sadaqah ibn Fadl and Ishaaq ibn Ibraaheem al- Handhalee.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Sharh Usul Ei’tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah, 2:172).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the consistency of the Aqidah and Manhaj of the Salafis, while on the contrary the people of deviation and splitting vehemently differ with each other in one era and land let alone over centuries. We also see the consistency and clarity of the Aqidah and Manhaj of the Salafis in that they are unified in their affairs which span 1400 years. This is the hallmark of consistency and In-sha-Allah, the truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And we find Abu Muhammad Abdur Rahman Ibn Abi Hatim (d.327H) transmits from Abu Zur’ah Ubaidullah al-Razi (d.264H) and Abu Hatim Muĥammad Ibn Idris al-Razi (d.277H) said while expounding on the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We have reached the Scholars in all the lands – The Hijaz, Iraq, Sham and Yemen, and from their Madhhab was…”</em> (Asal al-Sunnah wa Ei’tiqad al-Din, 1; al-Lalaka’i Sharh Ei’tiqad Ahl al-Sunnah Wal Jama’ah, 1:176-180)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning that they encountered various scholars in the different lands and they were upon the same creed and methodology Some biographers and historiographers mention Abu Hatim al-Razi had over 3,000 teachers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abul Qasim Ismaʿil al-Asbahani (d.535H) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“That which elucidates the Ahl al-Hadith are the Ahl al-Haq is that if you look at all of the books written by them, whether they are the early Ahl al-Hadith or the Ahl al-Hadith of our time, whether residing in different cities, in different eras with large distances between them and even after travelling huge distances to reach them, then despite all of this, you will find them upon the same Creed, the same path and the same Manhaj.”</em> (al-Hujjah Fi Bayanil Mahajjah, 2:224)  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Qawam al-Sunnah i.e. Abul Qasim also said:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“We saw the Ashabul Hadith, and they travelled far and wide to collect the narrations, then they sifted out the weak ones from the authentic narrations, they compiled them and they memorised them. The Ashabul hadith (Ahl al-Hadith) then acted upon these narrations and they promoted and spread these narrations this being their dawah and they used the narrations of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam to refute the mukhalifin (the opposers).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><br />
These Ashabul Hadith had with them a vast amount of authentic narrations just like the cloth seller has clothes, the one who sells dates has dates, and the one who sells perfume has perfume! So the one who sold dates becomes known as the date seller and the one who sells clothes becomes known as the clothes seller and the one who sells perfume becomes known as the perfume seller, then similarly the Ashabul Hadith and the scholars of hadith became known as the Ahl al-Hadith.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><br />
When these Ahl al-Hadith saw people going away from the ma’ruf (that which was known by way of necessitating and following the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam) and they could see people leaving the authentic narrations and they could see people from the various sects making tanqid and making disparaging remarks against the narrations the scholars of hadith began to refute these people and began to warn against them in their gatherings. The Ahl al-Hadith began to mention the real meanings of the words of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam as they ought to have been understood.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><br />
</em><em>So it is fair to say from this evidence that the scholars of hadith who authored all of the works in promoting the ittiba (following) of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam in reality they are the Ahlus Sunnah and have more of a right to call themselves the Ahlus Sunnah then any other person or group and this is because according to the scholars the real meaning of Sunnah is to follow the authentic chain of narration (hadith) from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam concerning the ahkam and to act upon that and to stay away from that which has come by way of a forbiddance in these narrations. Thus this is a clear evidence to say that the Ahl al-Hadith, Ashabul Hadith are actually none other than the Ahlus Sunnah themselves.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><br />
If someone was to say that if this is the case then every other sect other than the Ahlul Hadith also mention various narrations as evidences for their beliefs and their actions then what do we say about them? Then our response is, that those which in opposition to an authentic narration bring a weak narration, in opposition to a complete narration, bring a mursal (an incomplete) narration, in opposition to a marfu’ narration (a narration that reaches with complete chain the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam) bring a mawquf narration (that which does not reach the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam but a companion) then they cannot be on the same level as the Ahl al-Hadith whichever sect they may be from!</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><br />
The one who follows the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam based on the authentic narrations he is the one who is following a clear evidence and he is the one who is taking his understanding from the authentic narrations, not from the weak or the incomplete narrations which cannot be in comparison to those narrations which are authentic.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus it is clear that the Ahlus Sunnah is the one who will follow the authentic narrations and go out of his way to follow the authentic narration over and above any other narration or saying, whereas those who are ahlul ra’i (people of opinion and conjecture) they only follow the narrations which fit well within their hearts and minds.” (al-Hujjah Fi Bayanil Mahajjah, 3:413-414)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In conclusion, even the most misguided of people will inadvertently speak the truth. The Salafis have not given any Tom Dick or Harry any authority whatsoever, to classify us, we are only one type of Salafi and the others are not Salafi, even if people are adamant in doing so. YQ inadvertently admits the Salafis follow the Divine Texts which naturally allows us to be consistent for 1400 years. If YQ and those upon a similar methodology to him are going to use the term Madkhali for us, then it is only fair based on this consistency that he innovates another term for the early Pious ancestors, as they were also on this consistency.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the same video, YQ also distorts and manipulates some key facts, whether out of ignorance or deliberately, both are equally bad and intellectual dishonesty, but what do you expect from such people? Shaykh Fawzans view regarding the rulers and obeying him is based on the texts, our obedience to them and following the Sunnah. The reason YQ gives his concocted explanation is because he cannot label Shaykh Fawzan as a Madkhali. I believe this is a methodical and deliberate distortion of the true facts in order to brush away a classification dilemma. More on this deception later In-Sha-Allah  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Debunking Yasir Qadhi(ism)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The General Politico-Philosophical Liberalism Theories of John Rawls &#8211; </strong><strong>Rawlsian Political Liberalism</strong><strong> </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Part 1</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yasir Qadhi (YQ) deserves some neat attention due to his continuous manipulation of facts and for presenting Salafiyya with a warped view. There are no long intros or background information. I have never held YQ to be Salafi and I informed him of this when we both use to be on an emailing list called the Salaflist back in 2000 and more recently in December 2018 when I met him at the Future of Salafism Conference in Oxford. I will share more information related to his arrogant demeanor and persona, as noted by most of the academics present at the conference, his condescending and egotistical mannerisms towards Muslims and non-Muslims alike including his idolatrous shift in beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">YQ immaturely claimed the Salafi approach for dealing with the issues the Muslims face in the West, was inept, inadequate and essentially lacked the sophistication. He, most likely got irked by the traditionalist approach of Quran and Sunnah and perhaps sought a more philosophical rationalist approach.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Instead of looking at the approach of the Salafi Scholars who were specialists in fiqh and modern issues like, Shaykh al-Albani, Shaykh Ibn Baz, Shaykh al-Uthaymin and Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd to mention a few, he resorts to the works of a fellow Yale associate, Professor of Political Science, Andrew F. March. YQ takes from Andrew March, who in turn uses the idea of the American Philosopher John Rawls.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The General Politico-Philosophical Liberalism Theories of John Rawls</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Andrew March, in his book Islam and Liberal Citizenship: The Search for an Overlapping Consensus, which was basically his DPhil (Doctor of Philosophy) in Politics titled, Islamic Doctrines of Citizenship in Liberal Democracies: The Search for an Overlapping Consensus. (St. Johns College, Oxford, 2005), describes Rawls ideas as Rawlsian Political Liberalism. Rawls had a number of theories which he documents in a number of his works, which can be summarised as follows; The Justice Theory which talks about distributive justice and attempted to reconcile the competing claims of the values of freedom and equality. He argues for Political Liberalism, in which citizens of various lands who are divided by inflexible religious and philosophical disagreements could come to endorse a constitutional democratic regime and the idea of global justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In simpler words, this is the western idea and mirror reflection of the ideas of Sayyid Qutb and Mawlana Abul A’la Mawdudi of social justice, the democratic and political process as exemplified by the Ikhwan al-Muslimin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">YQ developed this ideas during his studies in Yale, where, as he claims was ‘enlightened’ spent time with Andrew March. YQ affirms this and says in the comments section in his diatribe of an article, ‘On Salafi Islam’ states that Andrew March was personal friend and in the same article he goes on to say about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“He has done admirable work and we NEED TO BENFIT from such works wherever they come from.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Yasir Qadhi, “On Salafi Islam,” MuslimMatters.org, April 22, 2014, accessed November 4, 2016, <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://muslimmatters.org/2014/04/22/on-salafi%20-islam-dr-yasirqadhi/">http://muslimmatters.org/2014/04/22/on-salafi -islam-dr-yasirqadhi/</a>. PDF version of the text can be found at http://cdn.muslimmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/On-Salafi -Islam_Dr.-Yasir-Qadhi.pdf.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">YQ refers readers to March’s book but also quotes from March’s journal article, Theocrats Living under Secular Law: An External Engagement with Islamic. In this article March puts forward a new standard of a “thick social contract model” through the use of the political philosophy of John Rawls. (Andrew F. March, “Theocrats Living under Secular Law: An External Engagement with Islamic Legal Theory”, Journal of Political Philosophy 19 (2011), 28–51).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">YQ describes and borrows from March, a number of ways in which Muslims can live and how they see their relationship with the secular state. He then presents his case further and one alternative model which March believes can be a possible alternative model or mode in which Muslims can abide and live in a western secular state. YQ describes this and says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“This model posits that when the wider community (in our case, the American Constitution) guarantees certain rights of security and religious freedom, and when Muslims have agreed to take advantage of these rights, in return they will consent to obey laws even if they do not derive from Islamic principles.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Yasir Qadhi, “God’s Law and Man-Made Laws: Muslims Living in Secular Democracies,” MuslimMatters.org, March 1, 2010, accessed November 7, 2016, http:// muslimmatters.org/2010/03/01/gods-law-and-man-made-laws-muslims-living-insecular-democracies/.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">YQ also says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“In this model, religious constituents would acknowledge and agree that while the existing system of government is not divine, it is sufficiently just or acceptably legitimate in many areas, and thus may be actively endorsed.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Yasir Qadhi, “God’s Law and Man-Made Laws: Muslims Living in Secular Democracies,” MuslimMatters.org, March 1, 2010)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">YQ then goes onto say that this is the most dominant view among the Sunni scholars like Yusuf al-Qaradawi and Abdullah ibn Bayyah, while he has some finer critique of it. (Modern Islamic Authority and Social Change, Evolving Debates in the West Vol 2 p.173, Edinburgh University press, 2018)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Essentially what YQ is saying, based on the works March and John Rawl is the Rawlsian Political Liberalism theory, which translates to what the Salafis say, that Muslims living in Muslim countries and Muslims living in Non-Muslims due to our covenant with them based on Islamic legal rulings, we do not rebel or make khuruj but rather obey the rulers. However, YQ and his ilk define and berate the same theory labelling it Madkhalism, mocking it and throwing the term around like dishwater. Modern academics have described this theory as the purists or quietists trend of Salafism.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, YQ is a Madkhali because he pushes the theory of obeying the rulers of the secular state living in the west and this is the academic fraud of YQ, whereas the Salafis have resorted to the divine textual evidences to come to the same legal ruling.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">YQ’s pal, Andrew March also published <em>Islam and Liberal Citizenship</em> (Oxford University Press, 2009), which is an exploration of the Islamic juridical discourse on the rights, loyalties, and obligations of Muslim minorities in liberal polities. He often writes on religion, liberalism, and Islamic law, which when coupled can be disastrous for anyone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the reason why YQ has shifted his theological and methodological foundations and is now adamant to misguide others. He also has little helpers, who are vile ikhwanis parading around as Salafis, who are shameless in defending and promoting YQ despite this deviant shift.</span></p>
