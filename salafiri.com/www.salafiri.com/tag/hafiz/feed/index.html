				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>READ <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/clearing-the-allegations-and-attack-on-allamah-rabbani-shaikh-muhammad-nasir-al-din-al-albani-1420h-part-1-the-hanafi-fiqh-channel/">Part 1</a>, <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/clearing-the-allegations-and-attack-on-allamah-rabbani-shaikh-muhammad-nasir-al-din-al-albani-1420h-part-2-the-hanafi-fiqh-channel-hanafi-asharis-on-the-hadith-in-sahih-mus/">Part 2</a></span></strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Hanafi Fiqh Channel have produced two videos showing that Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani weakened ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari. As I mentioned in the previous part, we will address the issues a little later In Shāʿ Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Following on from the previous part where I showed the position and outlook of Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah and his understanding of Sahih Muslim-the authenticity of the hadith contained therein, it showed his blind fanaticism for the hanafi madhab and his true position of the hadith in Sahih Muslim. This was an answer to the second video produced by the Hanafi Fiqh channel wherein the speaker talks about Sahih Muslim. (please refer to part 2)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both speakers in their respective parts digress to mention some comical points throughout their videos. They contained cheap shots and immature presentation of points. For example, they said we know the Salafi group attacks the four Imams, we did not know they would attack Sahih al-Bukhari and other such illiterate type of points. We assure you, do not worry, since you have opened this closet your hanafi skeletons will most certainly come to haunt you. More on this In Shāʿ Allāh in the forthcoming parts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will however overlook these points and not stoop to their level, whereas our intent is to bring clarity to these matters and the mindset, these young brothers wish to portray of Shaikh Allamah Rabbani Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here is another example how juvenile and childish these people are. When they mention Shaikh al-Albani’s name they say Nasir ud Din, when we all know the Shaikhs full name is Muhammad Nasir ud Din. This is the level of these people, such is their hatred and animosity that they can not even bring themselves to say the name Muhammad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Anyway, Shaikh al-Albani talks about the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and he looked at how some of the hadith which did not fulfill the criteria. He talks about Imams before him, like Imam Daraqutni, Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Hafiz Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, Hafiz Ibn Hajr and Hafiz al-Mundhiri, who also spoke about some of the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and their wording.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani gives three examples to highlight what he refers to when he did a generic gloss of the Sahihayn, and it is not as the detractors make out, that he scrutinized and analysed the whole of Sahih al-Bukhari. Shaikh al-Albani clearly says his contention is with just about 10 ahadith and that Imam Daraqutni questions 12 or so hadith from the Sahih of Imam Bukhari.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani clearly said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Therefore, it is not wisdom or knowledge for me to focus on critiquing the Sahihayn and abandon the hadith in the 4 sunans.” (watch video)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If a person questions my judgements of some of the hadiths, then they can look at Fath al-Bari and they will find many many things that are criticized by Hafiz Ahmad bin Hajr al-Asqalani.” (watch video)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“This Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani clarified in his Sharh (Fath al-Bar) many mistakes in the ahadith of Bukhari…” (watch video)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the three examples Shaikh al-Albani talks about is the hadith of Ibn Abbas radiAllahu Anhuma concerning the marriage of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to Maymunah radhiallahu anha while he was in ihram, he said the hadith is authentic in terms of its chains but the interpretation is of Ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhuma. Other ahadith that are critiqued are based on the narrators in the chain, this is the second type. With the third type being additional words added to the hadith to indicate a meaning that were not actually transmitted, like the hadith of the limbs radiating light due to being frequently washed in Wudu.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These are just some of the points that relate to this intricate science, and it is most certainly not for every individual to delve into it. This is more applicable and pertinent to those who proudly claim and openly attest they are hanafi muqallids ie in other words, they are strikingly ignorant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This being said, other modern day writers in academia have also alluded to Shaikh al-Albani weakening hadith in Bukhari, at least three different writers. Yet the same writers have strangely overlooked and ignored the criticism and views of Hafiz Ibn Hajr in his al-Fath and Imam Daraqutni’s queries. One of the aforementioned writers, in all fairness did look at Daraqutni’s queries and presented his arguments. Interestingly a fourth writer asserts Sahih al-Bukhari is the backbone of Salafi Islam, as the writer suggests. This is not far from the truth as Shaikh al-Albani was one of the most famous proponents of Salafiyyah, since when have the modern day Hanafi Ash’arites shown any care or love for Sahih al-Bukhari, except they worked on it to defend their Madhhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such writers and others like Hamza Malyabari and of his ilk suggest Shaikh al-Albani’s critical analysis of hadith was not in line with the methods of the earlier scholars. This is another farcical allegation which has been rebutted by many writers. The following book, being just one example dismantles and dismisses this embarrassing claim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-8087 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=386%2C685" alt="DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=169%2C300 169w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=768%2C1365 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=576%2C1024 576w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?w=1152 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zakariyyah bin Ghulam Qadir Pakistani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">(pp.280, Riyadh: Maktabah al-Ma&#8217;arif Lil-Nashr wal-Tawzi&#8217;a, 1431H/2010ce) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being, such matter are based of Ijtihad in relation to understanding the intricacies of this magnificent science, and only those who are free from the shackles of extreme blind partisanship and destructive fanaticism can look at such matters objectively. This excludes the extreme muqallids who vehemently acknowledge they are ignorant and are obligated to perform taqlid, yet they are the ones making youtube videos, reading the ahadith from Bukhari to show the inconsistencies and approach of the Salafi’s but they themselves reject the hadith in Bukhari when it is time to accept and act on them. This is most reprehensible!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Low and behold, here is the clarification from Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani when he was asked if he graded hadith in Bukhari weak and if the Scholars before him preceded him in it. Please watch it and be sincere without bigotry or sectarian partisanship.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this article we wish to present the verification of the famous ḥadīth of “Prophetic Khilāfah will be for 30 years” so that the general people are aware of it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Dawūd as-Sijastānī in his Kitāb as-Sunan 2/290 Kitāb as-Sunnah, Bāb Fil-Khulāfa no.4646), Imām Abū Eesā Tirmidhī in Kitāb as-Sunan 2/46, Abwāb al-Fitan Bāb Mā Jā Fil Khilāfah no.2226), Imām Abū ʿAbdur Rahman Nasā’ī in Kitāb as-Sunan al-Kubrā 5/47 no.8155, Kitāb al-Manāqib Bāb 5, Imām Abū Ḥātim bin Ḥibbān Bastī in as-Ṣaḥīḥ (al-Ehsān no.6623, 6904, Mawārid az-Zamān no.1534,1535 and many other scholars of ḥadīth via various chains from Saʿīd bin Jamhān from Safīnah Abū ʿAbdir Rahman the servant of the Messenger of Allāh narrates</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Messenger of Allāh said “The Prophetic khilāfah will remain for 30 years and the Allāh will give power to whom He Wills. Saʿīd said Safīnah said to me “count the years, 2 years of Abū Bakr and 10 years of Umar and 12 years of Uthmān and Alī so on (i.e. 6 years). Saʿīd said “I said to Safīnah these people say that Alee was not a khalīfah to which he replied “The backs of Banū Zarqā and Banū Marwān have lied.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the wording of Abū Dawūd which differs slightly from the others  however the meaning is the same.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Ḥadīth Imām Tirmidhī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth is Ḥasan.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Ḥadīth of Safīnah concerning the Khilāfah is authentic and it is my position regarding the Khulāfa.”</em> [Jāmʿe Bayān al-ʿIlm Wa Faḍilihi [2/225], see also Kitāb as-Sunnah of ʿAbdullāh bin Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal [2/590 no.1400]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Abī ʿĀṣim said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth in terms of being written is </em><em>established. Saʿīd bin Jamhān narrates from Ḥamād bin Salamah, a-ʿĀwām bin Ḥaushab and Ḥashraj (bin Nabātah)”</em> [Kitāb as-Sunnah [2/549-550 no.1181,1185]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Ibn Taymīyyah has also graded this narration to be authentic [as-Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/744] of Shaikh al-Albānī]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ḥākim also graded it authentic [al-Mustadrak [3/71]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The narrator Saʿīd bin Jamhān was declared to be trustworthy Imam Yaḥya bin Maʿīn, Imam Nasā’ī, Imam Ibn Ḥibbān and Imam Aḥmad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abū Dawūd also declared him to be trustworthy</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdīyy said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“According to me there is no harm in him”</em> [Tahdhīb ut-Tahdhīb [1/14]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ḥāfiẓ Dhahabī said</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Truthful from the middle (level of narrator).</em>” [al-Kāshif [1/282].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Truthful individual”</em> [Taqrīb ut-Tahdhīb no.2279]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In contrary to these Imāms, Imām Abū Ḥātim ar-Rāzī said, <em>“Write his ḥadīth but he cannot be used evidence.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This criticism is rejected due to a number of reasons:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] This opposes the praise of the majority</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] Zailaʿī’s Naṣb ur-Rāyah mentions [2/439]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abū Ḥātim’s saying “He is not evidence” is not harmful because he has not mentioned the reason for this criticism, he has used these words for many of the trustworthy and established narrators of the authentic books of ḥadīth without mentioning the reason, e.g. Khālid al-Ḥada and others, and Allāh knows best.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Dhahabī said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When Abū Ḥātim declares someone to be trustworthy, then hold onto it because he only declares someone trustworthy who is in the Ṣaḥīḥ Ḥadīth. Similarly when he declares someone to be weak or if he he says “he cannot be used as evidence” then hold back until you know what others have said. If someone says they were trustworthy then do not take Abū Ḥatīms criticism as he was firm with regards to the narrators. He has said about a group of narrators from the Ṣaḥīḥs they were not evidence and not strong and other similar statements.”</em> [Siyar Āʿlām an-Nabūla [3/260]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence this criticism is rejected.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Some scholars have alleged Imām Abū Ḥātim was harsh hence his statement is rejected compared to Imām Aḥmad bin Ḥanbals statement who was balanced and investigative.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Sājī&#8217;s statement, <em>&#8220;His Ḥadīth have no supports.&#8221;</em> Is also general and it is rejected because it is not detailed neither is it severe jarḥ. When someone’s honesty is established not being supported does not affect him. As it has already been established that Saʿīd bin Jamhān is trustworthy with definitive evidences, him being alone in reporting this Ḥadīth does not affect it it anyway.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Deceit of the Ḥadīth Rejecters.</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The real aim and objective of the Ḥadīth rejecters through their deceitful plots and treachery it to show the authentic Ḥadīth of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) are fabricated. This is to lead the general Muslims away from the fundamentals of the dīn and to create doubts so that the people begin to think the dīn as unreliable and then they eventually stray from the straight path.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With this they then want to express and impose their deficient opinions amongst the people, which will eventually lead to no one acting on the Qurān or Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One person from amongst the rejecters and deniers of Ḥadīth is Tamannā ʿAmādī Phalwārī, he writes in his fabrication of a book, &#8216;Intizār Mahdī Masīh&#8217; [Awaiting The Mahdī Messiah] whilst vilifying and rebuking this very same Hadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;You have seen the name of Ḥashraj bin Nabātah Al-Kūfi with regards to these narrations. He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl, he is not evidence and rejected in Ḥadīth and you do not generally find any supports for his Hadīth.&#8221;</em> [pg.57]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like to say regarding Hashraj bin Nabātah Imām Ahmad said, <em>&#8220;Trustworthy.&#8221;</em> And Ibn Ma&#8217;īn said, <em>&#8220;Good, trustworthy and there is no harm in him.&#8221; </em>Abū Zurʿah said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him and he is grounded in Ḥadīth.&#8221;</em> Ibn ʿAdīyy said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him.&#8221;</em> Tirmidhī graded his Ḥadīth Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the other hand Abū Ḥatīm said, <em>&#8220;Good write his Ḥadīth but he is not used as evidence.&#8221;</em> as-Sājī said, <em>&#8220;Weak.&#8221;</em> Ibn Ḥibbān said, <em>&#8220;He has a few Ḥadīth, his narrations are rejected and it is impermissible to use his reports as evidence when he is alone in reporting them.&#8221;</em> Nasā‘ī said he is not strong and criticised him another time he said there is not harm in him and praised him. [Summarised from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥākim and Dhahabī authenticated one of his Ḥadīth. [Mustadrak [3/606], ʿAlī (I think Ibn Al-Madīnī) also declared him to be trustworthy [Mizān Al-‘Eitidāl [1/551]. Hāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr said, <em>&#8220;Truthful but errs.&#8221;</em> [Taqrīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The conclusion is, this narrator is trustworthy and truthful according to the majority of the scholars of Ḥadīth. Hence, Tamannā ʿAmādī is a liar in his claim that, <em>&#8221; He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are so many lies in Tamannā ʿĀmādī’s book that a collation of them would result in a book. For example in the same book on [pg.54] this individual writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Muʿammar bin Rāshid of Yemen was a freed slave who died in the year 154H. He was active in compiling and collating Ḥadīth, he would narrate from the well known liar Ābān bin ʿAbbās. Whilst narrating from him he would put forward the name of Thābit al-Banānī instead [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101] yet the scholars of Ḥadīth still considered him to be trustworthy.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say let us look at the referenced page from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb and it clearly says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Khalīlī has transmitted in in al-Irshād with an authentic chain from Aḥmad that he said to Yaḥya ibn Maʿīn when he was copying the manuscript of ʿAbdur Razzāq from Muʿammar from Ābān, “You are writing this when you know Ābān is a liar?” He (Ibn Maʿīn) replied, “May Allāh have mercy on you Oh Abū ʿAbdullāh, I am writing it in order to memorise it so that when a liar (like Tamannā ʿĀmādī) narrates on Muʿammar from Thābit from Anas, I will say to them you have lied the chain is via Ābān (and not Thābit).”</em> [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask the readers now, why is Muʿammar to blame here and what is his fault? What he heard he narrated it in the same way, when he heard from Ābān he would say Ābān and when he heard from Thābit he would say Thābit. If he scholar of Ḥadīth do not consider him to be trustworthy what should they consider him (meaning he was honest)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of Tamannā ʿĀmādī are liars whose tongues and pens are free, if they want to, they can try to prove the day as night and night as day but they must remember a day will come when there will most definitely be punishment. On that day one will be taken to account for every deed big or small.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this was the research into the correct position of Ḥashraj bin Nabātah, it must be remembered here that he is not alone in reporting the Ḥadīth, rather the following individuals support him</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] ʿAbd al-Wārith [Abū Dawūd no.4646]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] al-ʿAwām bin Ḥūwshab [Abū Dawūd no.4647]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Ḥamād bin Salamah [Musnad Aḥmad [5/220-221]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus the criticism against Ḥashraj is rejected from every angle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islām Ibn Taymīyyah said concerning this Ḥadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth is well known from the narrations of Ḥamād bin Salamah, ʿAbd al-Wārith bin Saʿīd and al-ʿAwām bin Ḥūwshab and others on the authority of Saʿīd bin Jamhān. Imām Aḥmad relied on this narration for evidence for the Khilāfah of the four Khulāfa ar-Rāshidīn and he also authenticated it. He would also use it as evidence against those people who would remain silent with regards to the Khilāfah of ʿAlī as the people began to differ. To the extent that Aḥmad said, “Whoever does not consider ʿAlī as the fourth Khulāfa is more astray than is domestic donkey.” He also forbade in establishing wedlock with such people. This issue is agreed upon by the jurists, scholars of the Sunnah, the people of knowledge and insight and the righteous people, this is also the position ie madhab of the general people. Some of the people of desires have opposed them in this, from them are the people of theological rhetoric and like them the Rāfidah who rebuke and censure the first three Khalīphs. Likewise, the Khawārij who abuse the Khilāfah of two son in laws ie Uthmān and ʿAlī (of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) or like some of the Nāṣibīs who attack the Khilāfah of ʿAli or like some of the ignorant ones upon the Sunnah who remain silent of the Khilāfah (of ʿAlī)”</em> [Majmūʿa Fatāwa [35/18-19]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The following scholars graded the Ḥadīth to be authentic and strong,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] at-Tirmidhī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Ibn Jarīr at-Ṭabarī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4] Ibn Abī ʿĀsim</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5] Ibn Ḥibbān</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6] al-Ḥākim</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7] Ibn Taymīyyah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8] ad-Dhahabī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9] Ibn Ḥajr al-ʿAsqalānī (Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/745 no.459] All praise be to Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some scholars have mentioned two supporting narrations for this Ḥadīth</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[1] On the authority of Abī Bakra (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) as transmitted by Baihaqī in Dalail an-Nabūwwah [6/342] the chain is weak due to ʿAlī bin Zaid bin Jadʿān</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[2] On the authority of Jābir bin ʿAbdullāh (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) [al-Wāhidī in al-Wasīṭ cited from as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/745] and its chain is weak.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Benefit</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the later people claim this Ḥadīth of Safīnah opposes the Ḥadīth of Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim which Jābir bin Samurah (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) narrates from the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This affair will not cease until there are 12 Khalīphs…. And all of them will be from the Quraish.”</em> [Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, Kitāb al-Imārah, Bāb an-Nās Tabʿa Li-Quraish Wa Khilāfah Fil Quraish [no.1821] and its origin is in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī [no.7222-7223]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is lack of knowledge on the part of the claimants because both authentic Ḥadīth can be reconciled. The Ḥadīth of Safīnah refers to the Khilāfah of the Khulāfa Rāshidīn and the Khilāfah on the Prophetic Manhaj and the Ḥadīth of Jābir refers to the unrestricted Khilāfah. Thus the first Ḥadīth restricts and negates any more years than the 30 years of the Khilāfah of the Khulāfa ar-Rāshidīn and the second Ḥadīth establishes the Khilāfah of the non Rāshidīn hence there is contradiction between the two Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr has alluded to this reconciliation in Fath al-Bārī [13/212 under Ḥadīth no.7223] as well as Hāfiẓ Ibn Taymīyyah in Majmūʿa Fatāwa. This is what is correct and for further details refer to Shaikh Muḥammad Nāṣir ud Dīn al-Albānī’s book Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/742-749 no.459] as he has discussed this issue in great detail.</span></p>
