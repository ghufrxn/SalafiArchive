<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Summarised and Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibban and Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>A general point: What is taqlid?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Ibn Abdul Barr and Imam Ibn al-Qayyim quote Abu Abdullah b. Khawaz Mandad saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8216;Taqlid in the shariah is to turn to the saying of someone without proof and this is impermissible in the shariah and Ittiba is to take the saying with proof. <em>(I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> Imam Ibn Qayyim (2/178) and <em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm</em> of Ibn Abdul Barr (2/118).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Hanafi madhhab jurists have explained taqlid to mean,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">To act upon the saying of someone without any evidence or proof. (<em>Fawatih ar- Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/400).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it can be seen that those who perform taqlid will not be able to differentiate between the saying which is upon the truth and that which is upon falsehood. It can generally be seen from the definition of taqlid that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">✓ Taqlid is not knowledge but it is ignorance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Ghazzali writes, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“taqlid is to accept the saying of someone without any proof or evidence and this is not the way to attain knowledge of that which is from the usul (fundamental principles of the religion or the furu (those matters which are secondary). (<em>al-Mustasfa</em> (2/385).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">And it is written in <em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/402) that, taqlid is not the way for attaining certain knowledge. So know that that thing (taqlid) which does not lead to attaining knowledge cannot be called wajib (obligatory). Taqlid stops an individual from looking at the Quran and hadith as a proof and evidence. Never mind this being obligatory this cannot even be tolerated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Despite this some of the Hanafi scholars wrote,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The dalil (proof) for a muqallid is the saying of the mujtahid scholar, not his own thought or his scholars&#8217;. (<em>Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (p.5).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Therefore for the one performing taqlid the Quran and sunnah are no longer the proof and evidence and he is forever free from them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Some misconceptions cleared</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">To accept the witness of someone is not taqlid. The highly accepted book of the Hanafi fiqh titled <em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/400) states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“For the general lay person to turn to the mufti (scholar who gives a verdict) and for the judge to turn to the acceptable witness is <strong>not taqlid</strong>.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it is clearly proven to accept a verdict of the scholar of hadith is <strong>not taqlid</strong>.<strong> It is not taqlid</strong> to accept narrations from <em>Sahih Bukhari</em>. Why? Because there is <em>ijma</em> (unanimous agreement) of the ummah that it is the most authentic book after the book of Allah. And it is known that to turn to ijma is not taqlid. &#8216;So to turn to ijma is to turn to proof (not taqlid). (<em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-</em>Thabut 2/400)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is <strong>not taqlid</strong> to take a saying which is based upon revelation is <strong>not taqlid</strong>. (<em>Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (1/290).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">According to the Hanafi&#8217;s it is <strong>not</strong> permissible to perform taqlid of a <strong>Tabi’i</strong> (those of the second generations and many were students of the Companions). And the famous Hanafi jurisprudence book <em>Talwih</em> reports,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8216;So as for these narrations (the tabi&#8217;in) then taqlid will not be made of them. For they were men and we are men. (<em>Talwih</em> (2/17).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Some evidences on the prohibition of taqlid from the Quran.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> &#8216;Say (O Muhammad) to your folk follow what has been revealed down unto you from your Rabb (the Quran and Sunnah), and follow not any Auliya (protectors and helpers) besides him&#8217;. (Al-A&#8217;raf: 3).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">All classical mufassirin (explainers of the holy Quran) explain <strong>“That which has been</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>revealed by your Rabb”</strong> in the above ayah to refer to the Quran and hadith. For example, <em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> (2/200), <em>al-Qurtubi</em> (7/161), <em>al-Khazin </em>(2/182), <em>an-Nasafi</em> (2/44), <em>Shawkani</em> (2/179), <em>al-Qasmi</em> (7/2610), <em>al-Maragi </em>(8/100). This shows that we are ordered to follow the Quran and hadith as they are revealed by Allah and to abandon following any other way or saying as there is no evidence for following this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “Say, &#8216;Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful”. (an-Naml: 64).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This shows that without evidence shall not be accepted. Know that a saying which has no evidence to support it from the Quran and hadith shall not be accepted no matter who the saying is from. This is sufficient to refute the performing of taqlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Know that if a saying or action could be accepted without proof from the Quran and hadith then Allah would not have ordered for the proof to be brought forth in this verse. Verily it was sufficient for Allah to have called the disbelievers as &#8216;liars&#8217; but in ordering for the showing of proof in this verse, Allah has indicated that no saying shall be accepted without evidence. The utterance of this verse from the prophet Muhammad is to show that the way of the Muslim is not to perform taqlid and blindly follow. Some may comment that this verse was revealed in relation to the disbelievers and does not apply to Muslims. Then note that even though the disbelievers had no proof of what they used to do despite this they were still asked to produce there proof. Then the Muslim who has proof for what he does should be more readily asked for proof and this is necessary. Furthermore, to provide evidences is the way of the Muslim and to follow without proof or performing taqlid is and was the custom of the disbeliever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “When those who were followed disown (declare themselves innocent of) those who followed them, and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them. And those who followed will say, &#8216;If only we had one more chance to return (to the worldly life), we would disown (declare ourselves innocent from them) as they have disowned (declared themselves innocent from us). Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regrets for them&#8217;. (al-Baqarah: 166-167).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The ittiba (to follow) which has been mentioned in this verse is not ittiba which has been ordered with the proof as has been mentioned in verse one above. Therefore the ittiba referred to here will be to follow without proof and this is taqlid. If someone says that the itiba referred to here is the worship which is done for other than Allah and not making taqlid of any Imam or scholar. Then this in itself is a great proof in the prohibition of taqlid as it will have to be conceded that to make ittiba or to follow other than Allah is to worship that person and this will be shirk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> &#8216;When it is said to them: &#8216;Follow do ittiba) what Allah has sent down&#8217;. They say, &#8216;Nay! We shall follow (do ittiba) what we found our fathers following&#8217;. (would they do that) even though their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided?&#8217;. (al-Baqarah: 170).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This verse invites people to follow with evidences whereas those who are astray perform ittiba or follow that for which there is no evidence or proof. This is why they follow there forefathers and elders even though they had no evidences and proofs for what they used to say. So how is it that those who were astray continued to follow there elders not knowing whether they were upon the truth or falsehood? The only way they could distinguish between the truth and falsehood and actually be certain they were following the truth was if they had followed with proof and evidence,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">If someone says that &#8216;this verse is admonition of those disbelievers who would blindly follow there disbelieving elders and forefathers and does not refer to blindly following pious people and Imams. Then the answer to this is that this is a proof against you. For if it is as you say then know that this verse shows that to follow without evidences was the way of the disbelievers whereas the way of the Muslims is to follow the prophet Muhammad with clear evidences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad), &#8220;This is my way: I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me”. (Yusuf:108).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It would have been sufficient to call the disbelievers liars in the beliefs they held. However to explain in more detail the reason for the deviancy of the disbelievers it is not being said &#8216;that you are astray because you followed your disbelieving forefathers&#8217; but what is rather being said is that the disbelievers followed those for whose guidance or being upon the truth they had no evidences and proofs. And this what taqlid is to follow without evidences and proofs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Some sayings of the Salaf as-Salihin about taqlid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">The Companion Abdullah Ibn Mas’ud said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Let no person perform taqlid of any other person.” (<em>Majma az-Zawa’id</em> and <em>Mizan al-Kubra</em> of Shirani (1/48).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">The Companion Mu’adh Ibn Jabal said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“So when a scholar is upon guidance do not perform taqlid of him in your religion.” (<em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> (2/174), of Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, Egyptian print).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">A similar narration has been narrated as above from the companion Salmaan. (<em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> (2/174), of Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, Egyptian print).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Amir al-Mu’minin Ali said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Be aware in taking from the ways of people.” (<em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm wa Fadlihi</em> (2/114) of Imam Ibn Abdul Barr).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is known that those who were being addressed with this advise were the companions and Tabi’in. This clearly shows that taqlid in the era of the companions was forbidden.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Amir bin Sharajil Sha’bi said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“What these people inform you of from the messenger of Allah (hadith) take it. And what they say from there opinions then throw it in the rubbish.” (<em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em> (1/37) and <em>al-Hujjatullah al-Balighah</em> of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (1/148).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Dear readers know that Imam Sha’bi was from the Kibar Tabi’n&#8217; (those from the second generation after the prophet). He met 500 companions of the messenger of Allah (<em>Tazkirrah al-Huffaz</em> of Imam Dhahabi (1/74). So if the saying of a man of this stature and position is not proof in itself then how can the saying or opinion of any other Tabi’in or those who followed them be blindly accepted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Abdullah bin al-Mu&#8217;tamir said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“There is no difference between that animal which is pulled (after being tied up) and that human which performs taqlid”. (<em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm wa Fadlihi </em>(2/113,) <em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in </em>(2/170).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Know that the animal which is tied and dragged behind it&#8217;s owner knows not if it is being taken to be fed grass, or to sell or to slaughter. Likewise the muqallid (blind follower) has no knowledge that the one who he is blindly following whether he is taking him towards the truth or falsehood! This is because he has no proof for what he is following and nor is the one who he is following infallible (but our prophet is infallible).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Abu Hanifah said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“It is not halal (permissible) for anyone to take my saying who does not know from where I have bought the evidences”. (<em>Muqaddimah Hidayah</em> (p.93).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The author who recorded this saying continues by commenting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“And our Imam has prohibited the performing of taqlid and has stressed the importance of knowing the dalil (proofs and evidences).” (<em>Muqaddimah Hidayah </em>(p.93).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is clear from the above saying of the Imam that at first he prohibits the performing of taqlid and then he stresses the importance of following with proof. So it can therefore be seen that to accept with evidences and proof is not taqlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Malik said:</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Verily I am a man and I err and at times am correct. So look at what I say and whatever is in accordance with the book (Quran) and sunnah take it and whatever opposes this then abandon it.” (<em>Jalb al-Manfa&#8217;a</em> p.68).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Imam has completely finished here the performing of taqlid. This is because he has ordered the asking for proof from the book and sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Shafi’ has clearly warned against taqlid. Therefore his student Imam Muzani said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Imam Shafi’ forbids the performing of taqlid of himself and others (scholars and Imams). And he gave the order that all should look for themselves (at the proofs) in the religion and should be careful.” (<em>Mukhtasar al-Muzani</em> (1/2) on the marginal notes of <em>Kitab al-Umm</em>).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="9">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Do not perform taqlid of me, nor Malik, nor Awza&#8217;i, nor Nakha&#8217;i nor anyone else&#8217;s these were all Imams of their times. But they took there matters of the religion from the book and sunnah so you take them from there as well.” (<em>Iqd-ul-Jid</em> p.81).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">He also said to Imam Abu Dawud,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Do not perform taqlid of anyone of them in your religion.” (<em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> (2/181).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="10">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">The Imam of the Hanafi madhhab Imam Tahawi said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Only a misguided one performs taqlid.” (<em>Lisan al-Mizan</em> (1/280).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="11">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">One of the greatest scholars according to the Hanafi madhhab is Imam Sarakhsi he said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“If taqlid were permissible then it would have been performed of those who came before Abu Hanifah such as Imam Hasan al Basri and Ibrahim Nakha&#8217;i as they were more rightful for taqlid to be performed of them&#8217;. (<em>al-Mabsut</em> of Sarakhsi (12/28), Kitab al-Waqf).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It can be clearly seen Imam Sarakhsi that performing taqlid is not permissible and this was not the way of the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="12">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Another Imam of the Hanafi madhhab Jaraullah Zamakhshari said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“If there is a mother of misguidance then it is performing taqlid.” (<em>Atwaq az-Zahab</em> (p.42).</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“If there is a father of misguidance it is performing taqlid.” (<em>Ruh al-Ma&#8217;ni</em>).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>So did the Companions or those who came before them with their various shariah&#8217;s perform taqlid in any aspects of the religion? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. Shah Waliullah Dehlwee quotes in his book <em>Hujjatullah al-Balighah</em> (p.154) from Imam Ibn Hazm in his book <em>al- Ihkam</em> (1/760) that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“So to perform taqlid was haram (forbidden) in all of the shariah&#8217;s from the first of them to the last. Whether it was (performing taqlid) in Tawhid (aqidah), Prophethood, belief in pre-destination or all of the other aspects of worship and ahkam (rules and laws).”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Explanation of an ayah which is often quoted for performing taqlid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “Ask the people of knowledge if you do not Know.” (surah an-Nahl)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is claimed by some that when a layperson asks a scholar or seeks a verdict from him about something this is taqlid of the scholar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This is not the case because the layperson is within his rights to ask the scholar what the Quran and hadith say about a particular matter and not to ask him about his opinion. So after being told what the hadith states about a certain matter he will try to act upon it to his capability. This is not taqlid but it is the following of proof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">If just by &#8216;asking&#8217; someone one falls into taqlid then what does one say about the following verse wherein the prophet Muhammad was ordered to &#8216;ask&#8217; from the jews and Christians. Allah forbid! Will you now say that even Muhammad was performing taqlid or blindly following the Jews and Christians?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">What does to &#8216;ask&#8217; mean in this ayah? Does it mean ask the person of knowledge for his own opinion or what the Quran and hadith state? If it meant ask the scholar of his opinion then know that opinions vary. So the only reason a questioner asks is so that he can be led to certainty rather than more uncertainty and confusion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, the “people of knowledge” in this verse are those who are people of the Quran and hadith, not people of opinion. So this in itself refutes taqlid. Therefore, the muqallid and blind follower will ask about his Imam&#8217;s or scholars opinion. Whereas if he were to ask</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">for proof from the Quran and sunnah then he would no longer remain a muqallid. Also this verse orders to ask the person of knowledge if a person does not know and the following verse restricts the questioner not to follow other than that which is revealed, that is, the Quran and sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it is proven from this that one should not follow the scholar himself but should ask the scholar for proof and then follow that. We ask about the mentioning of the people of &#8216;knowledge&#8217; in this verse. Is &#8216;knowledge&#8217; anything other than the Quran and hadith?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is it obligatory to perform taqlid?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. The Hanafi scholar Adul Hayy Lucknowi writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Only that is obligatory which Allah has made so. And only he has authority to do this. Allah did not make it obligatory on anyone that he choose for himself a madhab (school of thought today such as Hanafi, Shafi’, Maliki, Hanbali and others) of an Imam. To think it obligatory to do this is to make a new religion which Allah has not legislated for.” (<em>Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em>).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Dhahabi states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Ahl us Sunnah do not make it obligatory upon anyone to follow for themselves only one specific Imam.” (<em>al-Muntaqa</em> (p.166).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is there any other person from whose tongue nothing will come except the truth, other than Muhammad?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. When the companion Abdullah bin Umar Ibn al-Aas RadhiAllahu Anhu was stopped by the Quraysh in writing the hadith (narrations) of the messenger of Allah because he (the messenger) was only a man also and at times he would be happy and at times in anger so not everything should be written down of his. Therefore, the companion Abdullah stopped writing all that was said from the tongue of the messenger. When the Prophet heard about this he pointed to his tongue and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Write! So I swear by Allah in whose hand is my soul that nothing comes from this (my tongue) except that it is the haqq (truth).” (<em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em> (1/68).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is it permissible to ascribe to a particular madhab, being known as Hanafi, Shafi’, Maliki or Hanbali?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. If it were permissible for a person to ascribe himself to a particular madhhab or person then the companions would have been the foremost to make there separate and distinct madhhabs with other companions as the leaders of the particular madhhab or group. But we see that despite the existence of great companions such as the four caliphs, Ibn Umar, Ibn Masud, Ibn Abbaas RadhiAllahu Anhum and others no particular madhhabs were formed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">In fact the companions refrained from ascribing themselves to any other companion or madhab. Therefore, the companion Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“I am not Alawi (a person who makes a particular madhab ascribing himself to the fourth caliph Ali as leader) nor am I Uthmani (a person who makes a particular madhab ascribing himself to the third caliph Uthmaan as leader), but <strong>I AM UPON THE &#8216;MILLAH&#8217; (NATION AND FOLLOWERS) OF MUHAMMAD<em>.”</em></strong> (<em>al-Ihkam</em> of Ibn Hazm (6/118).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it can be seen that the companions did not like to ascribe themselves to any other person except Muhammad. Also the four Imams Abu Hanifah, Shafi’, Maalik and Ahmad did not have their own separate &#8216;millah&#8217;s&#8217; therefore to ascribe oneself to them cannot be permissible also. If one was to say now that there are four separate &#8216;millah&#8217;s&#8217; (nations) then this would be a different matter altogether!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">O Allah guide us all upon truly following Muhammad. Amin.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from Monthly Al-Ḥadīth Hazro No. 62, P. 40-43.</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">الحمد لله رب العالمين والصلوة والسلام على رسوله الأمين، أما بعد</h3>
<p>All praise is for Allāh, Rabb of the ‘Ālamīn (all that exists), and may His Praise and Peace be upon his Trusted Messenger, to proceed – the permissibility of women praying behind men in the Masājid is established from authentic aḥādīth and āthār of the pious predecessors (Salaf al-Ṣāliḥīn), some of the evidence for this is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1) Sayyidunā ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar  narrated the Prophet ﷺ said, “When your women ask you for permission to go to the masjid at night, then grant them permission.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.865, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.442 Darussalam no.988)</em></p>
<p>Ḥāfiẓ Ibn ‘Abdil-Barr said, “This ḥādīth shows understanding that it is permissible for women to go to the masjid at night, and this is applicable to every prayer (from the general meaning of the ḥādīth)”. <em>(At-Tamhīd 24/281)</em></p>
<p><strong>2) It is narrated from Ummul Mu’minīn Sayyidah Umm Salamah that during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ when the women said the final taslīm of the prayers they would stand [to leave], and the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ and the men (his Companions) would remain seated. Then, when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ stood, the men would also stand. </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.866)</em></p>
<p><strong>3) It is narrated from Ummul Mu’minīn Sayyidah ʿĀʾishah When Allah’s Messenger ﷺ would lead the morning prayer, the women would leave wrapped in their murūṭ (woollen garments), without being recognised due to darkness. </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.867, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.645, Muwaṭṭa of Imām Mālik 1/5 no.3 and no.494 in the recension of Ibn Al-Qāsim)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></em></p>
<p>It is apparent from this ḥādīth that it is permissible for women to offer prayers in the Masājid. There is another narration from Sayyidah ʿĀʾishah in which the Prophet ﷺ said, “Do not prevent the women from going to the Masājid, and they should go (to the Masjid) without perfume while wearing plain clothes.” Sayyidah ʿĀʾishah i said, “If he (the Prophet ﷺ) saw the state of the women today, he would have prevented them (from going to the Masājid).” <em>(Musnad Aḥmad 6/69-70 and its chain is ḥasan)</em></p>
<p>There is another narration from Sayyidah ʿĀʾishah which says that if the Prophet ﷺ saw the state of the women today, he would have prevented them from the Masājid just as the women of Bani Isrā’īl were prevented. <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.869, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.445)</em></p>
<p>It is understood from this ḥādīth that the previous legislation that prohibited women from praying in the masjid is now abrogated – we do not act on the the law of Bani Isrā’īl, but we act in accordance with the Islamic law given to the Noble Prophet ﷺ, the Seal of all the Prophets, until the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p><strong>4) Sayyidunā Abū Qatādah Al-Anṣārī narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said, “I stand for the prayer, and I intend to lengthen it, then I hear the crying of a child, so I shorten the prayer as I dislike that there be a hardship upon his mother.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.868)</em></p>
<p><strong>5) Sayyidunā Anas bin Mālik narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said, “Verily I begin the prayer and I desire for it to be lengthened, then I hear the crying of a child, so I shorten the prayer because I know his crying will cause emotional distress for his mother.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.709, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.470)</em></p>
<p><strong>6) Sayyidah Zaynab Ath-Thaqafiyyah used to report from the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ that he said, “When any one of you women [intend to be] present at ‘Ishā’, then let her not apply perfume that night.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.443)</em></p>
<p><strong>7) Sayyidunā Abū Hurayra narrated the Prophet ﷺ said, “Do not prevent a female slave of Allāh from going to the Masājid of Allāh, and they may leave [to go to the masjid] without being perfumed.” </strong><em>(Musnad Aḥmad 2/438 no.9645 and its chain is ḥasan and it is his wording, Sunan Abī Dāwūd no.565, Ṣaḥīḥ ibn Khuzaymah no.1679, and Ibn Ḥibbān no.2214)</em></p>
<p><strong>8) Sayyidunā Abū Sa’īd Al-Khudrī narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said, “O Assembly of women! When a man goes into sujūd (prostration), then protect your gazes.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ ibn Khuzaymah no.1694 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Ṣaḥīḥ Ibn Ḥibbān no.402, and Ṣaḥīḥ according to Al-Ḥākim upon the conditions of the Shaykhayn (Bukhārī and Muslim) 1/191-192)</em></p>
<p><strong>9) Sayyidunā Sahl bin Sa’d narrated that, “During the lifetime of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, the women were commanded not to raise their heads before the men had sat (after prostration) due to the ugliness of their clothes (i.e., the shapes of their bodies being exposed).” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ ibn Khuzaymah no.1695, Ṣaḥīḥ Ibn Ḥibbān no.2216, and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ. Also, Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.362, 814, 1215 and Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.441)</em></p>
<p><strong>10) Sayyidunā Zayd bin Khālid narrated the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said, “Do not prevent the female slave of Allāh from going to the Masājid of Allāh, and they may leave [to go to the masjid] without being perfumed.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Ibn Ḥibbān no.2208 and its chain is ḥasan, another edition no.2211 and Al-Haythamī also said it is hasan in Majma’ Al-Zawā’id 2/33)</em></p>
<p>In summary, these narrations prove that women are permitted to offer ṣalāh in the masjid, provided that there is no fear of fitnah (temptation). It is also more virtuous for a woman to offer the prayer in her home, due to the fact that prayer in congregation is not obligatory for them.</p>
<p>Sayyidunā ‘Umar&#8217;s wife would go to the masjid offer the ‘Ishā’ prayer, and Sayyidunā ‘Umar did not prevent her from that. <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.362, 814, 1215 and Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.441)</em></p>
<p>Sayyidunā Ibn ‘Umar was so strict in this matter, when one of his sons said: “We prevent our women from going to the Masjid.”, he severely admonished him, and beat him. <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.442)</em></p>
<p>One woman vowed that if her husband was released from prison, she would pray 2 rak’at (cycles of prayer) in every masjid in Baṣra. Al-Ḥasan Al-Baṣrī said, “She should pray in the masjid of her people.” <em>(Muṣannaf ibn Abī Shaybah 2/484 no.7617, and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</em> – That is, she should not pray in every masjid, but rather she should fulfill the vow by praying in the masjid in her neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Sayyidunā Abū Hurayra said, “The best row (in congregational prayer) for the women is the last row, and the worst row is the first row.” <em>(Muṣannaf ibn Abī Shaybah 2/385 no.7623, and its chain is ḥasan)</em></p>
<p>‘Urwah bin Az-Zubayr said, “It is said that the best row for the women is the last row, and the worst row is the first row.” <em>(Muṣannaf ibn Abī Shaybah 2/385 no.7624, and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</em></p>
<p>Imām Abū Bakr Muḥammad bin Ibrahīm Al-Mundhir An-Naysabūrī said, “Ahlul ‘Ilm (The People of Knowledge) are in agreement that the Jumu’ah (Friday) prayer is not obligatory on women, and they also have consensus that if she attends and prays with the Imam (in congregation), then this is sufficient (i.e., permissible).” <em>(Al-Awsaṭ 6/156 no.864)</em></p>
<p>It is proven and established from authentic aḥādīth and āthār of the Salaf us-Ṣāliḥ that it is permissible for women to pray ṣalāh in the masājid with the condition that they adhere to the etiquettes of Islamic legislation and are veiled, and so on. On the day of Jumuʿah it is preferable for them to go to the masjid, rather than sitting at home, so that they may pray Ṣalāt al-Jumuʿah behind the imām and listen to the sermon to learn matters of the religion.</p>
<p>It is surprising that some people take their women out for Tablīghī Jama’at, then prohibit them from praying in the masjid, so that they remain ignorant and detached from religious education – if their women are forbidden from the masjid, and they keep them away from Masjid An-Nabawī, then these helpless women will be prevented from ṭawāf (circumambulating the Ka’ba) and the virtues of the Haramayn (Makkah and Medinah), and they will also be cut off from offering the Pillars of Ḥajj, and the error in this is self-evident.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><u>وَمَا عَلَيۡنَآ إِلَّا ٱلۡبَلَـٰغُ ٱلۡمُبِينُ</u></h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>“And our duty is only to convey plainly (the Message).” [36:17]</em></p>
<hr />
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Shaykh Zubair ‘Alī Za’ī in explanation of this ḥādīth wrote, “1. The morning prayer should be offered in the darkness (i.e. when it is dark). 2. It is necessary for women to cover themselves with a veil. 3. Every woman should veil herself from men. 4. It is permissible for women to offer prayers in the Masjid…” <em>(Itihaf ul-Basim Fi Tahqiq Muwatta al-Imam Malik, under ḥādīth no.494)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This fatwa of the great Ahl al-Hadith Shaykh, Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan shows the methodology of the Ahl a-Hadith. He clarifies mixing and sitting with people who hold such belief and ideas, let alone cooperating with them. And if Shaykh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan is not from the Akabarin, then I don&#8217;t know who is! Let me warn you dear readers, this Fatwa is not for the faint hearted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Sayyid Nawab Muhamamd Siddiq Hasan Khan Rahimahullah (d.1370/1890) was asked:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) Will the scholars of the Din and the Shari’ah clarify: the muqallidin group who perform taqlid of only one Imam, are they considered to be from Ahl al-Sunnah or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) And is the prayer behind them valid or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Is it permissible or impermissible to let them enter our Masjid and to have sittings and mixing with them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muqallidin of this type in India who have the obvious trait of having enmity and hatred against the people who act on Hadith, hurling slanderous lies and false accusations against them, being irritated with them for saying Amin loudly, raising their hands, placing the hands on the chest and reciting al-Fatihah behind the Imam, which are all established and proven from the authentic ahadith, that are not abrogated and are from raised reports that are not figuratively explained. Likewise, those who commit innovations like Milad, Urs (annual commemorative celebrations for saints) and going into seclusion for 40 days (like Sufis do for meditation and maraqabah) as well numerous other innovations, then they are out of the fold of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah and are like the other deviated sects like the Jahmiyyah, Murjiyyah and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is because they oppose Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l Jama’ah in hundreds of issues, in both Aqidah and actions. In fact, at times some of their beliefs and actions seem to be exactly like that of the Jahmiyyah and the Murji’ah, which will not be hidden from the reader of this treatise. What is to follow, are a few example of the issues, with regards to their Aqidah and actions (a few examples from a whole catalogue) in order to support my claim concerning them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqa’id</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They believe Iman does not increase or decrease, in fact they believe the Iman of an open wicked sinner, the Iman of the Prophets and the Angels is on the same level and equal, which is the Madhhab of the Murji’ah, which is a sect from among the misguided deviated sects as Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal as written in his treatise on Aqidah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>SECONDLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They believe that in all issues of the Din it is obligatory and compulsory to do taqlid of only one Imam, even if it opposes and contradicts the Quran and Hadith, whereas the Hanafi scholars have declared this type of taqlid to be shirk and have discoursed this under the ayah, <strong>“They took their rabbis and monks as lords beside Allah.”</strong> (Surah al-Tawbah, 9:31).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THIRDLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we find from Tafsir Mazhari of Qadhi Thanullah Panipati that the doors of ijtihad were closed with the four Imams and no one can be a mujtahid now, as Fatawa Durr al-Mukhtar mentions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>FORTHLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Isa Alayhis Salam descends, he will do taqlid of Imam A’zam (i.e. Abu Hanifah and this point is mentioned in Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:34.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We see refuge in Allah from these corrupt beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ACTIONS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(They say and hold the view)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) It is permissible for the Muslims to take interest from the non-Muslims in Dar al-Harb (a land that Muslims are at war with) (Sharh Waqayah, 3:130 Urdu) as it is also mentioned in the Farsi translation of Hidayah, published in Nawal Kishore, 3:96. (Durr al-Mukhtar, 3:149-Urdu, 1:43-Arabic).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) If someone has a nose bleed and the bleeding does not stop, then it is permissible for him to write the Quran on his forehead with either urine or blood. This is their respect for the Qur’an (Alamghiri, Delhi Print, 5:134, Arabic 1:154, Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:120-Urdu, Alamghiri, 3:404)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Masturbation does not break the fast as Fatawa Qadhi Khan states as mentioned in volume 1. (Qadhi Khan, 4:361)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) If a person is very aroused and fears fornication, then masturbating is obligatory as Radd al-Mukhtar the notes to Durr al-Mukhtar, Mujtabia Delhi print, p.165.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) If a man wraps his private part (male organ) in a cloth and has sexual intercourse with a woman while fasting and if the cloth is strong, he doesn’t have to repeat the fast nor have a bath for ritual impurity, as is mentioned in Barahana printed Matb’a Husami Lahore, 2:18.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) If a man conducts a wedding ceremony, marrying a man from the west to a woman from the east (meaning there is a difference of one year of journey time by walking) and then the women gives birth in 6 months, the man from the west will be considered to be the father and this will be considered his karamah (i.e. Miracle) even though the man and woman have not met. As mentioned in Fath al-Qadir in the notes to Hidayah, Nawal Kishore, 2:338. (Tablighi Behshiti Zewar, p.240 Lahore)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) Any animal bred while eating pig meat, is Halal as Ghayatul Awthar urdu translation of Durr al-Mukhtar, Nawal Kishore print, 4:196, mentions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) The revenue generated from fornication (i.e. prostitution) is lawful as Chalpi notes to Sharh Waqayah, Nawal Kishore Print mentions, p.298 in the footnotes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) Tanning pig skin purifies it and selling it is also permissible, as Muniyyah al-Musalli, Lahore print, p.32 states (Arabic edn. P.49, Mujtabai print).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10) the permissibility of doing tricks with Zakat. Meaning that if a person gives his wealth to either his wife or gifts it someone else, before the year is complete with the intentions that he doesn’t need to pay zakat, and then the wealth is returned to him after the year is complete, then this is permissible. Imam Abu Yusuf used to do this (Ihya al-Ulum, Arabic Nawal Kishore, 1:11, Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:505, Alamghiri, 10:334-335)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">11) If a man enters (i.e. sexually) a four legged (i.e. Animal) or a dead person and he does not ejaculate, it does not break his fast nor does he have to make ghusl, as Fatawa Qadhi Khan states, Nawal Kishore print, 1:105.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">12) Legal punishments ordered by the Qadhi are implemented inwardly and outwardly. For example, if a person claims that another mans wife is his wife and he gives a false testimony and then wins the trial, the woman will be his. Therefore, she will be lawful for him according to Allah’s law and the people and it is permissible for him to sleep with her and he will not be imprisoned according to Allah’s law. (Hidayah Matba Mustafai, 2:125, Sharh Waqayah, 3:59),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">13) If a person deliberately passes wind after reciting the Tashahhud, his prayer will be complete. (Sharh Waqayah Arabic Matb’a Nawal Kishore, 1:43, urdu 1:401).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">14) If someone borrows someone’s female slave and then commits fornication with her, there is no legal punishment on him despite knowing the female servant is unlawful for him i.e. an illicit sexual relationship. Hidayah Farisi translation, Nawal Kishore, 2:302-303.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 2</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The prayer behind such muqallidin will not be permissible, because we find from what has preceded that the beliefs and actions of these people oppose the way of Ahl al-Sunnah, in fact some beliefs and actions necessitate shirk and some corrupt the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 3</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Letting such muqallidin into your Masajid is impressible according to the shari’ah according to the ayah <strong>“</strong><strong>Expel them from wherever they have expelled you.”</strong> (Surah al-Baqarah, 2:191) and according to the command in the ayah, <strong>“Then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people.”</strong> (Surah al-An’am, 6:68). Therefore, mixing with them, sitting with them, marrying them, being with them in times of sadness and other interactions and connections are all unlawful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be clearly noted the commissioner of Delhi reconciled both parties and also issued a written tract which both parties agreed too, curbing the animosity and to pray behind each other as long as the prayer in not invalidated in order to preserve peace and prevent chaos. However, the muqallidin rejected this reconciliation again and concocted some baseless points. So, they returned to their original ways and began issuing posters and treatise against the people of Tawhid without caring for the reconciliation agreement.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> To proceed</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The &#8216;reality&#8217; of the position the Deobandīs toward the Ṣaḥābah and their riwāyāt, including their abuse and attacks on the Ṣaḥābah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, we say that the Ḥanafīs-Deobandīs have been at the forefront of speaking ill of the Ṣaḥābah, and thus not only resembling the Shīʿah but effectively being a support of the Shīʿah. They did this all to safeguard their Maḏhab as the Ṣaḥābī&#8217;s riwāyah may have opposed it.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Deobandī Maḥmūd al-Ḥasan, writes in this book Taqārīr Shaykh al-Hind, page: 133, that the Ḥanafīs say concerning Fātimah that: </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;She was a woman who was argumentative and lose with her tongue.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Hanafi books of usul Nūr al-Anwār, page: 183 and Uṣūl al-Shāshī page: 85, state:</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abū Huraīrah </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>that he was not a Faqīh, and that his riwāyah should be abandoned if it&#8217;s in contradiction to qiyās” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafīs have hurled this abuse at Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه due to the ḥadīth narrated by him known as the ḥadīth of Muṣarrā. This ḥadīth is muttafaq ʿalaīhi and in essence states that a person when selling an animal should not stop its milk so to make it seem to the buyer that its udders shall produce more milk than its true reality. Should this have been done once the buyer has milked the animal then the buyer has a right to return the animal together with a saah of dates or he can keep the animal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For the Ḥanafīs for well over a thousand years they could not see the logic or analogical reasoning behind Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه stating that along with giving back the animal one should also give a saa of dates to the seller. Thus they had to find an avenue to abandon his authentic ḥadīth and this could only be done by attacking teh being and person of the Imām of ḥadīth and Ṣaḥābī Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه so that there Maḏhabs position could be safeguarded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They forget that Ibn Masūd رضي الله عنه also gave the same verdict as Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه. Read this in line the hoodwinking they performed as stated above. Dare we ask if Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه was not a faqīh and would speak in opposition to sound logical reasoning and qiyās then how can Imām Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله or anyone else be a faqīh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is for this reason that these principles in the books of the Ḥanafī Maḏhab and jurisprudence, remain till today in edition after edition reprints and continue to be taught in their universities and colleges to those who are learning the Maḏhab of the Ḥanafīs. There has been no omission or retraction from such statements which have been made hundreds of years ago. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our Shaykh, Ḥāfiẓ Sanaʾ Allāh Zāhidī ibn Imām al-Dīn حفظه الله in his naqd and critique of Nūr al-Anwār has made detailed footnotes upon the text, and in page: 245-246, volume: 3, he has quoted around eighteen ʿĀʾimmah and Fuqahā of the aḥanāf who held this opinion concerning the Ṣaḥābī Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه not being a Faqīh, walī ʾAʿūḏhubillāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, one can refer to our Shaykh Zubāir ʿAlī Zaʾī رحمه الله (d.1435 Ah) writings where he has gathered in one place at least forty-one statements of the Ṣaḥābah where the Deobandīs have clearly opposed the Ṣaḥābah, just to defend their own Maḏhab, that is, the Maḏhab of Imām Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله. We hope to record some such instances in a later part to this paper. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The aḥanāf have not stopped in criticising Abū Huraīrah </strong><strong>رضي الله عنه </strong><strong>they&#8217;ve criticised others alongside him also for example, concerning the riwāyah of joining foot to foot, ankle to ankle which is narrated by Anas ibn Mālik </strong><strong>رضي الله عنه </strong><strong> </strong><strong>then ʾAmīn Ṣaftar Okarvī Deobandī (d.1421 Ah) writes in his book, Ḥāshyah [</strong><strong>حَاشِية</strong><strong>] Tafhīm al-Bukhārī ʿala Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, page: 380, volume: 1, that:</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Anas in the time of Rasūlullāh </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> was a boy who have not reached puberty and would stand in the back rows&#8221;. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʾAmīn Okarvī further writes: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Anas </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>and that which he done was in his infant age with the other children he has simply just narrated, however when he became older than the other Ṣaḥābah and the Tābiʿīn were upset at the actions of Anas of when he was a infant&#8221;. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> Here, we see once again that a riwāyah in Bukhārī from a Ṣaḥābī which no other Ṣaḥābah challenged is being explained away and belittled by saying that the rawī is a child, thus to be rejected. Yet, this riwāyah and those similar to it have been narrated by other than Anas رضي الله عنه  including the Ṣaḥābī Abū ʿAbd Allāh Nuʿmān ibn Bashīr رضي الله عنهما  in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, once again the precision and trustworthiness, Ḍabṭ and ʿAdālah of the Ṣaḥābah is being attacked as their position is ‘supposedly’ against the Maḏhab of Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله. The hoodwinking continues to be unravelled.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The ḥadīth which is narrated by ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar </strong><strong>رضي الله عنه </strong><strong>in Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī concerning the rafʿ al-yadayn, the raising of the hands of Rasūlullāh </strong><strong>‎</strong><strong>ﷺ</strong> <strong>in rukūʿ and out of rukūʿ, then in relation to this ʾAmīn Okarvī, once again writes in Ḥāshyah Tafhīm al-Bukhārī ʿala Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, page 385, volume 1, that: </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;However, Imām Bukhārī under this chapter has not brought a ḥadīth from any Muhājir or Anṣārī. He has brought a riwāyah from ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em> </em><em>who was a young child, or a ṣighār Ṣahābī, a small Ṣahābī and would stand in the back rows. And he had brought a riwāyah from Mālik ibn al-Khuwayrith who had only spent twenty nights with Rasūlullāh </em><em>‎</em><em>ﷺ</em><em>&#8220;. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Futhermore Okarvī writes in his book Tajallīyāt -e- Ṣaftar [تجلیات صفدر], page: 94, volume: 7, that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Likewise, Imām Bukhārī has not narrated anything from any Badrī Ṣahābī, a Ṣaḥābah who had participated at the battle of Badr rather he narrates from a childlike ibn ʿUmar and from who only spent twenty nights as a guest [Mālik ibn al-Khuwayrith] who narrates the Ḥadīth of rafʿ al-yadayn at nine different places, incomplete&#8221;. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is concerning Wāʾil ibn Ḥujr رضي الله عنه ʾAmīn Okarvī writes in his book Tajallīyāt -e- Ṣaftar, page: 94, volume: 7, that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Imām Muslim went one step further and with these two (Mālik ibn al-Khuwayrith and ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar) he also added a third Ṣahābī who was just a traveller by the name of Wāʾil ibn Ḥujr.  </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the hatred of the Deobandī Imām, not only for Imām Bukhārī رحمه الله and his Jāmiʾ al-Ṣaḥiḥ, but the Ṣaḥābah, he mocks them, he talks about them being merely children, he talks about them not reporting correctly and accurately, and for him the fact that the Muḥaddithīn such as Imām al-Bukhārī and Imām Muslim رحمهما الله were just picking and choosing aḥādīth from youngsters, walī ʾAʿūḏhubillāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask, if the Ṣaḥābah did not report correctly, or were merely travellers who spent little time with Rasūlullāh ‎ﷺ then did Imām Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله  spend any more time with the Nabī ‎ﷺ? Further, these very same Ṣaḥābah maintained their positions in adulthood and taught their students the rafʿ al-yadayn whilst continuing to act upon it, what will the blind following Ḥanafīs do with these facts?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, what were the ages of the &#8216;golden committee&#8217; of the forty scholars which the Ḥanafīs claim formed the backbone of the Ḥanafī Maḏhab? Some were around three and some five yet they are taken as giving verdicts at that age as well as formulating a Maḏhab!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Were Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله  or his students &#8216;Badrī Ṣaḥābah&#8217;</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Concerning Anas ibn Mālik </strong><strong>رضي الله عنه</strong><strong>, the Ḥanafī Imām Badr al-Dīn ʿAynī (d.855 Ah) the explainer of Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī writes in his book ʿUmdat al-Qāri Sharḥ Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī [</strong><strong>عمدة</strong><strong>القاري</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>شرح</strong><strong> </strong><strong>صحيح</strong><strong> </strong><strong>البخاري</strong> <strong>chapter: What should be said after the takbir, page: 291, volume: 5, that: </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;ويحتمل يكون أنس نسى في تلك الحال لكبر سنه وقد وقع مثل هذا كثيرا&#8221;. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;There is a possibility that Anas </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em> </em><em>in this condition became old and because of his old age he forgot, and such things have happened many times&#8221;. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> So it should be noted that for the Deobandīs to explain away the riwāyāt authentically reported from the Ṣaḥābah they not only call them children, the ones who stood in the back rows but the memory of Ṣaḥābah is challenged by calling them forgetful. Yet Imām Muḥammad Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī رحمه الله (d.1420 Ah) is attacked for critiquing a rawī in the isnād to a ḥadīth in Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī, Yaḥya ibn Sulaīm, who was not a Ṣaḥābah but from Aḥmad Ibn Ḥanbals رحمه الله  (d.241 Ah) period!  </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Barelwī Shaykh al-Ḥadīth Ghulām Rasūl Saʿīdī writes in his book, Sharḥ Ṣaḥiḥ Muslim, page: 1154, volume: 1 that: </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>&#8220;It is possible that Imām Dāraquṭnī </em><em>رحمه الله </em><em> </em><em>(d.385 Ah) brought the narration from Anas ibn Mālik </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>when Anas was in his old age and no doubt a person in his old age is prone to forget fullness&#8221;. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So in order to refute the ḥadīth from Anas رضي الله عنه  which goes against the Ḥanafī Maḏhab.  The Ḥanafī ʿulamaʾ are not only challenging their ʿAdālah but also challenging their Ḍabṭ of the Ṣaḥābah just to preserve their own Maḏhab. If this is not the abuse of the Ṣaḥābah then what is? </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Again, concerning Anas ibn Mālik </strong><strong>رضي الله عنه</strong><strong>, the famous personality from Ahl al-Bidʿah, Zāhid Ḥasan al-Kawthrī (d.1371 Ah) writes in his book, Taʿnīb al-Khatīb, page: 80, and also in the book, The upright defence of Abū Ḥanīfa by ʿAbd Allāh Quddūs Khān Qārān Deobandī, page: 213 that:  </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Furthermore concerning the narration of the head being squashed then the rawī is Anas ibn Mālik </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>alone and he narrated this when he was in his old age, similarly the narration of the Ṣaḥābah drinking the urine of the camels is narrated by him alone, and it is the position of Abū Ḥanīfa </em><em>رحمه الله </em><em>that no doubt the Ṣaḥābah are Just [ʿĀdl (</em><em>عادل</em><em>)], however despite this they are human beings and general laymen and sometimes because of old age they fell short in their precision of what they had heard and from this angle they are not free from mistake. In an instance where their narration contradicts the scholars of Fiqh then the scholar of Fiqh will be given preference and similarly in a instance where we have to remove the misunderstanding of that person when he narrated when he was in his old age then we take the narration of the one who contradicts him and who is younger&#8221;. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So here we have the Ḥanafī not only attacking the precision of the Ṣaḥābah who gave us our Dīn but they go further in saying that the Ṣaḥābah saying will be abandoned if it &#8216;contradicts a scholar of fiqh&#8217;. There is not much more to say on this point as it speaks volumes.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Ḥanafī Imām of jurisprudence Mulla Jīwan (d.1130 Ah) writes and quoted by ʾAmīn Ṣaftar Okarvī in his book, Futuhāt -e- Ṣaftar, page: 382, volume: 3, that:</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning Anas ibn Mālik رضي الله عنه </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;غير معرف ولاجتهاد&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He Anas </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>was not known for his Fiqh his understanding of the dīn or his ijtihād&#8221;.</em> walī ʾAʿūḏhu billāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The irony of Mulla Jīwan quote as referenced by ʾAmīn Ṣaftar Okarvī Deobandī is after quoting this even though he it&#8217;s from his own books of jurisprudence he says that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This quote has been utilised by those who advocate that the Nabī </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> has passed away and cannot hear us and by a certain Mawlānā Younus Nuʿmānī Deobandī (d.1434 Ah) would he himself stand on the minbar and announce he has no Fiqh or call himself a person who is not upright or has no ijtihād then why would you say that about a Ṣahābī.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The irony continues further where Younus Nuʿmānī who advocated the Nabī ﷺ passed away and does not hear responses to his Deobandī contemporary ʾAmīn Ṣaftar Okarvī Ḥayātī who believed the Nabī ﷺ is alive and can hear, in Futuhāt -e- Ṣaftar, page: 382-383, volume: 3, the following words that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Dear brothers in this speech Mawlānā [Ṣaftar Okarvī] has done a great wrong. He has ascribed to me that I have said a Ṣahābī is not ʿādl rather a Fāsiq. I have merely quoted from the book Nūr al-Anwār and Uṣūl al-Shāshī, I have pointed what they have written, what Mawlānā should have done was asked me where these are written and I would have shown him but instead he has tried to beguile and fool the masses by ascribing these sayings to me, the irony is that if a ghair muqallid, salafī had done this then it would be a different thing but this is being done by someone who ascribe himself to Ḥanafīyyah and is a clear to the Ḥanafī Maḏhab, and he has said I have said about this Ṣahābī that he was not known for his Fiqh and ijtihād, then I ask are these books of Ḥanafī Fiqh not also accepted by you? Then let it be known if this is written in there that if the narration of Anas [ibn Mālik] contradicts qiyās then the analogy will be given precedence this is written clearly in our books Nūr al-Anwār and Uṣūl al-Shāshī, so why am I being blamed?&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Subḥān Allāh, pay close attention to teh above spat between the two Ḥanafī-Deobandīs scholars and see how they have abused the Ṣaḥābah. In fact, pay heed to how their books of the madhab abuse the Ṣaḥābah!! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, one can see the internal fighting and the abuse that the Ḥanafī-Deobandīs have levied towards the Ṣaḥābah. Then they accuse the Ahl al-Ḥadīth of being the worst perpetrators of abuse against the Sunnah by allegedly weakening reports in Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet they themselves not only have they put aside many aḥādīth from Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī as has been mentioned above, they have criticised the actual Ṣaḥābah رضوان الله عليهم أجمعين   who are the narrators of the aḥādīth of Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī and furthermore they have ridiculed both Imām al-Bukhārī and Imām Muslim رحمهما الله  as scholars of ḥadīth. So this is the case of the Deobandīs not being honest with the public about their reality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How one can attack the likes of Imām Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī رحمه الله   after such nonsense is beyond comprehension!! A lot more can be said but it will turn into a large book rather than a short and brief paper. Further, evidences shall follow on how the Deobandīs truly see the Ṣaḥābah, رضوان الله عليهم أجمعين, Allāhu ʾAʿlam</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst the Ḥanafīs are putting up a smoke screen and attacking the likes of Imām Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānīرحمهالله  for making certain non marfūʿ muallaq riwāyāt in Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī daʿif, then much can be said in regards to this. However, this short treatise is designed as a response to show the actuality of the Ḥanafī Maḏhab and what they say about the aḥādīth of Rasūlullāh ﷺ and those that reported them and carried them to us, that is the Ṣaḥābah. Why al-Albānīرحمهالله  felt that certain riwāyāt where not connected back to Rasūlullāh ﷺ in Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī then this is a different a discussion for which he had a Salaf whether we agree or disagree with that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many of our ʿulamaʾ have disagreed with Imām al-Albānīرحمهالله  on his position concerning this. But why is it that the Deobandīs have decided highlighted this now? We say it is only because the reality of what the Deobandīs believe concerning Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī and other than that is hidden from the people and it is becoming apparent to them only now what they actually believe about Bukhārī and the aḥādīth that go back to Rasūlullāh ﷺ and the Ṣaḥābah in order to hide this they&#8217;ve now decided to counter attack by attacking Imām al-Albānī رحمهالله. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, what is it that the Ḥanafīs believe about the Ṣaḥābah? Below are just a few quotes concerning the Ḥanafīs and the belief concerning the Ṣaḥābah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author Pīr Syed Mushtāq ʿAlī Shāh Deobandī writes in his book, Tarjamah al-Aḥanāf, page: 119, says concerning the female Ṣahābī, Fāṭmah bint Qay that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Allāh knows whether she was truthful in her speech or she was lying&#8221;.</em></span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʾAʿūḏhubillāh. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If this is not attack on the ʿAdālah and trustworthiness of the Ṣaḥābah in favour of the likes of the Shīʿah, the Qādiyānī and other than that what else can it be seen as? The scholar of Ḥadīth and master debater of the Deobandīs ʾAmīn Ṣaftar Okarvī Deobandī, writes in his book, Tajallīyāt -e- Ṣaftar, page: 152, volume: 3, which has been published by Ishāt al-ʿulūm al-Ḥanafīyyah in Faisalabad, Pakistan, and also in his book, Juz al-Qirraʿat bī Ḥāshyah, with the Ḥāshyah of ʾAmīn Okarvī, page: 131, he said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;And this ʿUbādah is majhūl al-ḥāl, Mīzān al-Iʿtidāl &#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> ʾAmīnOkarvī is referring to ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit RadiAllahu Anhu the Ṣahābī who narrates the riwāyah, there is no Ṣalāh without the Fātiḥah in Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here ʾAmīn Okarvī is calling a Ṣahābī of Rasūlullāh ﷺ unknown whereas the Ahl al-Sunnah have Ijmāʿ that every single Ṣaḥābah is upright and just. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">أهْلُ السُّنَّةِ والْجَمَاعَة عَلَى أنَّهُم كُلّهم عُدُو</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whether the condition (حال) is known to us or not it is irrelevant and does not matter whatsoever, because they are assumed and presumed to be all upright and just, but here in order to explain the ḥadīth in a way as it contradicts the Ḥanafī Maḏhab this individual has called the Ṣahābī ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit majhūl al-ḥāl, we do not know his biography to the extent we do not know about him and his trustworthiness, ʾAʿūḏhubillāh. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our Shaykh ZubāirʿAlī Zaʾī رحمهالله  writes in his book, Masāʾalah Fātiḥah Khalf al-Imām, page: 26, whilst commenting on this quote of the DeobandīʾAmīnṢaftarOkarvī, he says the following: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It should be noted that the reference which this Deobandī, ʾAmīnOkarvī has given concerning the Ṣahābī, ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit</em> <em>being majhūl al-ḥāl from Mizān al-Iʿtidāl is a complete and utter fabrication and lie, we can say without a doubt that there is no reference in Mīzān al-Iʿtidāl of ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit being called majhūl al-ḥāl and All Praise belongs to Allāh </em><em>ﷻ</em><em>.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another particularly famous Deobandī, Ḥussain Aḥmad Tāndwī Deobandī writes in his book, Tawḍiḥ al-Tirmidhī page: 436, printed by Madanī mission book depot in Madanī Nagar, Calcutta, India, he writes: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;And this ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit is making anʿana and he is a mudallis and the anʿana of a mudallis not accepted.&#8221;</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">WalīʾAʿūḏhubillāh, this ignoramus Deobandī is calling a Ṣahābī a mudallis and no one on the face of this earth has ever said anything about the Ṣaḥābah from amongst the Muslims except that all of them upright and just and their ʿAdālah and Ḍabṭ of the Dīn and relaying it is unquestionable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here he is calling him a mudallis meaning effectively a man would narrate from the Nabī ﷺ put not in the correct manner and it&#8217;s from principles of ḥadīth that the anʿanah of a mudallis is not accepted unless he shows he&#8217;s heard directly from the one that he narrates from. This station cannot be levied upon ʿUbādah the Ṣahābī for he was a Ṣahābī of Rasūlullāh ﷺ and we cannot question the uprightness of any Ṣahābī let allow ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit who was from the major Ṣaḥāba.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We therefore say as it was by our teacher that this is not only a abuse of the Ṣahābī ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit but a clear fabrication and lie concerning him so that the Maḏhab of the Ḥanafī can be preserved in not praying Fātiḥah behind the Imām. Will the muqallid not stop at nothing even the abuse of the Ṣaḥābahin order to safe guard and preserve his Maḏhab? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholar of the Deobandīs, Faz al-Raḥman Ganj Murādabādī (d.1323 Ah), writes in his book, Malfūzat -e- Thānwī, page: 254, volume: 24, that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;In the night in my dream I met Fāṭima and she hugged me close, next to her chest and I became better&#8221;.</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, this Deobandī scholar claimed to have met Fāṭima and claims she hugged him, walīʾAʿūḏhubillāh, can you imagine if someone said to this Deobandī scholar that I met your sister or mother in my dream and she hugged me, what would he say? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, the Deobandī Imām Taqī ʿUthmānī, writes in his book, Dars -e- Tirmidhī Maktabah Dar al-ʿulūm Karachi, page: 455, volume: 1, whilst talking about a statement in the classical Ḥanafī book Hidāyah, that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;However, the author of hidāyah has alluded to the fact that he believed Abū Maḥḏhūrah that his understanding was weak and based upon suspicion, then this is not something that is correct&#8221;.</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence Taqīʿ Uthmānī is accepting that the author of hidāyah which is a classical text taught to every Ḥanafī student of knowledge, authored by Mulla Murghaīnān īḤanafī is talking ill of Sayyīd Abū Maḥḏhūra and this is something which is incorrect. </span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We know the ḥadīth of Anas ibn Mālik from Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī, Book: Call to prayer, Ḥadīth: 725,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Imām al-Bukhārī titled the chapter heading as:</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>إِلْزَاقِ</em><em> </em><em>الْمَنْكِبِ</em><em> </em><em>بِالْمَنْكِبِ</em><em> </em><em>وَالْقَدَمِ</em><em> </em><em>بِالْقَدَمِ</em><em> </em><em>فِي</em><em> </em><em>الصَّفِّ</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;And we joined in the rows our shoulders to each other&#8217;s shoulders and our foot to foot in a row&#8221;</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then making fun and levelling fun and mocking this riwāyah, the DeobandīʾAmīn Okarvī writes in this book, Ḥāshyah Tafhīm al-Bukhārīʿ ala Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, page: 380, volume: 1, published by: Maktabah Madīna, Lahore, he states that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Imām al-Bukhārī</em><em> </em><em>رحمهالله </em><em> </em><em>quotes the riwāyah from Anas, and Anas had not reached the age of puberty at the time of the Rasūlullāh </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> and would stand in the back rows. And Bukhārī has not even quoted the entire quote from Anas. Anas&#8217;s teacher Abū Bakr ibn Abī Shaybah (d.235 Ah) says that:</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It was said to Anas that you will see that if today you join your feet like you have previously been doing, then the people, meaning the Ṣaḥābah and the Tābiʿīn will run away from you like wild mules. Therefore, it is apparent that when a person becomes older he begins to develop some intellect and leaves off what he was doing when he was young. That which Anas done when he was young he done whilst he was around children however when he became older the Ṣaḥābah and the Tābiʿīn became upset at this habit of Anas. Therefore,it is clear that to him the feet is not the Sunnah of the Rasūlullāh </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> nor the Sunnah of the Ṣaḥābah and if it was a Sunnah or recommended to do this then the Ṣaḥābah and the Tābiʿīn would never be upset from such a habit or a Sunnah.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, we know what ʾAmīnOkarvī has said has opposed by Anas ibn Mālik myself in Ṣaḥiḥ Muslim, Book: The book of drinks, Chapter: It is recommended to pass water and milk etc, to the right of the one who drinks first, Ḥadīth: 2029(b), who said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;</em><em>قَدِمَ</em><em> </em><em>النَّبِيُّ</em><em> </em><em>صلى</em><em> </em><em>الله</em><em> </em><em>عليه</em><em> </em><em>وسلم</em><em> </em><em>الْمَدِينَةَ</em><em> </em><em>وَأَنَا</em><em> </em><em>ابْنُ</em><em> </em><em>عَشْرٍ</em><em> </em><em>وَمَاتَ</em><em> </em><em>وَأَنَا</em><em> </em><em>ابْنُ</em><em> </em><em>عِشْرِينَ</em><em>&#8220;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When the Nabī </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> came to Medina when I was ten years old and he died when I was twenty years old.</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, Okarvī calling Anas a young infant child who hadn&#8217;t reach puberty in the time of Rasūlullāh ﷺ is a utter fabrication and lie because we know at the death of Rasūlullāh ﷺ he was a twenty year old man, and Okarvī has lied upon him [Anas ibn Mālik] and opposed the aḥādīth in Ṣaḥiḥ Muslim and he has only done this so he can preserve his own Maḏhab of keeping the space of four handspans between each people in ṣalāh, as stipulated in the Ḥanafī Maḏhab without any bases whatsoever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is what he is saying in the previous quote that the Ṣaḥābah if it was done in his time, Anas was told by the other Ṣaḥābah and the Tābiʿīn if you do this today, meaning if you do this now after the death of Rasūlullāh ﷺ and now that you&#8217;ve grown up we&#8217;d run away from you like mules runaway from each other than this is without evidence and there is not authentic riwāyah going back to Anas ibn Mālik or other than that for this. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One can also refer to the acceptance of ʾAmīn Okarvī, who writes in his book, Tajallīyāt -e- Ṣaftar, page: 466, volume: 3, and, Futuhāt -e- Ṣaftar, page: 80, volume: 2, he states that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Nūr al-Anwār the famous book Ḥanafī of jurisprudence has called the Ṣahābī Muʿāwiya</em> <em>ignorant&#8221;.</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There will be a lot more said about the Ṣaḥābah and the Ḥanafīs but it suffices at this stage just to know that the Ḥanafīs have not left the Ṣaḥābah unscathed in order to defend their own Maḏhab yet they attack the Ahl al-Ḥadīth scholars for talking about the aḥādīth concerning Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Introduction </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a short paper that shall examine the principles of the Ḥanafīs, more specifically, the Deobandīs and Barelwīs and their relationship with the divine ḥadīth of the Nabī ﷺ. The paper aims to discuss and comment on themes such as:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafīs and their stance on Mawqūf narrations of the Ṣaḥābah. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafīs and their attacks on the Ṣaḥābah. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥanafīs and the scathing attack on the rūwāt [narrators] of Bukhārī and Muslim. Why and to what end? </span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafīs and the Nabī ﷺ</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Who criticised the narrations in Bukhārī and Muslim, Imām Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī رحمه الله or the Ḥanafīs and why?</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By no means does this paper seek to delve into the issues of ʿAqīdah or Fiqh in which the Ḥanafīs, that is the Deobandīs and Barelwīs, have rejected the ḥadīth due to their tahazzub (partisanship) and blind following of their Madhhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nor does this paper consider the absurdities of the Ḥanafī-Deobandīs vis a vis their &#8216;fiqh&#8217; which begins and ends with a disarray of fragmented opinions and verdicts which not only oppose the divine texts but also oppose the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥīn and their verdicts. This is something which can be examined by those who have the time and patience to sift through Ḥanafī texts collating the evidences.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To proceed:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For centuries the people of misguidance have been hurling abuse at the Ahl al-Ḥadīth and the Ḥanafīs are no exception to this. It&#8217;s often been said by the Ḥanafīs more specifically the Deobandī sect, that the Ahl al-Ḥadīth are a group of people that reject the sayings and the aḥādīth of the Ṣaḥābah رضوان الله عليهم أجمعين  and in doing so they have resembled the Shīʿah and people of misguidance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Had the Ḥanafīs uttered their saying so as to not give precedence to a saying of a Ṣaḥābī which was not in line with al-ḥadīth al-marfūʿ from Rasūlullāh ﷺ himself then this would be correct and in sync with position of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth, for the Ahl al-Ḥadīth do not permit blind following or clinging to the opinion of anyone in opposition to the sacred ḥadīth from Rasūlullāh ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, the Ḥanafīs in their usual hypocritical way have alluded that such a position of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth is not only erroneous but also an attack on the Ṣaḥābah and the aḥādīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It&#8217;s interesting to note that the Deobandīs are at the foremost in rejecting ḥadīth. In fact, for the Ḥanafī Madhhab, Sunnah and ḥadīth are seen as a secondary source equalled and level on par to qiyās and opinion with the later many times being given precedence over the blessed ḥadīth, as shall be illustrated later on by the permission of Allāh ﷻ the Most High, free from His creation completely. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In so far as ḥadīth is concerned, one can observe a plethora of evidence to substantiate the fact that, the Ḥanafī-Deobandīs have not only rejected the mawqūf riwāyat, that is the traditions reported from the Ṣaḥābah that have not reached the Nabī ﷺ, in fact they&#8217;ve gone further by criticising certain Ṣaḥābah and even attacked the ʿAdālah (عدالة) and Ḍabṭ (ضبط), which means the uprightness and the precision and preservation of ʿilm from the Ṣaḥābah, only because the riwāyah of the Ṣaḥābah were in opposition to the Ḥanafī Madhhab or Ḥanafī analogy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is in fact they, the Deobandīs, who have resembled the Shīʿah in their position and not the Ahl al-Ḥadīth and this chapter aims to substantiate that. One may ask why start with the Ḥanafīs and the Ṣaḥābah in this paper? The reply is due to the fact that the Deobandīs are the most vocal of sects that hoodwinks the masses into believing that they are the defenders of the Ṣaḥābah and have the utmost love for them, of course the opposite is the reality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In any event it is important to begin with the Ṣaḥābah as it is a principle of our ʿAqīdah that the entire understanding of our Dīn is based upon the understanding of the Ṣaḥābah as they learnt directly from the Nabī ﷺ and were thus the conveyors of truth and revelation to the ummah of the Nabī ﷺ. Simply put, if one attacks the Ṣaḥābah, as the Deobandīs do, then the attack is one upon the very foundation and acceptance of al-Islām.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Ḥanafīs and their stance on Mawqūf narrations of the Ṣaḥābah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The beginning of the ‘hoodwinking’ process.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafīs accuse us that we disrespect the Ṣaḥābah by not taking the mawqūf riwāyah over and above the marfūʿ riwāyah if it is in opposition to it. Then it should be noted that the Deobandīs hold a similar view in so far as only when it suits them. Some examples follow of the position that the Deobandīs present before the people which in essence may seem as them saying that they will not allow anyone, even a Ṣaḥābī to be followed if it is in opposition to the ḥadīth and actions of the Nabī ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Of course, the position they retort is pointless as in reality it is nothing short of a sinister plot but to attack the validity of the Ṣaḥābah, reject them, abuse them and do whatever it takes to safeguard the position of their Imām Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله  (d.150 Ah) regardless of the riwāyāt of the Ṣaḥābah or Rasūlullāh ﷺ himself. This is the actual reality and position of the Deobandī sect and the Ṣaḥābah as will follow.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">First, some examples of the ‘official’ doctrinal position espoused by the Deobandīs, which one may be fooled into thinking was written by Ahl al-Ḥadīth ʿulamāʾ rather than Deobandīs. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Sarfarāz Khān Ṣafdar Deobandī Ḥayātī (d. 1430 Ah)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He writes in his book, Rāh-e-Sunnat [رَاه سنت], page: 114, that: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;There is no doubt that the saying of a Ṣaḥābī specifically in this case, ʿAbd Allāh ibn Masūd </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>is accepted and has weight to it, but when we look atʿulūm al-Ḥadīth then there is a difference between that which is marfūʿ (elevated to the Nabī </em><em>ﷺ</em><em>) to that which is mawqūf this cannot be put aside. The station which is deserving of the narrations, which are marfūʿ, cannot be given to the riwāyāt which only reach the Ṣaḥābah and are mawqūf even though they are authentic.&#8221; </em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> Do the Deobandīs therefore advocate no taqlīd of the Ṣaḥābah in the presence of divine texts from the Rasūlullāh ﷺ? If so, do they also advocate no taqlīd of Imām Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله or other than him who are lesser in status than the Ṣaḥābah in the presence of the divine texts? If not, then why? Is Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله a greater mujtahid, faqīh or Imām than the Ṣaḥābah? Or, is Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله  greater in trustworthiness than the Ṣaḥābah? Or, is Abū Ḥanīfa&#8217;s رحمه الله  Ḍabṭ and ʿAdālah greater than the Ṣaḥābah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Seeing as the &#8216;authentic&#8217; mawqūf riwāyāt cannot reach the status of al-ḥadīth al-marfūʿ riwāyāt then what is the status of the sayings of Imām Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله  and the Ḥanafī Maḏhab which on the most part if not entirety are based upon no &#8216;authentic&#8217; asānīd (أسانيد)[mostly disconnected and weak asānīd] going back to Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله, spurious analogy and just opinions of men far lesser than any single Ṣaḥābī? Can one stick blindly to the Ḥanafī Maḏhab in the presence of the sayings of the Ṣaḥābah and Nabī ﷺ and what is the Islamic ruling upon this?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He writes in his book, Dars -e- Tirmidhī, page: 169, volume: 2, concerning a riwāyah from Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه he would pray the Qūnut in the Fajr ṣalāh. Whilst commenting on this Taqī ʿUthmānī says the following: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This riwāyah is mawqūf and it is not a dalīl for us&#8221;. </em></span></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> simply put, the Deobandī claims the benchmark to follow in all affairs is Rasūlullāh ﷺ himself and not the Ṣaḥābī. How truthful he is in this assertion shall be seen below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also in another place Dars -e- Tirmidhī, page: 191, volume: 1 he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Therefore, the answer which should be given in this is, that this is the action and ijtihād of Ibn ʿUmar </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>and there is no marfuʿ ḥadīth related in this regards.

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> why are the Deobandīs hypocritical enough to ferously attack the Ahl al-Ḥadīth who say that the saying of anyone, not even a Ṣaḥābī can be taken which is in opposition to the Nabī ﷺ? Do they apply the same ruling to Abū Ḥanīfa&#8217;s رحمه الله ijtihād as they do to the Ṣaḥābah? If so, then why not apply that not only to the ijtihādāt of Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله but to all his Maḏhab?</span></p>

However, the understanding of a Ṣaḥābī and a riwāyah that is mawqūf from a Ṣaḥābī is not a ḥujjah for us especially since it is in opposition to the Qurʾān, the authentic ḥadīth and the majority of the Ṣaḥābah&#8221;. </em></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> do you apply the same to Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله and his Maḏhab or have you read his kalimah?

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One can see clearly that the Ḥanafī-Deobandīs themselves and their forefathers have advocated that a saying of a Ṣaḥābī is to be left if it&#8217;s in opposition to a marfūʿ ḥadīth of Rasūlullāh ﷺ, yet when the Ahl al-Ḥadīth past and present have made this claim, they have tried to fool the people into saying that the Ahl al-Ḥadīth are against the Ṣaḥābah and the Ahl al-Ḥadīth are small or lesser Shīʿah&#8217;s by not following the Ṣaḥābah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet everybody knows that it is only the Ahl al-Ḥadīth who propagate the understanding of the Qurʾān and Sunnah by the way of the Ṣaḥābah as understood by the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥīn of this ummah who make taqlīd of nobody, whereas the Deobandīs and Barelwīs have clearly stuck to the sayings of their Imāms in opposition not only to the Ṣaḥābah but the aḥādīth of Rasūlullāh ﷺ. </span></p>
