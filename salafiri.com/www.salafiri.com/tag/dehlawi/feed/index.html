				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi says in Ma&#8217;yar al-Haq, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Taqlid for the layman which is wajib is taqlid mutlaq i.e. the taqlid of a mujtahid from amongst Ahl al-Sunnah without specification&#8230;&#8221; Then he goes onto to say the second form of taqlid; Qism thani, Mubah (permissible) which is taqlid of a specific madhab.&#8221; </em>(p.75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a huge difference between this and Taqlid Shakhsi which is taqlid of a specific individual unrestrictedly whether an Imam or a mujtahid this is the first thing to be noted. Shaikh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi in his Fatwa answers for both the first and second type because taqlid Shaksi is encompassed both what which he declared wajib and mubah. this was the first indicating factor. Let us assume his retraction was for the second type and let us also assume this was and is taqlid shakhsi.  However we presented the first question from the chapter from Kitab al-Taqlid wal-Ijtihad where in Shaykh Muhaddih Mian Nazir Hussain was asked,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Question: Some scholars says taqlid is FARDH and they present the ayah Fasalau Ahl al-Zikr&#8230; and he replied this statement is incorrect also due to their understanding of the ayah. He further said, some of the scholars using this ayah to mean the Imams and proving taqlid is FARDH from this ayah is is EXTREMELY WRONG and a GROSS ERROR</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here is where it gets interesting, the very same people who promote taqlid of the mujtahid of Imam use this very ayah Fasalau Ahl al-Zikr for the layman to make taqlid of an Alim, but here Shaikh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi is categorically saying it is wrong. Furthermore, he says these scholars using the ayah Ulil Amr to mean MUJTAHIDS and saying taqlid of the mujtahidin is FARDH is totally incorrect (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So he refute both types of Qism Awwal and Qism Thani, specifically using the word mujtahid of Ahl al-Sunnah in Qism al-Awwal!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we cited the conclusion of Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain to this answer wherein he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In summary taqlid is not evidenced from any ayah of the Quran nor from any hadith and neither did any Imam permit anyone from doing taqlid of them. Numerous beneficial treatises have been authored in the censure and rebuking of taqlid and if anyone wishes to refer to the reasons of its futility in detail, then they can refer to these treatise.”</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Upon reading the words of the Shaykh he refutes taqlid and saying it is not evidenced. How can it be claimed that he said one form of taqlid was wajib. We also mentioned the language of the people of taqlid was used to explained to them as the example cited in the first Qism is in actual fact Ittiba as Shaykh Muhammad Nazir himself refutes the notion of taqlid being wajib due to it being evidenced from the ayah Fasalu Ahl al-Zikr. Then he goes onto a cite a beautiful passage from Shaikh Abd al-Aziz Dehlawi from his Tafsir Azizi refuting taqlid and their deductions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The taqlid he says is wajib,  he cites the words of Shaikh Shah Waliullah from Iqd al-Jid are essentially ittiba i.e. ittiba or the narrations, but he uses the word taqlid to define this method, which was again the common language as we know very well that asking a scholar a question or a fatwa etc is not understood or considered taqlid of the scholar, and it is therefore sometimes of utmost importance to have lateral understanding based on the overall view of the scholars of hadith. It is like Imam Juwayni defining taqlid to follow the reports from the Prophet being taqlid in his Waraqat!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh further defines this taqlid mutual which is wajib that if the ruling conforms to the Sunnah it is accepted and if it opposes it, it will be rejected, then is precisely what the Ahl al-Hadith do even in this day and age and none of the Scholars of hadith have called this taqlid? As for the Shaykh&#8217;s statement on (1:179) that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The ignorant and the one who does not know, the shariah has made it obligatory and mandatory upon him to ask and learn the issues, meaning that he should ask Ahl al-Zikr, whether the scholar is well learned, whether he is a graduate or an undergraduate because Ahl al-Zikr here is general. So when he has an issue he should ask, whether it is from one scholar or from two scholars from amongst Ahl al-Zikr, in summary he should ask the one who he is satisfied and content with. Then when he has asked one or two (scholars) he excludes himself from a problematic position which does not leave anything upon him from the shariah and there is absolute ijma on this.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is perfect where the Shaykh clearly explains a lay person can ask one or more scholars and this is contrary to taqlid Shakhsi, or Qism Mubah (for arguments sake) as this is proceeds from the recantation and then the Shaykh explains the above without saying it is the permissible or wajib form of taqlid. The Shaykh then quotes from Mussalim al-thabut and his saying a muqallid acting on the SAYING of a scholar has fulfilled his research. He goes onto explain and answer this himself. Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain avidly cites this as a proof adjacent the ardent muqallids who were engrossed in Taqlid Shakhsi and not Ittiba.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here is another point, if the recantation is not from the Qism Awwal i.e. taqlid of a mujtahid then what sense does it make for him to say on (1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Some of the scholars using this ayah to mean the imams and proving taqlid is FARDH from this ayah is is EXTREMELY WRONG and a GROSS ERROR&#8221;</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;and using this ayah to say taqlid of the Aimah Mujtahidin is FARDH is totally wrong.&#8221;</em> (1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">bearing in mind he has already recanted from the Mubah type i.e. of taqlid Shakhsi i.e. taqlid of a specific madhab, as there are Qism Awwal and Qism Thani???</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">lastly the last part of the answer the Shaykh left general i.e. taqlid as just taqlid without specifying it, if anyone attempts to specify this fatwa of the Shaykh Fatawa Naziriyyah they must do so with clear, precise words of the Shaykh and the general must be left general if unless specified and not fom before a recantation. as a reminder he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In summary taqlid is not evidenced from any ayah of the Quran nor from any hadith and neither did any Imam permit anyone from doing taqlid of them.”</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be noted we cited the view of the direct student of Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain denying any form of taqlid being wajib, quoting the view of people way later who are no where near the stature of the students of Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain is misrepresentation of the view of the Ahl al-Hadith, none of the major scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith say this form is taqlid and that it is wajib they simply call it Ittiba, they done so for centuries. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It would interesting to note what Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi said in his other books, <em>Thabut Haq al-Haqiq, Daf&#8217;e al-Balwa </em>and<em> Falah al-Wali Ba-Ittiba al-Nabi</em> all three refuting the idea of taqlid and promoting Ittiba, inshAllah if time allows more discussions will be cited from them. There also some general words non specific in the sheikhs <em>Makatib Naziriyyah</em>, again not much direct significance to this discussion. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">more to follow inshAllah.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1326H &#8211; 1908c</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Muhammad Tanzil al-Siddiqi al-Hussaini</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Dr. Abu Nasr Fazal Hussain bin Qadi Farakh Hussain bin Qadi Wahid Ali bin Shah Ramadan Ali Ja’fari Mehdawani was a great scholar, an accomplished Doctor, writer and poet. He is the one who authored the biography of his illustrious teacher Shaikh al-Kul Mian Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi titled, ‘al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat’ and the book is well known due to him. He was born in the Mehdawan’s which was his ancestral residence. He lived in the Pakki Sarai area of Muzaffarpur.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Farakh Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Farakh Hussain possessed a lot of knowledge and was an expert in Arabic, Persian and Urdu. He was born in 1242H in the Mehdawans. He would indulge in Persian and Urdu poetry. He married three times, his first marriage was to the daughter of Shaikh Ja’far Faruqi of Bhawalpur. He had a son from this marriage and he was Shaykh Fazal Hussain. Qadi Farakh Hussain died in 1306H. (refer to, Kulliyat Fakhar: p.59, Tazkirrah Mehdawanu: p.34 and Tazkirrah Ulama Bihar: 2:204)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Birth of Shaykh Fazal Hussain</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Fazal Hussain was born on the 27<sup>th</sup> of Muharram 1271H corresponding to 1854H in the Mehdawans.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Seeking Knowledge</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He sought knowledge from Shaykh Muhammad Arif Peshawari and Shaykh Abdul Hamid Bihari. He later travelled to Delhi and sought knowledge from the Musnad of the time Shaikh al-Kul Mian Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi and studied hadith and tafsir with him. He also learnt medicine from Hakim Abdul Majid Dehlawi whilst in Delhi.  </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">After Seeking Knowledge</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He started to practise as a Doctor and was counted from amongst the accomplished Doctors of Bihar. He continued to reside in Muzaffarpur and and also set up his clinic there. He was also an avid writer and was a weekly columnist in the Weekly newspaper, ‘Taj’ which would be published in Patna.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Poet</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was very interested in poetry and would recite poems in both Persian and Urdu. He would use the poetic name of Hashr</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">His Books</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain wrote books on different disciplines some of them were,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(1) al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a biography of Shaykh al-Kul Sayyid Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi. This is considered to be Shaykh Fazal Hussains most important and famous work. It is approximately 367 pages and printed by Matba’a Akbari in Agra in 1326H/1908c and it has been reproduced a number of times thereafter. Dr. Muzaffar Iqbal said concerning this book, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This biography was authored based on modern principles and is worthy to be considered from the foremost of biographies in the Urdu language. The wording and presentation is highly reverential and the passages are clear, simple and continuous.”</em> (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857c until 1914c: p.200)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(2) al-Sufiyyah wal-Tasawwuf</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh mentioned this book himself in ‘Hayat Ba’dal Mamat’ when he wrote, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Sufiyyah wal Tasawwuf’ is a specific treatise I wrote wherein I discuss Tasawwuf in detail. The avid reader can thus distinguish and differentiate every claimant of Tasawwuf whether they are even actuals Sufi’s or not.”</em> (al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat: p.144).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the words of the Shaykh it is indicative this book was already published before al-Hayat Ba’dal Mamat was authored. However, we have not seen this book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Tamaddun Arab Aur Hadith Afak (Arab Civilisation and the Hadith of Afak)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is a substantive and detailed answer to the well known French orientalist Museo Layban’s book, ‘Arab Civilisation’ wherein he attempted to misrepresent the hadith of Afak and other doubts. The columnist who reviewed the book in the newspaper, ‘Taj’ of Bankipur of Patna on the 27<sup>th</sup> of October 1902 said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is our view that such a work should be translated and spread in the Arab world.”</em> (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.68)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Risalah Fiqh Wa Hadith</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh briefly outlines the knowledge of jurisprudence and hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Kitab al-Kuhl</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh discusses and debates in detail, the great evil, catastrophic harm and unlawfulness of alcohol. It is 177 pages and was published in 1902c. Dr. Muzaffar Iqbal wrote, “The reality of alcohol and its unlawfulness are scrutinised in detail. The editor of ‘Taj’ of Bankipur Patna, Allamah Fazal Haq Azad has published a review of the book in the issue dated 13<sup>th</sup> October 1902c. (The Emergence of Urdu Publishing in Bihar 1857-1914: p.216)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(6) Qunut Fi’l Nazila</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is concerning making Qunut at times of calamities and disasters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was a brief overview of the writings of the Shaykh and there are perhaps other works we do not know about.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Children</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Hussain married the daughter of Muhammad Akram Faruqi. He had five children, 3 sons and 2 daughters. The sons were Ali Akbar, Ahmad Hussain and Ghulam Muhammad.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">His Death</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Dr. Abu Nasr Fazal Hussain spent his life based on knowledge and its practical example. He spent time practising medicine as well as poetry. He died at the age of 55 in 1326H / 1908H in Lucknow and he was also buried there.</span></p>

<h3>For a while now the hanafis have been rebuking the Ahlul Hadith merely because they reject people’s statements and the opinion of men, that they give precedence to the authentic reports and narrations from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and they obey and follow him In everything.</h3>
<h3>I swear by him in whose hand my soul is in, they (The Ahlul Hadith) have no fault except that they have rejected the statements of the mujtahids over the texts of the shariah. The muqallidin found this very unfavourable and hence embarked on a relentless campaign of hurling abuse. It is such that they started calling them despicable names such as La-Madhab (those without a madhab), Ghair Muqallid, Wahabi and those who abandon the Imams.</h3>
<h3>This behaviour and temperament is manifest from them and most of the people know this and have witnessed it from them. Furthermore, they claim that this way (the way of Ahlul Hadith) is a new way and does not conform to the others. Therefore in this regard I authored this treatise and I have only quoted hanafi books in order to silence those who abuse, calls us names and to establish the proofs on them.</h3>
<h3>……</h3>
<h3>For instance Asaam Ibn Yusuf would raise his bands whilst going into ruku and whilst rising from it and likewise and similarly other scholars would do certain actions (not legislated in the Hanafi madhab) but yet they were still considered to be from the Hanafi school of thought and they would not be expelled from it. We find that they were not bigoted or staunch but rather just and fair. However the hanafis of this day and age lack any justice and fairness not like the hanafis of the past. This is the reason why they are very forthcoming with their name calling and the abuse they hurl with their tongues.</h3>
<h3>…..</h3>
<h3>And what profound words are of those Shaikh Shah Waliullah Muhadith Dehlawi who said in his Wasayah that all issues of Fiqh should always be relegated to the Quran and Sunnah, “so issues of fiqh should be referred back to the Quran and the Sunnah and only those that conform and concur should be accepted. The Ummah has no choice in this (if their opinions or statements differ with the Quran and Sunnah). Similarly it is impermissible to listen to the Mujtahid who is stringent in the taqlid of his imam, his opinion and position which contradicts the Quran and Sunnah. With the aim of getting closer to Allah, it can only be achieved by staying away from such people.”</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Shaikh Shah Waliullahs Dehlawi’s (1176H) Inclination in Fiqh and his Hanafiyyah </strong></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>al-Allamah Shaikh Muhammad Ismaeel Salafi (1378H)</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaikh Shah Waliullah and those who were upon his way did not want to staunchly restrict themselves to any one school of thought in terms of their beliefs, principles and fiqh. They wanted to act upon the issues which were presented by scholars of hadith and the four madhabs without any restrictions or obligations. Although he apparently was a Hanafi [1] he preferred to give precedence to the positions of the scholars of hadith and the Shafi’s.</p>
<p>In current times the deobandis show great reverence and affiliation with Shaikh Shah Waliullah and his family however their actions, inclinations and thought processes are in total contradiction and in opposition to the thoughts and understanding of Shaikh Shah Waliullah, his family and his followers.</p>
<p>The Deoband (ie their school) of today is almost entirely indifferent from the Barelwis of today and any differences between them are merely polemics.</p>
<p>We will find from the following clarifications the extent of Shaikh Shah Waliullah digressive thinking with regards to his fiqh and the sheer restriction and staunchness of the deobandis. They cannot bear to hear anything negative about themselves whereas Shaikh Shah Waliullah did not tire and abstain from practising and acting upon the Shafi madhab.</p>
<h3><b>The Hadith of Qulatain</b></h3>
<p>There is huge difference of opinion between the Shafis and the Hanafis with regards to the purification of water and the Hadith of the Qulatain is at the forefront of this. The hanafis say the Hadith is mudhtarib (confused) and the Shafis understand it to be authentic. So Shaikh Shah Waliullah understood that the Hanafi and Maliki elders did not come across the ahadith or their understanding was erroneous.</p>
<p>He says, “The Hadith of Qulatain is authentic and has been transmitted via numerous routes.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/117).</p>
<p>Meaning the doubts and discussions that arose due to this Hadith pertaining to purification, Shaikh Shah Waliullah favoured and sided with the shafis and excused the hanafis and malikis on the basis that the Hadith was not widespread in earlier times.</p>
<h3><b>Reciting Fatihah Behind The Imam</b></h3>
<p>This disagreement between the hanafis and shafis, wether to recite fatihah behind the imam is famous and numerous treatises have been authored on this subject. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“The individual praying behind the imam, it is obligatory for him to listen and to remain silent (ie not to recite loudly). If the Imam recites loudly then he should recite between the pauses. If the imam is reciting quietly then he may recite as he wishes. However he should not recite the Fatihah loudly so that it contends and mixes with the recitation of the imam. The first way is what I prefer (ie reciting between the pauses) and this is how we reconcile the ahadith in this regard.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/7)</p>
<p>There is balance in Shaikh Shah Waliullahs statement as he does not prefer the staunchness from both parties (ie to either remain totally silent or to recite the Fatihah loudly and contend with the imam)</p>
<h3><b>Raf ul-Yadain and Witr</b></h3>
<p>Shaikh Shah Waliullah said whilst discussing raising of the hands whilst going into ruku and the witr prayer, he said,</p>
<p>“The truth according to me is that this sunnah is optional wether to pray one rakah witr or three and raising of the hands is better then not raising as their are numerous ahadith for raising of the hands and they are established. A person should not get hung up about and cause dissension for himself.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/8)</p>
<p>It is apparent during those times such acts caused animosity and hence his statement was an encouragement to both sides.</p>
<h3><b>Travelling to Visit Graves.</b></h3>
<p>It is common amongst the people to undertake long journeys to visit graves of holy people and their mausoleum. They would do this just as if they were going on Hajj. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“The truth according to me is that visiting (ie undertaking a journey) graves, a place of worship of a wali and mount Toor are prohibited to visit and they are equal in their prohibition.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/153)</p>
<p>The deobandis and barelwis who love visiting graves speak very fervently about his topic but Shaikh Shah Waliullah position is in concurrence with that of Shaikh ul-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and other Imams of Tawhid.</p>
<h3><b>Nullifiers of Wudu</b></h3>
<p>The jurists differ over what nullifies wudu and Shaikh Shah Waliullah’s position is,</p>
<p>“The Asal ie the fundamental reason that obligates wudu is what is expelled from the two private parts and everything other than this is returned to this principle.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/149)</p>
<h3><b>Witr</b></h3>
<p>There is difference of opinion concerning the witr. The Hanafi jurists say they are obligatory whereas the scholars of Hadith say they are Sunnah. Shaikh Shah Waliullah’s position is,</p>
<p>“The truth is that witr are Sunnah mu’akidah (to be performed with designation) and Ali, Ibn Umar and Ubadah as-Samit (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) expounded them to be Sunnah.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/13)</p>
<h3><b>Qunut</b></h3>
<p>The Hanafi jurists consider the Qunut in the witr prayer to be obligatory where as the Shafis consider the Qunut in the fajr prayer to be obligatory, Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“There is difference of opinion regarding the ahadith and also amongst the position of the companions and the successors about the Qunut in the fajr prayer, according to me reciting or not reciting the Qunut is optional except during a great calamity where a few words are to be said before the ruku which is what I prefer as the ahadith establish the dua against the tribe of ra’al and Dhakwan as was later abandoned. This is not a text that totally abrogates the Qunut however it must be remembered that the Qunut is Sunnah that is not to be continuous forever.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/9)</p>
<h3><b>Combining Prayers</b></h3>
<p>The jurists differ whether to combine the prayers due to a reason, the hanafis believe it is not permissible to combine the prayers at all, whether at the earlier time or the later time and Jam Suri (apparent combining) is not even really combining but a form of combining. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said there are essentially 3 times for prayer, Asr is extracted form Dhuhr and Isha from Maghrib thereby reducing the prayer time between the 2 prayers and reducing laziness from Dhikr, he said</p>
<p>“The one with the shariah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) combined both at the earlier and later time but he did not order for this to be practised regularly nor emphasised it, just as he did not emphasise on the delayed prayers.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/18)</p>
<h3><b>The Takbirs For Eid</b></h3>
<p>The Hanafi jurists the Ahlul Hadith jurists differ over the number of takbirs for the eid prayer and the method of the eid prayer. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“There are 7 takbirs in the first rakah before the recitation and 5 takbirs before the recitation (just as the people of Haramain do ie the Ahlul Hadith) however the practise of the Kufiyeen [2], (ie the hanafis) say there are 4 takbirs before the recitation just like the funeral prayer and 5 takbirs after the recitation in the second rakah, however the Sunnah and the practice of al-Harmain (ie the people of Makkah and Madinah) is given precedence.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/23)</p>
<h3><b>Amount of Water</b></h3>
<p>The Hanafi and Shafi jurists differ with regards the quantity of water (for purification). The later Hanafi jurists quantify it as 2 large quantities (Dardah) whereas the Shafis say 2 Qulatain. So if a water well becomes impure there is some strange and obtuse Qiyas in how to purify the well with large buckets. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“There is nothing in this discussion which is reliable or anything obligatory that should be acted upon.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/217)</p>
<p>Then he said,</p>
<p>“The scholars have long debated the amount of water in a well containing a dead animal and if the water is flowing, however nothing is reported from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in this regard.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/147)</p>
<p>There are numerous issues Shaikh Shah Waliullah has cited in his Hujatullah, Musfa and Muswa in which he has sided with the Shafi and Ahlul Hadith jurists, which clearly highlights that he was far from staunch bigotry and did not favour narrow mindedness (to remain within the madhab). We also find that the earlier Hanafi scholars in general were not as bigoted and staunch as they are today. This bigotry started in the 4th century and gained prominence right up to the 9th century.</p>
<p>The fundamental way in preventing and reprimanding innovations is to follow the way of the Salaf. Taqlid of the Imams also played a part preventing the spread of innovation however with this came the bigotry of the reverence of these individuals. Due the variant opinions of the companions and following the way of Salaf based on the greater benefit it is highly unlikely that bigotry would take hold.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Taken from Tehrik Azad Fikr (pg.74-80)</span></p>
<p>Translator notes</p>
<p><em>[1] Here Shaikh Salafi is referring Shaikh Shah Waliullah being a Hanafi based on the understanding of how the Hanafi scholars of the past were for example Imam Tahawi, Imam Ibn Abil Izz etcetera in that they were not staunch and bigoted. </em></p>
<p><em>[2] This is a another important clarification that if Shaikh Shah Waliullah was a Hanafi in the sense the current day hanafis understand Hanafiyyah and then he would not have said kufiyeen ie referring to the Hanafi scholars. It is also evident from the style of the language that he did not count himself from amongst the hanafis as they see it. It however cannot be denied that his main learning and understanding was the Hanafi madhab and this is what we believe. Yet, it is biased to label him Hanafi as the current day hanafis label themselves to be Hanafi as their is a stark difference and even this small article has demonstrated that.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Ma’ayar ul-Haq Fi Tanqid Tanwir ul-Haq</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh al-Kul al-Allamah Nazir Hussain Muhadith Dehlawi (1320H)</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Muqallid Excuse Of Not Being Able To Act On The Quran and Hadith</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence it is proven a scholar upon the way of Hadith (non muqallid) whilst making knowledge based deductions should not make Taqlid of a Mujtahid in the texts of an issue, even though the mujtahids statement is in accordance with the Hadith. Yet the people who prohibit us from acting upon ahadith and even though clear manifest truth does not concur with them, one of the lame excuses they put forth in their defence is that acting upon ahadith in current times is extremely difficult.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They say the Quran and Hadith is an ocean of knowledge without any shores and hence understanding and acting on them is the duty of a Mujtahid only (ie not the common people). They say it is not in their permit to understand the Quran and Hadith and even if they were to read and understand the literal translation, they would not know whether a particular Hadith was abrogated or not, what the actual meaning of a text is or if there were any conflicting ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we say we answer this excuse from two angles</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first angle is that the Quran and Hadith is not as difficult, such that no one other than a Mujtahid mutlaq can understand them. On the contrary it is indeed very easy and whoever knows arabic especially and particular the scholars, who will easily and compressively understand the intent and meaning of the Quran and Hadith as is the saying of Allah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And We have certainly made the Quran easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?” (Soorah al-Qamar:17)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His ayaat and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom – although they were before in clear error.” (Soorah al-Jumu’ah:2)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient.” (Soorah al-Baqarah:99)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So whoever says we do not understand the Quran and Hadith despite being a scholar will fall under the punishment mentioned in the aforementioned ayah just as Mawlana Muhammad Ismail Shahid (InshaAllah) has mentioned in the treatise ‘Taqwiyat ul-Iman’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ma’ayar ul-Haq Fi Tanqid Tanwir ul-Haq (pg.70-71)</span></p>
