				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the call of the Salafi&#8217;s and the Ahl al-Hadith, that the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) is above and beyond the statement, opinion and view of any human being ever born on this earth. If this usul of Ahl al-Sunnah is put first and foremost and then everything behind this, it is possible for a person to achieve salvation. There is a clear command from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) in instructing all of us to transmit and spread ahadith, </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From Ubadah ibn Samit (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who narrates in marfu form that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, </span></p>
<div class="inline-attachment" style="text-align: justify;">
<dl class="file">
<dt class="attach-image"><span style="color: #000000;"><img class="postimage aligncenter" src="http://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=112" alt="hadith.png" width="711" height="141" /></span></dt>
</dl>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong>&#8220;I will tell you a hadith, the one present should transmit/narrate to those who are absent&#8230;&#8221; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(Musnad al-Firdaws of al-Daylami (1:2:317) from Silsilah Ahadith al-Sahihah (4:298 no.1721) of Shaykh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani authenticated this hadith by citing other ahadith with supporting meanings and understanding</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Benefits from This Hadith</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">1. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) teaching the companions divine texts first and foremost which is evidenced from the words, &#8220;I will tell you a hadith..</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) referring to his own words as hadith and thus establishing their validity and authority.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3. Instructions and command to spread the speech and message of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) to others. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4. A group of people should devout time to learn the hadith and then to spread it to the people, i.e. to do dawah</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">5. The need of those who are absent to listen to the hadith and speech of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;">There are other enormous benefits we can extract from this hadith. It is an incredible refutation of the orientalists and modern day hadith rejectors who deny the existence and authority of hadith. The second being of those people who devout more than necessary time to understanding fiqh through the positions of the madhabs, when this hadith clearly shows the command and Prophetic instruction to spread and propagate the hadith. We can therefore deduce from this, the great need to refer back to the Prophetic hadith and to spread this in every affair.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated, Compiled &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have alluded to this issue in the epilogue and I intend further clarification in this chapter. The terminologies or definition of both taqlid and Ittiba themselves highlight the differences between them. From the perspective of the Shari’ah, Ittiba is mentioned in the following Ayah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>كِتَابٌ</strong><strong> أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ فَلَا يَكُنْ فِي صَدْرِكَ حَرَجٌ مِنْهُ لِتُنْذِرَ بِهِ وَذِكْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>اتَّبِعُوا</strong><strong> مَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا مِنْ دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۗ قَلِيلًا مَا تَذَكَّرُونَ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Surah A’raf 2:3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">[This is] a Book revealed to you, [O Muhammad] &#8211; so let there not be in your breast distress therefrom &#8211; that you may warn thereby and as a reminder to the believers. Follow, [O mankind], what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies. Little do you remember. [Surah A’raf 2:3]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Ayah mentions both taqlid and Ittiba </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">i.e. <strong>اتَّبِعُوا مَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ &#8220;Follow, [O mankind], what has been revealed to you&#8221;  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an evidence and proof for Ittiba and the definition of taqlid has preceded this which means to accept the statement of someone that does not constitute evidence. This may be understood from the following Ayah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>وَلَا</strong><strong> تَتَّبِعُوا مِنْ دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ &#8220;and do not follow other than Him any allies&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Khawaiz Mandad Maliki said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whoever’s statement you follow whose statement is not obligatory to follow without evidence, you make Taqlid of them and Taqlid is not correct in the deen of Allah. What is obligatory upon us is Ittiba with evidence and we follow based on evidence which permissible in the deen whereas Taqlid is impermissible”</em> [al-Tahrir Fi Ilm al-Usul al-Taqrir wa’l Tahbir [3:353].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Trans note: he also ie Khawaiz Mandad said, <em>“Taqlid in the shariah means to refer to someone’s statement who himself does not have evidence for it and that is prohibited (Mamno’a) in the shariah and ittiba (following/obeying) is something that is established by the way of evidence.”</em> (Jami Bayan al-Ilm Wa-Fadhlihi [2:993 no.1895, Ibn Qayyim also cites something similar in A’laam al-Muwaqieen [2:197], as does Suyuti in ar-Radd Alal Akhlad Ilal Ard [pg.123]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Other scholars have also alluded to a similar meaning for example Kamal ibn al-Humam, Ibn Amir al-Haj and Allamah Shanqiti as their statements have preceded. Imam Ahmad Rahimahullah also defined Ittiba in this manner.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Dawud said that he heard Imam Ahmad stating that Ittiba is that of a person who follows and obeys the rulings and commands transmitted through authentic narrations of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his companions – may Allah be pleased with them all.  It should be noted that the people have the option with regards to the statements of the Tabi’een. He further said do not make taqlid of me or Malik, al-Thawri or Awzai,’ rather take from where they took from (ie the Quran and Sunnah). He further stated </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“From a man having little fiqh, is evident in him making taqlid of other individuals in the Din”</em> [Masail Abu Dawud [pp.113], A’lam al-Muwaqqi&#8217;een [3:489].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Source: <span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Legal Status of Taqlid [pp.22-24]</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Umar Fullatah may Allah have mercy upon him said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: Eesa (Jesus) the son of Maryam; Allah created him from a mother and he does not have a father. Similarly Allah created Adam without a father or a mother. And likewise Allah created Hawwa (Eve) with a father and no mother. Thus the affair is not strange. Allah said in His glorious Book:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">إِ`</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our father Adam—peace be upon him—Allah created him from soil, from sounding clay like the clay of pottery, from an adhesive soil. After that Allah ordered that a soul be blown into him with the statement, ‘Be’. Thus Adam was.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Where is the mother of Adam? Where is the father of Adam? The father of mankind—Adam—does not have a father or a mother. Thus the All-Knowing, the Most Great, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise, the One who does whatever He wants and chooses, created Adam without a mother or a father. And the affair is not like Darwin (upon him is the curse of Allah) says; the theory of Darwin which states the origin of mankind is from monkeys, and they evolved. The theory of evolution, says that monkeys evolved through stages until it became Adam. And that Adam is not from soil but rather he is an animal who evolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah the Exalted said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">إِ<strong>نَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَى عِنْدَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ آدَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِنْ تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Verily, the likeness of Eesa (Jesus) with Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from soil, the He said to him ‘Be’ and he was. (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:59)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Hawwa (Eve); Allah created her from a rib from Adam. She does not have a mother while she has a father. Thus Allah the Exalted wanted to create Eesa (Jesus) so He created him from a mother, and she is the virgin Maryam, the untouched; may the best prayers and peace be upon her and upon our Prophet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">She is Maryam the daughter of Imraan, the one whom Allah described with His statement:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">ا<strong>لَّتِي أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The one who guarded her chastity (Soorh At Tahrim 66:12)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In this is a testimony from the Creator, the Exalted, that she surely guarded her chastity and she was not a lewd woman, peace be upon her.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Her father was a righteous man, a worshipper. Her mother became pregnant with her, meaning with Maryam, so she dedicated her to the service of Allah. (Her intent was) if Allah blessed her with a son, she would dedicate this son to the Masjid, worship and the obedience of Allah. But Allah decreed the mother of Maryam was to give birth to Maryam; a girl and not a boy who would take care of the affairs of the Masjid and worship Allah in the Masjid.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thus when she gave birth to a girl she wanted an excuse with Allah, she said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">فَلَمَّا وَضَعَتْهَا قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَضَعْتُهَا أُنْثَى وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا وَضَعَتْ وَلَيْسَ الذَّكَرُ كَالْأُنْثَى وَإِنِّي سَمَّيْتُهَا مَرْيَمَ وَإِنِّي أُعِيذُهَا بِكَ وَذُرِّيَّتَهَا مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Then when she delivered her [child Maryam], she said: “O my Lord! I have delivered a female child,” – and Allah knew better what she delivered, – “And the male is not like the female, and I have named her Maryam, and I seek refuge with You (Allah) for her and for her offspring from Satan, the outcast.” (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:36)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Exalted said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">فَ<strong>تَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ وَأَنْبَتَهَا نَبَاتًا حَسَنًا وَكَفَّلَهَا زَكَرِيَّا كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا الْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِنْدَهَا رِزْقًا قَالَ يَا مَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هَذَا قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So her Lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of Zakariya. Every time Zakariya entered upon her in the prayer chamber, he found with her provision. He said, “O Maryam, from where is this [coming] to you?” She said, “It is from Allah. Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without account.” (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:37)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maryam—while she was still young—was honored by Allah. The provision that Zakariya found with Maryam—and Zakariya was from her closest guardians—he would come and find the fruits which only grow during the summer months with her during the winter months; and he would find with her the fruits which only grow during the winter months with her during the summer months. She was blessed, righteous, pious, throughout her youth and when she reached womanhood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yusuf the carpenter asked for her hand in marriage, and he was from her relatives. He desired to marry her. And she was righteous; dedicated to her prayer area, dedicated to obedience to Allah and worship. The entire community of that time period testified to her righteousness and piety. And for this reason when she became pregnant (they said to her)</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">يَا أُخْتَ هَارُونَ مَا كَانَ أَبُوكِ امْرَأَ سَوْءٍ وَمَا كَانَتْ أُمُّكِ بَغِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">O sister of Harun, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.”       (Soorah Maryam 19:28)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">How did you get pregnant with this boy? Where did you get this boy from?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Verily this boy was a miracle from Allah the Exalted. Allah wanted for her to have this son, so an angel came to her. The angel informed her that Allah had sent him to her.</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">لِأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلَامًا زَكِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(To announce) to you the gift of a righteous son (Soorah Maryam 19:19)</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَتْ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لِي غُلَامٌ وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِي بَشَرٌ وَلَمْ أَكُ بَغِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">She said: “How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?” (Soorah Maryam 19:20)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">How can I have a son, I do not have a husband and I have not been unchaste nor committed fornication? So how can I have a son?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And it is from the way of Allah the Exalted that the child is not born except by two parents, between a husband and a wife, man and a woman. He (the angel) informed her that this is what Allah wanted.</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَتْ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَنِ مِنْكَ إِنْ كُنْتَ تَقِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">She said: “Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Beneficent (Allah) from you, if you do fear Allah.” (Soorah Maryam 19:18)</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَ إِنَّمَا أَنَا رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لِأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلَامًا زَكِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(The angel) said: “I am only a Messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son.” (Soorah Maryam 19:19)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah commanded him (the angel) to blow into the sleeve of her outer garment. Allah the Exalted commanded the angel Jibreel to blow (into the sleeve of her outer garment) the word ‘Be’. Thus Jibreel came with a command from Allah. Thus Jibreel blew the word ‘Be’ that Allah had sent him with (into the sleeve of her outer garment) and thus Maryam became pregnant with Eesa (Jesus) may the best prayers and peace be upon her and our Prophet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And I remind you and I say to you, this affair is not strange. Because Allah created Adam peace be upon him, without a father or a mother, and we are all offspring of Adam, peace be upon him. This because Adam is the father of all mankind, except for those who follow the Darwin theory of evolution, so if they are not the children of Adam then they are the offspring of monkeys. But as for us, then we are the offspring of Adam; the one who Allah created with His Hands. And Allah breathed a soul into him. And Allah caused him to live in paradise, and Allah created from his rib Hawwa (Eve). After He entered them into paradise He forbade them to eat from the tree. When they ate from the tree He expelled them down to the earth. Thus this has been the linage since Allah created Adam and Hawwa up until this day of ours, and until Allah inherits the earth and all those upon it.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Salafi Da’wah is that of the Qur’an and the Sunnah. It is the Religion of Islam – pure and free from any additions, deletions or alterations. It is to adhere to the Path of the Messenger (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) and of the True Believers (as-Salaf us-Salih). As-Salaf is a collective term referring to the Pious Pioneers in Islam and all those who follow in their footsteps in belief, actions and morals.<span id="more-876"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah has said (what means): Whoever contends with and contradicts the Messenger after guidance has been clearly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that of the Faithful Believers, We shall leave him in the Path he has chosen and land him in Hell, what an evil destination! [An Nisa 4:115].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-lslam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullah) commented on this ayah: “All who contradict and oppose the Messenger (S), after the right path has been clearly shown to them, have followed other than the Path of the Believers. And all who follow other than the Path of the Believers have contradicted and opposed the Messenger (S). If one thinks that he is mistaken in following the Path of the Faithful Believers, he is in the same position as one who thinks that he is mistaken in following the Messenger (S).”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Who are the “Salaf?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As-Salaf us-Salih (or briefly: the Salaf) refers to the first and best three generations of Muslims. They are the Companions (Sahabah) of the Prophet (S), their immediate followers (Tabiun), and the followers of the Tabi’in. These were praised by the Prophet (S): <strong>The best of people is my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them</strong> [Bukhari and Muslim]. The term Salaf applies also to the Scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah after the first three blessed generations who followed their way in belief and practices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah (T) said (what means): The first to embrace Islam of the Muhajirin (those who migrated from Makkah to al-Madinah in obedience to Allah) and the Ansar (the citizens of al-Madinah who gave aid to the Muhajirin), and also those who follow them in the best way; Allah is well pleased with them, and they are with Him [At-Tawbah 9:100].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Among these scholars are (the number following the name is the Hijri year of death): Abu Hanifah (150), al-Awzai (157), ath-Thawn (161), al-Laith bin Sad (175), Malik bin Anas (179). Abdullah bin al-Mubarak (181), Sufyan bin ‘Uyainah (198), ash-Shafi’i (204), Is’haq (238), Ahmad bin Hanbal (241), al-Bukhari (256), Muslim (261), Abu Dawud (275), Ibn Taymiyyah (728), adth-Dthahabi (748), Ibn ul-Qayyim (751), Ibn Kathir (774), Muhammad bin ‘Abdil Wahhab (1206) and his many students, and, in our time: ‘Abd ul-‘Aziz bin Baz, Muhammad Nasir ud-Din al-Albani and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Who are the “Salafis?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The description “Salafi” applies to one who truly attaches himself to the Salaf. This attachment is not to an arbitrary single person or group of people. It is an attachment to that which will never err – to the guidance of Muhammad (S), his Sahabai, and their true followers. Likewise, Salafiyyah (the Salafi Da’wah) is not blind following of any particular Shaikh or Imam. It is adherence to the Qur’an and Sunnah as understood and practiced collectively by as-Salaf as-Salih. A true Salafi values Tawhid, singling out Allah in all acts of worship: in supplication, in seeking aid, in seeking refuge in times of ease and hardship, in sacrifice, in making vows, in fearing and hoping and total reliance, and so on. A true Salafi actively seeks to remove shirk (polytheism) with all his capacity. He knows that victory is not possible without true Tawhid, and that shirk cannot be fought with the likes of it (i.e., with another form of shirk). A true Salafi adheres to the Sunnah of the Prophet (S) and of his companions after him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (S) said, <strong>Adhere very closely to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided successors after me; bite on to it with your molar teeth, and beware of the newly invented matters.</strong> [Authentic; recorded by Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidthi. Whenever there is a difference of opinion, a true Salafi refers matters to Allah and His Prophet (S), acting in accordance with the ayah: If you differ in anything among yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger if you do believe in Allah and the Last Day, that is better and more suitable for final determination [An-Nisa 4:59]. He gives precedence to the Word of Allah and of His Prophet (S) over the opinion of anyone else, in according with the ayah: Believers! Do not put your opinions forward ahead of Allah and His Messenger, and fear Allah. Verily Allah is All-Hearing and All-Knowing. [Al-Hujurat 49:1].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A true Salafi revives the Sunnah of the Prophet (S) in his worship and behavior. This makes him a stranger among people, as the Prophet (S) has described: <strong>Islam began as a stranger, and it will revert to being a stranger just as it began. So give glad tidings to the strangers.</strong> [Recorded by Muslim]. And he (S) said in another narration: <strong>So give glad tidings to the few, those who purify and correct what the people have corrupted of my Sunnah.</strong> [Authentic; al-Albani’s as-Silsilat us-Sahihah number 1273].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A true Salalfi enjoins the good and forbids the evil. He warns people, out of deep concern, about shirk, innovations, misguided ways, and of deviant, destructive groups: Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong [Aal Imran 3: 104].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A true Salafi constantly seeks Allah’s forgiveness, makes true repentance, remembers Allah abundantly, and rushes to perform the righteous deeds in order to purify his soul. Thus he attempts to follow the ayah: Truly he succeeds who purifies it (i.e., the soul) [Ash-Shams 91:8].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A true .Salafi worships Allah out of a combination of Fear, Hope and Love. Allah says (what means): Call upon Him, with Fear and Hope. [Al-Araf 7:56]. And He says (what means): There are people who take [for worship] alleged rivals to Allah, loving them as only Allah should be loved. But the Believers love Allah more than all else. [Al-Baqarah 2:165].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A true Salafi is not of the Khawarij who consider most Muslims to be kafirs (disbelievers) because of committing sins. He is not of the Shiah who revile the Sahabah, who claim that the Qur’an has been altered, who reject the authentic Sunnah, and who worship the Prophet’s Family. He is not of the Qadariyyah who deny qadar (the Divine Decree). He is not of the murjiah who claim that iman is only words without deeds. He is not of the Mu’attilah who deny Allah’s Attributes. He is not of the Sufis who worship graves and claim Divine incarnation. He is not of the Muqallidun who insist that every Muslim should adhere to the Madth’hab (understanding) of a particular imam or shaikh, even when that madth’hab conflicts with the clear texts of the Qur’an or authentic Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus the true Salafs are Ahl us-Sunnati wal-Jamaah. They are at-Ta’ifat ul-Mansurah (the Aided, Victorious Group) and al-Firqat un-Najiyah (the Saved Party) which have been described in several hadiths. The Messenger (S) said: <strong>A group from my Ummah (nation or community) will always be aided with victory as they continue to persevere upon the Truth; they will not be harmed by those who abandon them or those who oppose them.</strong> [Recorded by Muslim]. And he (S) said: <strong>This Ummah will split into seventy three parties, all of which will go to Hell – except for one party: the one which will follow the same path as what I and my companions are following today.</strong>[Authentic; recorded by Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidthi, and others]. In one report he (S) described this Saved Party as: …<strong>except for one party, which is the Jama’ah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Upon comprehending this, a Muslim has no option but to be salafi. In doing so he attaches himself to that group which has been guaranteed success, victory, salvation and safety from the Fire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fundamental Principles of the Salafi Da’wah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Salafi Da’wah stands upon the principles of Tawhid and Tazkiyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Tawhid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tawhid means to accept and believe in the oneness of Allah (T) and in the uniqueness of His Message. It means to worship Allah (T) alone, and to worship Him in accordance with His legislation. Tawhid encompasses the following principles:</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">To believe in Allah’s existance and ownership of the creation, which is sometimes referred to as the Tawhid of Rububiyyah (Allah’s being the only True Lord or Rabb). Allah (T) says (what means): Praise be to Allah (T) the Lord of the Worlds. [Al-Fatihah 1:2]. And He says (what means): Allah is the Creater of all things, and He is in charge of all things. [Ash-Shura 42:11].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">To believe that Allah possesses the attributes of perfection and the Most Excellent Names, as mentioned in the Qur’an and authentic Sunnah, and in accordance to their literal Arabic meanings without denial of these attributes or likening them to the attributes of His creation. This is sometimes referred to as the Tawhid of Asma’ and Sifaat (Names and Attributes). Allah (T) says (what means): Say: He is Allah the One, Allah the Self Sufficient Master (whom all creatures need). He begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is nothing comparable to Him. [Al-Ikhlas 112:1-4]. And Allah also says (what means): There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. [Ash-Shuirai 42:1 1 ].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">To believe that Allah is the only one worthy of worship and full obedience, which is sometimes referred to as the Tawhid of ‘Ubudiyyah or ‘Ibadah (worship), or of llahiyyah or Uluhiyyah (state of being the only True God or Ilah). Allah says (what means): And the Mosques are for Allah (alone) so do not invoke anyone along with Allah. [Al-Jinn 72:18]. and He says: Whoever looks forward to meeting his Lord, let him do righteous deeds, and let him not ascribe unto anyone a share in the worship due to his Lord [alone]. [Al-Kahf 18:110].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">To believe in the uniqueness of Prophet Muhammad’s (S) Message and in the obligation to follow him exclusively. This is sometimes referred to as the Tawhid of Ittiba (adherence). Allah (T) said (what means): Say [Mubammad]: If you really do love Allah then follow me, Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [Al-Imran 3:31].</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Salafi Manhaj (methodology) maintains that these forms of Tawhid are inseparable from one another. They are the essence of the meaning of the testimony: “La ilaiha illa ‘Llah, Muhammadun Rasulu ‘Llah” (There is none worthy of being worshipped except Allah, and Muhammad is Allah’s Messenger). The Salafi methodology places special emphasis on the Tawhid of Ittiba’ because of the general tendency among many Muslims to neglect it. Thus it emphasizes the following items.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Belief that the revelation to the Prophet (S) is the final revelation, and that it is composed of two complementary and inseparable parts: the Qur’an and the Sunnah. The Prophet (S) said: I have indeed been given the Quran and, along with it, something similar to it. [Authentic; recorded by Abu Dawud and ad-Darimi]. And he (S) said: As long as you hold fast to two things which I have left among you, you will never go astray: Allah’s Book and my Sunnah. [Authentic; recorded by al-Hakim].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Belief that obedience to the Messenger must be absolute, and that his position is unapproachable by anyone else among humanity. The Prophet (S) is alone to be obeyed and followed. All beliefs, statements, deeds and morals which conflict with his teachings are to be rejected and avoided. Believers! Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from him when you hear (his Message). [Al-Anfal 8:20].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Directing perfect love to Prophet Muhammad (S), which should be exhibited in adherence to his commands, swiftness in obeying him, putting his statements above and ahead of all others, studying his Sirah, and studying and implementing his Sunnah in everyday life. The Prophet (S) has said: None of you believes until I become more beloved to him than his father, child and all mankind. [Recorded by Muslim].</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is unfortunate that true adherence to the Way of the Prophet (S) has weakened in the Ummah and true love for him has all but disappeared because of:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Abandoning his Sunnah and removing it from our daily lives, belittling it, and developing an attitude of pride and arrogance toward it.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The spread of numerous unsubstantiated and fabricated hadiths among Muslims.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The spread of many bid’ahs (innovations) among Muslims.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Blind following of a specific madth’hab (Taqlid).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Delivering Islamic verdicts without knowledge or evidence.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ceasing to implement the Shari’ah (Islamic laws) throughout the lands of Islam and replacing it by the ways and laws of the Kuffar (disbelievers).</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Tazkiyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tazkiyah, on the other hand, means to be purified or to purify oneself by adhering to Allah’s commands. In its best form, it would be to worship Him with complete surrender, submission, and devotion. This is a great favor that Allah (T) bestowed on this Urnmah. Allah did confer a great favor upon the believers when He sent a Messenger (i.e., Muhammad (S)) from amongst themselves reciting unto them His signs (i.e., the Quran) and purifying them (from sins and ignorance by adopting his way) and instructing them in the Book (the Quran) and Wisdom (the Sunnah) while before they had been in manifest error. [Al ‘Imran 3:164]. The following points should help clarify the true meaning of Tazkiyah.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Qur’an and Sunnah are the only sources for Tazkiyah.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (S) is the purest of mankind in his soul. His character reflected the teachings of the Qur’an. Therefore, he is our model for Tazkiyah. Allah says (what means): Indeed in the Messenger of Allah is a beautiful pattern of conduct to follow for anyone whose hopes lie in Allah and the Last Day and who remembers Allah abundantly. [Al-Ahzab 33:21].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet’s Companions and the rest of the Salaf are, as a group, a fine model to be followed in Tazkiyah.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">There is no way of drawing closer to Allah except by adhering to what Prophet Muharnmad (S) came with. The Prophet (S) has said: If anyone introduces into this affair of ours (i.e., the religion of Islam) anything which does not belong to it, it will be rejected from him. [Recorded by Muslim].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">There is no way to attain Tazkiyah but through the teachings of Islam. Allah says (what means): O you who believe! Enter into Islam wholeheartedly (i.e., obey all the regulations of Allah and His Messenger) and follow not the footsteps of Shaytan. Verily! He is to you an open enemy. [Al-Baqarah 2:208]. Thus there can be no Tazkiyah through deviant approaches of various groups, such as the Sufis who have corrupted the beliefs and practices of the Muslims.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Salafi Manhaj represents the true exemplification of piety. It is Iman without hypocrisy, purity without corruption.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Aims and Objectives of the Salafi Da’wah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Salafi Da’wah is not a political party or a new madth’hab. Rather, the Salafi da’wah is that of Islam in its totality, addressing all humanity irrespective of culture, race, or color. It is the complete and perfect methodology of understanding Islam and acting according to its teachings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Consequently, the aims of the Salafi Da’wah are no different than those of the Da’wah of Islam. Therefore the Salafis remain distinct from the various sects and groups in the way and methodology of their Da’wah. They call to Islam as a whole – to its correct understanding and implementation. Misguided groups and deviant sects emphasize and call to particular aspects of Islam, thereby neglecting its other aspects to suit their own needs, as well as losing sight of the purpose and perspective for which they have been created; which is, as Allah has stated (meaning): I have not created Jinn and people except (for this purpose): that they may worship Me. [Adth-Dthariyat 51:56]. And He has said (what means): And they were not commanded except with this: that they should worship Allah (alone), being sincere in His Din and being Hanifs (upright, true and conscientiously turning away from Shirk). [Al-Bayyinah 98:5]. This, in essence, is the call of all the Prophets: calling to the Tawhid of Allah, to the annihilation of shirk, to sincerity in His worship, to obedience to His Messengers, and to adherence to their way. This is also the essence of the Salafi Da’wah. This can further be itemized into the following practical objectives:</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Return to the sublime Qur’an and to the Prophet’s authentic Sunnah, and comprehend them both in accordance with the understanding and practice of as-Salaf: This conforms with what Allah (T) said (what means): If anyone contends with the Messenger even after the Guidance has been plainly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that of the believers, We shall leave him in the path he has chosen, and land him in Hell: What an evil abode! [An-Nisa 4:115]. And: So if they believe as you believe (the companions of the Messenger (S)), they are indeed on the right path. [Al-Baqarah 2:137].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Caution Muslims and exhort them to cleanse their lives of all forms of: shirk (polytheism), bid’ahs, and philosophy or other thoughts alien to the pure, essential tenets of Islam. This is a duty that Allah (T) enjoined upon us: Help you one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in sinning and transgression. [Al-Maidah 5:2].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Cleanse the Sunnah of the weak and fabricated narrations. The problems referred to in this and the previous point have marred the clarity of Islam and have prevented the progress of Muslims. This puts on us the responsibility referred to by the Messenger (S): A trustworthy group from every generation will carry this knowledge, expelling from it the alterations made by those going beyond bounds, and the false claims of the liars, and the misinterpretations of the ignorant. [Authentic recorded by Ibn Adiyy and others].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Educate Muslims and urge them to comply with the true Din, to act according to its teachings, and to adorn themselves with its virtues and ethics. This will ensure Allah’s acceptance and will realize for them happiness and honor, as indicated in the following: By the passing time, man is indeed in [a state of] loss, except those who attain to faith and do good deeds, and those who enjoin upon one another the keeping to truth, and enjoin upon one another patience in adversity. [Al ‘Asr 103:1-3].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Strive to revive Islamic thought within the boundaries of Islamic principles, and oppose stubborn adherence to madth’habs and prejudiced loyalty to parties. These problems have diverted Muslims from the pure original sources of Islam, and have deviated them from the honest Islamic brotherhood called to by Allah: And hold fast all together, by the rope of Allah, and be not divided among yourselves. [Al ‘Imran 3:103]. And by His Messenger (S): Be, worshippers of Allah, one brethren. [Al Bukhari and Muslim].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Present realistic Islamic solutions to contemporary problems, and strive to resume a true Islamic way of life and to establish a true Islamic society governed by Allah’s law. Allah (T) said: Hence, judge between them in accordance with what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their errant views. [Al-Maidah 5:49].</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We call upon all Muslims to support us in carrying out this noble trust which will surely elevate and honor them and spread the eternal message of Islam all over earth. Allah (T) has promised this, and His promise is surely true: <strong>He it is who has sent forth His Messenger with [the task of spreading] guidance and the religion of truth, in order to make it prevail over all [false] religion, however hateful this may be to those who ascribe divinity to aught but Allah. </strong>[As-Saff 61:9]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Misconceptions about the Salafi Da’wah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There following are is a number of misconceptions about the Salafi Da’wah:</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Calling as-Salafiyyah a “movement” or “movements.” It should be clear to all that the Salafi Da’wah is Islam, no more and no less. It is the True Islam with all its teachings and implications. Anyone who talks about it as an outsider might as well talk about Islam as an outsider! It is the teachings of the Qur’an and the authentic Sunnah in the light of practices and understanding of as-Salaf: A “movement” is meant to indicate something temporal or reactionary, whereas the Salafi Da’wah is the only true and constant and blessed Da wah of the prophets.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Thinking or claiming that the Salafs are followers of a fifth madth’hab which is attributed to Ibn Taymiyyah or Ibn Baz or al-Albani. This is a grave misconception. As stated above, the Salaf sources are the Qur an, the Sunnah, and the methodology of as-Salaf: If these scholars rely in their ijtihad on these sources then we take what they say, not because they said it, rather because Allah or His Messenger said it or called to it directly or indirectly through the known channels of ijtihad. The same applies to all scholars throughout the ages. We take from them all what conforms with the Qur’an and the Sunnah and we reject what does not.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Salaf Da’wah is against all forms of ‘asabiyyah and hizbiyyah (baseless allegiance for parties, factions, races, nations, etc). The only allowed allegiance is to Allah and His Messenger and to what stems from it. The leader of all Salafis is Muhammad (S). Anyone else will be respected and obeyed in as much as he obeys Allah and His Messenger. Claiming that the Salafi Da’wah calls its followers to be disorganized and chaotic in their behavior is another misconception. Work has to be organized and orderly, as was taught by the Messenger (S) on many occasions, but it should avoid the hizbiyyah disease described above.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Salafi Da’wah puts a strong emphasis on tarbiyah (education and cultivation). This is not a mere academic educational process; rather, it is a complete process which is meant to raise committed Muslims who understand their Din and who practice it in the best possible way.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask Allah (ta’ala) to guide us to the truth, to steady our feet, and to forgive our shortcomings.</span></p>
