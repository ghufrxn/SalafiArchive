<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was born into a religious family who were upon the correct Aqeedah from the very beginning and at the same time his surrounding was just a complete understanding of Quraan and Hadeeth. The Shaikh received his early education from his father Shaikh Ehsaanullaah Shaah Raashidee who was titled as an Imaam on Asmaa ur-Rijaal of his time by Shaikh ul-Islaam Thanaullaah Amritsari.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then went to Shaikh Muhammad Ibraahim Meer Sialkotee and took a letter from him to attend madrassah Rehmania in Delhi but for some reason or another he never went. He read Wadheh al-Bayaan and Shahadatul-Quraan from Shaikh Ibrahim Meer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whatever subject the Shaikh studied he developed great expertise in it so much so that he even composed poetry. His father Shaikh Ehsaanullaah was strictly againt and hated Greek philosophy but the Shaikh convinced his father and also learnt it. The Shaikh aswell as learning the Islamic sciences also learnt secular sciences and so he completed his metric and thereafter he completed his F.A. and then B.A and went on further and completed an M.A. In Religious studies from Karachi or Sindh University aswell as further Arabic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh had great expertise and excelled in syntax and Arabic grammar and was an authority in tafseer and Hadeeth and this is the reason why many respected him.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was unique in his knowledge and actions and he had complete authority in Islamic sciences and principles such as tafseer, Hadeeth, fiqh, principles of fiqh, history and biographies, asma ur-rijaal, adab, philosophy and logic. He had a heartily affection with Hadeeth and his research and expertise in asma ur-rijaal was vast and he was an experienced in research and analysis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After receiving his education be began teaching in his village in Peer Jhandha and after a number of years he moved to another village Dargah Shareef which is situated about 2 to 3 kilometres from New Saeedabaad. He established a madrassah and began teaching. The Shaikh also has a very big library which has more than 10,000 books.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh spent a lot of his life teaching and lecturing in the village madrassah of Daar ur-Rashaad, any of the students who would come would leave with pearls of knowledge. The Shaikh has numerous students some of them are</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His younger brother and the great Al-Allaamah Imaam Badee ud deen Sindhee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ibraaheem A’waan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Ghaanee bin Shaikh al-Allaamah Allaah Baksh Tanasyo</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hamdee Abdul Majeed as-Salafi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Yaqoob</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Professor Baksh Muhammadee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Yaqoob bin Moosaa Jantee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ayoob Mamduh bin Fathe al-Kuwaitee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Abdullaah </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And other that so many scholars benefitted from him.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Books</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">the Shaikh was constantly busy with teaching and delivering sermons and speeches throughout Pakistan and as he was also in charge of madrassah Daar ul-Rashaad where he would be continuously teaching and so had very little time. The Shaikh has written hundred of articles in the numerous magazines and journals in Pakistan and elsewhere, he would write in both Urdu and Sindhee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh has approximately 57 works spread over 3 languages ie Arabic, Urdu and Sindhee. This alone is a remarkable as most authors write in one language and rarely 2 but to write in 3 languages is indeed something. Writing alone is easy but writing on intricate and integral issues in different languages is a unique capability and we will see from the shaikhs works.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is further unique to Shaikh Muhibullaah is that a great majority of his books have an Arabic title irrespective of the language they have been written in as you will come to know.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh had travelled to Amritsar, Delhi, Agra, Saudia Arabia, Istanbul in Turkey and to some European countries with regards to knowledge. He spent 12 days just visiting the museums and bookshops in search of books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh would speak very little and when he did speak he was softly spoken, smiling and a pleasant natured scholar. His speech would always be weighed before he spoke and he would speak with his full knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh would prayer with great ease and simplicity and by this the followers would also tend to relax and pray with great ease. The Shaikh was indeed very simple and a very humble man so much so that if ever he needed a quote from a book he would get up and get the book himself instead of asking his students.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With regards to Tawheed and The Sunnah he was like an open razor sharp sword. Once a man came to the Shaikh and bowed down and gave Salaam, The Shaikh with great anger reprimanded the action and said any bowing is only for Allaah alone, when nowadays the people wait and anticipate that people bow and give them salaam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was strictly opposed and hated acts and statements of shirk. So an incident occurred in the year 1939 when the Shaikh along with his mother, nephew and some other people left for the annual pilgrimage of hajj via ship. The ship had not lifted the anchor when a man said “labbayk ya rasoolullaah” so the Shaikh said in a loud voice “is other than Allaah already being called upon what will happen to this ship” and as soon as the ship left the shores of Karachi it became engulfed in a storm and all you could hear were screams and the waves were rising and washing the ship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So now all of them were calling upon Allaah frantically and prostrating and reading the Quraan asking for leave of destruction. The captain said this ship has never had to face such a storm in over 40 years. The man who said labbayk ya rasoolullaah was on the ground prostrating and praying to Allaah. The captain had to turn the ship around away from Jeddah as he thought it was too dangerous and then the people became very sad at the thought of not being able to perform hajj. The ship remained in the storm for for 3 to days until things calmed and they finally made their way to Jeddah for hajj. This frightening ordeal lasted a total of 11 days and finally in the end they were able to fulfill their obligations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh really disliked pictures and any form of imagery so much so that all of the books in his library had all of the pictures defaced and every morning the photos in the newspaper would be defaced before they were give to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ehsaanullaah asked his brother for his daughters hand in marriage for Shaikh Muhibullah but his brother refused saying he (Shaikh Muhibullaah) does Raful Yadain ie raises his hands in the prayer so Shaikh Muhibullaah said I cannot abandon a Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu alayhee was-Sallam) just for the sake of a woman, let alone one woman i can sacrifice 1000 women over the Sunnah of my beloved Prophet (Sallalahu alayhee was-Sallam). Later on after Shaikh Ehsaanullahs demise his uncle agreed to his daughters marriage himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh would lead the Taraweeh prayer himself and recite one juzz every night in the month of Ramadhan. In any month he would on average recite 4 juzz per day and would finish reciting the whole Quraan in approximately one week, and he would start on the saturday and finish on the Friday, not only would he do this by memory but also by looking at the Quraan. Furthermore he would recite one juzz in the tahajjud prayer and would finish hence a whole Quraan via this way too.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would practise what had been narrated in the ahadeeth concerning the recitation of certain soorahs in the prayers for example what has been mentioned concerning reciting soorahs al-Baqarah, Ale Imraan and an-Nisaa the Shaikh would practise this as well as reciting 20 soorahs in 10 rakahs. This shows how the Shaikh was very observant of the Sunnah even when it came to actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh would have a lesson on tafseer ie explain the Quraan everyday after the fajr prayer and he would do so after researching the verses from at least 14 or 15 explanations of the Quraan and every ruling or issues related to the verse the Shaikh would mention and explain so much so that the explanation of a verse could continue for days. The Shaikh had great love for the Quraan and he would research and learn the meaning of the Quraan with great depth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh travelled extensively throughout Pakistan calling people to Islaam and delivering lectures at so many different places. He also travelled abroad and called non Muslims to Islaam. He travelled to England and visited cities such as London, Birmingham, Manchester and Oxford and told the people about the importance of sticking to the Quraan and Sunnah.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Shaikh On Asmaa ur-Rijaal</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair Alee Zaee said I did the checking of Imaam Baihaqis book “Ithbaat Adhaab al-Qabr” (Affirming the Punishment of The Grave) and this book was written in manuscript form by our Shaikh Imaam Bade ud deen so whilst doing the checking I was unable to find information concerning some narrators so I would refer to Shaikh Muhibullaah and he having unparallel memory would tell me the affair of some of these narrators from his memory from the books. Shaikh Muhibullaah also wrote the introduction to this book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hamdee Abdul Majeed as-Salafee one of the students of Imaam Badee ud deen is a checker and verifier of books and from one of the books he checked is Mu’ajam al-Kabeer of Imaam Tabarani and this is indeed a great service. He would often refer and benefit from Shaikh Muibullaah with regards to his checking in one place in the notes to a narrator he says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“For he is unknown according to the principles as my Shaikh Muhibullaah Shaah has said&#8221; (al-Muajam al-Kabeer 1/209)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hamdee would also send Shaikh Muhibullaah any new books printed in Iraaq.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once in answer to an issue of science of hadeeth he authored a 74 page treatise titled, “Calming the heart of one troubled by the tadlees of Thawree and al-A’amash”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair Alee Zaee has for a number of years has been compiling a book on scholars of current times and other people as he also had a great interest in Asmaa ur-Rijaal. So he asked Shaikh Muhibullaah pertaining  to some great scholars of our times and he was indeed a great expert and fair in these affairs when he spoke so I asked him about</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ash-Shaikh Abdul Azeez bin Abdullah bin Baaz (Rahimahullah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said,<em> “Scholar, researcher of the truth, trustworthy and honest.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ash-Shaikh Muhammad Naasir ud deen al-Albaanee (Rahimahullah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said, <em>“Researcher of the truth undoubtedly, established and trustworthy”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ash-Shaikh Ataaullaah Haneef Bhojiyaanee (Rahimahullah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said, <em>“My teacher, the trustworthy from amongst my trustworthy teachers, and there are very few similar to him in this era.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ash-Shaikh Badee ud deen Sindhee (Rahimahullah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said, <em>“Trustworthy”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zaahid al-Kawtharee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">he said, <em>“staunch/bigoted from amongst the hanafis.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(taken from Shaikh Zubair book titled, Anwaar us-Sabeel Fee Meezaan al-Jarh Wat-Ta’deel (Manuscript)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Some of the Scholars who Praised him</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great Shaikh Imaam Abu Fadhal Faidh ur-Rahmaan ath-Thawree (d.1417H) a great researcher and a great scholar of hadeeth who wrote an answer and refutation to Ibn Turkamaanee Hanafis book al-Jawhar an-Naqee said about Shaikh Muhibullaah Shaah “The Great Scholar”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh al-Allaamah the Muhaddith Irshaad ul-Haqq al-Atharee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Shaikh Muhibullaah Shaah Raashidee is the person that if you do not mention him the history of Sindh is incomplete. His knowledge, his virtues, his fear of Allaah and actions were like mountains and his life was just like an example of a salaf. There was no one like him when it came to being upfront and honest and serving guests. His clear statements and his following the Sunnah was a clear sign of a clear way. His daily living was just books and he is really worthy of the following statement, ‘we will die in books and the pages will be our shroud’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair Alee Zaee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“if I was made to stand between the station of Ibrahim and Rukn al-Yamaani ( ie facing kabah) and made to swear I would say I have not seen anyone more pious, worshipper or virtuous than Shaikh Muhibullaah Shaah”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh leaves behind 3 sons, Muhammad Yaseen, Muhammad Raashid and Muhammad Qaasim all of whom have received religious education and are now also teaching in the madrassah, the first two sons also help with cultivating the land that they own.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During various times various governments offered him positions within the governments but he kindly refused them and said the biggest service was to spread the Quraan and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great Shaikh and Muhaddith passed away on the 9th of shabaan in 1415H corresponding to 21st January 1995ce in Hydrabaad, his younger brother and the great Muhaddith and Imaam of Ahlus Sunnah The Shaikh al-Arab wal-Ajam Abu Muhammad Badee ud deen led his funeral prayer and was buried in his family village</span></p>
