</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [MUSLIM]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/952, 953 hadith no.1841, book 51, chapter 5, hadith no.14), at-Tamhid (2/279) and al-Istidhkar (no.1777) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Muslim (no.1031) from the hadith of Malik, and al-Bukhari (no.6806) from the hadith of Khubaib Ibn Abdurahman al-Ansari from Hafs Ibn Hashim with the same hadith.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Hafidh Ibn Abdul Bar took the word &#8220;Dhilla&#8221; (shade) and understood it to mean mercy. If the meaning of the word literally means shade then this would mean the shade of Allah&#8217;s Throne as it is mentioned in another hadith that, &#8220;&#8230;seven people will be given shade under Allah&#8217;s Throne&#8230;&#8221; (Mushkil al-Athar of at-Tahawi, new edition 15/69 hadith no.5844, Tuhfatul Akhyar 7/195 hadith no.5117 and it&#8217;s chain is [Sahih] authentic). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Whosoever is lenient with with the loan of someone who owes them (i.e. allows them a longer time to pay back, or reduces and forgives them part of the loan or pays of their debt etc.), &#8220;&#8230;Allah will shade him on the Day of Judgement under His Throne&#8230;&#8221; (Sunan at-Tirmidhi no.1302, and he said, &#8220;Hasan Sahih Garib&#8221; and it&#8217;s chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The wording in a hadith of Mu&#8217;adh Ibn Jabal (Radi Allahu Anhu) are, &#8220;&#8230;Allah will put them under the shade of His Throne&#8230;&#8221; (al-Mustadrak of al-Hakim 4/169 hadith no.7315, and it&#8217;s chain is [Sahih] authentic and al-Hakim authenticated it on the conditions of Bukhari and Muslim and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) This hadith points towards many important matters such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of a just leader</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of a youth who spends their youthful days in the worship of Allah</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who is connected to the Masjid and loves it and gives it preference over and above worldly matters </span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who loves and hates someone for the sake of Allah only and not because of a worldly or personal gain </span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who remembers Allah and cries whilst they are alone</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who fears Allah when a noble and beautiful woman invites him to a sinful act of relationship </span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who gives charity in Allah&#8217;s path secretly </span></li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">This is old speech from some of the People of Innovation (Ahlul Bid’ah). The famous Ahlul Hadeeth scholar, as-San’aanee has mentioned in his book <strong>Irshaadun-Nuqqad Ilaa-Ijtihaad</strong> from some of the People of Innovation who said “You forbid from blind following and yet you blind follow Yahyaa Ibn Ma’een, so if Yahyaa Ibn Ma’een says about a man, ‘He is trustworthy’, you’ll say, ‘Trustworthy’, and if al-Bukhaaree says, ‘This hadeeth is authentic’, you’ll say, ‘It is authentic’. So you are blind followers!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">So as-San’aanee answered this in his tremendous book <strong>Irshaadun-Nuqqad Ilaa-Ijtihaad</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">He said “Indeed this is not blind following, rather it is only the acceptance of the narration of the trustworthy, and Allah says in his noble book, <em>‘O you who believe! If a wicked person comes to you with news, verify it. Lest you should harm a people out of ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done.’ [Soorahtul-Hujuraat 49:6]</em>. So this ayah is understood that if a trustworthy person comes to us, we accept his information.”</p>

<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Sulayman Ibn Yasar: One Hadith</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[58] </strong><strong>From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Sulayman Ibn Yasar that Abdullah Ibn Abas (Radiullahu Anhu) said, &#8220;Al-Fadhl Ibn Abas was riding behind the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) when a woman from the Khathama tribe came to him to ask him for a fatwa. Al-Fadhl began to look at her, and she at him, and the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) turned Fadhl&#8217;s face away to the other side. The woman said, &#8216;Messenger of Allah, Allah made the Hajj obligatory when my father became a very old man, unable to stay firm on his riding-beast. Can I do Hajj for him?&#8217;, and he said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; This was during the farewell Hajj.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Sulayman Ibn Yasar) in Bukhari (no.6228)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/359 hadith no.815, book 20, chapter 30, hadith no.97) at-Tamhid (9/122) and he said, “This hadith is authentically established” al-Istidhkar: (no.765)   </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.1513) and Muslim (no.1334) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">1) There is a consensus (of the majority of the scholars) that a man can perform Hajj on behalf of a woman and a woman can perform Hajj on behalf of a man, only Hasan Ibn Saleh understands it to be disliked. (al-Ijma of Ibn al-Mundhir: (no.210) the night and day of a person performing Hajj (pg.90))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2) Some scholars have used this hadith as a proof that it is not obligatory and compulsory for a woman to cover (veil, hide) her face from non-mahram men whilst she is in the state of Ihram, however it is more virtuous that a woman covers (veils) her face from a non-mahram man. Fatimah Bint Mundhir says that whilst we were in the state of Ihram, we would cover (veil, hide) our faces (from non-mahram men) and we had Asma (Radi Allahu Anha) the daughter of Abu Bakr as-Sidiq (Radi Allahu Anhu) with us. (al-Muwatta, Yahya’s narration (1/328) hadith (no.734) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">3) Two people (or more) can ride on a vehicle (or riding animal) if it has the strength to take the load.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">4) There is a consensus that if a person who has reached the age of maturity reaches Arafah on the day of Hajj with the intention of performing it, then that person would have performed Hajj Faridah, even if that person was poor or reached Makah for any reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">5) The only person that can perform Hajj on behalf of the dead person is the one who has themselves performed Hajj Faridah, just as it is established from the Shibrmah hadith. See al-Mu’jam as-Saghir of at-Tabarani ((1/226) and its chain is [Hasan] good)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">6) Seeking forgiveness from Allah the Most High should be done all the time because no matter how much a person is righteous, it is possible for them to make mistakes and errors.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">7) It is necessary for the person who is ruling (or has authority) to command the good and prohibit the bad.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[57] From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Abu Bakr Ibn Abd ar-Rahman Ibn al-Harith Ibn Hisham from Abu Mas’ud al-Ansari that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) forbade the sale price of a dog, the earnings of a prostitute and the earnings of a fortune teller.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Abu Bakr Ibn Abdurahman Ibn al-Harith Ibn Hisham) in Humaydi (with my verification: (no.451))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 2/656 hadith no.1400, book 31, chapter 29, hadith no.68) at-Tamhid (8/397) al-Istidhkar: (no.1321)  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.2237) and Muslim (no.1567) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) This hadith is an excellent refutation against those people who say that the selling of a dog is allowed!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2) There is a consensus that the earnings of a prostitute and earnings of a fortune teller are prohibited. (at-Tamhid (8/398))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">3) The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, “The price of a dog is evil, the earning of a prostitute is evil and the earning of a cupper is evil.” (Sahih Muslim: (41/1568)[no.4012]) The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, “The price paid for a dog is not lawful” (Sunan Abu Dawud: (no.3484) and its chain is [Hasan] good) It has come in a hadith that if someone comes to take the earnings for a dog then his hands should be filled with mud (soil). (Sunan Abu Dawud: (no.3484) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">4) The narrations in which it has been declared that selling some dogs is allowed are all [Daif] weak and rejected. For example:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1. “From Jabir that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) forbade the price of cats and dogs, except hunting dogs.” (Sunan an-Nasa’i (7/191) hadith (no.4300) and he said: it is not [Sahih] authentic, (7/309) hadith (no.4672) and he said: this is [Munkar] rejected) This narration is [Daif] weak because of the [An] of Abu Zubayr Muhammad Ibn Mutris. Abu Zubayr was a famous mudallis. (al-Fath ul-Mubin fi Tahqiq Tabaqat al-Mudalisin (pg.61, 62) number (101/3))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2. “From Abu Hurayrah that (the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam)) forbade from the earnings of a prostitute, stallions, cats and dogs except hunting dogs.” (as-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi (6/6)) This narration is weak because of two reasons: 1) the reliability of Muhammad Ibn Yahya Ibn Malik adh-Dhabi is not known. 2) Hamad Ibn Salamah and Qays Ibn Sa’d are both reliable however the narrations of Hamad from Qays are [Daif] weak. Al-Bayhaqi said, “And there is inspection (further examination, looking into, investigation, scrutinizing) (needed) in the narrations of Hamad from Qays” (also (6/6)) This narration which contains Hamad Ibn Salamah from Qays (in the chain) is present in Sahih Ibn Hiban however it does not contain the permission to sell a dog, rather it is written that, “</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">(al-Ihsan (7/217) hadith (no.4920)) Jabir Ibn Abdullah al-Ansari (Radi Allahu Anhu) was asked about the charging (buying and selling) of dogs and cats he said, “The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) has severely prohibited it.”(Sahih Muslim: (42/1569)[no.4015])</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">It is known from this that even Jabir (Radi Allahu Anhu) understood that the charging (buying and selling) of dogs and cats is not allowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">5) In Sunan Daraqutni there are some narrations ((3/72, 73) hadith (no.3045, no.3046, no.3047) whereby the permissibility of selling some dogs is known however all these narrations are [Daif] weak and rejected and Imam Daraqutni has himself declared some of the narrators to be [Daif] weak. The grading and verification of the additional narrations that the people of blind following present are below:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">“Abu Hanifa from al-Haytham from Ikrimah from Ibn Abaas he said that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) permitted in the sale price of the hunting dog” (Musnad Abu Hanifa al-Haskafi’s narration (pg.169), urdu translation (pg.319), Jami’ul Masanid of al-Khwarizmi (2/10,11)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">One of Musnad al-Haskafi’s (died 650 hijri) previous narrator was Abu Muhammad Abdullah Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ya’qub al-Harithi (urdu translation (pg.24) Musnad al-Haskafi (pg.27))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">According to the noble muhadithin, Abdullah Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ya’qub al-Harithi is severely criticised. Abu Zur’ah Ahmad Ibn al-Husayn ar-Raazi said, “[Daif] weak” (Su’alat Hamzah Ibn Yusuf as-Sahmi (no.318))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abu Ahmad al-Hafidh and Haakim Nayshapuri said, “He was a teacher, he used to make hadith (up)” (Kitab al-Qira’at Khalful Imam of al-Bayhaqi (pg.178) hadith (no.388))</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Meaning this person was a complete teacher (talented) in fabricating hadith. Khatib Baghdadi, Khalili, Ibn Jawzi, Hafidh Dhahabi etc. have criticised him. (Tarikh Baghdad (10/126) (check what taa means) (no.5262), al-Irshad of al-Khalili, (3/972) taa (no.899), kitab adh-Dhu’afa Wal Matrukin of Ibn al-Jawzi (2/141), Diwan adh-Dhu’afa of adh-Dhahabi (2/63) taa (no.2297))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Also see Mizan al-I’tidal (2/496) and Lisan al-Mizan (3/348, 349) </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">His reliability is not established from any credible muhadith. </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">An overview of the chains of narration from Jam’ul Masanid of al-Khwarizmi is below:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1. Khwarizmi himself is not trustworthy and has an unknown reliability.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">2. Abu Muhammad al-Bukhari al-Harithi is a liar. As mentioned previously.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">3. Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Sa’id Urf Ibn Aqdah according to the majority of the muhadithin is a criticised narrator. Despite Imam Daraqutni praising him he said that he was a corrupt person meaning a rafidhi. (Tarikh Baghdad (5/22) taa (no.2365) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic) and said he used to say (spread) many [Munkar] rejected narrations. (Also and its chain is [Sahih] authentic) Abu Umar Muhammad Ibn al-Abas Ibn Muhammad Ibn Zakariya al-Baghdadi said that this person listed (wrote) criticisms about the noble companions meaning Abu Bakr and Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) in Jami’ Baratha therefore (because of this) I have abandoned his hadith. (Su’alat Hamzah as-Sahmi: (no.166) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">He (Ibn Uqdah) was also a robber, he stole books from Uthman Ibn Sa’id al-Muris son’s house. (al-Kamil fee adh-Dhu’afa of Ibn A’di (1/209) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic, Muhammad Ibn al-Husayn Ibn Mukram al-Baghdadi is reliable and Daraqutni declared him to be reliable etc.)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">It is known from this that Ibn Uqdah was a robber, unrighteous and a rafidhi.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">4. Ahmad Ibn Abdullah Ibn Muhammad al-Kindi al-Jilaj spread [Munkar] rejected hadiths on behalf of Imam Abu Hanifa. (al-Kamil of Ibn Adi (1/197)) </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Imam Abu Hanifa is not in need of these type of [Munkar] rejected hadiths. Wal Hamdullilah.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Hafidh Abdul Haq Ishbili declared this narration of Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi about the dog, to be a false hadith. (al-Ahkam al-Wasiti (3/249,248) Lisan al-Mizan (1/199))</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">5. The Imam of Asma ar-Rijal Yahya Ibn Ma’in said about Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan Ibn Farqad ash-Shaybani, “He is nothing” (Tarikh Ibn Ma’in: (no.1770))</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Imam Ibn Ma’in also said, “Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani is a jahmi liar.” (Kitab adh-Dhu’afa of al-Uqayli (4/52) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">In the second chain both Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani are criticised and al-Hasan Ibn al-Husayn al-Intaki is unknown. In the third chain there is Ibn Uqdah the robber, Abdullah Ibn Muhammad al-Bukhari the liar and both Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani who have been criticised. In the fourth chain there is Husayn Ibn Muhammad Ibn Khusro al-Bakhli, al-Husayn Ibn al-Husayn Intaki the unknown, Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani who have been criticised. In the fifth chain there is Ibn Khusro, Husayn Ibn Husyan, Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan. In the sixth and last chain there is Ibn Khusro the Mu’tazali who is criticised. See Lizan al-Mizan (2/312) and Sir A’lam an-Nubala (19/592) Qadhi Abu Nasr Ibn Ishkab and Abdullah Ibn Tahir are unknown, and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani is criticised. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Summarised verification: This narration is false and rejected and it is not established from Imam Abu Hanifa. It is known from this that the narrations which show the permissibility for selling some types of dogs are all [Daif] weak and rejected. </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Some people have said that selling a dog is allowed in contrast to a dog’s price being prohibited and evil. See al-Hidayah of al-Mirghinani (2/101, and the words for it, (3/79)) al-Quduri ((pg.74) before chapter as-Sarf) Fath ul-Qadir of Ibn Hamam (6/345) Bida’i as-Sana’i (5/142) Kanzud Daqa’iq (pg.257) al-Bahr ur-Ra’iq (6/172) ad-Durul Mukhtar with Kashf ul-Astar (2/50) Radul Mukhtar al-Ma’ruf with Fatawa Shami (4/238, 239) Hashiyah (marginal notes) of Tahtawi ‘Ala (on) ad-Durul Mukhtar (3/127) Kitabul Fiqh ‘Ala al-Madhahib al-‘Arba’a (2/232) and al-Fiqh al-Islami Wa adilatah (4/446) etc., Rather some people have written that it is allowed to slaughter a dog and sell its meat. See Fatawa Alamghiri (3/115)!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">All these sayings are rejected because they are against the authentic ahadith.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Mulla Marghinani wrote, “Apart from (the meat of) humans and pigs, the meat and skin of those things which are not eaten become pure from slaughtering it.” (al-Hidayah (2/441) other manuscript (4/69)) </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">This fatwa is rejected because of it having no proof.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[56] </strong><strong>And from the same chain of narration from Ubaydillah Ibn Abdullaah  Ibn Utba Ibn Mas’ud from Um Qays Ibn Mihsan that she brought a baby boy of her’s who was not yet eating food to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) and he sat him in his arms and he urinated on his garment, so the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) called for some water and sprinkled over it but did not wash it. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab clarified hearing (this hadith from Ubaydullah Ibn Abdullah Ibn Utba Ibn Mas’ud) in Muslim (104/287)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [BUKHARI]</span></strong></p>
<p>Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/64 hadith no.137, book 2, chapter 30, hadith no.109) at-Tamhid (9/108) al-Istidhkar: (no.116)</p>
<p>Transmitted by Bukhari (no.223) from the hadith of Malik and narrated by Muslim (no.287) from the hadith of Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p>1) The hadith (where it says that) water should only be sprinkled over the area where the baby boy, who has not started to eat, has urinated and the area where the baby girl, who has not started to eat, has urinated should be washed is mutawatir. See Nadhmul Mutanathar (no.37)</p>
<p>2) The noble Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) also used to have affection, love and show compassionate behavior towards very small children (babies). Allah the Most High sent him as a mercy to all the worlds. (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam).</p>
<p>3) If an infant baby boy (who is currently suckling) urinates on someone’s clothes or body then it will not be necessary to wash the affected area, rather just sprinkling water over that area will be sufficient. See hadith (no.461) (of this book)</p>
<p>4) A’isha (Radi Allahu Anha) said about the one who is affected by the urine of a small baby boy: it should be sprinkled over. (Musanaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (1/119) hadith (no.1274), and its chain is authentic)</p>
<p>5) Um Qays’s name is Jazamah Bint Wahb Ibn Muhsin (Radi Allahu Anha)</p>
<p>6) There is a consensus that the urine of every person who eats is impure. (at-Tamhid (9/109))</p>
<p>7) Every Qiyas is rejected in comparison to the Quran and Sunnah</p>
<p>8) There is a marfu’ narration from Abus Samh (Radi Allahu Anhu) that the urine of a female should be washed and the urine of a male should be sprinkled over. (Sunan Abu Dawud: (no.376) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic, and Ibn Khuzaimah authenticated it: (no.283) and al-Hakim (1/166), and adh-Dhahabi) Ibn Abdul Bar declaring this hadith to be [Daif] weak is a mistake.</p>
