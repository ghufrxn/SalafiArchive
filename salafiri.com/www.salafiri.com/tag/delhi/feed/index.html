<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[1] </strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1250H-1326H </strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(1834c-1908c)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the early 2000’s we compiled short biographies of some of the scholars of the sub continent, we also mentioned they were summaries of detailed biographies which were delayed in being published for some reason or another. In additional to the fact that in recent years, unfortunately some imprudent ignorant people from Birmingham began to say our dawah was to the scholars of ‘India and Pakistan,’ despite the sheer ignorance of such people and being totally clueless and oblivious of the dawah of the scholars before, we thought it was time and most pertinent to share some of the biographies of these great luminaries of the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafi’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was the summarized biography which has been since amended and updated by this biography.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[Biography] – Allamah Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani [1326H]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">http://www.salafiri.com/biography-allamah-muhammad-bashir-Sahaswani-1326h/</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is Allamah Kabir Muhammad Bashir bin Hakim Muhammad Badr al-Din bin Sadr al-Din al-Faruqi al-Sahaswani. He is not in need of any introduction, he is the renowned Scholar, the <em>Muhaddith</em>, the jurist, the debater, the teacher, the <em>mufti</em>, the admonisher and speaker. <em>(Forty Scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65 and Hayat nazir p.173 both of Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whenever Sahaswan is mentioned Shaikh Muhammad Bashir is the first one who comes to mind. <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab bayna mu’idihah wa mu’aridahah fi shabbah al-qarihah al-hindiyyah p.63 of Shaikh Abul Mukarram bin Abdul al-Jalil)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Family Roots and Background</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His lineage traces back to Umar ibn al-Khattab (RadhiAllahu Anhu). His grandfather was a resident of Thanesar which is in western Punjab, which he left and settled in Sahaswan. He had studied with various scholars and was known to be upright and righteous. <em>(Dabistan hadith p.216 of Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father, Hakim Muhammad Badr al-Din Faruqi was a Doctor and resided in Lucknow due to his work in the early years of the Shaikh’s life and this is where he received his early education, under the guidance of his father. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250 of Shaikh Imam Khan Nawshahri, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.379-380 of Muhammad Qadi Aslam Sayf Fairuzpuri)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father was a renowned physician who had learnt and studied Medicine at the hands of the experts of the Day which included the likes of Shaikh Shah Rafi al-Din Muhaddith Dehlawi. He also studied Ibn Sina’s classical Medical magnum opus <em>‘al-Qanun.’ </em>The Shaikhs father would treat everyone ranging from poor to the elite and even received honorary titles from the ruler of Oudh. He also had knowledge and had studied the Islamic sciences. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dabistan hadith p.216, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237 oh Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi, Forty Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith p.65)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father died in approximately 1260H/1844c and at the time Shaikh Muhammad Bashir was approximately 10 years old. Thereafter he returned to his native area of Sahsawan with his mother.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Birth of the Allamah Kabir</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani was born in approximately 1250H/1834c in Sahsawan which is in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Sahaswan is an old city with rich history. Sahsawan had always been a city of learning and Islamic sciences and a great number of scholars hailed from there. Likewise, and similarly a large number of Ahl al-Hadith scholars used to live in Sahaswan <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.379-380, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237, Forty Scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The historians and biographers have differed with regards to his exact date of birth. Shaikh Idris Nigrami mentions his birth to have been in 1240H in <em>‘Tazkirrah Ulama Hal’</em> where as Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hassani mentions 1254H in his <em>‘Nuzhat al-Khawatir.’</em> Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions that he was born approximately in the middle of the century and he was no more 8-9 years old when his father died. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:437)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abul Muakkaram mentions his birth day to be 1245H <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous Ahl al-Hadith historian, Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti mentions his date of birth as 1252H (1836-1837c) <em>(Dabistan hadith p.217)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The biographers have generally accepted his birth to have been around the years 1250H-1251H based on the statement of the Shaikhs student.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some Ahl al-Hadith historians and researchers have mentioned another Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani who died in 1321H who authored <em>‘Tabsirah al-naqid,’ </em>we were unable to find anything on this Shaikh and perhaps it is a mistake in the citation of the name and also the potential difficulty in reading the hand writing and script from books of that era. <em>(Was Islam Spread in the Subcontinent due to the efforts of the Sufiyyah, p.154 of Shaikh Ghazi Uzair)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani, who spend a lot of time under the tutelage of Shaikh Sahaswani authored a book on the biographies of the scholars of Sahaswan titled, <em>‘al-Yaqut al-marjan fi zikr ulama Sahaswan.’</em> Which is often referred to as ‘<em>Hayat al-ulama’ </em>and we will also refer to it with the same name here on in.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Pursuit of Knowledge</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Early Days in Sahaswan and Lucknow</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh began his studies with his father who had himself studied in Delhi and thus spent time with notable luminaries of the era. After returning to Sahaswan he began to study under Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan for approximately 10 years or so. Then in 1273H/1856c, just after the period of mutiny was subsiding he travelled to Lucknow and studied with the Scholars of Farangi Mahal from the likes of Shaikh Hidayahtullah Khan Rampuri, Shaikh Wajid Ali Banarasi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also studied with his paternal cousin, Shaikh Nur al-Hasan Sahaswani whilst in Matharah. He studied the Islamic sciences of tafsir, hadith, fiqh and usul <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.217, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Studies with Shaikh Muhaddith Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After Lucknow the Shaikh travelled to Delhi to study with Allamah Imam Sayyid Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, he studied Hadith, Fiqh and Tafsir with him and also obtained chains for ahadith from him Ie ijazat. He studied the two Sahihs and the four sunans. He also obtained (isnad) chains of hadith from Allamah Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin Ansari al-Yamani who was the Qadi of Bhopal. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Dabistan hadith p.217, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237-238, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Teachers from the Najd</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Shaikh travelled to the Hijaz and Najd to perform Hajj he studied with the likes of Shaikh Ahmad bin Ibrahim bin Isa al-Sharqi al-Najdi (d.1329H) and Shaikh Muhammad bin Abd al-Rahman Saharanpuri who migrated to Makkah and respectively attained ijazahs in hadith. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Transformation</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was upon the way of taqlid in his early years until his studies and the constant diligent nurturing of his first teacher, Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan Sahaswani who instilled the love and admiration of the Quran and Sunnah. Thereafter the Shaikh abandoned taqlid and held firmly onto the Kitab and Sunnah and the manhaj of the Salaf. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90-91, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani said when Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani studied the books of Ulum Aqliyyah, Mantiq, philosophy, Fiqh and Usul he leaned towards taqlid and the hanafi madhab and would issue legal edicts based on it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, when he sat in the lessons of Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan and benefitted from his manhaj, Shaikh Sahaswani’s inclination for research grew stronger, leading him to follow the Quran and Sunnah, he would refer to it in every issue. He adopted the manhaj of Amal bil-Hadith and believed it was obligatory to abandon the taqlid of specific people and opinions. <em>(Hayah al-ulama p.91, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Spreading the Quran and Sunnah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani was essentially a teacher and spent all of his life learning and teaching.  Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il al-Salafi also comes to this conclusion in his introduction to Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi’s <em>‘Ma’yar ul-haq,’he </em> categorises the Shaikhs students into, writers, debaters, teachers and so on where he says Shaikh Sahaswani was more of a teacher and educationalist. <em>(Introduction to Ma’yar ul-haq</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the beginning he spent a year teaching in Bangladesh and then another year in Bihar. This was followed by 15 years of teaching as a professor in Akbarabad, Agra in a college. This is what he would do in the day and then in the evening he would teach Quran and Hadith and conduct lessons at his house. There would be a constant flow of students to his gatherings of learnings during the day and the evening, the students would benefit greatly from his knowledge. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Time in Bhopal </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During this era Shaikh Allamah Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan was active in Bhopal due to his family. At the request of Allamah Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan in 1295H/1878ce Shaikh Sahaswani was appointed as a teacher in Madrassah Shah Jahaniyyah in Bhopal after leaving Agra and he remained there for sometime. Shaikh Sahaswani was given great respect and a high position in the teaching circles and was essentially made the head of all the learning faculties. <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst in Bhopal the Shaikh would deliver lectures and sermons and the Shaikh was such a prolific speaker and orator, most of the gathering would cry due to the fear of Allah due to the Shaikh reminding them of the affairs of the Din and Dunya. He would also deliver lectures in the residence of the leaders, who would also cry to the power of his admonitions. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:251, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani had been in Bhopal for approximately 12 years. In these 12 years both scholars worked together. Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan would write books and Shaikh Sahaswani would answer all the question that were presented and in this was why Shaikh Sahaswani was known as the Mufti. At the same time Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin Ansari al-Yamani was also in Bhopal and he was the Qadi. Bhopal flourished with Ilm and became a powerful learning centre for the Salafi’s and Ahl al-Hadith. <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.376-380, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Later around 1307H/1890c after the death of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan, the atmosphere of Bhopal was changing and Shaikh Sahaswani thought it was time to move on to Delhi. The family of Shaikh Siddiq Hasan Khan were unhappy with his decision due to the great benefit and knowledge he would propagate to the people and therefore he remained in Bhopal for longer. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The historians and biographers differ how long Shaikh Sahaswani’s stayed in Bhopal with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hassani saying 30 years and Shaikh Imam Khan Nawshahri saying 24 years. It seems more appropriate that he stayed in Bhopal for approximately 24 years because this is in line with other information. Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti mentions 25 years.  After Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan’s death Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani remained in Bhopal after another 12 years making his total time in Bhopal as 24 years. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252-253, Dabistan hadith p.220, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During this period Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan and Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi had an exchange of a book debate, where they both wrote books against one another. Shaikh Lucknowi alleged that Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani was the actual one writing the books under Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan’s name. Shaikh Sahaswani crushed this false allegation and clarified he was not the one writing the books. Shaikh Lucknowi later accepted this. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.93, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:251, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the wife of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan died in 1319H/1901c, the situation of Bhopal had changed with the new authority having a different approach to the Islamic sciences. It was at this time Shaikh Sahaswani thought it was time to move on. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.94, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Time in Delhi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh left Bhopal in approximately 1319H and spent approximately 6-7 years in Delhi where he taught Tafsir and Hadith, he also published some books and engaged in answering the general questions of the people ie Ifta. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.381)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh continued to teach in the place of his teacher, Shaikh Muhaddith Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi after his death in Delhi and he remained in this position until he died. Allamah Sahaswani was an exceptional orator, he gave circles in explanation of the Quran for years in Delhi and many scholars of that time would sit in his lessons.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>An Example of His Exemplary Character and Being Firm Upon Islam</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh only had a one son who was born in 1288H whose name was Nazir Hussain upon the name of his teacher Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi.  The Shaikh concentrated on the well being and nurtured his son upon the Quran and Sunnah and was fervently diligent in educating and teaching him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Eventually the Shaikh married his son off at the tender age of 17. However, after just 6 months the Shaikhs son died in 1305H. This was a very difficult and testing time for the Shaikh, losing an only son at such a young age and even that after 6 months of marriage. The Shaikh remained patience and continued his teaching and worship of Allah. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255-256)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh also set a precedent in his era which was unheard of and in fact was frowned upon due to the Hindu culture and practices that were prevalent in society at the time which did not bother the Shaikh nor did he care. The Shaikh arranged another marriage for his daughter in law with his own expense. Even during this era, the Muslims were affected by the hindu culture and they would think it was a bad and disliked practice for the woman to get married again. In this way the Shaikh put into practice what he had learnt and studied with his teachers.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What the Scholars Said About Him</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Bashir was well known for his knowledge and deep insight into the affairs of the Quran and Sunnah and numerous scholars testified to this including his teachers, from there were the likes of,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi praised Shaikh Sahaswani for his knowledge of the Quran and asks the family of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan to instruct Shaikh Sahaswani to start writing a tafsir of the Quran as others will not be as capable as him. <em>(Makatib naziriyyah p.159)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hussian bin Muhsin Yamani wrote in a letter to Shaikh Shams al-Haq A’zimabadi,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“May Allah have mercy on our brother al-Allamah Muhammad Bashir who is an Alim and Muhaqqiq who holds onto the Quran and Sunnah.”</em> <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams al-Haq A’zimabadi considered Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani from amongst the foremost students of Shaikh Sayyid Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi. <em>(Ghayah al-maqsud fi hal sunan abi dawud 1:59)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allamah, the Shaikh was the epitome of knowledge and the pride of the Khalaf to the Salaf in his virtue and good qualities. He was a mujaddid of the Din in the late era, the Imam of the time and a mujtahid mutlaq.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Sahaswan in an area which has produced scholars for years and if a scholar did emerge from there, it would not be unusual or something unheard of. However, a scholar of his caliber being born in the 13/14<sup>th</sup> century gave his era radiance and his area of Sahaswan such recognition that it will be forever remembered.” (Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Rashid Rida said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was the Shaikh, Muhammad Bashir al-Sahaswani, May Allah have mercy on him, he was from the powerful Scholars of India and from the major scholars of hadith, he encompassed the various science of the Shari’ah and other than it, coupled with actions based upon knowledge, taqwa and righteousness.”</em> <em>(Muqaddimah siyanah al-insan p.14)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hassani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Shaikh al-Fazil al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Muhammad Bashir al-Umari al-Sahaswani, a famous and well know scholar of India. … he was from the major scholars. He had piety and taqwa, he was righteous and upright. He was a genius with lofty manners and he had complete mastery over Usul al-Fiqh.”</em> <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:437-438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions great praise for him, his excellent and loft qualities he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I benefitted from the Shaikh with regards to knowledge of the texts and interpretation whilst he was in Agra and Bhopal. A whole group of students in fact the whole city of Dehli would benefit from his knowledge as we would deliver lessons and lectures on various sciences and disciplines. He would deliver a lesson every day for two hours after Fajr on the explanation of the Quran and Haidth and the people would travel far and wide to come to listen to him.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi goes onto say he would would teach the students the Quran and Hadith directly and he would answer questions on various in great depth and research like a mujtahid. He would also deliver lessons after jumu’ah on the Quran and Hadith in Masjid Qadi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was only interested and fervently followed the Quran and Sunnah and he was only interested in the victory of the truth. He set the precedence of knowledge in Bhopal and in fact in the whole of India and thereby established his rank and status in terms of his knowledge and powerful deductions of ijtihad. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Badi al-Din Shah al-Rashidi al-Sindi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Shaikh of the Mashaykh. The one and only, The Muhaddith of his time, the embodiment of taqwa, the revered scholar, the one who acted upon Islam completely, Shaikh, the well known Muhammad Bashir bin Badr al-Din Sahaswani he died in 1306H (this is a typo in the book it should be 1326H) , he authored ‘Siyanah al-Insan an waswasah al-shaikh dahlan’ which caused devastation in the circles of Ahl al-Bid’ah, he also wrote 3 treatises on the visitation of the Prophets (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) grave, ‘al-Qawl al-muhkam, al-Qawl al-mansur and al-Sa’i al-mashkur (Itmam al-hujjah)’(Muqaddimah hidayah al-mustafid p.96-97) </em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Shaikhs as a Debator</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Book Debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Shaikh Sahaswani went to the Hijaz to perform Hajj he saw some of the practices of the people in their veneration of the Prophets grave and saying the visiting of the grave was pillar of Hajj. Upon his return to India he authored a book on the subject titled, <em>‘al-Qawl al-muhaqqiq al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em> Some authors have cited the book as, ‘<em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani cites the book as <em>‘al-Qawl al-muhaqqiq al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em> This is essentially a primary source as it comes directly from the Shaikhs students. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.91</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri cites the name as <em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhaqqiq al-Muhkam…</em>’ <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Indian Shaikh and researcher Shaikh Uzair Shams perhaps also relied on the latter two Mashaikh and thus also mentions the name of the book as <em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhaqqiq al-Muhkam…</em>’ Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti also mentions the book with the same name. <em>(Dabistan hadith p.219)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This led to a book debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hanafi Lucknowi of Farangi Mahalli who was of the fervent opinion of the obligation and necessity to visit the Prophets grave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi wrote a reply titled <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mubram Fi Radd al-Qawl al-Muhkam’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani wrote a counter replied titled, <em>‘al-Qawl al-Mansur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi wrote his reply to the counter reply titled, <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur Fi Radd al-Qawl al-Mansur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Lucknowi in <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur’ </em>failed to answer the the main pivotal points and in return relied heavily on Subki’s arguments and <em>‘Shifa al-Siqam.’</em> Shaikh Sahaswani knew of Hafiz Ibn Abdul Hadi’s answer to al-Subki, ie <em>‘al-Sarim al-Munki’ </em>however Shaikh Sahaswani did not have the book. After a lengthy and exhausting search the Shaikh found the book wrote a follow up titled, <em>‘Itmam al-Hujjah Ala Man Awjab al-Ziyarah Mithal al-Hujjah al-Ma’ruf al-Madhab al-Ma’thur Fi Ziyarah Sayyid al-Qabur’ </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi replied with <em>‘al-Sai’i al-Mashkur Fi Radd al-Madhab al-Ma’thur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The latters reply was all regurgitation and repetition of the same arguments. Shaikh Lucknowi relied heavily on Subki’s <em>‘Shifa al-Siqam’</em> as mentioned and on the writings of Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Haithami. Shaikh Lucknowi overlooked the counter replies and arguments and thus in this regard the book <em>‘Itmam al-Hujjah’</em> remains by far the most comprehensive reply to all of the Sufi arguments even today. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani showed the contradictions, inconsistencies and irregularities from the own words of Shaikh Lucknowi from his books and then showed Shaikh Lucknowi’s contradictions from his other books. The discussions ranged from Usul al-Hadith, Usul al-Fiqh and rijal. Shaikh Sahaswani would first quote Shaikh Lucknowi from his book <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur’</em> and then answer all of his arguments in a writing style showing a written debate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani also wrote the reply to Shaikh Lucknowi’s <em>‘Madhab al-Ma’thur’</em> but it was never published and also due to the fact that Shaikh Sahaswani felt the arguments were just irrelevant repetitions and that he had already answered the claims anyway and also penned answers in his other book <em>‘Siyanah al-Insan’</em> as his student Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92, </em><em>Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:254)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both Scholars had mutual respect for each other and did not leave the realms of the Quran and Sunnah whilst addressing each other and the detailed issues.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Debate with the Mulhid Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani was an excellent debater and was very sharp Alhamdulillah. When the disbeliever Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani Hanafi challenged Allamah Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi for a debate, however as Allamah Nazir Hussain was very busy and also frail due to age. All of his students gathered to debate and he chose and Allamah Sahaswani to have a written debate with Mirza Qadiyani Hanafi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani came to Delhi around 1312-1313H and had issued a poster challenging for a debate as Shaikh al-Allamah Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi was one of the first scholars in the whole world to declare him to be a disbeliever. In those days sometimes they would have a written debate someone would be challenged and then they would respond to each other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The responses would usually be sent to each other via messengers depending on the place of residence. What was interesting is that Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani in order to show his bold nature in an attempt to fool the people of India thought he would come to Delhi as in go to the lions den in popular proverbs.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani came from Bhopal for the debate and began the written debate with Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani. One of the treacherous tricks of Mirza Qadiyani was when the other party would accept his challenge for a debate, he would digress and diverge into the conditions of the debate so that he would have an option to runaway from the debate. The Sufis and Barelwis of today also do the same, big mouths with little actions. Anyhow, Shaikh Sahaswani was an erudite Scholar and knew of such tricks so he said at the very beginning I agree with all of your conditions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence the debate took place which was concerning the living of the Messiah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mirza Qayani presented the ayah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>when Allah said, &#8220;O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve (Surah Ale Imran:56)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani recited</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>And there is none from the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe (in Jesus) before his death. (Surah al-Nisa:159)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This obliterated Mirza Ghulam Qadiyanis points which left him to resort to red herrings and illogical and stupid distortions and manipulation. It is said Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani tried to make different excuses to leave he was unable to answer and counteract the evidence of Allamah Sahaswan, he said he had to go to the train station to pick up his father in law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate continued for a period of 6 days and after the disgraceful fleeing of Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani, Shaikh Sahaswani remained in Delhi for another 2 days and then returned to Bhopal and Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani Hanafi never set foot in Delhi again. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.94-95, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.382, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate took place approximately around in either 1309H or 1312-1313H, showing he was from amongst the first people to refute and rebut the fallacious claims of the Mulhid Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani. This was the position of the Ahl al-Hadith at the very onset and then years later the Hanafi quarters followed, perhaps because he was one of their own. The book was published around 1313H titled <em>‘</em><em>al-Haq as-sarih fi hayat al-masih.’</em> <em>Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63-64)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ahl al-Hadith historians and biographers have differed as to when the debate took place, some have said it took place in 1309H whilst others seem to think it was later in 1312H-1313H <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi, the famous Ahl al-Hadith historian and biographer said he read the book in Shaikh Abdul Majid Seharwardi’s library and that it was printed by Matba’a Ansari in Delhi in 1309H and it was 136 pages. <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66-67)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is possible and plausible, the actual written debate took place in 1309H and the book was later published in 1312-1313H.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Well Known Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh had a huge number of students due to his constant teaching in the various places he taught and travelled to and numerating all of them would be impossible however, some of them were major scholars of Hadith in their own right who themselves produced many other scholars. Some of the students include,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ahmadullah Muhaddith Partabghadhi and Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Sa’id Sharf al-Din Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il Ansari Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Iqtidar Ahmad Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Amir Ahmad Sehswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mazhar Ali Sahaswani (the Shaikhs younger brother)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Wahhab Nabina Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid E’jaz Mu’jiz Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Sattar Umrpuri (The father of Shaikh Abdul Ghaffar Hasan Rehmani)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdur Rahman Bastawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Uthman Aligharhi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Taqi Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdus Samad Bastawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mubarak Ali Akbarabadi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ma’sum Ali Akbarabadi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And manu more</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Sahaswani an an Author</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was a prolific writer as we have already mentioned in his book debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi. The Shaikh was essentially a teacher however he did write some books and what outstanding and monumental books they were. From them we have the revolutionary book which caused havoc amongst the Sufi’s, making them feel things besides their usual wajd (Sufi dances) and esoteric trances!!! </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Siyanah al-insan an waswasah al-shaikh </strong><strong>dahlan &#8211; </strong><strong><em>Protecting The Human From The Satanic Whisperings of Shaikh Dahlan.</em></strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Shaikh Sahaswani went to Hijaz to perform Hajj he had a debate on Tawhid with the Ash’arite and Shafi Mufti Shaikh Ahmad bin Zaini Dahlan. The later also authored <em>‘</em><em>Durar al-saniyyah fi radd ala al-wahhabiyyah.’ </em>Shaikh Sahaswani upon his return to India authored his book answering all of the allegations and distortions of Dahlan as well as his slanderous aspersions against Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. The book is in debate format and contains some very detailed discussions. It was first printed in 1324H/1906c has been printed many times. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92-93, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.64, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.68)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is very important to understand is that after the debate with Shaikh Dahlan, Shaikh Sahaswani returned to India and Shaikh Dahlan also authored his <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah.’</em> Some people may argue Shaikh Sahaswani’s book was only a summary of the verbal debate they had in Makkh and that <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> is not an answer to <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah.’</em> It is very evident that Shaikh Sahaswani’s book more than likely was authored after he looked a <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah’</em> because he answers it in <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> and also the fact that it was published just two years before his death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another clear evidence which supports the aforementioned point is that Shaikh Ahmad Zaini Dahlan died in 1304H, way before Shaikh Sahaswani died and therefore it naturally leads to the conclusion that Shaikh Dahlans book <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah’ </em>was authored at least before 1304H </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Rashid Rida in his introduction to the book said,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In summary it can be said about this book, not only is it a refutation of Shaikh Dahlan or the jurists who have been cited for example Shaikh Taqi al-Din al-Subki and Shaikh Ahmad bin Hajr al-Haithami al-Makki but rather it is also a refutation of all of the grave worshippers and innovators of our time and those to come.”</em> <em>(Muqaddimah siyanah al-insan p.17, cf. </em><em>Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.65-66)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> is still used and it is of great benefit due to its depth and precision in answering the claims and distortions of the innovator grave worshippers. To add the book to date has not been answered!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad bin Zaini Dahlan had other issues, one was his position on the british colonialists, his edict can be read here</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>The Wahabis – Zainee Dahlans Real Opinion &amp; The British</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">also this is a refutation of Subki and Dahlan from the <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em></span></p>

</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is on the obligation of reciting fatihah behind the Imam and again it is a very detailed book answering the points of those who say otherwise. The Shaikh would deliver a lesson everyday after Fajr on this issue for approximately 3 months. The well known hanafi scholars of Delhi would be in attendance and would note every word. The Shaikhs student Shaikh Ahmadullah Dehlawi also noted every word and later published it as a book with this title. This book was published 1327H/1909c <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252-253, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.381, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.68)</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is on the issue of the permissibility of sacrificing on Eid al-Adha until the end of the month, this was an odd opinion of the Shaikh in which he opposed the people of knowledge. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The contentions that is well known amongst Ahl al-Sunnah is whether it can be done for 4 days.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh initially published a general poster in Bhopal on this issue after the death of Shaikh Nawab siddiq Hasan Khan. This was one such view which Shaikh Sahaswani erred on and his teacher Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin al-Yamani wrote a treatise answering Shaikh Sahaswani’s points as did another prominent student of Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, none other that the Imam of Hadith and Rijal in his own right, Shaikh al-Allamah Abul Mukarim Muhammad Ali Mu’i titled <em>‘Umdah al-tahqiq fi ithbat al-dhihayah ila akhir ayam al-tashriq’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani mentions Shaikh Sahaswani wrote a book collecting the evidences as well as his research into a book, however it was never published in reply to some of the points raised by the aforementioned scholars. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.95) </em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi mentions this as one of the works of Shaikh Sahaswani, other biographers have not mentioned this. <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said Shaikh Sahaswani wrote many books, some which were lost and other unprinted. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahsawani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani, who was also his student during his time in Bhopal and Delhi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He wrote many other treatises on the affairs of the Din which were attributed to some of his students.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Death</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh felt ill whilst in Delhi and passed away on the 29<sup>th</sup> of Jumada al-Ula/ Thani 1326H / 29<sup>th</sup> June 1908c at the age of 74. He was buried next to his teacher Shaikh Allamah Sayyid Nazir Hussain, in the Shaidipura graveyard. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hassani has yet made another mistake in his biographical entry for Shaikh Sahaswani where he says that he died in 1323H. <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Salafis and Ahl al-Hadith lost a great scholar who truly answered the grave worshipping innovators. It is therefore without a doubt that Shaikh Sahaswani is considered and will be known as one of the scholars who subdued and kept them at bay.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was from the scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith who they all respected. It is a shame just as the learning places and institutions were deprived of someone to replace the scholars, it was the same case with Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani, that there has been no one like him from Sahaswan or from the general Ahl al-Hadith”</em> <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah forgive him and shower him with her mercy, Amin</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Shaikh Shah Waliullahs Dehlawi’s (1176H) Inclination in Fiqh and his Hanafiyyah </strong></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>al-Allamah Shaikh Muhammad Ismaeel Salafi (1378H)</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaikh Shah Waliullah and those who were upon his way did not want to staunchly restrict themselves to any one school of thought in terms of their beliefs, principles and fiqh. They wanted to act upon the issues which were presented by scholars of hadith and the four madhabs without any restrictions or obligations. Although he apparently was a Hanafi [1] he preferred to give precedence to the positions of the scholars of hadith and the Shafi’s.</p>
<p>In current times the deobandis show great reverence and affiliation with Shaikh Shah Waliullah and his family however their actions, inclinations and thought processes are in total contradiction and in opposition to the thoughts and understanding of Shaikh Shah Waliullah, his family and his followers.</p>
<p>The Deoband (ie their school) of today is almost entirely indifferent from the Barelwis of today and any differences between them are merely polemics.</p>
<p>We will find from the following clarifications the extent of Shaikh Shah Waliullah digressive thinking with regards to his fiqh and the sheer restriction and staunchness of the deobandis. They cannot bear to hear anything negative about themselves whereas Shaikh Shah Waliullah did not tire and abstain from practising and acting upon the Shafi madhab.</p>
<h3><b>The Hadith of Qulatain</b></h3>
<p>There is huge difference of opinion between the Shafis and the Hanafis with regards to the purification of water and the Hadith of the Qulatain is at the forefront of this. The hanafis say the Hadith is mudhtarib (confused) and the Shafis understand it to be authentic. So Shaikh Shah Waliullah understood that the Hanafi and Maliki elders did not come across the ahadith or their understanding was erroneous.</p>
<p>He says, “The Hadith of Qulatain is authentic and has been transmitted via numerous routes.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/117).</p>
<p>Meaning the doubts and discussions that arose due to this Hadith pertaining to purification, Shaikh Shah Waliullah favoured and sided with the shafis and excused the hanafis and malikis on the basis that the Hadith was not widespread in earlier times.</p>
<h3><b>Reciting Fatihah Behind The Imam</b></h3>
<p>This disagreement between the hanafis and shafis, wether to recite fatihah behind the imam is famous and numerous treatises have been authored on this subject. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“The individual praying behind the imam, it is obligatory for him to listen and to remain silent (ie not to recite loudly). If the Imam recites loudly then he should recite between the pauses. If the imam is reciting quietly then he may recite as he wishes. However he should not recite the Fatihah loudly so that it contends and mixes with the recitation of the imam. The first way is what I prefer (ie reciting between the pauses) and this is how we reconcile the ahadith in this regard.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/7)</p>
<p>There is balance in Shaikh Shah Waliullahs statement as he does not prefer the staunchness from both parties (ie to either remain totally silent or to recite the Fatihah loudly and contend with the imam)</p>
<h3><b>Raf ul-Yadain and Witr</b></h3>
<p>Shaikh Shah Waliullah said whilst discussing raising of the hands whilst going into ruku and the witr prayer, he said,</p>
<p>“The truth according to me is that this sunnah is optional wether to pray one rakah witr or three and raising of the hands is better then not raising as their are numerous ahadith for raising of the hands and they are established. A person should not get hung up about and cause dissension for himself.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/8)</p>
<p>It is apparent during those times such acts caused animosity and hence his statement was an encouragement to both sides.</p>
<h3><b>Travelling to Visit Graves.</b></h3>
<p>It is common amongst the people to undertake long journeys to visit graves of holy people and their mausoleum. They would do this just as if they were going on Hajj. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“The truth according to me is that visiting (ie undertaking a journey) graves, a place of worship of a wali and mount Toor are prohibited to visit and they are equal in their prohibition.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/153)</p>
<p>The deobandis and barelwis who love visiting graves speak very fervently about his topic but Shaikh Shah Waliullah position is in concurrence with that of Shaikh ul-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and other Imams of Tawhid.</p>
<h3><b>Nullifiers of Wudu</b></h3>
<p>The jurists differ over what nullifies wudu and Shaikh Shah Waliullah’s position is,</p>
<p>“The Asal ie the fundamental reason that obligates wudu is what is expelled from the two private parts and everything other than this is returned to this principle.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/149)</p>
<h3><b>Witr</b></h3>
<p>There is difference of opinion concerning the witr. The Hanafi jurists say they are obligatory whereas the scholars of Hadith say they are Sunnah. Shaikh Shah Waliullah’s position is,</p>
<p>“The truth is that witr are Sunnah mu’akidah (to be performed with designation) and Ali, Ibn Umar and Ubadah as-Samit (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) expounded them to be Sunnah.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/13)</p>
<h3><b>Qunut</b></h3>
<p>The Hanafi jurists consider the Qunut in the witr prayer to be obligatory where as the Shafis consider the Qunut in the fajr prayer to be obligatory, Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“There is difference of opinion regarding the ahadith and also amongst the position of the companions and the successors about the Qunut in the fajr prayer, according to me reciting or not reciting the Qunut is optional except during a great calamity where a few words are to be said before the ruku which is what I prefer as the ahadith establish the dua against the tribe of ra’al and Dhakwan as was later abandoned. This is not a text that totally abrogates the Qunut however it must be remembered that the Qunut is Sunnah that is not to be continuous forever.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/9)</p>
<h3><b>Combining Prayers</b></h3>
<p>The jurists differ whether to combine the prayers due to a reason, the hanafis believe it is not permissible to combine the prayers at all, whether at the earlier time or the later time and Jam Suri (apparent combining) is not even really combining but a form of combining. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said there are essentially 3 times for prayer, Asr is extracted form Dhuhr and Isha from Maghrib thereby reducing the prayer time between the 2 prayers and reducing laziness from Dhikr, he said</p>
<p>“The one with the shariah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) combined both at the earlier and later time but he did not order for this to be practised regularly nor emphasised it, just as he did not emphasise on the delayed prayers.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/18)</p>
<h3><b>The Takbirs For Eid</b></h3>
<p>The Hanafi jurists the Ahlul Hadith jurists differ over the number of takbirs for the eid prayer and the method of the eid prayer. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“There are 7 takbirs in the first rakah before the recitation and 5 takbirs before the recitation (just as the people of Haramain do ie the Ahlul Hadith) however the practise of the Kufiyeen [2], (ie the hanafis) say there are 4 takbirs before the recitation just like the funeral prayer and 5 takbirs after the recitation in the second rakah, however the Sunnah and the practice of al-Harmain (ie the people of Makkah and Madinah) is given precedence.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/23)</p>
<h3><b>Amount of Water</b></h3>
<p>The Hanafi and Shafi jurists differ with regards the quantity of water (for purification). The later Hanafi jurists quantify it as 2 large quantities (Dardah) whereas the Shafis say 2 Qulatain. So if a water well becomes impure there is some strange and obtuse Qiyas in how to purify the well with large buckets. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“There is nothing in this discussion which is reliable or anything obligatory that should be acted upon.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/217)</p>
<p>Then he said,</p>
<p>“The scholars have long debated the amount of water in a well containing a dead animal and if the water is flowing, however nothing is reported from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in this regard.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/147)</p>
<p>There are numerous issues Shaikh Shah Waliullah has cited in his Hujatullah, Musfa and Muswa in which he has sided with the Shafi and Ahlul Hadith jurists, which clearly highlights that he was far from staunch bigotry and did not favour narrow mindedness (to remain within the madhab). We also find that the earlier Hanafi scholars in general were not as bigoted and staunch as they are today. This bigotry started in the 4th century and gained prominence right up to the 9th century.</p>
<p>The fundamental way in preventing and reprimanding innovations is to follow the way of the Salaf. Taqlid of the Imams also played a part preventing the spread of innovation however with this came the bigotry of the reverence of these individuals. Due the variant opinions of the companions and following the way of Salaf based on the greater benefit it is highly unlikely that bigotry would take hold.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Taken from Tehrik Azad Fikr (pg.74-80)</span></p>
<p>Translator notes</p>
<p><em>[1] Here Shaikh Salafi is referring Shaikh Shah Waliullah being a Hanafi based on the understanding of how the Hanafi scholars of the past were for example Imam Tahawi, Imam Ibn Abil Izz etcetera in that they were not staunch and bigoted. </em></p>
<p><em>[2] This is a another important clarification that if Shaikh Shah Waliullah was a Hanafi in the sense the current day hanafis understand Hanafiyyah and then he would not have said kufiyeen ie referring to the Hanafi scholars. It is also evident from the style of the language that he did not count himself from amongst the hanafis as they see it. It however cannot be denied that his main learning and understanding was the Hanafi madhab and this is what we believe. Yet, it is biased to label him Hanafi as the current day hanafis label themselves to be Hanafi as their is a stark difference and even this small article has demonstrated that.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Ma’ayar ul-Haq Fi Tanqid Tanwir ul-Haq</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh al-Kul al-Allamah Nazir Hussain Muhadith Dehlawi (1320H)</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Muqallid Excuse Of Not Being Able To Act On The Quran and Hadith</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence it is proven a scholar upon the way of Hadith (non muqallid) whilst making knowledge based deductions should not make Taqlid of a Mujtahid in the texts of an issue, even though the mujtahids statement is in accordance with the Hadith. Yet the people who prohibit us from acting upon ahadith and even though clear manifest truth does not concur with them, one of the lame excuses they put forth in their defence is that acting upon ahadith in current times is extremely difficult.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They say the Quran and Hadith is an ocean of knowledge without any shores and hence understanding and acting on them is the duty of a Mujtahid only (ie not the common people). They say it is not in their permit to understand the Quran and Hadith and even if they were to read and understand the literal translation, they would not know whether a particular Hadith was abrogated or not, what the actual meaning of a text is or if there were any conflicting ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we say we answer this excuse from two angles</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first angle is that the Quran and Hadith is not as difficult, such that no one other than a Mujtahid mutlaq can understand them. On the contrary it is indeed very easy and whoever knows arabic especially and particular the scholars, who will easily and compressively understand the intent and meaning of the Quran and Hadith as is the saying of Allah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And We have certainly made the Quran easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?” (Soorah al-Qamar:17)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His ayaat and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom – although they were before in clear error.” (Soorah al-Jumu’ah:2)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient.” (Soorah al-Baqarah:99)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So whoever says we do not understand the Quran and Hadith despite being a scholar will fall under the punishment mentioned in the aforementioned ayah just as Mawlana Muhammad Ismail Shahid (InshaAllah) has mentioned in the treatise ‘Taqwiyat ul-Iman’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ma’ayar ul-Haq Fi Tanqid Tanwir ul-Haq (pg.70-71)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Venerating the dead by preparing food and transferring the reward to the deceased on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 40<sup>th</sup> day is an innovation. There is no evidence or even trace of this in the first 3 generations, hence this is an innovation and the Muslims should warn against this. Allah said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى ٱلۡبِرِّ وَٱلتَّقۡوَىٰ‌ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى ٱلۡإِثۡمِ وَٱلۡعُدۡوَٲنِ‌ۚ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ‌ۖ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلۡعِقَابِ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">       But help ye one another unto righteousness and pious duty. Help not one another unto sin and transgression, but keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is severe in punishment. [al-Maidah:2]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The food should not be consumed as this is also a type of veneration although the food is in and of itself not haram. An evidence which alludes to venerating the deceased and preparing for them on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 40<sup>th</sup> and other days are innovations and impermissible in the Shari’ah are the following statement of the Prophet ﷺ which are clear evidences that veneration on set days are innovations: “Whoever does an action which we have not sanctioned will be rejected (Mardud)” [<i>Trans Note: Bukhārī [no.2697], Muslim [no.1718], Musnad Aḥmad [6:146].  </i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus based on this hadeeth all of the aforementioned actions are innovations and heresies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ also said “The worst of the affairs are the innovations and heresies” [Trans Note: Muslim [no.867], Musnad Aḥmad [14:126], Abū Dawūd [no.4608], Tirmidhī [no.2676] and Mishkāt [no.16] and <em>Bukhari 7277</em>] with slight differences in the wording.]   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We pray that Allah saves our Muslim brothers and sisters from innovations. Upon us is to convey and Allah knows best.</span></p>
