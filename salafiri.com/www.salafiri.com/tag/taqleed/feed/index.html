<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Summarised and Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibban and Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>A general point: What is taqlid?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Ibn Abdul Barr and Imam Ibn al-Qayyim quote Abu Abdullah b. Khawaz Mandad saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8216;Taqlid in the shariah is to turn to the saying of someone without proof and this is impermissible in the shariah and Ittiba is to take the saying with proof. <em>(I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> Imam Ibn Qayyim (2/178) and <em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm</em> of Ibn Abdul Barr (2/118).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Hanafi madhhab jurists have explained taqlid to mean,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">To act upon the saying of someone without any evidence or proof. (<em>Fawatih ar- Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/400).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it can be seen that those who perform taqlid will not be able to differentiate between the saying which is upon the truth and that which is upon falsehood. It can generally be seen from the definition of taqlid that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">✓ Taqlid is not knowledge but it is ignorance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Ghazzali writes, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“taqlid is to accept the saying of someone without any proof or evidence and this is not the way to attain knowledge of that which is from the usul (fundamental principles of the religion or the furu (those matters which are secondary). (<em>al-Mustasfa</em> (2/385).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">And it is written in <em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/402) that, taqlid is not the way for attaining certain knowledge. So know that that thing (taqlid) which does not lead to attaining knowledge cannot be called wajib (obligatory). Taqlid stops an individual from looking at the Quran and hadith as a proof and evidence. Never mind this being obligatory this cannot even be tolerated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Despite this some of the Hanafi scholars wrote,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The dalil (proof) for a muqallid is the saying of the mujtahid scholar, not his own thought or his scholars&#8217;. (<em>Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (p.5).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Therefore for the one performing taqlid the Quran and sunnah are no longer the proof and evidence and he is forever free from them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Some misconceptions cleared</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">To accept the witness of someone is not taqlid. The highly accepted book of the Hanafi fiqh titled <em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/400) states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“For the general lay person to turn to the mufti (scholar who gives a verdict) and for the judge to turn to the acceptable witness is <strong>not taqlid</strong>.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it is clearly proven to accept a verdict of the scholar of hadith is <strong>not taqlid</strong>.<strong> It is not taqlid</strong> to accept narrations from <em>Sahih Bukhari</em>. Why? Because there is <em>ijma</em> (unanimous agreement) of the ummah that it is the most authentic book after the book of Allah. And it is known that to turn to ijma is not taqlid. &#8216;So to turn to ijma is to turn to proof (not taqlid). (<em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-</em>Thabut 2/400)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is <strong>not taqlid</strong> to take a saying which is based upon revelation is <strong>not taqlid</strong>. (<em>Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (1/290).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">According to the Hanafi&#8217;s it is <strong>not</strong> permissible to perform taqlid of a <strong>Tabi’i</strong> (those of the second generations and many were students of the Companions). And the famous Hanafi jurisprudence book <em>Talwih</em> reports,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8216;So as for these narrations (the tabi&#8217;in) then taqlid will not be made of them. For they were men and we are men. (<em>Talwih</em> (2/17).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Some evidences on the prohibition of taqlid from the Quran.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> &#8216;Say (O Muhammad) to your folk follow what has been revealed down unto you from your Rabb (the Quran and Sunnah), and follow not any Auliya (protectors and helpers) besides him&#8217;. (Al-A&#8217;raf: 3).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">All classical mufassirin (explainers of the holy Quran) explain <strong>“That which has been</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>revealed by your Rabb”</strong> in the above ayah to refer to the Quran and hadith. For example, <em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> (2/200), <em>al-Qurtubi</em> (7/161), <em>al-Khazin </em>(2/182), <em>an-Nasafi</em> (2/44), <em>Shawkani</em> (2/179), <em>al-Qasmi</em> (7/2610), <em>al-Maragi </em>(8/100). This shows that we are ordered to follow the Quran and hadith as they are revealed by Allah and to abandon following any other way or saying as there is no evidence for following this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “Say, &#8216;Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful”. (an-Naml: 64).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This shows that without evidence shall not be accepted. Know that a saying which has no evidence to support it from the Quran and hadith shall not be accepted no matter who the saying is from. This is sufficient to refute the performing of taqlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Know that if a saying or action could be accepted without proof from the Quran and hadith then Allah would not have ordered for the proof to be brought forth in this verse. Verily it was sufficient for Allah to have called the disbelievers as &#8216;liars&#8217; but in ordering for the showing of proof in this verse, Allah has indicated that no saying shall be accepted without evidence. The utterance of this verse from the prophet Muhammad is to show that the way of the Muslim is not to perform taqlid and blindly follow. Some may comment that this verse was revealed in relation to the disbelievers and does not apply to Muslims. Then note that even though the disbelievers had no proof of what they used to do despite this they were still asked to produce there proof. Then the Muslim who has proof for what he does should be more readily asked for proof and this is necessary. Furthermore, to provide evidences is the way of the Muslim and to follow without proof or performing taqlid is and was the custom of the disbeliever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “When those who were followed disown (declare themselves innocent of) those who followed them, and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them. And those who followed will say, &#8216;If only we had one more chance to return (to the worldly life), we would disown (declare ourselves innocent from them) as they have disowned (declared themselves innocent from us). Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regrets for them&#8217;. (al-Baqarah: 166-167).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The ittiba (to follow) which has been mentioned in this verse is not ittiba which has been ordered with the proof as has been mentioned in verse one above. Therefore the ittiba referred to here will be to follow without proof and this is taqlid. If someone says that the itiba referred to here is the worship which is done for other than Allah and not making taqlid of any Imam or scholar. Then this in itself is a great proof in the prohibition of taqlid as it will have to be conceded that to make ittiba or to follow other than Allah is to worship that person and this will be shirk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> &#8216;When it is said to them: &#8216;Follow do ittiba) what Allah has sent down&#8217;. They say, &#8216;Nay! We shall follow (do ittiba) what we found our fathers following&#8217;. (would they do that) even though their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided?&#8217;. (al-Baqarah: 170).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This verse invites people to follow with evidences whereas those who are astray perform ittiba or follow that for which there is no evidence or proof. This is why they follow there forefathers and elders even though they had no evidences and proofs for what they used to say. So how is it that those who were astray continued to follow there elders not knowing whether they were upon the truth or falsehood? The only way they could distinguish between the truth and falsehood and actually be certain they were following the truth was if they had followed with proof and evidence,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">If someone says that &#8216;this verse is admonition of those disbelievers who would blindly follow there disbelieving elders and forefathers and does not refer to blindly following pious people and Imams. Then the answer to this is that this is a proof against you. For if it is as you say then know that this verse shows that to follow without evidences was the way of the disbelievers whereas the way of the Muslims is to follow the prophet Muhammad with clear evidences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad), &#8220;This is my way: I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me”. (Yusuf:108).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It would have been sufficient to call the disbelievers liars in the beliefs they held. However to explain in more detail the reason for the deviancy of the disbelievers it is not being said &#8216;that you are astray because you followed your disbelieving forefathers&#8217; but what is rather being said is that the disbelievers followed those for whose guidance or being upon the truth they had no evidences and proofs. And this what taqlid is to follow without evidences and proofs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Some sayings of the Salaf as-Salihin about taqlid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">The Companion Abdullah Ibn Mas’ud said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Let no person perform taqlid of any other person.” (<em>Majma az-Zawa’id</em> and <em>Mizan al-Kubra</em> of Shirani (1/48).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">The Companion Mu’adh Ibn Jabal said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“So when a scholar is upon guidance do not perform taqlid of him in your religion.” (<em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> (2/174), of Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, Egyptian print).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">A similar narration has been narrated as above from the companion Salmaan. (<em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> (2/174), of Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, Egyptian print).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Amir al-Mu’minin Ali said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Be aware in taking from the ways of people.” (<em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm wa Fadlihi</em> (2/114) of Imam Ibn Abdul Barr).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is known that those who were being addressed with this advise were the companions and Tabi’in. This clearly shows that taqlid in the era of the companions was forbidden.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Amir bin Sharajil Sha’bi said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“What these people inform you of from the messenger of Allah (hadith) take it. And what they say from there opinions then throw it in the rubbish.” (<em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em> (1/37) and <em>al-Hujjatullah al-Balighah</em> of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (1/148).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Dear readers know that Imam Sha’bi was from the Kibar Tabi’n&#8217; (those from the second generation after the prophet). He met 500 companions of the messenger of Allah (<em>Tazkirrah al-Huffaz</em> of Imam Dhahabi (1/74). So if the saying of a man of this stature and position is not proof in itself then how can the saying or opinion of any other Tabi’in or those who followed them be blindly accepted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Abdullah bin al-Mu&#8217;tamir said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“There is no difference between that animal which is pulled (after being tied up) and that human which performs taqlid”. (<em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm wa Fadlihi </em>(2/113,) <em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in </em>(2/170).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Know that the animal which is tied and dragged behind it&#8217;s owner knows not if it is being taken to be fed grass, or to sell or to slaughter. Likewise the muqallid (blind follower) has no knowledge that the one who he is blindly following whether he is taking him towards the truth or falsehood! This is because he has no proof for what he is following and nor is the one who he is following infallible (but our prophet is infallible).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Abu Hanifah said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“It is not halal (permissible) for anyone to take my saying who does not know from where I have bought the evidences”. (<em>Muqaddimah Hidayah</em> (p.93).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The author who recorded this saying continues by commenting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“And our Imam has prohibited the performing of taqlid and has stressed the importance of knowing the dalil (proofs and evidences).” (<em>Muqaddimah Hidayah </em>(p.93).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is clear from the above saying of the Imam that at first he prohibits the performing of taqlid and then he stresses the importance of following with proof. So it can therefore be seen that to accept with evidences and proof is not taqlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Malik said:</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Verily I am a man and I err and at times am correct. So look at what I say and whatever is in accordance with the book (Quran) and sunnah take it and whatever opposes this then abandon it.” (<em>Jalb al-Manfa&#8217;a</em> p.68).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Imam has completely finished here the performing of taqlid. This is because he has ordered the asking for proof from the book and sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Shafi’ has clearly warned against taqlid. Therefore his student Imam Muzani said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Imam Shafi’ forbids the performing of taqlid of himself and others (scholars and Imams). And he gave the order that all should look for themselves (at the proofs) in the religion and should be careful.” (<em>Mukhtasar al-Muzani</em> (1/2) on the marginal notes of <em>Kitab al-Umm</em>).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="9">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Do not perform taqlid of me, nor Malik, nor Awza&#8217;i, nor Nakha&#8217;i nor anyone else&#8217;s these were all Imams of their times. But they took there matters of the religion from the book and sunnah so you take them from there as well.” (<em>Iqd-ul-Jid</em> p.81).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">He also said to Imam Abu Dawud,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Do not perform taqlid of anyone of them in your religion.” (<em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> (2/181).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="10">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">The Imam of the Hanafi madhhab Imam Tahawi said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Only a misguided one performs taqlid.” (<em>Lisan al-Mizan</em> (1/280).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="11">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">One of the greatest scholars according to the Hanafi madhhab is Imam Sarakhsi he said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“If taqlid were permissible then it would have been performed of those who came before Abu Hanifah such as Imam Hasan al Basri and Ibrahim Nakha&#8217;i as they were more rightful for taqlid to be performed of them&#8217;. (<em>al-Mabsut</em> of Sarakhsi (12/28), Kitab al-Waqf).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It can be clearly seen Imam Sarakhsi that performing taqlid is not permissible and this was not the way of the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="12">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Another Imam of the Hanafi madhhab Jaraullah Zamakhshari said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“If there is a mother of misguidance then it is performing taqlid.” (<em>Atwaq az-Zahab</em> (p.42).</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>So did the Companions or those who came before them with their various shariah&#8217;s perform taqlid in any aspects of the religion? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. Shah Waliullah Dehlwee quotes in his book <em>Hujjatullah al-Balighah</em> (p.154) from Imam Ibn Hazm in his book <em>al- Ihkam</em> (1/760) that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“So to perform taqlid was haram (forbidden) in all of the shariah&#8217;s from the first of them to the last. Whether it was (performing taqlid) in Tawhid (aqidah), Prophethood, belief in pre-destination or all of the other aspects of worship and ahkam (rules and laws).”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Explanation of an ayah which is often quoted for performing taqlid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “Ask the people of knowledge if you do not Know.” (surah an-Nahl)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is claimed by some that when a layperson asks a scholar or seeks a verdict from him about something this is taqlid of the scholar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This is not the case because the layperson is within his rights to ask the scholar what the Quran and hadith say about a particular matter and not to ask him about his opinion. So after being told what the hadith states about a certain matter he will try to act upon it to his capability. This is not taqlid but it is the following of proof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">If just by &#8216;asking&#8217; someone one falls into taqlid then what does one say about the following verse wherein the prophet Muhammad was ordered to &#8216;ask&#8217; from the jews and Christians. Allah forbid! Will you now say that even Muhammad was performing taqlid or blindly following the Jews and Christians?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">What does to &#8216;ask&#8217; mean in this ayah? Does it mean ask the person of knowledge for his own opinion or what the Quran and hadith state? If it meant ask the scholar of his opinion then know that opinions vary. So the only reason a questioner asks is so that he can be led to certainty rather than more uncertainty and confusion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, the “people of knowledge” in this verse are those who are people of the Quran and hadith, not people of opinion. So this in itself refutes taqlid. Therefore, the muqallid and blind follower will ask about his Imam&#8217;s or scholars opinion. Whereas if he were to ask</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">for proof from the Quran and sunnah then he would no longer remain a muqallid. Also this verse orders to ask the person of knowledge if a person does not know and the following verse restricts the questioner not to follow other than that which is revealed, that is, the Quran and sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it is proven from this that one should not follow the scholar himself but should ask the scholar for proof and then follow that. We ask about the mentioning of the people of &#8216;knowledge&#8217; in this verse. Is &#8216;knowledge&#8217; anything other than the Quran and hadith?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is it obligatory to perform taqlid?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. The Hanafi scholar Adul Hayy Lucknowi writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Only that is obligatory which Allah has made so. And only he has authority to do this. Allah did not make it obligatory on anyone that he choose for himself a madhab (school of thought today such as Hanafi, Shafi’, Maliki, Hanbali and others) of an Imam. To think it obligatory to do this is to make a new religion which Allah has not legislated for.” (<em>Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em>).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Dhahabi states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Ahl us Sunnah do not make it obligatory upon anyone to follow for themselves only one specific Imam.” (<em>al-Muntaqa</em> (p.166).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is there any other person from whose tongue nothing will come except the truth, other than Muhammad?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. When the companion Abdullah bin Umar Ibn al-Aas RadhiAllahu Anhu was stopped by the Quraysh in writing the hadith (narrations) of the messenger of Allah because he (the messenger) was only a man also and at times he would be happy and at times in anger so not everything should be written down of his. Therefore, the companion Abdullah stopped writing all that was said from the tongue of the messenger. When the Prophet heard about this he pointed to his tongue and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Write! So I swear by Allah in whose hand is my soul that nothing comes from this (my tongue) except that it is the haqq (truth).” (<em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em> (1/68).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is it permissible to ascribe to a particular madhab, being known as Hanafi, Shafi’, Maliki or Hanbali?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. If it were permissible for a person to ascribe himself to a particular madhhab or person then the companions would have been the foremost to make there separate and distinct madhhabs with other companions as the leaders of the particular madhhab or group. But we see that despite the existence of great companions such as the four caliphs, Ibn Umar, Ibn Masud, Ibn Abbaas RadhiAllahu Anhum and others no particular madhhabs were formed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">In fact the companions refrained from ascribing themselves to any other companion or madhab. Therefore, the companion Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“I am not Alawi (a person who makes a particular madhab ascribing himself to the fourth caliph Ali as leader) nor am I Uthmani (a person who makes a particular madhab ascribing himself to the third caliph Uthmaan as leader), but <strong>I AM UPON THE &#8216;MILLAH&#8217; (NATION AND FOLLOWERS) OF MUHAMMAD<em>.”</em></strong> (<em>al-Ihkam</em> of Ibn Hazm (6/118).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it can be seen that the companions did not like to ascribe themselves to any other person except Muhammad. Also the four Imams Abu Hanifah, Shafi’, Maalik and Ahmad did not have their own separate &#8216;millah&#8217;s&#8217; therefore to ascribe oneself to them cannot be permissible also. If one was to say now that there are four separate &#8216;millah&#8217;s&#8217; (nations) then this would be a different matter altogether!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">O Allah guide us all upon truly following Muhammad. Amin.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shaikh Muqbil, may Allaah have mercy on him, said about the following when most of them were alive, “As for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badi%27_ud-Din_Shah_al-Rashidi" target="_blank">Shaikh Badee’ud-Deen ar-Raashidi</a> [d. 1996] then he is from our Shaikhs and I attended a <i>dars</i> or two or three of his, may Allaah the Most High protect him—<strong>and he is regarded as an Imaam of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah</i></strong>, may Allaah reward him with good, and he hates blind-following and blind-followers and repels them.</p>
<p>And also likewise is the Shaikh Naasirud-Deen al-Albaani, may Allaah the Most High protect him, <strong>he is regarded as an Imaam of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah</i></strong>, and we advise all of our brothers to obtain his books and benefit from them.</p>
<p>And likewise also is the Shaikh ’Abdul-’Aziz ibn Baaz, may Allaah the Most High protect him, <strong>he is regarded as one of the Imaams of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah</i></strong> and a champion of the <i>Sunnah</i> of Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وسلم …</p>
<p>… as for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdur-Rahman_al-Mu%27allimee_al-Yamani" target="_blank">’Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Yahyaa al-Mu’allimi</a> [d. 1966] then the likes of him are few in this time, and his books, if you read his book, ‘<i>At-Tankeel bimaa fee Ta’neeb al-Kawthari minal-Abaateel,’</i> you will see a wonder of wonders as regards his patience and tolerance in his refutation of al-Kawthari, and some people have called him <strong>the Dhahabi of his time</strong>, so <i>alhamdulillaah</i> his books are beneficial and his style is easy.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehsan_Elahi_Zaheer" target="_blank">Ehsan Elahi Zaheer</a> [d. 1987] also, Allaah unleashed him on the <i>Raafidah</i> and on the <i>Shee’ah </i>and so he exposed them—<strong>and he is regarded as a champion of the <i>Sunnah</i> of Allaah’s Messenger</strong> صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وسلم … and … it is proper that these people should be asked about me and not me of them—because they are the Imaams of this time, may Allaah reward them with good.</p>
<p>And when we say so and so and so and so from these people [mentioned above], I do not mean that you blindly follow [<i>taqleed</i>] them—<strong>so do not blindly follow Badee’ud-Deen nor al-Albaani and nor Ibn Baaz and nor so and so and nor so and so, these people are our Imaams, but if we were going to blind follow them, then we would have blindly followed Abu Bakr and ’Umar and ’Uthmaan and whoever traversed upon their way …</strong>”</p>
<p><i>Ijaabatus-Saa‘il ’alaa Ahammil-Masaa‘il</i>, p. 494.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[8] Tanwir ul-Aynain Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Allamah Shah Muhammad Isma’il (1246H)</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Bigoted Staunch Taqlid and Blind Following of the Imams Over Authentic Texts</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh, the Imaam al-Allamah Muhammad Isma’il said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Chapter Exaggeration in Taqlid and Ta’assub (bigotry).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">People have exaggerated a lot in the taqlid of one particular individual and have made rigid bigotry obligatory upon themselves to the extent that they have prohibited an individual from performing ijtihad and from doing taqlid of other Imams. And this is that non-curable illness which destroyed the shi’ahs and these people (ie the muqallidin) have also reached the realms of destruction but the only difference is that the shi’ahs have reached a greater level of destruction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They (the Shi’ahs) started to find texts to back up the statements of their Imams and these people (ie the muqallidin) have also adopted this way and begun to figurative explain well known narrations that opposed the statements of their Imams. However they should have weighed and presented the statements of their Imams to these narrations and texts and if they (the statements) coincided with the text they should have accepted them or otherwise rejected them. (Tanwir ul-Aynain Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain (pg.44-45)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said, “And I am amazed when I see a person has the ability to return to a clear and conclusive hadith of the Messenger of Allaah (Saalalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) which opposes the statement of his Imam and yet they still hold doing taqlid permissible and I wonder how is this permissible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So if he does not leave the statement of his Imam in such a situation then he has with him Shirk Fir-Risalah (Association partners in the Messengership of the Prophet.).” then the Shaikh goes onto mention the hadith of Adiyy bin Hatim in Jame at-Tirmidhi in regards to the verse of Allaah,<strong>“They have taken their monks and rabbis Lords besides Allaah.”</strong> (Soorah at- Taubah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say further, “So we find from this hadeeth that if a person comes to know the evidences from the Book and the Sunnah and he still adheres to the statement of a specific Imam and begins to figurative explain these evidences, then such a person has traits of Christianity in him and there is the danger that he may have taken some aspects of Shirk in him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And there is extreme amazement on such a nation, who instead of fearing such taqlid they declare those who abandon this taqlid to be great oppressors. Then how well does the following verse fit such people, “How shall I fear those whom you associate and yet you do not fear that you have associated partners with Allah for which Allah has not revealed any evidence, so which of the two are upon the truth, if only but you knew.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So think and be just and do not be from those people who have doubts and we seek refuge in Allah from being amongst those who have bigotry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Tanwir ul-Aynain Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain (pg.49-51).</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[6] Taqlid Aur Amal Bil-Hadith </strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Nawab Syed Mahdi Ali Khan Bahadur (1325H)</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Practice of the People Before The Advent of The Four Madhabs</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During the time of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) there were no other books or texts other than the Quran that were consulted with regards to issues pertaining to the Shariah, the ahadith and rulings. At the time no books of ahadith were authored nor did any companion compile a book about issues of Fiqh and their rulings and nor did any scholar pen anything on Usul or Qawa’id.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the time there was just actions of the companions, they would see the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) perform an action and they would then just do the same. They did not intend to focus on Usul al-Fiqh and its compilations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) would issue a legal edict or answer a question, the companions would listen and remember them. The custom of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in terms of his actions and completion of the acts of worship etc would differ at different times and not all of the companions would be with him all of the time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, whichever companion saw an action he remembered it and when the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said something they would memorise it. Any particular reason or specific circumstances evolving around those instances, they kept to themselves not thinking any thing of them and they continued like this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From amongst the zealous and keen companions, they would endeavour to seek more knowledge and learn more about the finer details. They would ask one another and so on. So some of these companions became stronger jurists. The companions who spent more time with the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) learnt more and became more knowledgable in relation to others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the time of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) passed and it was the era of the companions, they would act on their knowledge as well as what they had heard directly from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If a new matter arose they would ask the other companions and if they were unable to find a clear answer from the Quran and Sunnah they would look at other similar issues that had been transmitted via the Quran and Sunnah and make deductions based on them. If they faced a difficult issue they would consult and seek advice from one another and resolve the matter in this way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people who were born in this era or those who accepted and reverted back to Islam, this is how they learnt the knowledge of the din, exactly the same way the companions had learnt from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). In other words, whenever a companion would meet each other, they would be jurists in their own right (because of what they knew in relation to the other companion in terms of hadith or rulings) and took issues of the shariah from them.</span></p>
