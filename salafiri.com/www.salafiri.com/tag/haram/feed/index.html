				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><em><strong>The Hanafi Fiqh Channels Recent video on Allamah Rabbani Imam Shaikh Muhammad Nāsir ud-Dīn al-Albani by the Bradford crew</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><em><strong>Hanafi Ash&#8217;ari&#8217;s on the Hadith in Sahih Muslim &#8211; Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah and his Madhhab Fanatacism </strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Read</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/clearing-the-allegations-and-attack-on-allamah-rabbani-shaikh-muhammad-nasir-al-din-al-albani-1420h-part-1-the-hanafi-fiqh-channel/">Part 1</a></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet again, recently the intellectual prowess of some people arose in Bradfud, the Ash&#8217;ari Deobandi&#8217;s in conjunction with the ta&#8217;an ie slanderous accusation on the name Abu Hanifah as the Hanafi Fiqh Channel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They released a video on the categorisation and grading of Shaikh al-Albani concerning the ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari. Posts of this nature will by no means explain or clarify such intricate and fine issues of the science of Hadith and illal. This inshaAllah, is to be addressed in due course.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This manipulative presentation and associated distortions are nothing new from these Ash&#8217;ari Deobandi&#8217;s, as their scholars, other Ash’arites as well underlings of this camp have presented other deceitful allegations. They alleged that Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani also rendered some ahadith in Sahih Muslim to be weak, again this is not the place to enter into these issues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, what I wanted to share was the horrible double standards these people employ and how they turn a blind eye to their own scholars, Shuyukhs they revere. It highlights how these people disastrously forget the true reality, yet under the guise of attacking and vilifying Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, they develop selective amnesia. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This being said, we hope the honest reader who fears Allah and the last day can judge for himself and see the truth and the double standards.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah, the student of Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, the one who lauded the Deobandi Echelons and his understanding of the Hadith in SAHIH MUSLIM</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abdul-Fattah-Abu-Guddah.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-8076 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abdul-Fattah-Abu-Guddah.jpeg?resize=479%2C423" alt="abdul Fattah Abu Guddah" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abdul-Fattah-Abu-Guddah.jpeg?resize=300%2C265 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abdul-Fattah-Abu-Guddah.jpeg?resize=768%2C678 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abdul-Fattah-Abu-Guddah.jpeg?resize=1024%2C905 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abdul-Fattah-Abu-Guddah.jpeg?w=1080 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>“I first met Shaikh Abdul-Fattaah Abu Guddah in his city, Aleppo, more than twenty years ago approximately. I realised that he was a man who was bigoted towards the Hanafi madhhab such that he blindly followed it when in his mosque in Aleppo he agreed to the permissibility of treating someone with alcohol under the supervision of a skilled, Muslim doctor.</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>So I said to him, “This is not enough. The doctor must also be well-acquainted with the Sunnah. For in the Sunnah, for example, alcohol has been described as being a disease and not a cure. So how can a Muslim doctor who knows the Sharee’ah prescribe a cure which the Prophet, صلى الله عليه وسلم, described as being a disease?!”</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>So he said, “Perhaps the hadith is weak or not authentic!” I replied, “How can it be when it is in Sahih Muslim?” So he said, “We will go back and check it to make sure.”</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>So one of the people who was present and he was a friend to both parties in the debate said, “So when you do check and find out that it is authentic, will you act upon it or what the madhhab says?”</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>So he replied, “The madhhab!”</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(Hayat al-Allamah al-Albani Bi Qalamihi (p.38-41), Kashf al-Niqab (p.9) </strong></span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The <em>Kashf al-Niqab</em> was first printed in 1395H / 1975ce, this should give you an idea how long these people were extreme fanatics towards their madhab. Yet they talk about hadith of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So what does Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah say, he says he will check the Hadith in SAHIH MUSLIM because he considered it to be weak or the fact that he did not even know it was in SAHIH MUSLIM</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, and we have not even directed our attention to Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari yet and this is not even the top of the iceberg. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will inshaAllah, with the permission and aid of Allah alone show the historical assertions the Hanafi Ash’arites have made concerning the Sahihs of Imam’s Bukhari and Muslim.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #333399;">10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>[2]</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Shaikh Abdul Haq al-Hashimi</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>1302H-1392H </strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(1884c-1972c)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Numerous scholars have been born and served Islam in spreading its message and Calling to the Tawhid of Allah, however, there were very few who were in of themselves a community or the same affect as a group of scholars. From them was the likes of Shaykh Abu Muhammad Abdul Haq al-Hashimi Muhajir Makki. He was instrumental in helping hundreds of people to guidance with the permission of Allah, he was a formidable scholar, an expert, an orator who continued this blessed dawah for decades. He was a scholar, an orator, Khatib, a teacher and a writer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His dawah efforts are spread over 70 years across the subcontinent and Saudi Arabia, where he would deliver lectures from the most basic of subjects to the most complex of discussions ranging from Hadith science’s through to Rijal discussions. His writings and books alone which number many are in themselves a testimony to the depth and veracity of his knowledge. Allah had indeed gifted him with his dawah and constant, consistent and continuous dawah in the best possible manner. </span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Name and Lineage</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is Shaykh, the Allamah, the Muhaddith, al-Musnad al-Ilmi, the destroyer of Shirk and bid’ah, Abu Muhammad Abdul Haq al-Hashimi, his lineage goes back to Umar bin al-Khattab (RadhiAllahu Anhu) in 42 generations and is as follows,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Muhammad Abdul Haq bin Abdul Wahid bin Muhammad bin Hashim bin Ramadan bin Bilal bin Hibatullah bin Ali bin Isma’il bin Jalal bin al-Shams bin al-Amir bin Ja’far bin Abdur Rahman bin Jalal bin Muhammad Kabir bin al-Amir bin Wasil bin Abul Abbas bin Hashim bin Muhammad al-Kabir bin Abdur Rahman bin Jalal bin Mahmud bin Umar bin Jalal bin al-Amir bin Muhammad bin al-Amir bin Najib bin Umar bin Nasir bin Muhammad bin Abid bin Abi Bakr bin Najib bin Zayd bin Abid bin Abi Muslim bin Abdullah bin Abbas bin Muhammad bin Zayd bin Abdullah bin Umar bin al-Khattab (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) (Aqidah Firqatun Najiyyah p.27)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykhs name of al-Hashimi he took from his great grandfather. The Shaykh Rahimahullah dictated his own biography which his son, Shaykh Abu Turab al-Zahiri penned down in 1382H, therefore at times the biography will change from third person to first person. There have been other biographies too but mostly small and short.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Early Education</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I was born in 1302H (1884ce) in Kotla Shaikhan in the state of Bhawalpur, I grew up with my parent’s love as I was the youngest and my brothers who were born before me passed away and as being the only and youngest child I received all the love of my parents. They raised me very well with excellent cultivation.”</em> (Aqidah Firqatun Najiyyah p.19)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some scholars have mentioned the Shaykh was born in 1301H, which is to be taken lightly as the Shaykh had more knowledge when he was born that a third party. (A’dat al-imam bukhari fi sahih p.9)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti in his biography often cites from the dictated biography of Shaykh Abdul Haq which can be referred. (Dabistan Hadith p.312-320)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I read the Quran to my father, I also studied Persian as well as books on Nahw and Sarf ie grammar and syntax. He later sent me to other cities and towns in order to seek knowledge. I learnt various sciences from experts and specialized teachers, syntax, grammar, meanings, orating, balagha, adab-conduct, language and poetry. I further studied books on Aqidah and Usul al-Fiqh, I also learnt and studied fundamental books on tafsir and fiqh with my teachers. I then directed my main focus and study to the sciences of the Quran and Hadith, thereby began reading and looking into the books of the Imams of Ahl al-Sunnah.”</em> (Aqidah Firqatun Najiyyah p.19-20, Dabistan Hadith p.312)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykhs father, Shaykh Abdul Wahid was a scholar and person of knowledge in his own right, he spread Tawhid and Sunnah in his land. He would work during the day and learn at the same time and then teach the young Abdul Haq. Shaykh Abdul Wahid had a longing for his son to seek knowledge and learn the Islamic sciences. So he sent Shaykh Abdul Haq to other cities of learning, where he would further seek knowledge of the sacred sciences. He travelled to Multan, Batala and Delhi at the request of his father, he also travelled to numerous villages and smaller towns. (A’dat al-imam Bukhari fi sahih p.9)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Aqidah and Manhaj</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was as Salafi as they come, radiant, clear and manifest in his beliefs and the principles of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah which is further evident in his books and his teachings. He says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“My Aqidah is the Aqidah of the Salaf us-Saleh, the same Aqidah of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jam’ah, the Fuqaha and the Muhadithin. My Aqidah is to act on the Quran and Sunnah and to take the apparent ie Zahir meaning without ta’wil or tahrif and my madhab is the madhab of Ashabul Hadith in belief and actions.”</em> (Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.5)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said<em>, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is Allahs blessing upon me that I am from the Ummah of the leader of the children of Adam and then he had further blessings on me that he guided me to the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafiyin in Aqidah and actions.”</em> (Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.18)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He opposed taqlid and loved the pure Sunnah, he warned and abandoned taqlid while have respect for the Imams as he says. (Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.5)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He did not restrict himself to a madhab as he had profound knowledge of the hadith likewise his immense knowledge of hanafi fiqh.”</em> (Majmu’a Tarjamah al-Shaykh Hamad al-Ansari 2:613)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Teachers      </strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh had over 60 teachers and his son, Abu Turab al-Zahiri says his father did not mention more than half of them due to their beliefs and manhaj not being in accordance with the Salaf us-Salah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have many teachers and I would like to mention the ones I sought knowledge from and they are those whose beliefs were in accordance with the Salaf us-Salihin with regards to Tawhid, Iman and in issues of the Sifat of Allah ie the ones who had the correct and sound Aqidah. The very same teachers who who rejected and shunned taqlid and lived their life accordance with following and obeying ie Ittiba of the Quran and Sunnah, they gave me their asanid and ijazat.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already mentioned he would travel to various places to study and gained ijazat from various esteemed scholars. After seeking knowledge, he returned to his village and began teaching. He began expounding the call of Tawhid and Sunnah, he would teach on a daily basis with students following whatever he did during the day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also known about the Shaykh that he faced much oppression, injustice and hardship from his fellow classmates and people of his era. Shaikh Badi al-Din Shah al-Rashidi al-Sindhi mentions they tried to kill the Shaykh many times when his dawah was spreading and the people were accepting it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Later he moved to a place called Mahnad and began teaching the Quran and Hadith and this continued for approximately 2 years, he also taught Bulugh al-Maram. He also taught other books for example Kafiyyah, Muwatta Imam Malik and the al-Fiyyah of Ibn Malik as well as the expounding on the knowledge of hadith. (Mawlana Sultan Mahmud p.36-37, of Shaykh Muhammad Rafiq Athari)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh Thereafter moved to his home area of Kotla Shaikhan and taught the six canonical book of hadith as well as other sciences. He remained in his home town for 3 years and many of his students moved to his home town to benefit from him during the time remained there. (Mawlana Sultan Mahmud p.37)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then moved to Ahmadpur Sharqiyyah upon the request of some people and then began teaching there whilst residing in Katra Ahmad Khan. His efforts produced a large number of people who accepted the call of the Ahl al-Hadith and a community progressed. The Shaykh spent approximately over 25 years giving dawah and calling to Allah and and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). He would teach for 14 -18 hours a day at times without resting. (Dabistan Hadith p.313)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the Khatib and also had weekly lessons on Tafsir and hadith. He was the first person to organize an Ahl al-Hadith conference in Ahmadpur Sharkiyyah. He invited pioneer scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith from the likes of Shaykh Thanullah Amritsari, Shaykh Muhammad Junaghadi, Shaykh Abul Qasim Banarisi, Shaykh Muhammad Ibrahim Siyalkoti as well as other major Ahl al-Hadith scholars of the time. (Dabistan Hadith p.313)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was also in Ahmadpur where the Shaykh expounded the understanding of Bukhari where he would teach it in his unique way, he would expand on the deductions and interpretations of Imam Bukhari. He would elaborate on the fiqh of the hadith as well as talk about the narrators and chains while at times delving into the intricacies of the sciences of hadith. (Mawlana Sultan Mahmud p.37)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abu Turab said when Dar al-Hadith was set up the Shaykh would deliver lessons on the sciences of the Quran and Sunnah, he would go all out and shun the people of desires, innovation and shirk in speaking and writing and many people repented from their disbelief. Many repented from Shirk and sacrificing to the people of the grave. He waged war against the grave worshippers, he had debates with them and Allah gave him victory. He set up learning centres and he approximately produced 100 scholars in Pakistan who were considered the major scholars of today like Shaykh Sultan Mahmud. (Ishyakh wa Maqalat p.12)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1948/1949, King Abd al-Aziz bin Sa’ud requested him to come to Saudi Arabia and teach. It is possible that he travelled to Hajj and upon seeing his extensive knowledge of the Quran and Sunnah, King Abd al-Aziz issued a royal decree allowing him to teach in the Haram al-Makki. (Mawlana Sultan Mahmud p.51)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His son Shaikh Abu Turab mentions</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He went to Makkah for Hajj and he performed Hajj while it was under the control of the Sharif of Makkah and Malik Abdul Aziz ibn Sa’ud. during which he had academic discussions and discourses with some of the major scholars of the Mamlika, who were impressed with the depth of his knowledge. They studied the explanation of Musnad Ahmad from him and sat with him in his lessons in Makkah while benefitting from him and they were inclined to his knowledge and personality. So these scholars sought from the King Abdul Aziz ibn Sa’ud to issue a royal decree for him to teach in Makkah. From those who requested this was the chief justice al-Shaykh Abdullah bin Hasan Al-ash-Shaykh. The King obliged and issued a royal decree for the Shaykh to teach in Haram Makki in 1367H. The Shaykh continued doing this until he died.”</em> (Ishyakh wa Maqalat p.13)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh mentions himself,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allah enabled me to migrate to this peaceful land, Makkah and the righteous man, King Abdul Aziz who asked me to teach Masjid al-Haram, May Allah give him a place in Jannatul Firdaws and make his family the guidance and abaility to propagate the Din and its sciences. Amin.” </em>(Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.17)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti mentions Shaykh Abd al-Haq had enmity for the Sharif of Makkah and when King Abd al-Aziz bin Abdur Rahman al-Sa’ud captured Makkah, Shaykh Abd al-Haq his joy as well as other people of the same understanding and hence they travelled to the Hijaz. (Dabistan Hadith p.316-317)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was a formidable orator and he would travel extensively to the various cities and deliver lectures and sermons. He was softly spoken with clear distinct words which would sit very easily and comfortably with people. He would speak in a simple way for the masses for them to understand the message of Tawhid and Sunnah. In this regard he travelled to Multan, Muzaffargardh, Dera Ghazi Khan, Jampur, Jhang, Shawrkot and Bhawalpur. He also travelled to India where he studied and would later also teach and give dawah via lessons and sermons in Amritsar, Batala and Delhi. He would also participate in the India Ahl al-Hadith conferences. (A’dat imam Bukhari fi sahih p.16, Mawlana Sultan Mahmud p.49)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh goes onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This (ie being issued a royal decree) was due to the intervention of the chief Justice Shaykh Abdullah bin Hasan Al-ash-Shaykh, may Allah have mercy on him and give him a plce in Jannah, and the head of the department of Commanding good in Riyadh, Shaykh Umar bin Hasan. These righteous and virtuous people honoured me and may Allah benefit the Muslims through them. I was also honoured by the Grand Mufti Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (Al-ash-Shaykh), the Chief head of commanding the good of Hijaz Shaykh Abdul Malik bin Ibrahim, my noble brother, the great Ustadh Shaykh Abd al-Aziz bin Baz. All of these people were my salafi brothers who aided the Din, the pure Sunnah and were very close to me in the Din, may Allah reward them with good in this world and in the hearafter.” </em>(Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.17)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh goes onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have been in Makkah for a very long time since 1367H and I teach in Dar ul-Hadith and in Haram of Makkah the 6 books of hadith and Musnad Ahmad and the explanation of the Quran, I seek forgiveness from Allah and I ask him to give me guidance to that which he loves and is happy with.”</em> (Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.17)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had a remarkable memory with an unprecedented ability to recall texts. He had memorized hundreds and thousands of hadith and he would often recite the books of hadith from memory when teaching his students who would have their books opened in front of them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He left Pakistan for Saudi Arabia without amassing any wealth, he only left behind his institute of learning, which his grandsons are running in Pakistan. Even when he went to Saudi Arabia, all of the rulers from Abd al-Aziz Ibn Sa’ud to King Faisal had a lot of respect for him and honoured him for his vast knowledge. He never asked for anything, especially money and led a very simple life and just immersed himself in his books and teachings. He spent all of his life in the area of Misfalah in Makkah in a rented house.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would recite the Quran daily and follow it with reciting a portion of Bukhari in that he would complete both the Quran and the whole of Bukhari in 30 days. Allah had blessed him so much that the Shaykh himself said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If Allah was to give me the life of Nuh Alayhis Salam I would still not be bale to thank Allah for his blessings and bounties that he bestowed upon me.”</em> (Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.18)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would warn and reprimand the Imams of the Haram for opposing or abandoning some of the Sunnahs of the prayer. (Ittihaf Ahl al-Rasukh)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already mentioned that he taught for approximately 70 years in the Subcontinent and Makkah. His Son Shaykh Abu Turab mentions that his father taught hadith for approximately 40 in India/Pakistan and 25 years in the Haram and Dar al-Hadith in Makkah. (Ishyakh wa Maqalat p.13)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong> His Dreams</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh had several dreams which he mentions to his son Abu Turab al-Zahiri. He said whilst he was studying hadith he saw the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) in a dream and the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) passed in front of him, he was wearing white clothes and his face was radiant like the moon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another dream The Shaykh saw the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) was wearing beautiful clothes while he descended from the the sky, he sat on a chair and he hugged the Shaykh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another dream he saw the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) holding a dead persons body and another person who was holding the body from the feet. The Shaykh was also holding the body and he was at the front, the Shaykh says I then begin to fall into water and then sensed from this dream that I will revive the unpractised Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another dream the Shaykh found himself in the Prophets (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) apartment and the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) had a large register. I asked the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) the name of a companion, the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said to me to look in the register and he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) showed me the name.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh also said my mother saw the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) in a dream that he was visiting our house. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) called me while I had a writing paper in my hand and he began dictating and I continued to write. My mother approached us and the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) stood up and I also stood up and then we went to another room and he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) continued to dictate to me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I am not narrating these dreams for anything good or bad but rather that this weak person is expressing the bounty and blessing of Allah upon me.”</em>     </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Haq would also practice calligraphy and script, so much so that he wrote over 37,000 ahadith and 3,000 Quran with his own handwriting, as well as the summary of Sahih al-Bukhari.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykhs son, Shaykh Abdul Wakil al-Hashmi has all of the Shaykhs works, he also has the Shaykhs library and his books. The Shaykh would often write notes and points of benefits in his books especially books of hadith. The Shaykh would write detailed intricate notes pertaining to hadith and its sciences</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>What the Scholars Said About him</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abd al-Aziz al-Zahrani said I heard Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al-ash-Shaykh say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is NO ONE from Ahl al-Sunnah who explains Sahih al-Bukhari like the explanation of Abu Muhammad Abd al-Haq al-Hashimi.”</em> (as mentioned by Shaykh Badr al-Utaibi in the introduction of the Thabt of Shaykh abd al-Haqq al-Kabir)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Wakil al-Hashimi mentions that he heard from the Grand Mufti Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al-ash-Shaykh that he would send my father questions on Gharaib Ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abd al-Rahman bin Yahya al-Mu’allami al-Yamani moved to Makkah around at the same time. He was one of the Shaykhs who wrote about the Musnad al-Sahihayn, he wrote<em>, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Shaykh al-Allamah al-Jalil Abu Muhammad Abd al-Haq bin Abd al-Wahid asked me to stop working on his First volume of his Musnad al-Sahihayn, and it indeed I found it was an impressive compilation between the Sahihayn.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Badi al-Din Shah al-Rashidi al-Sindi said while writing about his book Musnad al-Sahihayn,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It was authored by Shaykh al-Muhaddith al-Fazil, the scholar Abu Muhammad Abd al-Haq al-Hashimi, a teacher in Haram al-Makki, clear to the people is his upholding of the Sunnah.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of Shayh Muhaddith Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, Shaykh Abu Khayr Isma’il as-Salafi and numerous other scholars of Hadith from the Subcontinent have written about his works. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn Baz after reading his book Aqidah Firqatun Najiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have looked at the dictated book of al-Shaykh al-Allamah Nasir al-Sunnah, Qame al-Bidah Abu Muhammad Abd al-Haqq al-Hashimi, I found the aqidah he said was in accordance with Tawhid, Imam and names and attributes of Allah upon the way of the companions and Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamah” </em>(Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.3)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abu Turab said that another time Shaykh Ibn Baz said Shaykh Abd al-Haq was from the people of knowledge the people of our era seek knowledge from.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abu Turab further said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>Shaikh Ibn Baz said that there was a strong bond between him and my father and whenever we would meet he would praise him and invoke Allahs mercy upon him and asking Allah to grant him a high place in Jannah, he would praise my father with great reverence. He would clearly say that he was knowledgeable from the scholars of our time. He introduced his treatise on Aqidah and praised it. When he would attend my father lessons he would be amazed at his explanations. Another time Shaykh Abu Turab mentions once Shaykh Ibn Baz attended the Shaykhs Lessons on Tafsir and Shaykh Ibn Baz asked the people which book is the Shaykh reading from, they said he does not have anything except the mushaf. He was overly amazed and impressed with my fathers knowledge and his preservation or memorization of it.”</em> (Madinah newspaper, 24/2/1420, see also al-Injaz fi tarajmah al-Imam Ibn baz pp.588-589)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Umar Abd al-Hadi, the rector of Dar al-Hadith said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “He was an exemplary scholar with virtuous manners, decorum, uprightness, he loved to spread knowledge and had eagerness to benefit the students until Allah benefitted them. Students with great knowledge and esteem graduated at his hands, he had a great status, with truthfulness in serving knowledge and students, May Allah have mercy upon him and give him a lofty place in Jannah.”  </em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Umar Abdul Jabbar said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Shaykh Abd al-Haq had memorized the six canonical books of hadith and their chains, he knew the issues of differences between the Imams and their evidences, what had precedence over the other, he respected the views of the Scholars and he loved the earlier scholars.”</em> (al-Bilad newspaper 10/11/1379)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Umar Abdul Jabbar wrote a short biography of Shaykh Abd al-Haq in the Bilad newspaper and it is from what Shaykh Abd al-Haqq had dictated to him during his life on the 10<sup>th</sup> Dhul Qa’dah 1379 corresponding to 6<sup>th</sup> May 1960.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Rabi bin Hadi al-Madkhali said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He is the Allamah al-Muhaddith Abu (Muhammad) Abdul Haq..”</em> (Tazkir al-Nabihin p.283, Then Shaykh Rabi cites all of the biography from Aqidah firqatun najiyyah) see. p.283-288)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Students</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh had hundreds of students spread over the world, major scholars in their own right, from some of the well known ones are,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Sultan Mahmud – Shaykh ul-Hadith</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shyakh Thanullah Madani and Shaykh Sultan Mahmud’s son informed me that he taught Sahih al-Bukhari 66 times and it was Shaykh Abd al-Haq who sent Shaykh Sultan to Jalalpur to teach.  Allahu Akbar 66 times it would be uncommon for anyone of to have read Bukhari once let alone having studied it once and where is 66 times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To read more about his biography refer to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/shaikh-ul-hadith-muhaddith-sultan-mahmud-jalalpuri-1416h/">HERE</a></strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the heritage of the Salafi’s and Ahl al-Hadith and the service and efforts of the elder scholars of hadith which is their main hallmark and not the one that is often projected of the sociopolitical representation. They continued and strove in spreading the teaching of the Quran and hadith day and night, just teaching, preaching and giving Dawah of the clear meanings and of the Quran and Hadith and thus any fringe minority view of some of the scholars should not be taken as the mainstream way of the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafi’s, it is except a fringe view due to the possible need at the time. More on this later inshaAllah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Hadith Abd al-Razzaq-The Shaykhs eldest son</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Turab al-Zahiri – The Shaykhs son</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Wakil al-Hashimi, also the Shaykhs son.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Badi al-Din Sindhi Shah al-Rashidi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abd al-Karim</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Yamani-the author of Manahil</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Thanullah Madani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Shaykh Abd al-Haqq al-Hashimi, I studied with him near the Ibrahim gate of Majid al-Haram al-Makki.” </em>(al-Majmu’a fi tarjamah al-shaykh hamad al-ansari (1:455)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdullah bin Abd al-Aziz bin Aqil gained ijazah from him in 1381H-1382H, he said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was a scholar, he would explain Musnad Ahmad, he had weak eyesight and he was unable to see except that he would stand and I do not know how but Allah would return his sight and I surely think I was not confused…. He was Salafi in Aqidah and wed id not find a single word agasint the correct Aqidah” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn Aqil also mentions that</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Shaykh Abd al-Haq compiled Bukhari in Musnad form. He also said I visited him for many years and sat in his lessons on the 6 books in our many travels to Makkah, he was a trustworthy scholar and beyond that and I have not heard anything from him or from other Scholars about him except good.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Thanullah Madani was also his student and studied with him in his house and in he Haram in the Summer months. Shaykh Thanullah said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We would study and learn hadith in general and would concentrate on the 6 books more often and he would sit where (Shaykh) Wasiullah currently sits. He says the Shaykhs style was not common but rather academic, his speech would be clear and easy with overwhelming evidences. He would go into refutations sometimes especially the hanafi’s and one of the differences between Shaykh Abd al-Haqq and the other Shaykhs of the Hijaz was that he would explain an issue completely. He would clarify the fiqh of the hadith without restricting himself to a madhab and would adopt the view closest to the Quran and Sunnah. He would teach Sahih al-Bukhari with his own explanation which was in 14 volumes which he would teach after maghrib. We read many books to him for example Bidayah wan-Nihayah. He served the Din and would debate and discuss with the people of Innovations and Shirk whilst detesting the people of opinion. During Hajj some Hanafis would mention issues from the likes of Ashraf Ali Thanwi and so the Shaykh would vigorously refute them from the Quran and Sunnah”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said about him in his Thabt,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Ustadh al-Fazil, the famous Muhaddith and the author of many books.”</em> (Tazkirrah al-Jahabazah al-Darari p.19)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many of the majors of India and Pakistan would visit him when in Makkah from the likes of great scholars and Imams in their own right like Abdul Rawpari, Shaykh Abdul Jalil Samrudi as mentioned by Shaykh Thanullah Madani and Shaykh Abdul Wakil Hashimi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abu Turab mentions approximately 100 Scholars and students gained Ijazah to narrate from him from the east and west. Some of the Scholars were from the Major scholars of Najd and the Harams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Hasan Rashid narrated to us at the end of the time due to the immense love of hadith in his last days we would just mention ahadith their chains and this would go on for a long time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the Scholars who heard hadith from, benefitted from him and his lessons they include the likes of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Sultan Mahmud Jalalpuri</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Badi al-Din Sindhi</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[526]     From Malik from someone trustworthy from Bukayr ibn Abdullah ibn al-Ashajj from Abd ar-Rahman ibn al-Hubab al-Ansari from Abu Qatada al-Ansari that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, forbade making nabidh from dates and raisins together, and nearly ripe dates and fresh dates together. </span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[GRADING] – [SAHIH]</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[REFERENCES]</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/844 hadith no.1639, book 42, chapter 3, hadeeth no.8) at-Tamhid (24/205) and al-Istidhkar (no.1767)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted al-Nasa&#8217;i in al-Kubra (Tuhfatul Ashraf no,12119), from the hadith of Malik, from the Hadith of Malik as above and it has supports in Bukhari (5602), Muslim (1986) and it is thus Sahih.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADEETH]</strong></span></h5>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since everything intoxicant is haram and sometimes Nabidh made from dates and raisins can become intoxicants, therefore from the perspective of Sadh al-Dhari&#8217; i.e. a means to prevent a harm, we have been prohibited from drinking Nabidh.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Islam is a Din that wishes good for humanity.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Who is the trustworthy narrator referred to here? This is unclear, however in Sunan al-Kubra of al-Nasa&#8217;i (from Tuhfatul Ashraf 9:261 no.12119) and Tamhid (24:206), Amr bin al-Harith who is trustworthy, transmits from Bukayr bin Abdullah ibn al-Ashajj, there are also authentic supporting narrations which support this hadith, therefore this hadith is authentic wa Lillahil Hamd. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">See also hadith no.136, 248</span></span></li>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[368] Narrated An-Nu&#8217;man bin Bashir (Radi Allahu Anhu):<br />
I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) saying and he pointed with his fingers towards his ears, &#8216;Both legal and illegal things are evident but in between them there are doubtful (suspicious) things and most of the people have no knowledge about them. So whoever saves himself from these suspicious things saves his religion and his honor. And whoever indulges in these suspicious things is like a shepherd who grazes (his animals) near the Hima (private pasture) of someone else and at any moment he is liable to get in it. (O people!) Beware! Every king has a Hima and the Hima of Allah on the earth is His illegal (forbidden) things. Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body if it becomes good (reformed) the whole body becomes good but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[RULINGS FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) The halal things are absolutely clear and the haram things are absolutely clear. Every muslim is commanded to use the halal and refrain and avoid the haram.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) It is a sign of taqwa to refrain and avoid the unclear matters.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) The heart is such an important piece of the body that when it is upright the whole body is upright and when it is corrupt, the whole body becomes corrupt.<br />

Ibn Abas (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, “Whoever forgets or doesn’t do a (necessary) action from Hajj or Umrah then that person has to do dam meaning sacrifice a goat and distribute (it) to the poor people in the Haram. (as-Sunan al-Kubra of al Bayhaqi 5/30 and its chain is authentic, al-Muwatta of Imam Malik 1/419, hadith no.968 and its chain is authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) A summary of one hadith is that if a person performing Hajj can’t perform the tawaf before the evening on the day of sacrifice (10 Dhul Hijjah) then all the (Ihram’s) bounding (required) actions have to performed again by him meaning he has to put the Ihram back on and do the visiting tawaf. See Sunan Abu Dawud (no.1999) and its chain is [Hasan] good and Ibn Khuzaimah has authenticated it (no.2958)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The people of knowledge should tell the people about knowledgeable things that are in accordance to the Quran, Sunnah and the Shar’iah compliant proofs during the days of Hajj (and additionally before and after it).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) There is a consensus that the person performing Hajj and Umrah that is in the state of Ihram will not cut his hair or have it cut. If the hair has to be cut because of a Shar’iah compliant excuse then dam will need to be done.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) It is best to cut (shave) the hair after throwing the stones at Jamarah Aqabah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) For more detailed issues about the Hajj and Umrah see my (translated and verified) book “the day and night of the person performing Hajj”</span></p>
