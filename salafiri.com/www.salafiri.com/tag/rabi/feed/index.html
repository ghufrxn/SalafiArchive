				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong> Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>[Taken from the Introduction of, The Distinctive Jurisprudence of Ahl al-Ḥadīth; Prayer &amp; Purification Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn Shāh al-Rāshidī al-Sindhī]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have already compiled a biography of <strong>Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn</strong> which was first published online around 2001 and it was the first ever biography of the Shaykh<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> in English. One may refer to it for a basic background of the Shaykh, his teachers, students and writings. This biography has since been used by others with modifications and at the same time some new biographies have been published online, however all of them use the same generic sources and thus without any new information. What follows, I hope, In-Shāʾ-Allāh are brief snippets from the life of the Shaykh that are not in English.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh ʿAtā Allāh Thāqib</strong> lauded him with the following titles;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>Nāṣir al-Sunnah al-Nabawiyyah, Nāṣir al-ʿAqīdah al-Salafiyyah, Qāṭeʿ al-Bidʿah, al-Mujāhid, Lā ʿElā Kalimatallāhi, al-Ṣalb Fi al-Sunnah, al-Malāzim lil-ʿIbādah, al-ʿĀlim al-Fāḍhil, al-Muḥaddith, al-Faqīh, Raʾis al-Muḥaqqiqīn, al-ʿAllāmah, al-Shaykh, t</em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="color: #003366;">he defender of the Prophetic Sunnah and Salafī ʿAqīdah, the destroyer of innovations, the Mujāhid, the upholder of the word of Allāh, firm in the Sunnah, inherent in worship, the virtuous scholar, the scholar of hadith, the jurist, the leader of the researchers, the savant, the learned.</span><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a formidable scholar who spread Islam throught the lands he travelled to. He travelled from town to town, village to village and city to city spreading the message of Tawḥīd and Sunnah and reprimanded Shirk and Bidʿah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once a person upon Tawḥīd called Shaykh Badīʿ to his village to deliver a lecture. When the Shaykh arrived at the Masjid the adminstrators stopped him from delivering his lecture. <strong>He then proceded to his house and delivered his lecture on his roof.</strong> So, in the middle of the silent night, on the roof with only one listener the Shaykh began his lecture, and with his powerful voice and stature, his words echoed and resonated across the whole village, and when he recited the Qurʿān in his uniqe melodious manner and expounded Tawḥīd, the people started to come out of their houses, slowly by slowly until a huge crowd had assembled in the bazzar. <strong>Then they started listening attentively until many of them adopted the dawʿah of</strong> <strong>Tawḥīd</strong>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This relentless effort in calling to <strong>Tawḥīd</strong> in remote parts of Sindh and in Pakistan led to everyone knowing the daʿwah of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth and the call of the Messengers. So much so that when the Shaykh began his daʿwah in Sindh there was not a single Masjid of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth there and when he died there were over <strong>eight hundred (800)</strong> Ahl al-Ḥadīth Masājids in Sindh and its interior. <strong>Shaykh Zubayr ʿAlī Zaʾī</strong> said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>The Shaykh despite being busy in writing and researching, especially the Tafsīr of the Qurʾān, he would diligently take time out for his students. Whenever he would teach, it would seem that he had prepared his notes but in reality this was the phenomenon of his remarkable memory. Some of the most difficult quotes and passages would flow off his tongue without any difficulty. He vehemently opposed the <strong>Khawārij and the Takfirīs and was firm on the methodology of Ahl al-Sunnah wa Ahl al-Ḥadīth</strong>. His every prayer was engrossed in intense servitude and worship that one would sense it was his last prayer.</em><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was intelligent, incisive and perceptive, which was evident from many incidences. Once he was abruptly asked by a muqallid to prove the Ṣalāh from Bukhārī and Muslim and the Shaykh obliged him.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> <strong>Shaykh ʿAbdul ʿAzīz al-Sadḥān</strong> said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>Some of the scholars informed me that the Imām of Ḥaram, Shaykh Muḥammad Subayyal would attend the lessons of Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn in the Ḥaram of Makkah. I was informed that once he was asked a question and he replied by quoting approximately Fourty (40) Ayāt and Thirty (30) Aḥadīth.</em><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>His Remarkable Memory</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the elders who spent time with Shaykh Badīʿ would say he had memorised voluminous books. They included the works of the Salaf, Imām Shawkāni and the works of Imām ibn Ḥazm. They say he knew <em>al-Muḥallā</em> of Ibn Ḥazm by heart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once the Shaykh memorised a whole Sūrah while travelling on a camel, either Sūrah al-Nūr or Sūrah al-Anfāl and the journey was approximately only 30-40 minutes.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> He memorised the whole Qurʾān in Three to Four (3-4) months when he was approximately Thirteen (13) years old.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another scholar mentions that once Shaykh Badīʿ came to their institute and delivered a lecture in which he opened all the doors of the sciences of Islam. <strong>During the lecture the Shaykh quoted from Ḥāfiẓ ibn Ḥajr’s <em>Fatḥ al-Bārī</em> numerous times and also quoted the volume and page numbers.</strong> The scholar mentions that he noted all of the references and quotes. When he returned home after a few days he checked each and every reference and he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>‘By Allāh, every single quote, the volume and page number were unequivocally accurate and I did not find a single difference in the wording of the quotes, they were verbatim.’</em><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Praised by the ʿUlamāʾ</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A teacher in a Salafī University in Pakistan was advising his students of the knowledge and status of Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn and he mentioned an incident. Once a student who wanted to study the Islamic sciences asked <strong>Shaykh ʿAbd ʿAzīz ibn Bāz</strong> which scholar has taqwa and is strong and firmly grounded in knowledge who I can go to to seek knowledge. <strong>Shaykh Ibn Bāz</strong> replied:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>Go to such and such place in Pakistan and there will be a man there called Badīʿ al-Dīn, go to him and seek knowledge from him.</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, the student travelled to Pakistan to Shaykh Badīʿ and told him why he had come to seek knowledge and how <strong>Shaykh Ibn Bāz</strong> had advised him. Upon hearing this Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn started to cry and then said to the student:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #003366;">What a strange thing you say, you leave an ocean of knowledge and come to a small river, return to <strong>Ibn Bāz</strong> and seek knowledge and spend time with him.   </span>    </span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great scholar and Muḥaddith, <strong>Shaykh ʿAtā Allāh Ḥanīf Bhuwjiyānī</strong> wrote in the introduction to one of Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn’s book:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>The learned researcher of our jamāʿah, belonging to the well known Rāshidī family.</em></span><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And his well known student and the notable scholar of Ḥadith, <strong>Shaykh Zubayr ʿAlī Zaʾī</strong> mentions:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>If someone were to me ask while I was standing between Rukn al-Yamānī and Maqām Ibrāhīm about this Shaykh (i.e Badīʿ al-Dīn) I would say; I swear by Allāh I have never seen anyone of the likes of Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn in terms of knowledge and his comprehension.</em><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Zubayr</strong> further said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em><strong>Shaykh Muḥammad Ṣiddīq bin ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz Sarghodwī</strong> said: ‘The researcher scholar’ and I heard <strong>Shaykh Muḥammad ibn Ḥadī al-Madkhalī</strong> say in his house; ‘We do not hear anything about him, except good.’</em><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Ṣalāh al-Dīn Yūsuf</strong> described him as:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>A sign from the signs of Allāh.</em><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Rabīʿ ibn Hadī al-Madkhalī</strong> said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>Al-Shaykh al-ʿAllāmah al-Muḥaddith al-Faqīh, the one with deep comprehension, beneficial to the students and of great stature.</em><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh died in 1416/1996. May Allāh have mercy on him, Āmīn.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Rasheed Barbee</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Question</strong>:</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is there a difference between the innovation that is considered a sin and the innovation that takes a person outside the fold of Islam?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yes; there is innovation that takes a person outside the fold of Islam such as denying that Allah will be seen in the afterlife, denying that Allah is above His creation, making supplication to other than Allah, sacrificing to other than Allah, these are all types of innovation that take a person outside the fold of Islam, but we don’t declare a person to be outside the fold of Islam until we have established the proof against him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is because some of the people have had the doubts heaped upon them and they are far removed from the era of the Prophethood and far removed from the light of Prophethood. As a result they fall into innovations such as these; and these innovations take the person outside the fold of Islam. We say, denying that Allah will be seen in the afterlife is disbelief, as is denying that Allah is above His creation, and claiming that the Koran is created is also disbelief, major disbelief.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">But as for the one who says, I bear witness that no one has the right to be worshipped except and Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and he prays and he fasts and he desires paradise and he believes in it etc, etc; then perhaps some of the doubts of the people of falsehood came to him and piled up upon him until he fell into the aforementioned innovations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we say to him, you fell into disbelief and the proof is this and that and we make it clear to him. So if Allah gives him the success to return to the truth then all praises belong to Allah, if not then we will say he is a disbeliever only after the proof has been established against him. As for the innovation that is sin then it is different than this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example I see him with rosary beads (dhikir beads) these rosary beads, oh my brothers, there origin is taken from the Christians and the Hindus! These beads are something which is foreign to the Muslims. Who were they taken from? (They were) taken from the Hindus and the Christians, the Christians took them from the Hindus. And I have seen for myself a Christian monk wearing these beads and a Hindu monk wearing these beads and they were using these beads and now the innovators from the Muslims have taken these beads from them. And other than this from the different types of innovations such as the different types of remembrance that have in them deviation from what is correct as for these types of innovations we don’t say they remove someone from the fold of Islam. We don’t say that a person has left Islam except with proof, and we don’t say that a person is a sinner (fasiq) except with proof. So although it is bida you don’t automatically make him a sinner because of it, but he becomes a sinner after it has been made clear to him after it has been made clear and he stays upon this bida then he becomes a sinner (fasiq).</span></p>
