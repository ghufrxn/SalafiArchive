<h5 style="text-align: center"></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[119] From Malik from Ishaq Ibn Abdillah Ibn Abi Talha from Anas Ibn Malik (Radi Allahu Anhu) that he heard him saying, Abu Talha (Radi Allahu Anhu) said to (his wife) Um Sulaim (Radi Allahu Anha), &#8220;I have heard the voice of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) which was feeble, and I think that he is hungry. Have you got something (to eat)?&#8221; She took out some loaves of barley bread, then took her face-covering sheet and wrapped the bread in part of it, and pushed it under my garment and turned the rest of it around my body and sent me to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). I went with that, and found Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) in the Masjid with some people. I stood up near them, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) asked me, &#8220;Have you been sent by Abu Talha (Radi Allahu Anhu)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) asked, &#8220;With some food (for us)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said to all those who were with him, &#8220;Get up!&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>(So Anas (Radi Allahu Anhu said) He (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) set out (and all the people accompanied him) and I proceeded ahead of them till I came to Abu Talha (Radi Allahu Anhu). Abu Talha (Radi Allahu Anhu) then said, &#8220;O Um Sulaim (Radi Allahu Anha)! Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) has arrived along with the people, and we do not have food enough to feed them all.&#8221; She (Radi Allahu Anha) said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) know better.&#8221; So Abu Talha (Radi Allahu Anhu) went out till he met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Then Abu Talha (Radi Allahu Anhu) and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) came and entered the house. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, &#8220;Um Sulaim (Radi Allahu Anha)! Bring whatever you have.&#8221; So she brought that very bread. The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) ordered that it be crushed into small pieces, and Um Sulaim (Radi Allahu Anha) pressed a skin of butter on it. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said whatever Allah wished him to say (to bless the food) and then added, &#8220;Admit ten (men).&#8221; So they were admitted, ate their fill and went out. The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) then said, &#8220;Admit ten (more).&#8221; They were admitted, ate their full, and went out. He (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) then again said, &#8220;Admit ten more!&#8221; They were admitted, ate their fill, and went out. He (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) admitted ten more, and so all those people ate their fill, and they were around 70 or 80 eighty men.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/927, 928 hadith no.1789, book 49, chapter 10, hadith no.19), at-Tamhid (1/288, 289) and al-Istidhkar (no.1722) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.5381) and Muslim (no.2040) from the hadith of Malik </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">*From the narration of Yahya Ibn Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">**From the narration of Yahya and it has come in the original &#8220;Haluma&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) This narration is another proof of Muhamad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam&#8217;s) Prophethood and was a great miracle whereby around 70 people ate to their fill from only a little amount of food.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Apart from the exception of the wisal fasts, the noble Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) sometimes used to become hungry. During the wisal fasts Allah the Most High used to feed and nourish the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) just as it is established from other ahadith. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) The people of Iman should give each other invitations so that love is increased between them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) It is allowed to occasionally take other people to a feast who have not received an invitation to it, only when the friend who has given you the invitation fully trusts you but remember that it is not allowed to put a Muslim brother in any difficulty. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) The aqidah of the companions was that Allah and His Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) knew what was best however just to be clear they did not hold the aqidah that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was the knower of the unseen because only Allah has the specific attribute of being the Knower of the unseen. There are many evidences in the Quran and Sunnah which show that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was not the knower of the unseen and some of them evidences are present in this book. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) If there is not enough space in the house then it is allowed to feed people in groups after groups. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and the noble companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) went through a lot of difficulty during their lives. On some occasions they couldn&#8217;t find anything to eat however they were still patient and thankful. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) You should try to feed your guests and those who have been invited to the feast with the best of foods. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">9) It is allowed to welcome and receive the guests and friends outside of the house. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">10) You do not need permission to enter into your own home. Similarly, those who have been invited to your home by you do not need permission to enter it. </span><span style="color: #000000">Apart from the above there are further benefits as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It is allowed to make a dua for blessings on the food before eating it. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">It is allowed to give necessary orders in the house of a friend that fully trusts you. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">When you have food it is allowed to eat till one&#8217;s stomach is full occasionally otherwise it is better to to make 3 parts for the stomach (i.e. water, air, food)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">You should always submit to whatever decision the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) made whether we comprehend it with our limited understanding or not. </span></li>
<li>All types of food are permissible to eat (for example buttered bread) except for those foods which the Sharia has prohibited.</li>
</ol>
