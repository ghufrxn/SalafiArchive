				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous soofee Abu Bakr Shiblee said he was taught tasawwuf (ie given the Khirqah-cloak) by Junaid Baghdaadee and he by his uncle Saree Saqtee and he by Ma’roof Karkhee and he by Dawood Ta’ee and he by Habeeb Ajmee and he by Hasan Basree and he by Alee (Radhiallaahu Anhu) and he was taught tasawwuf by the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> This is the Silsilah that is very famous according to the soofee’s and the basis of soofism is based upon this chain but this silsilah is based upon total lies and it is a fallacy according to the great scholars of hadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Imaam al-Muhadditheen the teacher of Imaam Bukhaari, Imaam Alee ibn al-Madeenee said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"> “Hasan al-Basree only saw Alee in Madeenah when he was a child.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Imaam Abu Zur’ah said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"> “Hasan al-Basree did see Alee but he did not hear (narration’s) from him.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Imaam Ibn Abee Haatim said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="color: #000080;">“When the oath of allegiance to Alee occurred in Madeenah, Hasan (al-Basree) was only fourteen (14) years old then Alee went to Koofah and Basrah and Hasan was not able to meet him again for a second time.” (Kitaab al-Maraaseel Ibn Abee Haatim (pg.31).</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> From the statements of these Imaams it shows Hasan al-Basree only saw Alee (Radhiallaahu Anhu) during a time of tribulation and at the age of 14 and unknown he would have been able to get to Alee. It is also inconceivable that Alee would have left the major and minor companions and gives the inner secrets of tasawwuf Ie the Khirqah (cloak) to a 14-year-old boy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> This is why Shaah Waleeullaah Dehlwee said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"> “According to the soofee’s the attribution of Hasan to Alee is correct but the Scholars of hadeeth do not consider this to be correct or authentic.” (al-Intibaa Fee Salaasil al-Awliyaa (pg.31).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The Scholars of Hadeeth traveled city to city to learn hadeeth and its sciences however they were unable to acquire information concerning the fallacy that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) might have given Alee a cloak of inner knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The famous scholar of hadeeth Allaamah Saklhawee, Imaam Ibn as-Salaah and Imaam al-Hadeeth Haafidh Ibn Hajr Asqalaanee have all said this narration of the Khirqah (ie cloak) is a lie and fabrication.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> So Haafidh Sakhawee said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"> “Ibn as-Salaah said it is baatil (false)….. and Ibn Hajr said it is a lie and slander that Alee gave Hasan the inner cloak of knowledge. And according to the Imaams of Hadeeth it is not established that Hasan heard from Alee and that he received the cloak of inner knowledge.” (al-Maqaasid al-Hasanah (pg.331).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Allaamah Taahir Muhaddith of Hindh also mentioned the statement of Haafidh as-Sakhawee and said after,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"> “This incident is false and fabricated.” (Tadhkirratul Mawdhoo’aat (pg.191).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Similarly the famous Muhaddith Allaamah Taqee ud deen said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"> “This is not established from Alee authentically.” (Kashf al-Khafaa of Ejloonee (2/138).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Imaam Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“The evidence for the khirqah narration is not narrated via an authentic, hasan or weak chain and that which has been narrated is false and lies.” (Kashf al-Khafaa of Ejloonee (2/138), al-Maqaasid al-Hasanah (pg.331)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">These were the statements of the scholars of hadeeth that the narration, which mentions the beginning of the soofee’s to be baseless and false. So you should think yourself now, that which has been based upon lies and fallacies how can one hope for good and blessings from it.</span></p>
