<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[117] From Malik from Ishaq Ibn Abdillah Ibn Abi Talha from Anas Ibn Malik (Radi Allahu Anhu) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) used to visit Um Haram bint Milhan (Radi Allahu Anha), who would offer him meals. Um Haram (Radi Allahu Anha) was the wife of Ubada bin As-Samit (Radi Allahu Anhu). Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam), once visited her and she provided him with food and started looking for lice in his head. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) slept, and afterwards woke up smiling. Um Haram (Radi Allahu Anha) asked, &#8220;What causes you to smile, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam)?&#8221; He (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said. &#8220;Some of my followers who (in a dream) were presented before me as fighters in Allah&#8217;s cause (on board a ship) amidst this sea caused me to smile; they were as kings on the thrones (or like kings on the thrones).&#8221; (Ishaq, a sub-narrator is not sure as to which expression the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) used.) Um Haram (Radi Allahu Anha) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam)! Invoke Allah that he makes me one of them. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) invoked Allah for her and slept again and woke up smiling. Once again Um Haram (Radi Allahu Anha) asked, &#8220;What makes you smile, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam)?&#8221; He (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) replied, &#8220;Some of my followers were presented to me as fighters in Allah&#8217;s Cause,&#8221; repeating the same dream. Um Haram (Radi Allahu Anha) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam)! Invoke Allah that He makes me one of them.&#8221; He (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa SAllam) said, &#8220;You are amongst the first ones.&#8221; It happened that she sailed on the sea during the Caliphate of Mu&#8217;awiya bin Abi Sufyan (Radi Allahu Anhu), and after she disembarked, she fell down from her riding animal and died.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [IT&#8217;S CHAIN IS SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/464, 465 hadith no.1026, book 21, chapter 18, hadith no.39), at-Tamhid (1/225) and al-Istidhkar (no.963) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.2788, no.2789) and Muslim (160/1912) from the hadith of Malik </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Um Haram and Um Sulaim were sisters (Radi Allahu Anhuma). Ibn Abdul Bar said, &#8220;I think that Um Haram or Um Sulaim (Radi Allahu Anhuma) breast fed the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) meaning one of them was his (Sallahu Alayhi Wa Sallams) foster mother and the other was the foster aunty. See at-Tamhid (1/226) the same thing was mentioned by Imam Abdullah Ibn Wahb al-Misri and other than him. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) If a woman uses her husband&#8217;s wealth to feed someone and the husband does not show any signs of being displeased then this food is halal, and the woman&#8217;s husband also receives the reward. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) Performing Jihad against the disbelievers at sea and making navy ships is a highly virtuous act to do. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) It is allowed for women to participate in Jihad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) It is allowed for men and women to travel by sea.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) It is allowed for every Muslim to perform Jihad under the leader, whether he is a king or Khalifah etc.,  until the day of Judgement. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) This hadith shows the great virtue of Mu&#8217;awiya Ibn Abi Sufyan the one who wrote down the revelation. This great Jihad campaign was carried out under his supervision and the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was happy about it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) The reward for someone who is martyred in the path of Allah or someone who dies due to a medical reason in the path of Allah is the same and according to some scholars the martyr receives more reward.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">9) According to some scholars the Jihad performed at sea is more virtuous then the Jihad performed on land and this is seen to be the most correct view in this era therefore the Muslims should make a great amount of effort in manufacturing the best navy ships. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">10) It is mentioned in another version of this narration which has an authentic chain that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) slept in the early afternoon i.e. he performed a siesta and that Um Haram carried out the Jihad at sea with her husband Ubadah Ibn Samit (Radi Allahu Anhuma). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Further benefits from this hadith are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">1) This battle campaign and Jihad at sea of Mu&#8217;awiya (Radi Allahu Anhu) was during the Caliphate of Uthman (Radi Allahu Anhu) and Um Haram (Radi Allahu Anha) died at a place called Qabras. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2) The dreams of the Prophets (Alayhimusalam) are revelation. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">3) This hadith is also a proof of Muhamad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam&#8217;s) Prophethood. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) explained about some of the unseen things which happened after his death and was witnessed by peoples eyes. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">4) Those narrations which mention that it is prohibited to travel by sea are all weak and rejected. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">5) Having the desire to participate in good deeds implies you have Iman. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">6) It is allowed to ask someone to make dua for you when it comes to good deeds. </span></p>
