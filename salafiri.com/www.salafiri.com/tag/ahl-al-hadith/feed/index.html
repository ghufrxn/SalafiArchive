				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">(This biography from is <em>Maqalat Irshad ul-Haq Athari</em>, 4:369-403, which I have very slightly adapted)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">[tn. introduction: This a very brief biography of Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi by his astute and perceptive student, Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq Athari. We find that the true people of knowledge have lofty, praiseworthy and beautiful character which is in accordance with the true teaching of Islam. Despite their vast knowledge, you will find them in them humility, modesty and taqwa. This should be a lesson for all aspiring students of knowledge. Seeking fame, status, and using titles which are not befitting for you, is not from the way of the Salaf, and is in fact a dangerous disease of the heart. Do not be amazed with the little knowledge Allah has given you, and never consider yourself above your brothers]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If a person is born with the qualities of knowledge and acting upon it, insight, virtue, truthfulness, zuhd, taqwa, honesty, integrity, intelligence and other qualities then we say this is the likes of <strong>Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi</strong> who died in <strong>Ramadhan 1405H corresponding to 4<sup>th</sup> June 1985</strong> on a Tuesday to meet his creator and left behind thousands grieving his loss.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was unwell for a while and it was during this period that I had the opportunity to meet him every so often. The last occasion was during the last days of Sha’ban (of that year) when his situation worsened and so I went to enquire regarding his health. He was unable to hear and all that remained was an acquaintance, and so I returned home in a state of sadness and grief. People would ask me concerning the Shaykh and I would say to them May Allah wish good for him as his health situation is bad and worrying. Thereafter, after a period of 4 months of illness the Shaykh passed away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The writer of these words sought knowledge and benefitted from the Shaykh in 1968</strong>. Liyaqatpur was my native area and in 1963 I completed the beginner level books from the local deobandi madrassah Qasim al-Ulum. My teachers advised me to go to Jamia Rashidiyyah in Sahiwal or Khayr al-Madaris in Multan (the madrassah of Mawlana Khayr Muhammad Jalandhari) however Mawlana Mufti Abdur Rahman of Kehraurpaka advised me to go al-Jamia al-Salafiyyah in Faisalabad, this was not because he was an Ahl al-Hadith but rather because his friend Shaykh Sharifullah Khan was teaching there, who was considered an expert teacher of the Ma’qulat. So eventually with my father’s permission I enrolled at al-Jamia al-Salafiyyah. However, Shaykh Sharifullah Khan had left al-Jamia al-Salafiyyah in 1962, nonetheless he was replaced by his student, the teacher of the scholars, Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Abdullah Budhiyamalwi.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> After completing the middle level education I went to Gujranwala to Jamia Islamiyyah Chah Shahan in my last year and this is when I had the opportunity to attend the lessons of the Shaykh (Muhammad Ghonadalwi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Lessons</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In my brief life I’ve had the opportunity to attend the lessons of various Shuyukh and teachers of the era but the prestige I experienced in Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi’s lessons I never experienced elsewhere. We had read about the special care and attention Imam Malik would undertake to deliver his lessons, while first performing Wudu, combing his hair, use Kohl and perfume himself, wear fine clothes and then teach, then our Shaykh would also do the same. He would always arrive on time. As soon as he would enter the masjid he would offer 2 rak’ahs for Tahayyatul Masjid and then focus on his lesson on hadith. One day there was torrential rain and the days were very cold, some us assumed that today the Shaykh won’t come and the lesson will be cancelled, however one our friends came running and told us while he was in a state of shock that the Shaykh is coming, so we all scurried and the Shaykh as per his norm, entered the Masjid and prayed his Tahayyah. Mawlana Muhammad Ali Muslim Chima mentioned to me that before the Shaykhs residence in Abadi Hakim Rayy he would travel from Ghondalwala every day by bicycle, we never ever saw him to be late, even once. One day the Shaykh generally mentioned that it has been five (5) years (in the teaching post) and it is Allah’s blessing that I have never been late for Madrassah, not even one day. Alas, where do we find people who fulfil their obligations with such responsibility nowadays.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the Tahayyatul Masjid he would sit in his position with great care composure and begin his lesson. The Shaykh had so much respect and reverence for hadith that even after one and a half hours he would remain sitting calmly in the same position and would at the very least just move his feet up and down, despite tiredness due to age, which is a natural affair. There was no possibility at all of him lying down on a pillow (due to the respect of hadith). During the lesson if he needed to scratch himself somewhere he would not stop saying the beloved words of <strong><em>Qala Qala Rasul Allah….</em></strong> He would respond to the Salam and and say Walaykum Asalam to whoever was attending the lesson. He would turn to the guest as soon as he would finish his lesson, greeting them with a smile and then ask them how they were, thereafter address their reason for coming.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Shaykh’s Qualities</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With Allah’s infinite blessings, he had a remarkable memory and vast knowledge. <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti</strong> wrote the truth when he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“His mind and memory were remarkable and without match. The affair of vast knowledge was as such that when he would talk about a matter, all the discussions and information pertaining to that matter would be put forth and nothing would be missed while his speech was articulate and continuous, there was no hesitancy or stuttering in his speech (when delivering ilm).”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many of his students have verified the veracity of his memory and presented ample testimonies which can be read in the special edition of <strong><em>al-I’tisam, vol.38, issues 1-2</em></strong>. In this regard you may read the testimony of <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Ashraf Sandhu</strong>, he writes:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Shaykh Hafiz Abdullah Amritsari’s memory and recollection was such that he had complete mastery over all books of Ulum and Fiqh. We observed regarding very difficult issues that when he needed to open a book to refer to an issue, then he would be at the right place straight away. This was also the affair with Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi, that whatever book he consulted, the themes and context would be completely preserved and accurate.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The result of this powerful memory was that when he would speak, it would be as if he was turning the pages and reading from the book and there was no feeling that he was slowing down or having difficulty in what he was teaching. He would teach the basics of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> for example, the difference between the Quran and hadith, the difference between Sunnah and khabar, the authority of hadith, the preservation of hadith, the writing of hadith, the categorization of the books of hadith, a summary of the life and times of Imam al-Bukhari, the importance of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari </em>and its authority, likewise and similarly the authority khabar al-wahid, <strong>the specification of khabar al-wahid and issues of apparent contradiction which would last approximately 15-20 days</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-8796 alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?resize=381%2C233" alt="Minhatul Bari" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?resize=300%2C183 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?resize=768%2C468 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?resize=1024%2C624 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?w=1322 1322w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?w=1236 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would talk about apparently conflicting narrations and then mention that according to the Shafi’yyah the first stage is reconciliation <strong>(<em>Tatbiq/Jam’</em>)</strong> and if that was not possible then declaring one to be <strong><em>nasikh</em> </strong>and the other <strong><em>mansukh</em></strong> and again if this was not possible then they would try to show one as being <strong><em>rajih</em></strong> and the other <strong><em>marjuh</em></strong> (one has precedence over the other) and if all of this was not possible then the ruling from both reports would be dropped. With the Ahnaf the first stage was abrogation<strong> (<em>naskh</em>),</strong> then giving precedence to one report over the other and then the last stage of trying to reconcile between the two reports <strong>(<em>Tatbiq/Jam’</em>).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While mentioning this he would say that in one instance Mawlana Anwar Shah Kashmiri says that doing <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong> has precedence over <strong><em>tatbiq</em></strong> because taking the <strong><em>rajih</em></strong> position is in line with the human natural disposition. However, at the same time he says and holds the view that it is permissible to specify the Qur’an (made <strong><em>takhsis</em></strong> of) by the Sunnah, whereas this is in reality from the angle of <em>tatbiq</em> and it is absolutely clear and manifest that the Quran is <strong><em>rajih</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, according to the Hanafiyyah specifying the Sunnah with the Sunnah and specifying the Quran with Mutawatir hadith and vice versa is permissible and they do not look at the strength of the evidence in this regard. He further said, (i.e. Shaykh Ghondalwi said) that it is amazing that Mr Kashmiri in this discussion of Usul holds the position of the Hanafiyyah to be correct, in that <em>tarjih</em> is the first stage compared to <em>tatbiq</em> but the various statements of Imam Abu Hanifah contradict this view of the Hanafiyyah. He (Anwar Shah al-Kashmiri) said in <em>Kitab al-Ghusl</em> (in his explanation of <strong><em>Sahih al-Bukhari, Faydh al-Bari</em></strong>) that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Know that different reports which have been transmitted from our Imam on a single issue (i.e. Abu Hanifah), then the general position of our Mashaykh is to give one report <em>tarjih</em> first and to take the manifest report and leave the rare or uncommon report but I do not take this view. This is especially the case when the rare or uncommon report is supported by hadith, then in such instances I take that report without caring that it is a rare or uncommon report. This is because any reports from our Imam, May Allah have mercy on him (despite being rare) it is not possible that he did not have evidence from the ahadith or anything else and so if we find the hadith agrees with his report, then we take it. Yes, and if there is disparity between the views of the Mashaykh,<strong> <em>tarjih</em> </strong>is a possibility due to differences between them and sometimes reconciliation between their statements may defy the purpose of the difference. This is because there is no option other than <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong> contrary to the differences that emanate from a single person, when reconciliation has precedence. This is because the principle is that there should not contradictions in the statement of a single individual and therefore reconciliation should take precedence before making <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong>. It is strange that when our people see apparently contradictory ahadith, they try to reconcile them but when they find differences in statements of the Imam they take up the position of <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong> first and leave the method of reconciliation. I like that the contradictory statements that have from our Imam to be first reconciled provided there is no evidence established against this.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You clearly see his words (i.e. Anwar Shah Kashmiri’s) and then in the introduction<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> he gives <em>tarjih</em> precedence over reconciliation but then on the other hand when there are differences in the views or statements of a person,  he holds that reconciliation has precedence over <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In summary Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi would deliver some introductory lessons for a number of days before teaching <em>al-Bukhari</em>. During his lessons he would not only suffice with explaining why the hadith was under the relevant chapter heading, clarification of the juristic points from the hadith, discussions on the controversial issues, a clarification and explanation of the difficult words, but he would also, while treading the path of the scholars of hadith, present brief biographies of the narrators in the chain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example, during the explanation of the first hadith in <em>al-Bukhari</em>, regarding the point of <strong><em>“Hadathana al-Humaydi”</em> </strong>Imam al-Bukhari transmit the hadith from his famous teacher, Imam Abdullah bin al-Zubayr al-Humaydi al-Qurayshi al-Makki, who in turn was the student of Imam al-Shafi’i and of al-Qurayshi lineage. Imam al-Humaydi collated his narrations as a Musnad which has been printed in two volumes. Imam al-Bukhari, by transmitting from Imam al-Humaydi intended to show revelation began in Makkah and thus transmitted his first hadith from his Makki Shaykh. Likewise, and similarly, since Imam al-Humaydi was a Qurayshi and due to the Prophets Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam’s words, <strong><em>“Begin with the Quraysh”</em> </strong>he transmitted his hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since Imam al-Humaydi was Imam al-Shafi’is student, the student like his teacher was also critical of Ahl al-Rayy. Since Imam al-Bukhari had severely criticized Imam Abu Hanifah and some of the hanafi scholars said that Imam al-Bukhari’s criticism of Imam Abu Hanifah was due to the influence of Imam al-Humaydi and his other teacher, Nu’aym b. Hammad, whereas this is incorrect. Imam Muslim and Imam al-Nasa’i also criticized Imam Abu Hanifah, so were they also influenced by Imams al-Humaydi and Nu’aym b. Hammad? There is another al-Humaydi who is famous and he is Imam Abu Abdullah Muhammad b. Abi Nasr, who collated the (biographies) of the narrators of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em> and he was the student of Imam Ibn Hazm.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The second narrator in the chain is Sufyan and there are two famous scholars of hadith with this name. One is Sufyan al-Thawri and the other was Sufyan b. Uyaynah. They were the contemporaries of Imam Malik and from the most trustworthy scholars of hadith in Makkah. Imam al-Shafi’i said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If it were not for Malik and Ibn Uyaynah knowledge in Hijaz would have departed.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Uyaynah like Imam Malik was from the Taba Tabi’in and I remember him vividly saying this part that he read the footnotes of Mawlana Ahmad Ali Saharanpuri (Hanafi) who referred to him as <strong>“Makki al-Tabi’i”</strong> and then said he made a mistake. So he would introduce the narrators comprehensively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the characteristics of the scholars of hadith is that they also sought knowledge from people who were lower (in knowledge or younger) than them in status without any hesitation which led to a specific category in the science of hadith, <strong>‘the narrations of the senior from the junior’</strong>. No matter how many amazing qualities a teacher has, he is still a human at the end of the day and who is free from error or mistakes? Imam Abdullah b. Mubarak said: <em><strong>“Who is safe from error.”</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> So if a teacher makes a mistake and then his student corrects him in the gathering then the Muhaddith wont feel any anger nor have animosity for the student because the fundamental aim is serve knowledge without any inkling for fame. Our Hafiz was also an example of these qualities. Hence, once during the lesson on <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> we were going over <em>Kitab al-Manaqib</em> and we got to the hadith of Anas RadiAllahu Anhu pertaining to the mi’raj. Sharik b. Abdullah narrates from Anas RadiAllahu Anhu and while discussing the hadith, Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Sharik b. Abdullah made a mistake in this hadith, he was unable to preserve the wording of the narration due to his weak memory. When he became the Qadi of Kufah his memory deteriorated and changed. Other than changing the chronology of the explanation and the details he presented for, ‘thumma Haddathana Fatadli’ the scholars of hadith have criticized this.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When he finished speaking I gathered my courage and said, Shaykh this is not Sharik b. Abdullah al-Nakha’i al-Qadi but in fact it is Sharik b. Abdullah ibn Abi Nimr because Imam al-Bukhari did not take any narrations from Sharik Qadi.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> However Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi disagreed and said the individual was Sharik Qadi. However, I still gathered courage and expressed the same view and then the Shaykh stayed quiet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The next day as per usual the Shaykh after reciting the khutbah addressed me and said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“What you were saying yesterday is correct the narrator is not Sharik Qadi but rather it is Sharik b. Abdullah bin Abi Nimr, who is truthful but he made mistakes and the scholars of hadith have criticised some of the wordings of this narration.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One can learn the open mindedness of the Shaykh from this example and an expansive readiness to accept the truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While explaining the ahadith under the <strong>“Bab Halwatul Iman” (The Chapter on the sweetness of Iman”</strong> he said the reality of Iman and its sweetness is something physical and something that one can also feel when one has hatred and dislike for sins, his soul is refreshed (tr. This means he feels his Iman increasing) which causes nur to flourish on the individual due to righteous actions on a truthful believer and therefore sometimes he smells something foul on evil sins and something fragrant due to good deeds. The Shaykh went on to present numerous evidences for this and also mentioned the narration of Jabir b. Abdullah RadhiAllahu Anhu that he was with the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam when a foul smell arose so the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Do you know what this foul stench is? This is the smell from the mouth of the people who backbite the Muslims”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, the hadith:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“When a person lies the angels due to his lying, move away from him.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So I asked the Shaykh is it possible that can happen even now, i.e. being able to smell the fragrance or a foul smell due to deeds. The Shaykh replied the Companions would also experience this which was due to the favours and blessings of Allah upon them. So, if a person maintains a strong powerful link with Allah he would perhaps also experience this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another incident is what is mentioned by <strong>Muhammad Rafiq</strong>, when I saw him I told him that I was studying with Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi and upon hearing his name he was pleasantly surprised. So I asked him if he knew him and he replied very well. Then he mentions that he used to live in Sheikhpura and during the night he would hear a sound in the drains which would increase day by day. We called many people to recite but nothing worked. Then someone advised us to get Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi to do ruqyah, so we bought him to our house and he stayed the night and then when leaving in the morning he advised us to disperse some water throughout the house on which he had recited. This not only helped with the problem but we also smelt roses on the house for three days, so he is indeed a great scholar and sitting with him is an indispensable treasure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another incident which the Shaykh narrated to us was something that occurred during his teaching spell in the Islamic University of Madinah. There was a person who would have severe pain in his back which would start suddenly. The Shaykh instructed him to come to him when the pain arose. So one day he came and the Shaykh put his hand on the pain and informed the person the pain was due to the effect of magic. So the Shaykh did ruqyah on him for a few days and Allah cured him. So I asked the Shaykh how did he know magic was done on him. The Shaykh replied that when I put my hand on his back I could smell a foul stench and I realized this was due to the effect of magic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Under <strong>Kitab al-Ilm</strong>, in the chapter to fix duties in rotation for learning knowledge Imam al-Bukhari cites the hadith of Umar RadhiAllahu Anhu that briefly talks about the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam divorcing his wives. The Shaykh went onto say that Allamah Shibli Nu’mani expressed the view the hadith indicates the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam had divorced his wives but this was only a false rumour and that <strong>Hafiz ibn Hajr</strong> said this false rumour was perhaps spread by a hypocrite, Shibli Nu’mani thus concludes, that narrations in that period were fabricated based on the analogical reasoning (qiyas) of the narrator and therefore the narrations must be scrutinised to see how much of he narration was based on the qiyas of the narrator.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While discussing this Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi said this was a historical event during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and irrespective of the type of rumours, everything must be investigated. Allah says: <strong>“When a fasiq comes to you then verify.” (Surah al-Hujurat:6)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam had exemplary interactions with his wives but despite this he separated from them for a month. It is also possible that a hypocrite may have spread this rumour, however this has no connection whatsoever with the Ahadith of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam but just one incident. The same incident was investigated by Umar RadhiAllahu Anhu and the reality of the issue became clear. The Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam separating from his wives for a month, is something which is established. Qiyas or the rumour is only connected to the understanding of the narrator that the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam divorced his wives and then to form a principle that there is analogical reasoning in the Prophetic Ahadith by a narrator is totally incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then the Shaykh went onto discuss (the issues with) Allamah Shibli’s interpretation and understanding of narrations.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> The Shaykh also said Shibli also rejects the hadith of Qartas (i.e. the hadith of the paper and inkwell during the last days of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam), he claims it was only narrated by Abdullah b. Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma when he was young.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi explained, this view of Allamah Shibli is incorrect because Abdullah b. Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma narrated the incident during the era of the companions and numerous students narrated it from him and when it was not denied or rejected by a single one of them is a reality of its authenticity and just because only one companion transmits a narration does not cause it to be spurious. Abdullah b. Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma also narrated the hadith of talaq and likewise Umar RadhiAllahu Anhu narrated the hadith, actions are by intentions and no other companion narrates this hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The summary of these points is that Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi did not only rely on the books explaining al-Bukhari and other books of hadith but that he was also aware of the disease of the hadith rejectionists in the subcontinent. He also authored two specific books against the hadith rejectionists.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While discussing a mutual issue between a hadith transmitted by Imam al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>There are five types of kissing</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) The kissing of Rahmah, when a parent kisses their child, like the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam kissed Hasan, Hussayn and Fatimah RadhiAllahu Anhum</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) The kissing of greeting, like when Muslims meet each other which is the practice in the Arab lands</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) The kissing of compassion, when children kiss their parents</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) The kissing of desires, when a husband and wife kiss.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) The kissing of love i.e. family, when a brother kisses his brother.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the chapter of writing Ahadith the first hadith Imam al-Bukhari mentions is the hadith of Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu which mentions his sahifah, which contains the hadith: <em>“A Muslim must not be killed for disbeliever.” </em>Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi said while discussing this hadith that the 3 Imams, Malik al-Shafi’i and Ahmad issued their legal edicts in conformation to this hadith. However, Imam Abu Hanifah was of the view that if a Muslims kills a dhimmi then the Muslim shall be killed in retaliation. Allamah Kashmiri has defended the Imam and after a long discussion he presents the following four answers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) In the hadith the disbeliever that is referred to is a combatant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) This hadith is in relation to stopping the blood spilt in the days of ignorance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) The ruling concerning the life of a dhimmi is the same as a Muslims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) During the sermon of the conquest of Makkah the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam announced the laws of retribution for the killing of a Muslim and the dhimmi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These four points that are provided in answer are far fetched and incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) Explaining that the disbeliever in the hadith is a war combatant is an extremely superficial point because the blood of a combatant is permissible irrespective anyway. In fact this understanding is in relation to an attribute and Allamah Shawkani has explained that this understanding is also unreliable according to the hanafi scholars themselves.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) Restricting the hadith to the blood of the people of ignorance is a claim that is without evidence and specifying or restricting something without evidence or proof is impermissible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) The dhimmi is terms of his life is not equal to that of a Muslim, Allah says: <strong>“The people of the fire and the people of Jannah are not equal.” (Surah al-Hashr:20)</strong> he also said: <strong>“</strong><strong>and never will Allah give the disbelievers over the believers a way”</strong> <strong>(Surah al-Nisa:141)</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> and what has been transmitted by Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu: <strong><em>“The Muslims are equal in their retribution of blood.” </em></strong>Therefore, saying the dhimmi is equal to the Muslim in terms of the sanctity of life is incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) During the conquest of Makkah thinking the Muslims and the dhimmis were being addressed in wrong in the first place because the disbelievers are not permitted to enter Makkah and Mr Kashmiri himself, the incident he refers to he says the person was not a dhimmi but rather a someone who fell into the ruling of a dhimmi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being, the Shaykh was mindful of the various explanations of Bukhari from <strong><em>Fath al-Bari, Umdah al-Qari</em></strong> as well as Allamah Kashmiri’s notes, <strong>Faydh al-Bari</strong> and at times he would vehemently express his views when needed. Sometimes he would answer Mr Kashmiri and the Shafiyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once I asked the Shaykh:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Did you meet ever Allamah Kashmiri and have a discussion with him? He replied no, “I never met him, however, once he came to a conference organized by Mawlana Abdul Wahid and in those days an Arab student of knowledge used to study with me. So the student visited Mawlana Kashmiri and discussed some issues of aqidah with him. After his discussion with the Mawlana, any issues the student didn’t understand, he would come and ask me (and I would clarify them to him). So, this coming and going to Mawlana Kashmiri continued for a few days. In the end while leaving him, the student said to him (i.e. Mawlana Kashmiri):</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>لولا الشيخ محمد جوندلوي لأضللتني</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If it were not for al-Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi, you would have misguided me.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Shaykh as a Mufassir</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I also benefitted from the Shaykh while he explained and translated the meaning of the Qur’an. First the Shaykh would begin with discussion the issue of the Qur’an being the speech of Allah which would be followed by explaining the difference between the Quran and Hadith, defining the knowledge of tafsir, the methodology of tafsir, tafsir via transmitted reports and tafsir through opinion as well as other sciences like reason for revelation etc. Once I asked which tafsir was better, he replied if Mawlana Abdul Aziz Muhaddith Dehlawi had completed his tafsir it would have been unrivalled.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our Hafiz and Shaykh was also expert exegetist of the Quran in addition to being a great Muhaddith. I heard from some of the teachers in al-Jamia al-Salafiyyah that when the Shaykh was teaching there, he would deliver lessons on the Quran after the morning prayer and he took 10 months just on Surah al-Fatihah. While at al-Jamia Islamiyyah in Gujranwala, the Shaykh would deliver the Khutbah in Masjid of the Jamia. Shaykh Isma’il al-Salafi was also alive at the time and his sermons were also extraordinary on a range of issues and also include guidance on the socio-political issues which would also be published in <em><strong>al-I’tisam</strong></em> magazine. However, despite this I would pray behind Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi and I would be eager to know what the subject of the khutbah would be each week. The reader will be astonished to know, as I was, that the Shaykh spent almost a whole year explaining the ayah <strong>“He has certainly succeeded who purifies himself And mentions the name of his Lord and prays.”</strong> <strong>(Surah al-A’la: 14-15)</strong> in his Friday sermons every week.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh would say while detailing the requirements of the person who explains the Quran that: “It is necessary for an explainer of the Quran to have the following requirements, to have the correct belief accompanied with the correct intention, having knowledge of hadith and its sciences, the language of the Quran and that he should have comprehensive understanding of Imam Raghib’s <em><strong>Mufradat al-Quran</strong></em>. He must know Sarf, Nahw, the meanings, the knowledge of fiqh and its principles, speculative rhetoric and the knowledge of the variant methods in recitation, so that Allah’s aids him in his explanation.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It can be said without any hesitation that Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi possessed all these qualities and requirements. He would explain the ayah, <strong>“You Alone we worship and you alone we ask for help</strong>”<strong> (Surah al-Fatihah: 4)</strong> in a way that the listeners would be astounded. He would explain in detail the meaning of worship, the difference between worship and habitual norms or customs, why and how Allah should be worshipped and the reasons for worship. In this regard he would explain the difference between worship and obedience and refute the ideas of <strong>Allamah Mashriqi </strong>and<strong> Mawlana Mawdudi</strong>, who would say that establishing Allah’s law (on earth) was in essence and in reality worship and that the prayer, fasting and zikr were merely part of a training course.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh also clarified the difference between worship and obedience and also refuted the ideology and principles of <strong>Mawlana Mawdudi</strong> in a specific book titled, <em><strong>Tanqid al-Masa’il</strong> </em>which is printed. The book does not have the publication date, but it seems to be around 1957ce, this was when Mawlana Mawdudi deviated from his methodology of da’wah all of a sudden, and he would describe the first method of da’wah as the way of the Prophets. Thereafter, contrary to the first method, when he adopted the scientific method of da’wah, aiming for success and reformation with elections and leadership as a policy, which he declared to be prohibited and impermissible before.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people of knowledge know, with this (new) decision and policy of his, 70 of his close allies left him, some of whom were considered the pivotal central core of <strong>Jamat Islami</strong>. It has been a few years his previous associates refuted him, i.e. Mawlana Mawdudi’s understanding of worship, which include the likes of <strong>Mawlana Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi</strong> in his <strong><em>“Asr Hadhir Mein Din Ki Tafhim wa Tashrih” </em></strong>(The Understanding and Explanation of the Religion in Current Times) and Mawlana Manzur Ahmad Nu’mani’s <strong><em>“Mawlana Mawdudi Ke Sath Meri Rafaqat ki Sarghazisht Awr Ab Mera Mawqif”</em></strong> (The History of my Association with Mawlana Mawdudi and My Position on him Now) only when <strong>Mawlana Mawdudi’s</strong> book, <strong><em>“Quran Ki Char Bunyadi Istalahain”</em></strong> (Four Fundamental principles of the Quran) started to emerge in the market. However, our Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi sensed the danger way earlier and comprehensively refuted him in his <em><strong>Tanqid al-Masa’il</strong></em> and warned the nation from the dangerous ideas of Mawlana Mawdudi. May Allah give him a great reward, Amin. I wish to expand on his more but this is not the place for this, however, the avid reader can refer to <em><strong>Tanqid al-Masa’il.</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh said regarding the reality of ghulu while explaining the ayah <strong>“do not commit excess in your religion” Surah al-Nisa:171</strong> that Allah and his Messenger established the limits for the affairs of the Din and therefore exceeding that does not entail reward but rather it entails punishment. Exceeding the prescribed limits in the Din is ghulu and excessiveness. If this excessiveness is in belief, transactions, in places and situations it is considered ghulu, if it is in knowledge then it is considered to be implementation and if it is regarding mannerisms and worship then it is considered to be monasticism, if it is in customs or habits then it is considered compulsion. If it is it do with purification and to keep impurities away it is considered to be whisperings and if it is regarding the lack of preservation of the usul and furu then it is considered to be oppression.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said in explanation of the ayah <strong>“O you who have believed, enter into Islam completely” (Surah al-Baqarah:208)</strong> this ayah commands complete submission and obedience to Islam and a warning against the path of the misguided nations which traversed the path of shaytan <strong>“So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part” Surah al-Baqarah:85</strong>. It is incorrect to take some aspects of Islam and reject the rest and one can only abstain from misguidance after research. It is taqlid that pushed fanaticism and partisanship in Islam. The dissension and discord between the Hanafi’s and Shafi’s was so intense that let alone praying behind one another, they would not marry each other. They issued legal edict that debating with one another was like jihad and it was permissible to break the fast in order to debate with much energy and such historical facts are very lengthy to discuss.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The straight path which was one was divided into quarters and this was why <strong>Allamah Sha’rani</strong> said doing taqlid of one Madhhab does not act on the complete shari’ah. This ayah also refutes the notions above because it advocates complete submission and obedience to Islam and to live in peace and harmony because in <strong>fis silmi</strong> the meaning of silmi is also harmony. Allah said <strong>“And if they incline to peace” (Surah al-Anfal:61)</strong>, in this regard the meaning of the ayah would be oh honest people live with each other in complete harmony and peace and do not be disunited and differ while following the way of shaytan. The summary is that this ayah refutes the ideas bigoted taqlid and supports the concept of research and investigation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said in explanation of <strong>“Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans” (Surah al-Baqarah:62)</strong> he talked about the Sabiyyah and the condition of doing righteous deeds. He also mentioned that <strong>Mawlana Abul Kalam Azad</strong> made a mistake in understanding this ayah because he said that a jewish or christian person believes in Allah and the hereafter while doing righteous deeds, he will worthy of paradise and this is incorrect. This is because believing in Allah entails and obligates believing in the Messenger, who guides to the worship of the creator. So, therefore, if a person believes in Allah and not the Messenger he sent then this is synonymous in him rejecting Allah. In fact, a person has to believe in all of the Messengers and rejecting a single one is disbelief because the jews and Christians do not believe in Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam as the Messenger of Allah so therefore it is incorrect to say they have faith. This ayah also has the wording “and did righteousness” which is restricted to obeying and following the Prophet. Allah says <strong>“Say, [O Muhammad], &#8220;If you should love Allah, then follow me” (Surah Al-Imran:31)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Pakistan and Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In additional to Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi being a distinguished teacher, researcher, Muhaddith, Mufassir, Munazir and author, he was also involved in politics. He was in favour of the two state solution. This was the reason he supported Muslim league for the Pakistan independence movement and not only this, he was also the president of the Muslim league branch in Gujranwala and offered a credible role in the independent Pakistan movement.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Who does not know that the intent in establishing an independent Pakistan was solely to create an Islamic environment and in light of the Quran and Sunnah to spread the message of living (Islamically) to the sad state of affairs of the world and similarly to present a practical example of an Islamic state. However, how disconcerting is this affair that despite continuous efforts this noble and sacred ideology was sidelined that let alone completing this objective the future generations are distancing themselves from Islam. Most of the shortcomings lie and fall with our people of authority and leadership, who did everything in this country but nothing for Islam. This action of these people is synonymous to betraying Allah and his Messenger. Some of which they were punished for by the annexing of East Pakistan (i.e Bangladesh) and the remainder of which we hear on a daily basis. Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi vividly felt these realities so much so that it led him to write:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If the Islamic constitution is not established in Pakistan it will never be safe and there is a real danger that it might break way (into separate states) from a geographical, language and tribal (or regional) perspective. There is a dire need for the Islamic constitution to be established here due to logical perspective and not on the basis of religious devotion. So whoever wishes for a constitution other than an Islamic constitution to be established in Pakistan and he exerts efforts and works towards this, then in reality he is someone who betrays the country. They intend to weaken Pakistan and dividing in to states or wanting it to integrate with India again.&#8221;</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The affair is manifestly clear that there was only one way to protect and defend Pakistan and also to guard it from conflict, which was to establish an Islamic constitution immediately. However, due to stark reality this was not achieved and as a result the same things happened which Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi had expressed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this era, not just Pakistan rather the whole Islamic Ummah is subject to division and discord. The enemies of Islam are in agreement in exterminating the Muslims but a shame the Muslims are disunited. So what should the Muslims do, who feel the pain of the Ummah and what steps should they take. So Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi also offers some valuable advice and thoughts on this, he says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>In this era the world is divided into three parts, politically speaking; The socialist or communist block, the western block (Democracy) and the Islamic block. In such circumstances it is mandatory on all Muslims to support the Islamic Block and all of the Muslims countries should be united into one nation and they should be united on a single point of interest (or demand). All of the Muslims leaders of the different countries should be organised into a group which will make the decisions and all of them should have the same Islamic constitution as well as the education system and where as much as possible, to be lenient on distinctive law pertinent in the different countries as much as possible and finally anything that prevents unity between the Muslims which revolves around, nationalism and language, the utmost effort should be exerted to eliminate them.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, you can understand how much passion he had with regards to unifying the Muslims. He despised division and discord on a national level nor divisions on a global Islamic level. On the contrary he understood global Islam based on the words of the blessed Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam that: <strong><em>“The example of the Muslims is like a single body” </em></strong>as a single body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>An Embodiment of Knowledge and Action</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was in terms of his knowledge some one who upheld the Sunnah and a true embodiment of beneficial knowledge. He was scholar with taqwa and zuhd. He was someone who spent his nights awake in the servitude of Allah, in fact this was his norm from the days he was a student. <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Abduh</strong> narrates from <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Yunus Dehlawi</strong> when Shaykh Ghondalwi was studying in Delhi he would pray tahajjud in a masjid which was further away from Chandni Chowk. One evening he was going to the masjid when a guard blew his whistle. The Shaykh due to his simplicity decided to run and fell when he approached the masjid. The guard by then had caught up with him and arrested him under the pretense of being a thief. The masjid administrators eventually were able to free him once they found out. His night prayers were long with good recitation of the Quran. While reading the ayahs of glad tidings it would seem real. His trembling voice would give away his fear of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His attention to his prayer was such that his acclaimed student <strong>Shaykh Ataullah Hanif mentions the Shaykh never missed the first Takbir of the prayer for approximately 50 years</strong>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> He would also focus on the recommended acts besides those which were obligatory and Sunnahs. He would always offer 2 units of prayer when entering the masjid and would never sit without offering them. After offering his Tahajjud prayers at home he would go to the Masjid and instruct the Mu’adhin to call the Adhan at its correct and allocated time. He would then proceed to make zikr with full concentration.  After sunrise he would offer his Salatul-Duha and then return home and he would the same with the optional prayers after Maghrib.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My brother in Islam <strong>Shaykh Shahbaz Ahmad Salafi</strong> mentions once a questioner came before prayer time. He said i’ve come to know you are a senior scholar of this city, so could you assist me? After helping him the Shaykh said: <strong><em>‘Someone has misinformed you, Shaykh Muhammad Isma’il al-Salafi is the senior scholar, he is the khatib of the of the large masjid, im just a student of knowledge and the Imam of a small masjid.&#8217;</em></strong> After everyone had departed, his affair of humility and modesty was such that he cried through the whole prayer while he led us in prayer. Allah Allah, what a stature of humility, humbleness and modesty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The attachment Shaykh had with the Quran can be deduced from the following example that <strong>Shaykh Sufi Muhammad Akbar</strong> mentioned. In 1984 the Shaykh’s health deteriorated and he was taken to hospital. It was during the month of Ramadhan and the doctor prohibited him from fasting. During the days of severe health concerns he continued to make zikr and recite the Quran. <strong>Later, he expressed his sadness in not being able to fast but also expressed that during this period he was able to finish 30 recitations of the Quran, meaning that he would recite the whole Quran in one day</strong>. It was the same affair during the end of his days when he was in a hospital in Lahore, he was constantly engaged in the remembrance of Allah from his heart and tongue. When people would come to meet him and ask about his health, he would reply with a brief answer and then continue in his Zikr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One day after the Shaykhs death I visited <strong>Shaykh Ataullah Hanif</strong>, during the visit the phone rang. I gathered from the phone conversation Shaykh Hakim Abdul Rahim Ashraf was on the other end and he called to offer his condolences. Shaykh Ataullah’s voice spoke with fear and his eyes became wet and said in a very saddened tone, <em>“Hakim Sahib, not only has the Musnid of Ilm passed away but the gatherings of remembering and pondering have also finished.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh besides talking about knowledge would also encourage righteous actions and remembering Allah. I also had the pleasure to benefit from this and the issues that troubling me before I spent time with the Shaykh were alleviated by the Shaykhs admonitions and advices. In my early days there was a lack of attention but I eventually maintained a link of knowledge and its people. <strong>The Shaykh was unique that if I missed a lesson, he would ask about me.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After finishing my education, I joined Idarah Ulum al-Athariyyah and after every 2 or 4 months I would visit the Shaykh to ask about difficult issues. These gatherings would last long with the Shaykh. After departing from the Shaykh it would seem like I have acquired major wealth and it was this feeling that would give me the inclination to return.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once I went through a period when I was unable to achieve tranquility in my prayer, I was unable to concentrate on my zikr nor have the zeal to research. So, I wrote to the Shaykh. He replied very quickly and instructed me with some duas and invocations, after which those feelings disappeared.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have already mentioned his attention and focus on the obligatory and acts of sunan. After the second sajdah and the brief period of resting, it is the norm of the scholars of hadith to support oneself on the ground, but what is the defined method? This is something that was differed over. However, the Shaykh would support himself with his fists, just as one kneads dough. This resulted in marks on the knuckles, just as one get marks on the ankles (from Tawarruk). I remember very clearly while studying Sahih al-Bukhari when he explained this issue, he read the statement in the marginal notes of Sahih al-Bukhari (1:114), <strong><em>“The jurists says one should support himself just as one kneads dough, as cited by al-Kirmani.”</em></strong> He said the notes mention the word <em>al-Abin</em> but the correct ward is al-Ajin has <em><strong>al-Kirmani</strong></em> has mentioned in his explanation of <em><strong>al-Bukhari</strong> </em>(5:176).<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Abul Barkat Ahmad</strong> mentions the Shaykh would focus on fasting on the white days, but when he became weak he stopped keeping them. However, after this he suffered from nose bleeds and he said, <em>“I realise, the nose bleeds were controlled by fasting and this has happened due to not keeping the fasts.”</em> The point being the Shaykhs was a true example of the Salaf in terms of knowledge and action.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Jalal al-Din Ahmad Hashimi Ja’fari Banarasi (d.1279/1863)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was born in 1221H/1806 and hailed from the surrounding area of Banaras. He was born into a family of learned scholars and his father Shaykh Abdul A’la (d.1274) was also a learned man. A year after the Shaykh’s birth his mother passed away. His lineage as an Hashmite can be traced back. (Tazkirrah al-A’la, 3)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He sought knowledge from his father and also from Shaykh Ahmadullah Muhaddith Banarasi. He then travelled to Delhi and sought knowledge from the scholars, which included the well known scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith, Shaykh Shah Muhammad Isma’il Shahid (InshaAllah) (d.1246/1831) and Shaykh Abd al-Haq Muhaddith Banarasi (d.1286/1869). He studied important texts as well as the books of hadith with the aforementioned scholars of hadith and also received his ijazah from them. It was these two scholars who instilled the love of Amal bil-Hadith and following of the Sunnah in him. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 345)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Abd al-Hayy al-Hasani said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He received sanad in hadith from Shaykh Abd al-Haqq bin Fadhalullah al-Uthmani al-Niyutayni and he followed his way in rejecting taqlid and acting on the apparent texts. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir, 7:136)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had a powerful memory, as such that he would memorise a Juzz during the day in Ramadhan and then recite it in the evening in Tarawih. He also participated in the 1857 mutiny war but evaded capture. (Tazkirrah Ulama Hindh, 41; Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 346; Marqa’a Banaras, 244).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Despite being a scholar of the Din, he was an exceptional debater. He was a defender of the Sunnah and subdued innovations, and as such he didn’t tolerate anything contradicting the Sunnah. He debated with Mawlana Khurram Ali on the issue of reciting Fatihah behind the Imam and also authored the book, Fatihah al-Sawab Fi Qir’ah Fatihah al-Kitab in 1256H, which he translated into Urdu as, Zubdah al-Bab. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 345).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also authored, Zubdah al-Qawanin, Inbasat Ibarah al-Kafiyyah bil-Bayan al-Shafiyyah, Farahing Ikhwan al-Safa, Qawa’id Urdu, al-Qawl al-Mansur, Rakah Tarawih. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 346).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This outstanding scholar of the Ahl al-Hadith died in 1279H/1863CE.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(See, Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh, 345+; Tazkirrah al-A’la, 3+; Tazkirrah Ulama Hindh, 41; Marqa’a Banaras, 244; Tarajim Ulama Hadith Banaras, 71)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the existence of a remarkable scholar of the Ahl al-Hadith who died over 150 years ago, which again repudiates the tedious claim that the Ahl al-Hadith have only been around for 100 years. Likewise, it also answers the modern day understanding that Salafiyyah is a movement that started in the early 1900’s by Shaykh Muhammad Rashid Ridha and Muhammad Abduh, when we clearly have a scholar of the Ahl al-Hadith who died in the middle 19<sup>th</sup> century.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This fatwa of the great Ahl al-Hadith Shaykh, Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan shows the methodology of the Ahl a-Hadith. He clarifies mixing and sitting with people who hold such belief and ideas, let alone cooperating with them. And if Shaykh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan is not from the Akabarin, then I don&#8217;t know who is! Let me warn you dear readers, this Fatwa is not for the faint hearted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Sayyid Nawab Muhamamd Siddiq Hasan Khan Rahimahullah (d.1370/1890) was asked:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) Will the scholars of the Din and the Shari’ah clarify: the muqallidin group who perform taqlid of only one Imam, are they considered to be from Ahl al-Sunnah or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) And is the prayer behind them valid or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Is it permissible or impermissible to let them enter our Masjid and to have sittings and mixing with them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muqallidin of this type in India who have the obvious trait of having enmity and hatred against the people who act on Hadith, hurling slanderous lies and false accusations against them, being irritated with them for saying Amin loudly, raising their hands, placing the hands on the chest and reciting al-Fatihah behind the Imam, which are all established and proven from the authentic ahadith, that are not abrogated and are from raised reports that are not figuratively explained. Likewise, those who commit innovations like Milad, Urs (annual commemorative celebrations for saints) and going into seclusion for 40 days (like Sufis do for meditation and maraqabah) as well numerous other innovations, then they are out of the fold of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah and are like the other deviated sects like the Jahmiyyah, Murjiyyah and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is because they oppose Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l Jama’ah in hundreds of issues, in both Aqidah and actions. In fact, at times some of their beliefs and actions seem to be exactly like that of the Jahmiyyah and the Murji’ah, which will not be hidden from the reader of this treatise. What is to follow, are a few example of the issues, with regards to their Aqidah and actions (a few examples from a whole catalogue) in order to support my claim concerning them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqa’id</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They believe Iman does not increase or decrease, in fact they believe the Iman of an open wicked sinner, the Iman of the Prophets and the Angels is on the same level and equal, which is the Madhhab of the Murji’ah, which is a sect from among the misguided deviated sects as Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal as written in his treatise on Aqidah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>SECONDLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They believe that in all issues of the Din it is obligatory and compulsory to do taqlid of only one Imam, even if it opposes and contradicts the Quran and Hadith, whereas the Hanafi scholars have declared this type of taqlid to be shirk and have discoursed this under the ayah, <strong>“They took their rabbis and monks as lords beside Allah.”</strong> (Surah al-Tawbah, 9:31).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THIRDLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we find from Tafsir Mazhari of Qadhi Thanullah Panipati that the doors of ijtihad were closed with the four Imams and no one can be a mujtahid now, as Fatawa Durr al-Mukhtar mentions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>FORTHLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Isa Alayhis Salam descends, he will do taqlid of Imam A’zam (i.e. Abu Hanifah and this point is mentioned in Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:34.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We see refuge in Allah from these corrupt beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ACTIONS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(They say and hold the view)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) It is permissible for the Muslims to take interest from the non-Muslims in Dar al-Harb (a land that Muslims are at war with) (Sharh Waqayah, 3:130 Urdu) as it is also mentioned in the Farsi translation of Hidayah, published in Nawal Kishore, 3:96. (Durr al-Mukhtar, 3:149-Urdu, 1:43-Arabic).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) If someone has a nose bleed and the bleeding does not stop, then it is permissible for him to write the Quran on his forehead with either urine or blood. This is their respect for the Qur’an (Alamghiri, Delhi Print, 5:134, Arabic 1:154, Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:120-Urdu, Alamghiri, 3:404)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Masturbation does not break the fast as Fatawa Qadhi Khan states as mentioned in volume 1. (Qadhi Khan, 4:361)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) If a person is very aroused and fears fornication, then masturbating is obligatory as Radd al-Mukhtar the notes to Durr al-Mukhtar, Mujtabia Delhi print, p.165.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) If a man wraps his private part (male organ) in a cloth and has sexual intercourse with a woman while fasting and if the cloth is strong, he doesn’t have to repeat the fast nor have a bath for ritual impurity, as is mentioned in Barahana printed Matb’a Husami Lahore, 2:18.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) If a man conducts a wedding ceremony, marrying a man from the west to a woman from the east (meaning there is a difference of one year of journey time by walking) and then the women gives birth in 6 months, the man from the west will be considered to be the father and this will be considered his karamah (i.e. Miracle) even though the man and woman have not met. As mentioned in Fath al-Qadir in the notes to Hidayah, Nawal Kishore, 2:338. (Tablighi Behshiti Zewar, p.240 Lahore)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) Any animal bred while eating pig meat, is Halal as Ghayatul Awthar urdu translation of Durr al-Mukhtar, Nawal Kishore print, 4:196, mentions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) The revenue generated from fornication (i.e. prostitution) is lawful as Chalpi notes to Sharh Waqayah, Nawal Kishore Print mentions, p.298 in the footnotes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) Tanning pig skin purifies it and selling it is also permissible, as Muniyyah al-Musalli, Lahore print, p.32 states (Arabic edn. P.49, Mujtabai print).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10) the permissibility of doing tricks with Zakat. Meaning that if a person gives his wealth to either his wife or gifts it someone else, before the year is complete with the intentions that he doesn’t need to pay zakat, and then the wealth is returned to him after the year is complete, then this is permissible. Imam Abu Yusuf used to do this (Ihya al-Ulum, Arabic Nawal Kishore, 1:11, Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:505, Alamghiri, 10:334-335)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">11) If a man enters (i.e. sexually) a four legged (i.e. Animal) or a dead person and he does not ejaculate, it does not break his fast nor does he have to make ghusl, as Fatawa Qadhi Khan states, Nawal Kishore print, 1:105.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">12) Legal punishments ordered by the Qadhi are implemented inwardly and outwardly. For example, if a person claims that another mans wife is his wife and he gives a false testimony and then wins the trial, the woman will be his. Therefore, she will be lawful for him according to Allah’s law and the people and it is permissible for him to sleep with her and he will not be imprisoned according to Allah’s law. (Hidayah Matba Mustafai, 2:125, Sharh Waqayah, 3:59),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">13) If a person deliberately passes wind after reciting the Tashahhud, his prayer will be complete. (Sharh Waqayah Arabic Matb’a Nawal Kishore, 1:43, urdu 1:401).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">14) If someone borrows someone’s female slave and then commits fornication with her, there is no legal punishment on him despite knowing the female servant is unlawful for him i.e. an illicit sexual relationship. Hidayah Farisi translation, Nawal Kishore, 2:302-303.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 2</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The prayer behind such muqallidin will not be permissible, because we find from what has preceded that the beliefs and actions of these people oppose the way of Ahl al-Sunnah, in fact some beliefs and actions necessitate shirk and some corrupt the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 3</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Letting such muqallidin into your Masajid is impressible according to the shari’ah according to the ayah <strong>“</strong><strong>Expel them from wherever they have expelled you.”</strong> (Surah al-Baqarah, 2:191) and according to the command in the ayah, <strong>“Then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people.”</strong> (Surah al-An’am, 6:68). Therefore, mixing with them, sitting with them, marrying them, being with them in times of sadness and other interactions and connections are all unlawful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be clearly noted the commissioner of Delhi reconciled both parties and also issued a written tract which both parties agreed too, curbing the animosity and to pray behind each other as long as the prayer in not invalidated in order to preserve peace and prevent chaos. However, the muqallidin rejected this reconciliation again and concocted some baseless points. So, they returned to their original ways and began issuing posters and treatise against the people of Tawhid without caring for the reconciliation agreement.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ahl al-Hadith have always displayed a clear and pristine methodology, a methodology they acted upon, taught and passed down to their students. Let the reader not be confused with the two or three liner snippets which show a distorted representation of the methodology of our scholars. Such presentations show the deep understanding and the great insight our scholars possessed, which should not be conflated with a negligent and lenient approach to methodology. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholars of Ahl al-Hadith were fervent and unreserved when it came to matters of the Sunnah. Using oblique examples of the co-operation of the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafi Scholars with the people of innovation, based on national interests of the Muslims in a particular country or region is indeed the most negligent of examples to prove points of practise and methodology.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Someone asked Shaykh Ubaydullah Rehmani Mubarakpuri (d.1414H)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>QUESTION: </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">What is the ruling on acting on something that opposes the Sunnah, making the excuse that it is for the greater good (Maslaha) and unity while the general people and the Ahl al-Hadith remain silent on the matter, also what is the ruling on participating in it (i.e. such acts of unity that oppose the Sunnah)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER: </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">Acting on something that opposes the Sunnah, i.e. acting on innovations and participating in such things (events), remaining silent despite having the power (to rectify) on the basis of some worldly good or for the reason that unity remains intact between each other so that differences don&#8217;t arise, is a reprehensible thing and an evil act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Committing acts of innovation are tantamount to reckless sinning and remaining silent on such matters is compromising the Din, both of which are prohibited. It is indeed a great crime if the scholars and the general people have the ability and power to command the good and change evil but chose to remain silent. This is because commanding the good and forbidding the evil is an obligation of the Din.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, while giving daw&#8217;ah it is obligatory to act on:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">ادْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ وَجَادِلْهُم بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Invite (people) to the Way of your Rabb with wisdom and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better…”</strong> (Surah al-Nahl, 16:125)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">عَنْ جَرِيرٍ، قَالَ سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَقُولُ ‏مَا مِنْ رَجُلٍ يَكُونُ فِي قَوْمٍ يُعْمَلُ فِيهِمْ بِالْمَعَاصِي يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَى أَنْ يُغَيِّرُوا عَلَيْهِ فَلاَ يُغَيِّرُوا إِلاَّ أَصَابَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِعَذَابٍ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَمُوتُوا</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah RadhiAllahu Anhu: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If any man is among a people in whose midst he does acts of disobedience, and, though they are able to make him change (his acts), they do not change, Allah will smite them with punishment before they die. (Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah) (tr. Abu Dawud, no.4339)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, an individual should always exert effort in reviving and defending the Sunnah and extinguishing bid’ah in order to protect oneself from the punishment mentioned in this Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ‏ مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى كَانَ لَهُ مِنَ الأَجْرِ مِثْلُ أُجُورِ مَنْ تَبِعَهُ لاَ يَنْقُصُ ذَلِكَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurayrah RadiAllahu Anhu said that Allah’s Messenger said: He who called (people) to righteousness, there would be reward (assured) for him like the rewards of those who adhered to it, without their rewards being diminished in any respect. (Muslim) (tr. Muslim, no.2674)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ لِبِلاَلِ بْنِ الْحَارِثِ ‏&#8221;‏ اعْلَمْ ‏&#8221;‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ مَا أَعْلَمُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ قَالَ ‏&#8221;‏ اعْلَمْ يَا بِلاَلُ ‏&#8221;‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ مَا أَعْلَمُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ قَالَ ‏&#8221;‏ أَنَّهُ مَنْ أَحْيَا سُنَّةً مِنْ سُنَّتِي قَدْ أُمِيتَتْ بَعْدِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مِنَ الأَجْرِ مِثْلَ مَنْ عَمِلَ بِهَا مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (ﷺ) said to Bilal bin Al-Harith: &#8220;Know.&#8221; He said: &#8220;I am ready to know O Messenger of Allah!&#8221; He (ﷺ) said: &#8220;That indeed whoever revives a Sunnah from my Sunnah which has died after me, then for him is a reward similar to whoever acts upon it without diminishing anything from their rewards…. (al-Tirmidhi) (tr. Al-Tirmidhi, no.2677)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibrahim bin Maysarah said: Whoever honours an innovator then verily he has aided the destruction of Islām. (Transmitted by al-Bayhaqi in Shu’bal Iman in mursal form) (tr. al-Lalika’i, <em>Sharh Usul al-Ei</em><em>’</em><em>tiqad</em>, 1:139 no.267; al-Tabrizi, <em>Mishkat al-Masabih,</em> 1:189)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[4]</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Imam Ibn Hazm</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>384H-456H</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>(994c-1064c)</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Name, Genealogy &amp; Ancestry</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His kunyah is Abū Muḥammad and his full name and lineage is ʿAlī bin Aḥmad bin Saʿīd bin Ḥazm bin Ghālib bin Ṣāliḥ bin Khalaf bin Maʿdān bin Sufyān bin Yazīd, the freed slave of Yazīd bin Abū Sufyān bin Ḥarb bin Umayyah, al-Fārisī in origin al-Amawī al-Yazīdī al-Qurṭubī al-Ẓāhirī.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His forefather, Yazīd was a freed slave of Yazīd bin Abū Sufyān and thus he had Persian ancestry.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> His forefather, Khalaf was the first from the family who entered al-Andalus<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> while his grandfather, Saʿīd bin Ḥazm moved to Qurṭuba from Labla.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> His father, Aḥmad bin Saʿīd was considered to be learned and an honest man, with expertise in language and served as a minister for the grand vizier al-Manṣūr Muḥammad bin Abī ʿĀmir and his son, al-Muẓaffar.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ḥazm takes his name from his great grandfather Ḥazm. It is well known that Ibn Ḥazm was born in Qurṭuba ie Cordoba, however, some authors have given him the attribution of Lablī due to his ancestral home of Labla.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> Labla is the Arabic name given to the town of Niebla which is in the Spanish province of Huelva of Andalus. Ibn Ḥazm was born on the 30<sup>th</sup> of Ramaḍān 384/994 which he had wrote himself and gave to his student, Ṣāʿid bin Aḥmad, Abuʾl Qāsim.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Childhood and a Brief Sketch of his Early Life </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imām Ibn Ḥazm spent almost all his life exclusively in al-Andalus while spending a few months in al-Qayrawān in North Africa. He had intentions to venture east to Baghdad and other centres of learning, however this dream was never achieved. He was bought up in an affluent family since his father, who was also learned – served as a Wazīr to the Umayyad representative in al-Andalus until their fall from power. Initially his father’s ministerial position bought wealth and stability in the life of young Ibn Ḥazm but later it caused trouble and suffering with various trials.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Later, Ibn Ḥazm was also to serve the Umayyads as a minister a few times, which were short engagements, when they gained and lost power. With the troubles and trials associated with his tenure, Ibn Ḥazm dedicated himself and focused on learning the sacred Islamic sciences, writing, and teaching. He was famed for his deep and extensive knowledge all over Andalus, as such the Ẓāhirī Madhhab spread all over al-Andalus. His critique and superior debating skills made him more famous during his life and his verbal altercations with the state backed Mālikī Madhhab, which was dominant at the time also faced a challenge from him and at times his wrath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was skilled interlocutor and while having mastered various sciences – including non-religious sciences, he was a formidable and prolific writer and debater. His mastery over argumentation and disputation on a whole array of genres made him a feared adversary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By 399H/1009 the viceroy, al-Manṣūr and al-Muẓaffar was displaced from power and Ibn Ḥazm’s father, Aḥmad was discharged from his position which led him to leave his palatine residence located in the outskirts of the austere city of Madīnah al-Zahīra when Ibn Ḥazm was approximately 15 years old.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> His family left their quarter, which were specifically for the civil servants and moved back to his childhood residence in Balaṭ Mughīth. Balaṭ Mughith was situated in eastern side of Qurṭuba.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These were troubling times for Ibn Ḥazm and his family, having lived a life of peace and tranquility which was followed by a period of trials and persecution. There had been successive changes in rulers with a period of civil unrest and turmoil, which led to Ibn Ḥazm and his family facing tribulations, oppression, imprisonment, exile and burden able official fines. Ibn Ḥazm’s father Aḥmad bin Saʿīd was imprisoned with his all of his possession confiscated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to these trouble and adverse times, the years proved further sorrowful for Ibn Ḥazm, his older brother Abū Bakr died in 401H due to plague<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> and in the following year his father, Ahmad bin Saʿīd also died in 402H, when Ibn Ḥazm was just a teenager of 18.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> Ibn Ḥazm was yet again faced with another extremely difficult year in 403H when his first wife died – who he loved dearly, which Ibn Ḥazm alludes to himself.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 403H, the Berbers ransacked Qurṭuba, burnt it, destroyed, and slaughtered its inhabitants for two consecutive months. Ibn Ḥazm’s family home in Balaṭ Mughīth was destroyed<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> which eventually led Ibn Ḥazm to leave his birthplace for Almeria in the beginning of 404H, while an orphan.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He learnt and taught the Islamic sciences while in Almeria, living there discreetly in peace. He also travelled to Malaga for a short period of time and had a debate with a jewish scholar which led him to write a book. The ruler of Almeria at the time began questioning the political motives of Ibn Ḥazm and accused him of plotting a political insurgency. Ibn Ḥazm was imprisoned for this for a few months and then he was eventually exiled in 407H.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> Thereafter, he sought refuge in the castle of Ḥiṣn al-Qaṣr, where he remained for a short while. He was respected and looked after by the King of the Castle, Ibn Mughaffal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ḥazm then travelled to Valencia and remained there for approximately two years<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>, at the same time Murtaḍā ʿAbd al-Raḥmān bin Muḥammad announced his succession to rule while he was also in Valencia. azm then travelled to Vallencia thenIbn Ḥazm was in favour and harboured sympathy for the Umayyad’s and thus joined an expedition to regain Qurṭuba, however they were defeated in Granada and Ibn Ḥazm was imprisoned by the Berbers.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After being released by the Berbers, Ibn Ḥazm entered Qurṭuba once again around 409H during the reign of Qāsim bin Ḥamūd al-Mamūn, and thereafter wrote is famous book, The Ring of the Dove while in Qurṭuba. <a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>After this troubled period when the young ruler ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Mustaẓhir rose to power he appointed Ibn Ḥazm as a minister around 414H<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>, this was a short appointment perhaps lasting a month or so after which Ibn Ḥazm was imprisoned again by the new ruler while al-Mustaẓhir was murdered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After his brief ministerial stints around the age of 30 Ibn Ḥazm was increasing disillusioned with the return and sustained rule of the Ummayyds nonetheless he continued to be optimistic. After a few years he was reinstated as a minister under the grand vizier at the time.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> During such roles Ibn Ḥazm passionately dedicated himself to intellectual writing and learning, his pursuit of knowledge as well clarifying matters of the Dīn. He eventually concluded that he was created for other things and left ministerial and advisory roles and focused on the Sunnah and Athār.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 429H, Ibn Ḥazm was imprisoned again by the Berbers.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> After his release he travelled through different areas, having religious disputation with different antagonists and frequent periods of imprisonment. If Ibn Ḥazm was not in prison, he was in hiding from the authorities. Thereafter in 430H he reached Majorca when he was around 45 years old. Ibn Ḥazm again during these years devoted most of his time to writing and composing his works but it was not before long that he was in trouble with the authorities again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While in Majorca, Ibn Ḥazm was forced to issue legal edicts based on the Mālikī Madhhab and not the Ẓāhirī, in return for sanctuary in Majorca by its secretary Abuʾl Abbās ibn Rashiq. Majorca’s inhabitants and prior to this the, inhabitants of Almeria complained to their respective Qāḍī’s and rulers and Ibn Ḥazm was yet again faced with more trials and persecution. In Majorca Ibn Ḥazm also had debates with the foremost Ashʿarite of his era, Abuʾl Walīd al-Bājī on many theological issues, who was asked to help by the antagonists in desperation after they were unable to halt the intellectual juggernaut, Ibn Ḥazm.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In around 440H, Ibn Ḥazm had to leave Majorca when he was approximately 55 years old, he travelled to Denia, Almeria, Seville – which is known as Ishbīl in Arabic and then finally to his ancestral home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ḥazm had to face another great trial and test during his lifetime, which was probably after 445H and before his death, the king of Seville, al-Muʿtaqid ordered the public burning of his books.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a> After Seville and the public burning and destruction of his book, Ibn Ḥazm was eventually coerced and exiled from the trials he faced to return to his native ancestral home in Montija, in Huelva on the orders of al-Muʿtaqid. He remained there until his death where he continued to write and teach. Al-Muʿtaqid also prevented people from studying with him and banned Ibn Ḥazm from teaching – he threatened anyone who approached him for studies.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During this last period Ibn Ḥazm focused on his writing and teaching, while some students did manage to study with him. These students were young as most of the older ones were well aware of the wrath and expected punishment of the ruler. Some of his family members perhaps also studied with him.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Pursuit and Quest for Knowledge</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most well-known and oft repeated accounts in how Ibn Ḥazm began seeking knowledge is what his student Abū Muḥammad ibn al-ʿArabī mentions. This account is disputed, and some biographers have failed to accept it, while offering plausible explanations and reasons. One of the main arguments against this is that Ibn Ḥazm was already studying with the local teachers in the grand mosque. The incident however is that one day when a friend of Ibn Ḥazm’s father died he went to pray his funeral prayer at midday. When he entered the masjid he sat down, so one of his teachers signaled to him to pray the Taḥḥayatul masjid, which Ibn Ḥazm was unfamiliar with and the people said to him how can you not know about this prayer at your age, Ibn Ḥazm was approximately 25-26 at the time of the alleged incident. There is another incident, that he was about to pray the Taḥḥayatul masjid after the Asr prayer, when he was told to sit down.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion this left Ibn Ḥazm embarrassed and humiliated and so he asked his teacher to direct him to the house of the most learned jurist of the city – Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Daḥḥun. He began reading the Muwaṭṭāʾ of Imām Mālik to him as well as other books for approximately three years.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many explanations have been put forward which challenge this account. We know that Ibn Ḥazm began seeking knowledge and taking ḥadīth studies at the tender age of 16, around late 399H early 400H<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a> with his teacher, Abū ʿUmar Aḥmad bin Muḥammad al-Jasūr<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a> and was thus well acquainted with the understanding of ḥadīth.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Teachers</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the teachers he heard ḥadīth and studied Islamic sciences include the likes of Abū ʿUmar Aḥmad bin al-Jasūr, as mentioned above, Yaḥya bin Masʿūd known as Wajh al-Jannah, Qāḍī Yunus bin ʿAbd Allāh, Qāḍī Abū Bakr Ḥumām bin Aḥmad, Abū Muḥammad bin Yūnus, Qāḍī Yūsuf bin ʿAbd Allāh, Abū Saʿīd al-Fattā al-Jaʿfarī, Muḥammad bin Saʿīd, Muḥammad bin Saʿīd bin Nubāt, Abuʾl Qāsim ʿAbd al-Raḥmān bin Abī Yazīd al-Miṣrī, ʿAbd Allāh bin Rabʿi al-Tamimī, ʿAbd Allāh bin Muḥammad bin Uthmān, Abū ʿUmar al-Ṭalmanakī, ʿAbd al- Raḥmān ibn ʿAbd Allāh bin Khālid, ʿAbd Allāh bin Yūsuf bin Nāmī, Ibn al-Kharrāz, Ibn al-Kattānī, Abuʿl Walīd bin al-Farḍī and Abū ʿUmar bin ʿAbd al-Barr al-Nimari,. He also studied with Abū ʿAbd Allāh bin Daḥḥūn and ʿAlī bin Saʿīd al-ʿAbdarī al-Mayurqī (Majorca) and focused on fiqh with them.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abuʾl Khiyār Masʿūd bin Sulaymān bin Muflit was from his famous and well-known teachers – Ibn Ḥazm learnt the various views of fiqh from him and he is also credited for instilling the inclination of the Ẓāhirī Madhhab in him.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a> He studied ḥadīth, fiqh and other sciences from numerous other scholars and they’re too many to mention.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ḥazm first studied the Mālikī Madhhab in general from the clergy of Qurṭuba and then specifically with Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Dahḥḥun for three years and thereafter he began to debate with the people.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>  He then moved to the Shāfiʿī Madhhab and then eventually to the Ẓāhirī Madhhab.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a> In around 418-420H he began teaching the Ẓāhirī Madhhab with his teacher, Abuʾl Khiyār or Ibn Khiyār in the grand mosque of Qurṭuba. The Mālikīs were infuriated and lodged a complaint with the ruler, who ordered a royal decree for both of them to be banned from teaching.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is no secret that Ibn Ḥazm al-Ẓāhirī championed the Ẓāhirī Madhhab, he codified it, taught it, and spread it. Such was the case that it reached unprecedented levels all over al-Andalus and the Maghrib that when Abū Bakr ibn al-ʿArabī returned from his studies in the east he said, “When I returned, I found that the whole of the Maghrib had been filled with the Ẓāhirī Madhhab.”<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> Ibn Ḥazm’s view was very simple, that only divine texts had legislative authority and constituted evidence, and that all matters must be referred back to these two sources generally, and specifically when differences arose. He rejected views based qiyās and stuck to the general views and core evidences.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a> He spent the remainder of his life, spreading and defending the Ẓāhirī Madhhab all over al-Andalus.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This credit goes to the prodigious traditionalist and ḥadīth master, the Muḥaddith, Imām Baqī bin Makhlad (201-276H), who had over two hundred and eighty teachers, who travelled the east and west over two decades in the question of knowledge and ḥadīth and thus amassed a vast and extensive collection of ḥadīth which he took back to Qurṭuba, the city of his birth. For well over a quarter of a century the illustrious Imām Baqī bin Makhlad served the cause of ḥadīth, producing numerous students and established a school of ḥadīth in Qurṭuba. He died in Qurṭuba in 276H and left behind a cultured, cultivated and established school of ḥadīth in Spain which was reduced to a Dār al-Ḥadīth.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a> It is such a spring that Ibn Ḥazm grew up in and essentially drank from it.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His students and those who narrated from him include, Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Ḥumaydī who benefited a lot from him, he was also an acclaimed historian and wrote, <em>Jadhwah al-muqtabis fī dhikr wulāt al-andalus.</em> Another student, Ṣāʿid bin Aḥmad al-Andalusi was also an established historian and geographer and authored the well-known <em>Ṭabaqāt al-umam</em>. His son, Abū Rāfʿe al-Faḍal and a whole group of people benefitted from him. The last person to narrate – who also had ijāzah from him was Abuʾl Ḥasan Shurayḥ bin Muḥammad. Also, the likes of Abū Muḥammad ibn al-ʿArabī – the father of the well-known Abū Bakr ibn al-ʿArabi, studied all of his works with him except the last volume of his <em>Kitāb al-Fiṣal</em> for seven years.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Works</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ḥazm had numerous works, we have it on numerous authorities that he compiled, collated and wrote around 400 volumes, compromising 80,000 pages as his son Abū Rāfʿe al-Faḍal transmitted,<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a> the most prolific author in the history of Islām, on par or close to Ibn Jarīr al-Ṭabarī.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a> These books varied in their type, most of them were written works while others were explanations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also know that there was a public burning of his books by the state. This was not a few isolated detractors or antagonists or even a group, but rather a state backed public burning. This highlights three important aspects, the first that public burning of books was not a few books but it was all of his books, the second; books of the author were forever lost due to this and third anyone who even had any of Ibn Ḥazm’s books and disagreed with the burning would never volunteer information they possessed his books and hence were hidden and concealed in fear of reprisal</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inevitably such events caused fear and disillusioned the people from reading or even looking at the works of Ibn Ḥazm. If this fact is coupled with the official banning of Ibn Ḥazm teaching, this had a further adverse effect on the works of Ibn Ḥazm. It is well known know that teachers would teach and have reading sessions of their books, which they would teach and explain. So when Ibn Ḥazm was banned, his books burnt there was very little hope of ever having his works available to us or even after the immediate centuries after his death. We know about the books of Ibn Ḥazm from the ones he mentioned himself or his companions or students mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From records we find the names of around 180<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a> or so, with some researchers mentioning 160 or so works authored by Ibn Ḥazm and only 40 of them approximately have ever been published. This in of itself is incredible, that the virtue and stature of Ibn Ḥazm are professed through limited works. Some scholars like al-Dhahabī mention only 74 works.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Listing all of the works of Ibn Ḥazm would be too lengthy, as a summarised version we shall mention some of them.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">ʿIzz al-Dīn bin ʿAbd al-Salām said, &#8220;I have not seen the likes of any books on Islamic sciences likes Ibn Ḥazm&#8217;s <em>al-Muḥallā</em> nor the likes Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Din’s <em>al-Mughnī.&#8221;</em> Al-Dhahabī comments: &#8220;Shaykh ʿIzz al-Dīn is right, and the third is al-Bayhaqī&#8217;s <em>al-Sunan al-Kubrā</em>, and the fourth Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr&#8217;s <em>al-Tamhīd</em>. Whoever obtains these volumes, if he is one of the intelligent muftis and perseveres in reading them &#8211; he is truly a ʿālim.&#8221;<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Praise of the Ulamāʾ</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Ḥumaydī said, “I have not seen anyone of the likes of him; who had combined in him intelligence with an agile memory, generousness, and the most devout in the Dīn.”<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Ḥumaydī further praises his teacher Ibn Ḥazm and says in the introduction of his book <em>Jadhwah </em>while elevating the status of his teacher, “These historical records and its respective science – I acquired most of them from my teacher, Ḥāfiẓ Abū Muḥammad ʿAlī bin Aḥmad bin Ḥazm.”<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a> Al-Ḥumaydī praises Ibn Ḥazm in numerous places in the aforementioned work.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Qāḍī, Abuʾl Qāsim Ṣāʿid bin Aḥmad commented on the stature and status of Ibn Ḥazm on history and genealogy and said, “In the whole of al-Andalus, he was the most perceptive, comprehensive expert and accomplished scholar with regards to Islamic sciences and had the final word and extensive knowledge on language, rhetoric, poetry biography, the Sunnah reports and genealogy.”<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Dhahabī lauds him with the following titles, “al-Imām al-ʿAllāmah al-Ḥāfiẓ al-Faqih al-Mujtahid…”<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a> and “The Imam, one ad only, the ocean of knowledge, the possessor of sciences and knowledge..”<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Khāqān defended him against some of the allegations of Ibn Ḥayyān and said about Ibn Ḥazm, “He was a unique faqih who was not a muqallid, he did not fall into innovations or new ideas… he devoted himself to the different sciences of knowledge and their respective studies, he was honest in his expressions and observations.”<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Dhahabī said about him, “He was extremely intelligent with a prolific memory such that his knowledge of the sciences was very extensive.”<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Khalikān said, “He was humble yet possessed all the virtues and had numerous works.”<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah said, “He had faith, religious commitment and a great deal of knowledge, that no one can deny except one who is stubborn, and the content of his books highlights his deep knowledge of various views and different circumstances, as well as his respect for the fundamentals of Islam and for the Messenger, which is a combination that cannot be found with anyone else.”<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ḥajr quotes al-Ḥumaydī who said, “He was a Ḥāfiẓ of ḥadīth and the Sunan with their understanding, deducing rulings from the Qurʾān and Sunnah, he was dedicated to the great sciences, and was devout upon his knowledge.”<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Dhahabī said, “He was an expert of the various sciences; a multidisciplinary in the Dīn, he was truthful, pious and devout.”<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was even praised and honoured by his adversaries like Abū Marwān bin Ḥayyān.<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Family</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most authors mention that Ibn Ḥazm had only one son, the scholar, Abū Rāfʿe al-Faḍal. However some biographers mention that he also had other sons and one daughter, Abū ʿUsāmah Yaʿqūb, Saʿīd, Abū Sulaymān Muṣʿab.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a> However such findings are under scrutiny and are to be researched further.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The great polymath and phenomenon, Imām Ibn Ḥazm died on his estate in Montija, Manta Lisham, in his native ancestral home located in the west of Andalus, on the 28<sup>th</sup> of Shaʿbān  in 456/1064 at the age of 71,<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a> he left behind a lasting legacy for the Muslim Ummah.</p>
