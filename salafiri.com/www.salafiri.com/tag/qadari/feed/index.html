				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>by </strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaymah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">This statement shows the Manhaj of the Salaf regarding the innovators and their interaction with the rulers. Although we cannot derive legal rulings or establish a specific Manhaj from this single statement, it does however show the view of one venerated Salaf (although there are others – see further points). Likewise, the early scholars of hadith used this statement for theological and methodological conclusions as evidenced by them in transmitting it in their respective early books of Aqidah and Manhaj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">It is of equal importance and something by the way of thought provoking to individuals who adhere to the ‘card’ of <strong>“the salaf differed over certain matter”</strong> when it comes to the rulers. As Salafis, we do not endorse unrestricted blind praise for rulers, but this report further adds to the scope of discussion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Two affairs are encompassed in this statement which are a reminder to those who exert time and effort in reinventing religious trends when the Salaf established them for us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Imam Abu Amr Ubadah bin Nusayyin al-Kindi (d.118H)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">He was from the Tabi’in who died in 118H. Imam Ibn Hibban said in his <em>ath-Thiqat</em> he died when he was young. (<em>Tahdhib ut-Tahdhib</em> (2/287) (ar-Rislaah). Imam Ibn Sa’d said about him, <em>“He was thiqah and died in 118H during the reign of the Khaliph Hisham bin Abdul Malik.”</em> (<em>Tabaqat Ibn Sa’d</em> (9/459 no.4686) (Khanji). Imams Ahmad, al-Nasa’i, Ibn Ma’in, Ijli and Ibn Numayr all declared him thiqah (<em>Tahdhib ut-Tahdhib</em> (2/286-287).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Ghaylan bin Muslim was from the founding members of deviant Qadari sect. Hisham bin Abdul Malik was the Umayyad ruler.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>The Statement</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>“A man came to Ubadah bin Nusayyin and said, “The leader of the believers, Hisham cut Ghaylan’s hands and feet and executed him.” He said, “Is what you say true”? He replied, “Yes.” Ubadah said, “By Allah he acted in accordance with the Sunnah and applied the correct judgement, I will write to the leader of the believers and praise him for his actions.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Transmitted by</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(1) al-Firyabi, <em>Kitab al-Qadr</em> (p.216 no.285) (Dar Ibn Hazm)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(2) Abu Zur’ah ad-Dimashqi, <em>at-Tarikh</em> (p.161-162 no.800) (DKI)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(3) Ibn Battah, <em>al-Ibanatul Kubra</em>, Kitab ath-Thani (2/239 no.1851) (Darul Rayah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(4) Al-Ajurri, <em>Kitabush-Shari’ah</em> (2/922 no.517) (Madar al-Watan)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(5) Al-Lalaka’i, <em>Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah</em> (4/526 no.1165) (Dar un-Nasihah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(6) At-Tabarani, <em>Musnad ash-Shamiyin</em> (3/266 no.2228) (ar-Risalah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(7) Ibn Asakir, <em>Tarikh ad-Dimashq</em> (26/218, 48/212) (Dar ul-Fikr)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(8) Ibn Hajr, <em>Lisan ul-Mizan</em> (2/6/314 no.6009) (Dar ul-Basha’ir)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Benefits</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(1) Expressing happiness and rejoicing when innovators die, and this refers to the callers to innovation and active ardent supporters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(2) Verifying news and making sure reports and incidents are true and accurate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(3) Communicating the truth by endorsing and openly agreeing with judgements and rulings according to the Quran and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(4) Judging and weighing all actions according to the Sunnah, whether it’s the general Muslims or the rulers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(5) Praising the rulers for their actions that coincide and conform to the affairs of the Sunnah and those which aid Islam by refuting and curb the incursion of the deviant innovators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(6) The Salaf did praise the rulers as those who equally reprimanded their evil in accordance with the constraints of the Sunnah. We do not intend by this that you start a fan club but intelligently acknowledge that if you quote statements of openly rebuking the rulers you also have statements which praise the rulers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(7) The writing of Ubadah to Hisham shows the scholars of the Salaf communicated with the rulers through writing. If in this example it is was for praise, then it is also a given they would have written to advise them on other matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Further Benefits</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(1) Scholars like Numayr bin Aws, a Qadhi from Dimashq also wrote to Hisham congratulating him on executing Ghaylan (al-Uqayli, <em>Kitab adh-Dhu’afa al-Kabir</em> (3/437) (Dar ul-Baz).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(2) Raja’ bin Haywah also wrote to Hisham praising him for his actions. (<em>Kitab adh-Dhu’afa al-Kabir</em> (3/436), <em>Lisan ul-Mizan</em> (2/6/314)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(3) Hisham bin Abdul Malik had ordered Imam al-Awza’i to debate with Ghaylan to establish evidence against him and to refute his views. Ghaylan remained adamant on his heretical views and with the evidence established against him, he was executed due to Imam al-Awza’i’s fatwa of execution. (<em>Lisan ul-Mizan</em> (2/6/314), Muhammad Ibn Abd Rabbah, <em>al-Iqd al-Farid</em> (2/193) (DKI), al-Baladhuri, <em>Ansab al-Ashraf</em> (8/419)(Dar ul-Fikr).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(4) Maymun bin Mihran, Iyas bin Mu’awiyyah a judge in Basrah, and Rabi’ah al-Ra’y also a judge all debated Ghaylan before the reign of Hisham but under the rule of the Umayyads and at their behest. (at-Tabari, <em>Tarikh ar-Rasul</em> (7/203) (Dar ul-Ma’arif), <em>Ansab al-Ashraf</em> (8/390), Ibn Kathir, <em>al-Bidayah Wan-Nihayah </em>(9/349) (DKI), <em>al-Iqd al-Farid</em> (2/191-192), Abu Nu’aym, <em>Hilyatul Awliya</em> (3/260) (al-Maktabah as-Salafiyyah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">So, I hope based on fairness and the bravery of the new mujaddids they can ascribes labels such as ‘sell-outs’ to the Imams and scholars cited above.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="center"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Compiled &amp; Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 align="center"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">I compiled a biography of &gt;&gt;&gt; <a style="color: #003300;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/biography-imam-qatadah-ibn-diaamah-sadusi-basri-118h/"><strong>Qatadah b. Di’amah Sadusi Basri [d.118H</strong>]</a> which was published many years ago. A number of people commented he was a Qadari. The orientalists have been at the forefront of this in trying to undermine the hadith corpus and rijal reliability and they have been quick to run with this. Some have presented the argument of the permissibility of taking knowledge from innovators while pursuing this line of argument and using Qatadah as an example.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imam Qatadah strongly adhered to the Sunnah and sought knowledge from the Successors and Companions. He took the tafsir of the Quran from them and the transmission of hadith and he was an astounding and prolific preserver of hadith. He was particularly a formidable expert in the tafsir of the Quran and is on record for saying, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“There is not an ayah except that I have heard something concerning it”.</em> (Shadhrat adh-Dhahab (1/154)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The innovation of rejecting and denying Qadr ie the belief of the Qadariyyah was rampant in Iraq and the likes of the misguided innovator Ma’bad al-Juhani, the founder of the Qadariyyah were based around that region and in this regard some good authorities were accused of inclining towards that view where as that was not the case.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Qatadah Affirming Qadr</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imam Ibn Battah (d.387H) adds a chapter heading in his book, <strong>“The First Chapter – What has Been Transmitted from a Group of Tabui’in (Successors) Concerning Having Iman in al-Qadr and Affirming it”</strong> and then transmits this report,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">A man came to Qatadah and said to him. <em>“Oh Abul Khattab what do you say concerning al-Qadr”? Qatadah replied, “Do you like of the Arabs or non-Arabs”? He replied, “The Arabs”. He replied, “The Arabs did not believe in this during the time of ignorance whereas Islam affirms al-Qadr” and then he read some couplets of a poem.”</em> (al-Ibanah An Shari’yyatil Firqatin Najiyyah Wa Mujanabatil Firaq al-Mazmumati, (Kitab ath-Thani, al-Qadr (2/219 no.1792) (Dar ur-Rayyah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imam Ibn Abi Hatim in his tafsir under <strong>Surah Tawbah: 51</strong> transmits through an Mu’allaq (disconnected chain) from Qatadah an affirmatory statement on al-Qadr from his Shaikh Muslim b. Yassar who said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“al-Qadr are two expansive valleys in which people are destroyed and its extent cannot be comprehended. So perform righteous deeds like the deeds of the man who knows there is no salvation except through his deeds. Have tawakkul like the tawakkul of the man who knows nothing will harm him except what Allah wrote for him”.</em> (Ibn Abi Hatim, Tafsir al-Quran al-A’zim (8/454 no.1182), al-Ibanah (Kitab ath-Thani, al-Qadr (2/310-311 no.1990), as-Suyuti, Durr al-Manthur (3/249)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">From Sa’id b. Abi Aruba from Qatadah who said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“I asked Sa’id b. al-Musayyib about al-Qadr”. He said, “Whatever is (written for you) from Qadr will be your Qadr and whatever is not (written for you) in your Qadr will not be from your Qadr”.</em> (al-Lalaka’i, Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnati Wa’l Jama’ah (4/774 no.1295)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The report above from Sa’id Ibn Abu Aruba contradicts what adh-Dhahabi transmits from him and ad-Dastawa’i when they said Qatadah said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“Everything is from al-Qadr except sins”.</em> (Tazkirratul Huffadh (1/124)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Abdur Razzaq as-Sanani mentions in his tafsir from Ma’mar from Qatadah from al-Hasan who said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“Whoever rejects al-Qadr he has indeed rejected the Quran”.</em> (Abdur Razzaq as-San’ani, Tafsir al-Quran (2/240 no.1391), Musannaf (9/21 no.21102), Abdullah b. Imam Ahmad, as-Sunnah (2/83 no.984) (ar-Riyashi), al-Ibanah (Kitab ath-Thani, al-Qadr (2/180 no.1666), Muqbil, al-Jam’i as-Sahih Fi’l Qadr (p.524 no.543)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">From Abdur Razzaq from Ma’mar from Qatadah who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“I asked Sa’id b. al-Musayyib concerning al-Qadr, he replied. “Whatever Allah decreed (al-Qadr) then that is Qadr”.</em> (Musannaf Abdur Razzaq (9/26 no.21018), Abdullah b. Imam Ahmad, as-Sunnah (2/48 no.927) (ar-Riyashi), al-Ibanah (Kitab ath-Thani, al-Qadr (2/221 no.1799), al-Jam’i as-Sahih Fi’l Qadr (p.524 no.541)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The Accusation of Denying al-Qadr</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Hanzalah b. Abi Sufyan reports Tawus would flee from Qatadah due to his views on al-Qadr. (Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnati Wa’l Jama’ah (4/704 no.1143), Siyar A’lam an-Nabula (5/275), Tahdhib ul-Kamal (23/509)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Ibn Sa’d said he had something by the way of al-Qadr (Tabaqat al-Kubra (9/228 no.3957)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Al-Ijli said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>&#8220;He was accused of al-Qadr and he would not call to it nor speak about it …”</em> (Ma’rifah ath-Thiqat (2/215 no.1513)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Abu Musa Ishaq al-Juzjani also levied a charge against Qatadah (adh-Dhahabi, Tarikh al-Islam (6/201), Mukhtasar Tarikh Dimashq (25/116)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Ibn Shawzab said Qatadah would openly express his view on denying al-Qadr. (al-Fusawi, al-Ma’rifah wat-Tarikh (2/277), (Siyar A’lam an-Nabula (5/275), Tazkirratul Huffadh (1/124)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Others have also reported some affairs of negation of al-Qadr where in Qatadah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"> <em>“Everything is from al-Qadr except sins”.</em> (Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnati Wa’l Jama’ah (4/774 no.1296), Siyar A’lam an-Nabula (5/275), Tazkirratul Huffadh (1/124 no.107)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">However al-Lalaka’i directly after this report transmit Qatadah’s statement contradicting the view in the report above. It reads, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“Hakam b. Umar sent Khalid b. Abdullah to Qatadah to ask him some questions on some issues and at the time he was in al-Hiyarah. I asked him about Allah’s statement “</em><em>Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians, and the Majûs, and those who worship others besides Allâh (Surah al-</em><em>Hajj:17) does this refer to the mushriks of Arabia? He replied, “No, rather the detractor Zindiqs (heretics) who associated partners (i.e. shirk) from Allah’s creation with him and they would say Allah created good and shaytan created evil and Allah does not have power over shaytan”.</em> (Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnati Wa’l Jama’ah (4/774 no.1297), Tarikh Dimashq (15/33)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Another charge by Abu Dawud against Qatadah was that he would remain silent and not speak about al-Qadr; indicating his denial of it (al-Ibanah (Kitab ath-Thani, al-Qadr (2/25 no.1810)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">However, Abu Dawud also said, <em>“Nothing is authentic about Qatadah regarding al-Qadr (denying it)”.</em> (Mu’ajam Ibn al-Muqri (2/45 no.183)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Adh-Dhahabi also repeats the charge and said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“He was accused (denying) al-Qadr”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and in Siyar transmits a report from al-Hasan al-Basri which is transmitted from Qatadah that,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em>“The good is from al-Qadr and evil is not from al-Qadr”. Adh-Dhahabi then said, “Qatadah was accused of (denying) al-Qadr”.</em> (Tazkirratul Huffadh (1/124), Siyar A’lam an-Nabula (4/583), respectively)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">adh-Dhahabi presents his summary on Qatadah in Tazkirratul Huffadh when he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"> <em>“I say: despite this foul belief no one held back using his hadith as evidence, may Allah forgive his errors”.</em> (Tazkirratul Huffadh (1/124)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Adh-Dhahabi clearly changes his view and this statement abrogates his previous views when he said Ahmad b. Hanbal said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“Qatadah and Sa’id spoke about al-Qadr while they both concealed it. I say (adh-Dhahabi): They both repented and retracted just as their Shaikh repented”.</em> (Siyar A’lam an-Nabula (5/275)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Yaqut al-Hamawi said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“He (Qatadah) spoke of something of al-Qadr and then he retracted from it”</em>. (Mu’ajam al-Adba (5/2233 no.914)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Dr. Ahmad b. Sa&#8217;id b. Hamdan al-Ghamidi also mentions in his footnote in his checking of Sharh Usul al-I’tiqad under (no.1297), </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“The author (al-Lalaka’i) transmitted two contradictory statements of Qatadah with the first one saying everything is from al-Qadr except sins and in the second that (denying) al-Qadr is the view of the Zanadiqah (heretics), Allah knows best which view is authentic from him. Indications have preceded that Qatadah had a view on al-Qadr and then he repented from it”.</em> (Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnati Wa’l Jama’ah (4/774)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Abdul Hamid Bakhit said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"> <em>“Qatadah is trustworthy according to the majority scholars of hadith, the accusation of al-Qadr regarding sins needs investigating and this did not prevent numerous scholars of hadith transmitting hadith from him, they relied and authenticated his narrations since he was hafiz and hujjah. The accusation of al-Qadr is not proven and if it is, it will be explained with that which does not oppose clear Iman and Islam”.</em> (Dirasat Tarikhiyyah Fi Rijal al-Hadith, p.48)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Dr. Abdullah Taha Abdullah as-Salmani has also favoured the view that denial of al-Qadr like the Qadariyyah has not been proven regarding Qatadah and all the scholars of hadith took his hadith. (Majallah Ibhath Kulliyah at-Tanziyyah al-Asaiyyah vol.8 no.2 p.203-207)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">In summary, If Qatadah was accused with Qadr and the reports are authentic then his repentance and retraction is established and thus absolved of such accusations. We must also consider some of the accusations are without supporting evidence and therefore questionable. What also supports the previous statement are the statements of Abu Dawud where he said Qatadah would remain silent and not speak of al-Qadr and his saying nothing is authentic from Qatadah denying al-Qadr. Similarly, adh-Dhahabi repeating the charge of al-Qadr and then affirming his retraction from it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Lastly, another perspective is that he was known as a caller to al-Qadr and this is why the scholars of hadith took his narrations otherwise their rule was very stringent in not taking reports from those wo called to their innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">In the words of adh-Dhahabi himself, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><em>“Indeed Qatadah is Hujjah with consensus when he clarifies he heard hadith…” </em>(Siyar A’lam an-Nabula (5/271)</span></p>
