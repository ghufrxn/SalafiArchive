<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Abdul Hamid Ibn Abdurahman: One Hadith</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[63] From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Abdulhamid Ibn Abdurahman Ibn Zayd Ibn al-Khatab from Abdullah Ibn Abdullah Ibn al-Harith Ibn Nawfal from Abdullah Ibn Abas that Umar Ibn al-Khatab (Radi Allahu Anhu) set out for ash-Sham and when he was at Sargh, near Tabuk, the commanders of the army, Abu Ubaydah Ibn al-Jarah (Radi Allahu Anhu) and his companions, met him and told him that the plague had broken out in ash-Sham. Ibn Abas (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8220;Umar Ibn al-Khatab (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8216;(Call) all the first Muhajir unto me.&#8217; He assembled them and asked them for advice, informing them that the plague had broken out in ash-Sham. They disagreed (had a difference of opinion). Some said, &#8216;You have set out for something, and we do not think that you should leave it.&#8217; Others said, &#8216;You have the companions of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) and the rest of the people with you, and we do not think that you should send them towards this plague.&#8217; Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8216;Leave me.&#8217; Then he said, &#8216;(Call) Summon the Ansar to me.&#8217; They were summoned and he asked them for advice. They acted as the Muhajirun had and disagreed (had a difference of opinion) as they had disagreed. He said, &#8216;Leave me.&#8217; &#8220;Then he said, &#8216;Summon to me whoever is here of the aged men of Quraysh from the Muhajirun of the conquest.&#8217; He summoned them and not one of them differed (had a difference of opinion). They said, &#8216;We think that you should withdraw the people and not send them towards the plague.&#8217; Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) called out to the people, &#8216;I am leaving by camel in the morning,&#8217; so they set out. Abu Ubaydah (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8216;Is it flight from the decree of Allah?&#8217; Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8216;Better that someone other than you had said it, Abu Ubaydah. Yes. We flee from the decree of Allah to the decree of Allah. What would you think if these camels had gone down into a valley which had two slopes, one of them fertile, and the other barren. If you pastured in the fertile part, wouldn&#8217;t you pasture them by the decree of Allah? If you pastured them in the barren part, wouldn&#8217;t you pasture them by the decree of Allah?&#8217; &#8221;(then Ibn Abas (Radi Allahu Anhu) said) Abd ar-Rahman Ibn Awf (Radi Allahu Anhu) arrived and he had been off doing something and he said, &#8216;I have some knowledge of this. I heard the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) say, &#8220;If you hear about it (a plague) in a land, do not go forward to it. If it comes upon a land and you are in it, then do not depart in flight from it.&#8221; (Ibn Abas (Radi Allahu Anhu) said) &#8216;So Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) praised Allah and then set off.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Abdul Hamid Ibn Abd ur-Rahman) in Bayhaqi (7/217, 218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 2/894- 896 hadith no.1720, book 45, chapter 7, hadith no.22, and in it: (the words) fadaaw tahum (is present) instead of fadaaw hum) at-Tamhid (8/361 &#8211; 363) al-Istidhkar: (no.1652)          </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.5729) and Muslim (no.2219) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) There are some points of wisdom in people not going to the place where a plague (epidemic) has broken out and occurred in that area and for the people to not run away from there who live in that area where the plague has occurred (and stay there instead) for example: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">a. If this illness (plague) spreads and affects someone who is outside the affected area then his aqidah can become corrupt that this illness is infectious and has the capability to cause many people to become ill. This situation is the same for the person who gets infected by coming into the area where the plague is, therefore this prevents bad and corrupt aqidah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">b. Chaos, turmoil and fear is not spread.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Even if an authentic hadith is a Khabar Wahid, it is a proof because Umar (RadiAllahu Anhu) acted upon the hadith narrated by one companion Abd ur-Rahman Ibn Awf (RadiAllahu Anhu). See hadith (no.9)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) Those who are in power should act upon the advice of the people of solution and agreement in ijtihadi affairs (matters).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The general Muslims should consult their reliable and upright brothers in important matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) If there is no clear proof for an issue in the Qur’an, Sunnah or Ijma then a general proof can be used as evidence or ijtihad can be done.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) The real knowledge is the Qur’an and hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) It is possible that a smaller scholar has knowledge of a proof which a bigger scholar doesn’t have.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani (the false Prophet) writes in contradiction to this authentic hadith that, “And I know that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said when a plague occurs in any place then the people of that city should leave the city without stopping otherwise they will be amongst those who fight against Allah the Most High.” (Majmu&#8217;ah Ishtiharat vol.2 pg.713) Mirza’s explanation here is a complete and utter lie.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">9) After acquiring knowledge of the Hadith of the Messenger’s (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) one should submit and accept it immediately instead of saying he said and such and such said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">10) In the blessed era of the noble companions there was nothing called taqlid (blind following).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[61] From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Hamzah and Salim Ibn Abdullah Ibn Umar from Abdullah Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, &#8220;Bad luck (misfortune) (if it exists then) is in a house, a woman and a horse.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Salim and Hamzah Ibn Abdullah Ibn Umar) in Bukhari (no.5772)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta ((Yahya’s narration) 2/972 hadith no.1883, book 54, chapter 8, hadith no.22) at-Tamhid (9/278) al-Istidhkar: (no.1819)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.5093) and Muslim (no.2225) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) The foundation (and reasons behind) most general corruption and killing in the time of the noble Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) and before him was in 3 important things: </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1. The house, meaning the land</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">2. Women</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">3. Horses, meaning cavalry (armies, troops)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Therefore the meaning of ill luck here (in this hadith) is the above however this hadith is abrogated because of other [Sahih] authentic hadith. The noble Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, “If superstition (misfortune) existed in anything then it would be in houses, women and horses.” (Sahih Bukhari (no.5094) and Sahih Muslim (no.2225) [no.5807, no.5808] The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, “There is no superstition.” (Sahih Bukhari (no.5754), Sahih Muslim (no.2223) also see Fath ul-Bari (6/60-63 under hadith (no.2858, no.2859) and at-Tahmid (9/290) and he said, “Then this became abrogated and the Qur’an and Sunnah declared this to be false.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) The narration which has been transmitted in Muwatta Imam Malik that states one house will have numerous superstitions and less wealth, then the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said (about it), “it is evil, leave it” (2/972 hadith (no.1884) the chain of narration is [Daif] weak because of it being [Munqati’] broken.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In Sunan Abu Dawud (no.3924) it is a weak narration because the chain of narration contains the tadlis of Ikrimah Ibn Amar the mudallis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) In one narration it has come that A’isha (Radi Allahu Anha) censured Abu Hurayrah (Radi Allahu Anhu) because of the hadith of Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu), this chain of narration is weak because it contains Qatadah the mudalis. The other chain of narration is [Munqati’] broken because of “Makhul From A’isha”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) Also see hadith (no.412)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Salim Ibn Abdullah said that Abdullah Ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) said (After he heard this that), &#8220;If A&#8217;isha (RadhiAllahu Anha) heard this from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) then I consider that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) only refrained from greeting the two corners (in tawaf) which are adjacent to the Hijr (Hatim) because the House had not been completed on the foundations of Ibrahim (Alayhisalam).&#8221; (i.e. the corners he did not touch were not the original corners of the Ka’bah) . </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri (did) anana in what I know and he narrated from Nafi’ the mawla of Ibn Umar from Abdullah Ibn Abu Bakr as-Sidiq and the hadith has many routes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta ((Yahya’s narration) 1/363, 364 hadith no.824, book 20, chapter 33, hadith no.104 and with it: he did not complement (lam yutamam)) at-Tamhid (10/26) al-Istidhkar: (no.772)    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.4484) and Muslim (399/1333) from the hadith of Malik. From Yahya Ibn Yahya’s narration and in the original: Qalaj, mistake from the publisher.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) If two matters are allowed and are established from the Qur’an and Sunnah, then in order to be safe from evil and corruption one of them does not have to be performed and can be left (temporarily).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) The Mother of the believers A’isha (RadhiAllahu Anha) said, “I find no difference if I was to pray in the Hijr (Hatim) or pray inside the House of Allah (Ka’bah) ” (al-Muwatta Yahya’s narration 1/364 hadith no.825 and its chain is [Sahih] authentic) Meaning (that) praying inside the Hatim is the same as praying inside the House of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) According to the most correct saying, whoever performs tawaf inside the Hatim that person’s tawaf is not valid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) Ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) not having knowledge of this [Sahih] authentic hadith is clear proof that some Ahadith can be unknown to even the biggest scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) It is not correct for anyone to think they have complete knowledge of all the evidences of the Shar’iah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) There is a difference of opinion regarding who built the House of Allah first. It is established from the Majestic Qur’an that the person who built the foundations of the House of Allah was Ibrahim (Alayhisalam). The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was asked which Masjid was built first? So he replied: Masjid Haram, then it was asked: what Masjid was built after that? So he replied: Masjid Aqsa, then it was asked: how long was it between the construction of these two? So he replied: 40 (years). Sahih Bukhari (hadith (no.3425)) and Sahih Muslim (hadith (no.520))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) A summarised saying of Ali (RadiAllahu Anhu) is that the people of Nuh (Alayhisalam) and the people of Ibrahim (Alayhisalam) used to live in houses however, the House of Allah is the first place of worship. Al-Mukhtar of al-Dhiya al-Maqdisi (2/60 hadith (no.438)) and al-Mustadrak of al-Hakim (2/292, 293) and its chain is [Hasan] good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) People should not be tested without necessity (when there is no need to and it can be avoided).</span></p>
