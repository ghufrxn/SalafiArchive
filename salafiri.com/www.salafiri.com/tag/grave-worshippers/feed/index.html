<h5 align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The reality of Imaam Haakims authentications and Haafidh Dhahabee agreeing with him, The reality of Imaam Haakim and his gradings, The status of Musnad of Imaam Ahmad, The grading of ‘hasan’ of Imaam Tirmidhee, The Gradings of Dr Muhammad Musafaa al-A’dhamee, The Gradings of Allaamah Muhammad Naasir ud deen al-Albaanee</span></strong></h5>

Furthermore, we have shown this from books that have been verified and checked by Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed and Gibril Fouad Haddad’s teachers, those they have alleged ‘ijazahs’ from and those who are their trusted authorities, from the likes of Shaikh Noor ud deen Ittar, Muhammad Awaamah, Shaikh Shu’ayb al-Arnaa’oot and so on)</span></strong></h5>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[1] </strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1250H-1326H </strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(1834c-1908c)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the early 2000’s we compiled short biographies of some of the scholars of the sub continent, we also mentioned they were summaries of detailed biographies which were delayed in being published for some reason or another. In additional to the fact that in recent years, unfortunately some imprudent ignorant people from Birmingham began to say our dawah was to the scholars of ‘India and Pakistan,’ despite the sheer ignorance of such people and being totally clueless and oblivious of the dawah of the scholars before, we thought it was time and most pertinent to share some of the biographies of these great luminaries of the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafi’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was the summarized biography which has been since amended and updated by this biography.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[Biography] – Allamah Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani [1326H]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">http://www.salafiri.com/biography-allamah-muhammad-bashir-Sahaswani-1326h/</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is Allamah Kabir Muhammad Bashir bin Hakim Muhammad Badr al-Din bin Sadr al-Din al-Faruqi al-Sahaswani. He is not in need of any introduction, he is the renowned Scholar, the <em>Muhaddith</em>, the jurist, the debater, the teacher, the <em>mufti</em>, the admonisher and speaker. <em>(Forty Scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65 and Hayat nazir p.173 both of Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whenever Sahaswan is mentioned Shaikh Muhammad Bashir is the first one who comes to mind. <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab bayna mu’idihah wa mu’aridahah fi shabbah al-qarihah al-hindiyyah p.63 of Shaikh Abul Mukarram bin Abdul al-Jalil)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Family Roots and Background</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His lineage traces back to Umar ibn al-Khattab (RadhiAllahu Anhu). His grandfather was a resident of Thanesar which is in western Punjab, which he left and settled in Sahaswan. He had studied with various scholars and was known to be upright and righteous. <em>(Dabistan hadith p.216 of Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father, Hakim Muhammad Badr al-Din Faruqi was a Doctor and resided in Lucknow due to his work in the early years of the Shaikh’s life and this is where he received his early education, under the guidance of his father. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250 of Shaikh Imam Khan Nawshahri, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.379-380 of Muhammad Qadi Aslam Sayf Fairuzpuri)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father was a renowned physician who had learnt and studied Medicine at the hands of the experts of the Day which included the likes of Shaikh Shah Rafi al-Din Muhaddith Dehlawi. He also studied Ibn Sina’s classical Medical magnum opus <em>‘al-Qanun.’ </em>The Shaikhs father would treat everyone ranging from poor to the elite and even received honorary titles from the ruler of Oudh. He also had knowledge and had studied the Islamic sciences. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dabistan hadith p.216, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237 oh Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi, Forty Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith p.65)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father died in approximately 1260H/1844c and at the time Shaikh Muhammad Bashir was approximately 10 years old. Thereafter he returned to his native area of Sahsawan with his mother.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Birth of the Allamah Kabir</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani was born in approximately 1250H/1834c in Sahsawan which is in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Sahaswan is an old city with rich history. Sahsawan had always been a city of learning and Islamic sciences and a great number of scholars hailed from there. Likewise, and similarly a large number of Ahl al-Hadith scholars used to live in Sahaswan <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.379-380, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237, Forty Scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The historians and biographers have differed with regards to his exact date of birth. Shaikh Idris Nigrami mentions his birth to have been in 1240H in <em>‘Tazkirrah Ulama Hal’</em> where as Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hassani mentions 1254H in his <em>‘Nuzhat al-Khawatir.’</em> Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions that he was born approximately in the middle of the century and he was no more 8-9 years old when his father died. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:437)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abul Muakkaram mentions his birth day to be 1245H <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous Ahl al-Hadith historian, Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti mentions his date of birth as 1252H (1836-1837c) <em>(Dabistan hadith p.217)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The biographers have generally accepted his birth to have been around the years 1250H-1251H based on the statement of the Shaikhs student.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some Ahl al-Hadith historians and researchers have mentioned another Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani who died in 1321H who authored <em>‘Tabsirah al-naqid,’ </em>we were unable to find anything on this Shaikh and perhaps it is a mistake in the citation of the name and also the potential difficulty in reading the hand writing and script from books of that era. <em>(Was Islam Spread in the Subcontinent due to the efforts of the Sufiyyah, p.154 of Shaikh Ghazi Uzair)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani, who spend a lot of time under the tutelage of Shaikh Sahaswani authored a book on the biographies of the scholars of Sahaswan titled, <em>‘al-Yaqut al-marjan fi zikr ulama Sahaswan.’</em> Which is often referred to as ‘<em>Hayat al-ulama’ </em>and we will also refer to it with the same name here on in.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Pursuit of Knowledge</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Early Days in Sahaswan and Lucknow</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh began his studies with his father who had himself studied in Delhi and thus spent time with notable luminaries of the era. After returning to Sahaswan he began to study under Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan for approximately 10 years or so. Then in 1273H/1856c, just after the period of mutiny was subsiding he travelled to Lucknow and studied with the Scholars of Farangi Mahal from the likes of Shaikh Hidayahtullah Khan Rampuri, Shaikh Wajid Ali Banarasi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also studied with his paternal cousin, Shaikh Nur al-Hasan Sahaswani whilst in Matharah. He studied the Islamic sciences of tafsir, hadith, fiqh and usul <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.217, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Studies with Shaikh Muhaddith Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After Lucknow the Shaikh travelled to Delhi to study with Allamah Imam Sayyid Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, he studied Hadith, Fiqh and Tafsir with him and also obtained chains for ahadith from him Ie ijazat. He studied the two Sahihs and the four sunans. He also obtained (isnad) chains of hadith from Allamah Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin Ansari al-Yamani who was the Qadi of Bhopal. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Dabistan hadith p.217, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237-238, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Teachers from the Najd</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Shaikh travelled to the Hijaz and Najd to perform Hajj he studied with the likes of Shaikh Ahmad bin Ibrahim bin Isa al-Sharqi al-Najdi (d.1329H) and Shaikh Muhammad bin Abd al-Rahman Saharanpuri who migrated to Makkah and respectively attained ijazahs in hadith. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Transformation</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was upon the way of taqlid in his early years until his studies and the constant diligent nurturing of his first teacher, Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan Sahaswani who instilled the love and admiration of the Quran and Sunnah. Thereafter the Shaikh abandoned taqlid and held firmly onto the Kitab and Sunnah and the manhaj of the Salaf. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90-91, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani said when Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani studied the books of Ulum Aqliyyah, Mantiq, philosophy, Fiqh and Usul he leaned towards taqlid and the hanafi madhab and would issue legal edicts based on it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, when he sat in the lessons of Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan and benefitted from his manhaj, Shaikh Sahaswani’s inclination for research grew stronger, leading him to follow the Quran and Sunnah, he would refer to it in every issue. He adopted the manhaj of Amal bil-Hadith and believed it was obligatory to abandon the taqlid of specific people and opinions. <em>(Hayah al-ulama p.91, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Spreading the Quran and Sunnah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani was essentially a teacher and spent all of his life learning and teaching.  Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il al-Salafi also comes to this conclusion in his introduction to Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi’s <em>‘Ma’yar ul-haq,’he </em> categorises the Shaikhs students into, writers, debaters, teachers and so on where he says Shaikh Sahaswani was more of a teacher and educationalist. <em>(Introduction to Ma’yar ul-haq</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the beginning he spent a year teaching in Bangladesh and then another year in Bihar. This was followed by 15 years of teaching as a professor in Akbarabad, Agra in a college. This is what he would do in the day and then in the evening he would teach Quran and Hadith and conduct lessons at his house. There would be a constant flow of students to his gatherings of learnings during the day and the evening, the students would benefit greatly from his knowledge. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Time in Bhopal </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During this era Shaikh Allamah Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan was active in Bhopal due to his family. At the request of Allamah Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan in 1295H/1878ce Shaikh Sahaswani was appointed as a teacher in Madrassah Shah Jahaniyyah in Bhopal after leaving Agra and he remained there for sometime. Shaikh Sahaswani was given great respect and a high position in the teaching circles and was essentially made the head of all the learning faculties. <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst in Bhopal the Shaikh would deliver lectures and sermons and the Shaikh was such a prolific speaker and orator, most of the gathering would cry due to the fear of Allah due to the Shaikh reminding them of the affairs of the Din and Dunya. He would also deliver lectures in the residence of the leaders, who would also cry to the power of his admonitions. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:251, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani had been in Bhopal for approximately 12 years. In these 12 years both scholars worked together. Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan would write books and Shaikh Sahaswani would answer all the question that were presented and in this was why Shaikh Sahaswani was known as the Mufti. At the same time Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin Ansari al-Yamani was also in Bhopal and he was the Qadi. Bhopal flourished with Ilm and became a powerful learning centre for the Salafi’s and Ahl al-Hadith. <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.376-380, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Later around 1307H/1890c after the death of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan, the atmosphere of Bhopal was changing and Shaikh Sahaswani thought it was time to move on to Delhi. The family of Shaikh Siddiq Hasan Khan were unhappy with his decision due to the great benefit and knowledge he would propagate to the people and therefore he remained in Bhopal for longer. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The historians and biographers differ how long Shaikh Sahaswani’s stayed in Bhopal with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hassani saying 30 years and Shaikh Imam Khan Nawshahri saying 24 years. It seems more appropriate that he stayed in Bhopal for approximately 24 years because this is in line with other information. Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti mentions 25 years.  After Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan’s death Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani remained in Bhopal after another 12 years making his total time in Bhopal as 24 years. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252-253, Dabistan hadith p.220, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During this period Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan and Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi had an exchange of a book debate, where they both wrote books against one another. Shaikh Lucknowi alleged that Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani was the actual one writing the books under Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan’s name. Shaikh Sahaswani crushed this false allegation and clarified he was not the one writing the books. Shaikh Lucknowi later accepted this. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.93, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:251, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the wife of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan died in 1319H/1901c, the situation of Bhopal had changed with the new authority having a different approach to the Islamic sciences. It was at this time Shaikh Sahaswani thought it was time to move on. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.94, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Time in Delhi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh left Bhopal in approximately 1319H and spent approximately 6-7 years in Delhi where he taught Tafsir and Hadith, he also published some books and engaged in answering the general questions of the people ie Ifta. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.381)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh continued to teach in the place of his teacher, Shaikh Muhaddith Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi after his death in Delhi and he remained in this position until he died. Allamah Sahaswani was an exceptional orator, he gave circles in explanation of the Quran for years in Delhi and many scholars of that time would sit in his lessons.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>An Example of His Exemplary Character and Being Firm Upon Islam</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh only had a one son who was born in 1288H whose name was Nazir Hussain upon the name of his teacher Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi.  The Shaikh concentrated on the well being and nurtured his son upon the Quran and Sunnah and was fervently diligent in educating and teaching him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Eventually the Shaikh married his son off at the tender age of 17. However, after just 6 months the Shaikhs son died in 1305H. This was a very difficult and testing time for the Shaikh, losing an only son at such a young age and even that after 6 months of marriage. The Shaikh remained patience and continued his teaching and worship of Allah. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255-256)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh also set a precedent in his era which was unheard of and in fact was frowned upon due to the Hindu culture and practices that were prevalent in society at the time which did not bother the Shaikh nor did he care. The Shaikh arranged another marriage for his daughter in law with his own expense. Even during this era, the Muslims were affected by the hindu culture and they would think it was a bad and disliked practice for the woman to get married again. In this way the Shaikh put into practice what he had learnt and studied with his teachers.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What the Scholars Said About Him</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Bashir was well known for his knowledge and deep insight into the affairs of the Quran and Sunnah and numerous scholars testified to this including his teachers, from there were the likes of,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi praised Shaikh Sahaswani for his knowledge of the Quran and asks the family of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan to instruct Shaikh Sahaswani to start writing a tafsir of the Quran as others will not be as capable as him. <em>(Makatib naziriyyah p.159)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hussian bin Muhsin Yamani wrote in a letter to Shaikh Shams al-Haq A’zimabadi,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“May Allah have mercy on our brother al-Allamah Muhammad Bashir who is an Alim and Muhaqqiq who holds onto the Quran and Sunnah.”</em> <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams al-Haq A’zimabadi considered Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani from amongst the foremost students of Shaikh Sayyid Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi. <em>(Ghayah al-maqsud fi hal sunan abi dawud 1:59)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allamah, the Shaikh was the epitome of knowledge and the pride of the Khalaf to the Salaf in his virtue and good qualities. He was a mujaddid of the Din in the late era, the Imam of the time and a mujtahid mutlaq.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Sahaswan in an area which has produced scholars for years and if a scholar did emerge from there, it would not be unusual or something unheard of. However, a scholar of his caliber being born in the 13/14<sup>th</sup> century gave his era radiance and his area of Sahaswan such recognition that it will be forever remembered.” (Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Rashid Rida said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was the Shaikh, Muhammad Bashir al-Sahaswani, May Allah have mercy on him, he was from the powerful Scholars of India and from the major scholars of hadith, he encompassed the various science of the Shari’ah and other than it, coupled with actions based upon knowledge, taqwa and righteousness.”</em> <em>(Muqaddimah siyanah al-insan p.14)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hassani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Shaikh al-Fazil al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Muhammad Bashir al-Umari al-Sahaswani, a famous and well know scholar of India. … he was from the major scholars. He had piety and taqwa, he was righteous and upright. He was a genius with lofty manners and he had complete mastery over Usul al-Fiqh.”</em> <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:437-438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions great praise for him, his excellent and loft qualities he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I benefitted from the Shaikh with regards to knowledge of the texts and interpretation whilst he was in Agra and Bhopal. A whole group of students in fact the whole city of Dehli would benefit from his knowledge as we would deliver lessons and lectures on various sciences and disciplines. He would deliver a lesson every day for two hours after Fajr on the explanation of the Quran and Haidth and the people would travel far and wide to come to listen to him.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi goes onto say he would would teach the students the Quran and Hadith directly and he would answer questions on various in great depth and research like a mujtahid. He would also deliver lessons after jumu’ah on the Quran and Hadith in Masjid Qadi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was only interested and fervently followed the Quran and Sunnah and he was only interested in the victory of the truth. He set the precedence of knowledge in Bhopal and in fact in the whole of India and thereby established his rank and status in terms of his knowledge and powerful deductions of ijtihad. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Badi al-Din Shah al-Rashidi al-Sindi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Shaikh of the Mashaykh. The one and only, The Muhaddith of his time, the embodiment of taqwa, the revered scholar, the one who acted upon Islam completely, Shaikh, the well known Muhammad Bashir bin Badr al-Din Sahaswani he died in 1306H (this is a typo in the book it should be 1326H) , he authored ‘Siyanah al-Insan an waswasah al-shaikh dahlan’ which caused devastation in the circles of Ahl al-Bid’ah, he also wrote 3 treatises on the visitation of the Prophets (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) grave, ‘al-Qawl al-muhkam, al-Qawl al-mansur and al-Sa’i al-mashkur (Itmam al-hujjah)’(Muqaddimah hidayah al-mustafid p.96-97) </em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Shaikhs as a Debator</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Book Debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Shaikh Sahaswani went to the Hijaz to perform Hajj he saw some of the practices of the people in their veneration of the Prophets grave and saying the visiting of the grave was pillar of Hajj. Upon his return to India he authored a book on the subject titled, <em>‘al-Qawl al-muhaqqiq al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em> Some authors have cited the book as, ‘<em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani cites the book as <em>‘al-Qawl al-muhaqqiq al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em> This is essentially a primary source as it comes directly from the Shaikhs students. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.91</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri cites the name as <em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhaqqiq al-Muhkam…</em>’ <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Indian Shaikh and researcher Shaikh Uzair Shams perhaps also relied on the latter two Mashaikh and thus also mentions the name of the book as <em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhaqqiq al-Muhkam…</em>’ Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti also mentions the book with the same name. <em>(Dabistan hadith p.219)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This led to a book debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hanafi Lucknowi of Farangi Mahalli who was of the fervent opinion of the obligation and necessity to visit the Prophets grave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi wrote a reply titled <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mubram Fi Radd al-Qawl al-Muhkam’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani wrote a counter replied titled, <em>‘al-Qawl al-Mansur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi wrote his reply to the counter reply titled, <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur Fi Radd al-Qawl al-Mansur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Lucknowi in <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur’ </em>failed to answer the the main pivotal points and in return relied heavily on Subki’s arguments and <em>‘Shifa al-Siqam.’</em> Shaikh Sahaswani knew of Hafiz Ibn Abdul Hadi’s answer to al-Subki, ie <em>‘al-Sarim al-Munki’ </em>however Shaikh Sahaswani did not have the book. After a lengthy and exhausting search the Shaikh found the book wrote a follow up titled, <em>‘Itmam al-Hujjah Ala Man Awjab al-Ziyarah Mithal al-Hujjah al-Ma’ruf al-Madhab al-Ma’thur Fi Ziyarah Sayyid al-Qabur’ </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi replied with <em>‘al-Sai’i al-Mashkur Fi Radd al-Madhab al-Ma’thur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The latters reply was all regurgitation and repetition of the same arguments. Shaikh Lucknowi relied heavily on Subki’s <em>‘Shifa al-Siqam’</em> as mentioned and on the writings of Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Haithami. Shaikh Lucknowi overlooked the counter replies and arguments and thus in this regard the book <em>‘Itmam al-Hujjah’</em> remains by far the most comprehensive reply to all of the Sufi arguments even today. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani showed the contradictions, inconsistencies and irregularities from the own words of Shaikh Lucknowi from his books and then showed Shaikh Lucknowi’s contradictions from his other books. The discussions ranged from Usul al-Hadith, Usul al-Fiqh and rijal. Shaikh Sahaswani would first quote Shaikh Lucknowi from his book <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur’</em> and then answer all of his arguments in a writing style showing a written debate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani also wrote the reply to Shaikh Lucknowi’s <em>‘Madhab al-Ma’thur’</em> but it was never published and also due to the fact that Shaikh Sahaswani felt the arguments were just irrelevant repetitions and that he had already answered the claims anyway and also penned answers in his other book <em>‘Siyanah al-Insan’</em> as his student Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92, </em><em>Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:254)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both Scholars had mutual respect for each other and did not leave the realms of the Quran and Sunnah whilst addressing each other and the detailed issues.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Debate with the Mulhid Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani was an excellent debater and was very sharp Alhamdulillah. When the disbeliever Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani Hanafi challenged Allamah Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi for a debate, however as Allamah Nazir Hussain was very busy and also frail due to age. All of his students gathered to debate and he chose and Allamah Sahaswani to have a written debate with Mirza Qadiyani Hanafi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani came to Delhi around 1312-1313H and had issued a poster challenging for a debate as Shaikh al-Allamah Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi was one of the first scholars in the whole world to declare him to be a disbeliever. In those days sometimes they would have a written debate someone would be challenged and then they would respond to each other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The responses would usually be sent to each other via messengers depending on the place of residence. What was interesting is that Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani in order to show his bold nature in an attempt to fool the people of India thought he would come to Delhi as in go to the lions den in popular proverbs.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani came from Bhopal for the debate and began the written debate with Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani. One of the treacherous tricks of Mirza Qadiyani was when the other party would accept his challenge for a debate, he would digress and diverge into the conditions of the debate so that he would have an option to runaway from the debate. The Sufis and Barelwis of today also do the same, big mouths with little actions. Anyhow, Shaikh Sahaswani was an erudite Scholar and knew of such tricks so he said at the very beginning I agree with all of your conditions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence the debate took place which was concerning the living of the Messiah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mirza Qayani presented the ayah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>when Allah said, &#8220;O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve (Surah Ale Imran:56)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani recited</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>And there is none from the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe (in Jesus) before his death. (Surah al-Nisa:159)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This obliterated Mirza Ghulam Qadiyanis points which left him to resort to red herrings and illogical and stupid distortions and manipulation. It is said Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani tried to make different excuses to leave he was unable to answer and counteract the evidence of Allamah Sahaswan, he said he had to go to the train station to pick up his father in law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate continued for a period of 6 days and after the disgraceful fleeing of Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani, Shaikh Sahaswani remained in Delhi for another 2 days and then returned to Bhopal and Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani Hanafi never set foot in Delhi again. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.94-95, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.382, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate took place approximately around in either 1309H or 1312-1313H, showing he was from amongst the first people to refute and rebut the fallacious claims of the Mulhid Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani. This was the position of the Ahl al-Hadith at the very onset and then years later the Hanafi quarters followed, perhaps because he was one of their own. The book was published around 1313H titled <em>‘</em><em>al-Haq as-sarih fi hayat al-masih.’</em> <em>Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63-64)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ahl al-Hadith historians and biographers have differed as to when the debate took place, some have said it took place in 1309H whilst others seem to think it was later in 1312H-1313H <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi, the famous Ahl al-Hadith historian and biographer said he read the book in Shaikh Abdul Majid Seharwardi’s library and that it was printed by Matba’a Ansari in Delhi in 1309H and it was 136 pages. <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66-67)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is possible and plausible, the actual written debate took place in 1309H and the book was later published in 1312-1313H.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Well Known Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh had a huge number of students due to his constant teaching in the various places he taught and travelled to and numerating all of them would be impossible however, some of them were major scholars of Hadith in their own right who themselves produced many other scholars. Some of the students include,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ahmadullah Muhaddith Partabghadhi and Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Sa’id Sharf al-Din Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il Ansari Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Iqtidar Ahmad Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Amir Ahmad Sehswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mazhar Ali Sahaswani (the Shaikhs younger brother)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Wahhab Nabina Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid E’jaz Mu’jiz Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Sattar Umrpuri (The father of Shaikh Abdul Ghaffar Hasan Rehmani)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdur Rahman Bastawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Uthman Aligharhi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Taqi Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdus Samad Bastawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mubarak Ali Akbarabadi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ma’sum Ali Akbarabadi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And manu more</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Sahaswani an an Author</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was a prolific writer as we have already mentioned in his book debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi. The Shaikh was essentially a teacher however he did write some books and what outstanding and monumental books they were. From them we have the revolutionary book which caused havoc amongst the Sufi’s, making them feel things besides their usual wajd (Sufi dances) and esoteric trances!!! </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Siyanah al-insan an waswasah al-shaikh </strong><strong>dahlan &#8211; </strong><strong><em>Protecting The Human From The Satanic Whisperings of Shaikh Dahlan.</em></strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Shaikh Sahaswani went to Hijaz to perform Hajj he had a debate on Tawhid with the Ash’arite and Shafi Mufti Shaikh Ahmad bin Zaini Dahlan. The later also authored <em>‘</em><em>Durar al-saniyyah fi radd ala al-wahhabiyyah.’ </em>Shaikh Sahaswani upon his return to India authored his book answering all of the allegations and distortions of Dahlan as well as his slanderous aspersions against Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. The book is in debate format and contains some very detailed discussions. It was first printed in 1324H/1906c has been printed many times. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92-93, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.64, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.68)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is very important to understand is that after the debate with Shaikh Dahlan, Shaikh Sahaswani returned to India and Shaikh Dahlan also authored his <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah.’</em> Some people may argue Shaikh Sahaswani’s book was only a summary of the verbal debate they had in Makkh and that <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> is not an answer to <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah.’</em> It is very evident that Shaikh Sahaswani’s book more than likely was authored after he looked a <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah’</em> because he answers it in <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> and also the fact that it was published just two years before his death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another clear evidence which supports the aforementioned point is that Shaikh Ahmad Zaini Dahlan died in 1304H, way before Shaikh Sahaswani died and therefore it naturally leads to the conclusion that Shaikh Dahlans book <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah’ </em>was authored at least before 1304H </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Rashid Rida in his introduction to the book said,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In summary it can be said about this book, not only is it a refutation of Shaikh Dahlan or the jurists who have been cited for example Shaikh Taqi al-Din al-Subki and Shaikh Ahmad bin Hajr al-Haithami al-Makki but rather it is also a refutation of all of the grave worshippers and innovators of our time and those to come.”</em> <em>(Muqaddimah siyanah al-insan p.17, cf. </em><em>Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.65-66)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> is still used and it is of great benefit due to its depth and precision in answering the claims and distortions of the innovator grave worshippers. To add the book to date has not been answered!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad bin Zaini Dahlan had other issues, one was his position on the british colonialists, his edict can be read here</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>The Wahabis – Zainee Dahlans Real Opinion &amp; The British</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">also this is a refutation of Subki and Dahlan from the <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em></span></p>

</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is on the obligation of reciting fatihah behind the Imam and again it is a very detailed book answering the points of those who say otherwise. The Shaikh would deliver a lesson everyday after Fajr on this issue for approximately 3 months. The well known hanafi scholars of Delhi would be in attendance and would note every word. The Shaikhs student Shaikh Ahmadullah Dehlawi also noted every word and later published it as a book with this title. This book was published 1327H/1909c <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252-253, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.381, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.68)</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is on the issue of the permissibility of sacrificing on Eid al-Adha until the end of the month, this was an odd opinion of the Shaikh in which he opposed the people of knowledge. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The contentions that is well known amongst Ahl al-Sunnah is whether it can be done for 4 days.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh initially published a general poster in Bhopal on this issue after the death of Shaikh Nawab siddiq Hasan Khan. This was one such view which Shaikh Sahaswani erred on and his teacher Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin al-Yamani wrote a treatise answering Shaikh Sahaswani’s points as did another prominent student of Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, none other that the Imam of Hadith and Rijal in his own right, Shaikh al-Allamah Abul Mukarim Muhammad Ali Mu’i titled <em>‘Umdah al-tahqiq fi ithbat al-dhihayah ila akhir ayam al-tashriq’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani mentions Shaikh Sahaswani wrote a book collecting the evidences as well as his research into a book, however it was never published in reply to some of the points raised by the aforementioned scholars. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.95) </em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate which Shaikh Sahaswani had with Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani on the issue whether the messiah was alive, this was authored in book form with some additional points and printed with this title around 1313H.</span></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="13">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Ayam al-safar</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi mentions this as one of the works of Shaikh Sahaswani, other biographers have not mentioned this. <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said Shaikh Sahaswani wrote many books, some which were lost and other unprinted. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahsawani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani, who was also his student during his time in Bhopal and Delhi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He wrote many other treatises on the affairs of the Din which were attributed to some of his students.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Death</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh felt ill whilst in Delhi and passed away on the 29<sup>th</sup> of Jumada al-Ula/ Thani 1326H / 29<sup>th</sup> June 1908c at the age of 74. He was buried next to his teacher Shaikh Allamah Sayyid Nazir Hussain, in the Shaidipura graveyard. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hassani has yet made another mistake in his biographical entry for Shaikh Sahaswani where he says that he died in 1323H. <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Salafis and Ahl al-Hadith lost a great scholar who truly answered the grave worshipping innovators. It is therefore without a doubt that Shaikh Sahaswani is considered and will be known as one of the scholars who subdued and kept them at bay.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was from the scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith who they all respected. It is a shame just as the learning places and institutions were deprived of someone to replace the scholars, it was the same case with Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani, that there has been no one like him from Sahaswan or from the general Ahl al-Hadith”</em> <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah forgive him and shower him with her mercy, Amin</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Alhamdullilahi Rabbil A’lamin, Wasalatu Wasalam Ala Rasoolillahil Karim, </em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Wa, Ba’d</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All Praise is to Allaah, the Most High and Majestic, may there be abundant salutations upon the Messenger of Allah (r) and his family.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After translating the book <em>‘The (Aqidah of the) Bareilwis and Deobandis Are The Same’</em> of Shaikh Talib ur Rehman, we thought it would be beneficial to publish it as two separate treatises, with the aim to highlight the beliefs of these two sects separately for the new reader who may want to know the basics of their beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an E-Book publication, it can downloaded in PDF format or alternatively read online.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sha’ban 1436H / June 2015ce</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>S</strong><strong>alafi</strong> <strong>R</strong><strong>esearch</strong> <strong>I</strong><strong>nstitute</strong> <strong>2015</strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[1]</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Aqeedah of Wahdatul Wajood (ie Allaah is incarnate in everything) that Allaah Came To This Earth as Muhammad (r)</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Deobandee Aqeedah</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah (the famous author of Fadhail Amaal) said whilst ­presenting the poetry of Qaasim Nanautwee, <em>“Remained the veil of being a man on your grandeur, we do not know who is what in the part of the veil”</em> (Tableegi Nisaab pg.810)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Zakariyyah writes about the very famous proponent of ­wahdatul ­wajood, Mansoor Hallaaj, <em>“And mansoor was hanged just on the basis of leaving ­etiquettes, his saying of annal-Haqq (I am the truth) was the Haqq (ie the truth) but one word too blasphemous.”</em> (Walee Kaamil pg.279)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> The close Soofee disciple of Zakariyyah, Soofee Iqbal writes <em>“Love, the loved and the lover say it as one, and so the oneness was explained.” </em>(Muhabbat pg.70)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [2]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Attributes Of Allaah Are Exclusive For Him And Even Messenger of Allaah (r) Cannot Have Them.</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah writes, <em>“Allaah, the truth who is an encompassment of every grandeur and goodness then in reality there is none other than his ­grandeur.” </em>(Tableegi Nisaab pg.300)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Maulana Rasheed Ahmad Gangohee said, <em>“Sayyid Sahib had the attributes of the almighty incarnated in him.”</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.185)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Ashraf Alee Thanwee writes, <em>“The one who is complete has a position called Abul-Waqt and when he wishes to have Allaahs attributes to be incarnated in him he can do so. it is not strange that Shaah Sahib may have had attribute of al-Jabbar incarnated in him at that time and from his position of mazhariyyat he may have resolved it by this attention.”</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.68)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [3]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Mankind Can Only Claim to be the Worshipper of Allaah and Nothing Else As This Is Shirk.</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haajee Imdaadullah Muhaajar Makkee writes, <em>“As the Messenger of Allaah </em>(r) <em>is the truth you can call the worshipping slave of Allaah the ­worshipping slave of the Messenger.” </em>(Shamaa’im Imdaadiyyah 2/71)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Manzoor Numaanee said about Shah Abdur Rasool that he was from the well known Auliyaas of Muhammad Mian. (Monthly ­al-Furqaan Shaikh ul Hadeeth no pg.66)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [4]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Only Allaah Alone Can Help And No Prophet Or Holy Person Can Help.</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maulana Ahsan Gheelanee writes, <em>“We do not deny or reject seeking help from the souls of the Auliyaa, hence so if a believer ­inflicted with troubles seeks help from good souls then what verse of the Quraan or Hadeeth refutes this.”</em> (Haashiyah Suwaaneh Qaasimee 1/332)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> The deobandee author Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah writes, <em>“The scholars of Deoband never say that no one other than Allaah can have knowledge of the unseen and similarly they also do not believe and accept that a man during his life or even after his death has no power to help.”</em> (Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah pg.101)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> In another place he writes, <em>“Every man whether in this world or in the state or barzakh needs the permission of Allaah and his spirituality. Up until there is permission some souls who are in the state of barzakh help the people, who are from this world and tell them some things.”</em> (Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah pg.152)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> the Deobandee author of Inkishaaf writes, <em>“The friendship of Allah and the miracles of the Auliyaa remain after their deaths with the permission of Allah and so with regards to this just understand that souls of the auliya can also come to this world with the permission of Allaah and can help the people with the command of Allaah.”</em> (Inkishaaf pg.67).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [5]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Only Allaah Can Help With Calamities And He Alone Is The One Who Is Asked For Help.</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no reference to this quote so we have not translated it, but it is a poem of Imdaadullah Muhaajir Makkee and Qaasim Nanautwee full of shirk.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [6]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Only Allaah Alone can Remove Calamities</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Deobandee author of Inkishaaf writes whilst quoting a book on Soofee terminology, <em>“It is these people who are the inheritors of the Prophets and they are the ones who remove the calamities of the creation.”</em> (Inkishaaf pg.250)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [7]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Only Allaah Is the One Who We Plea To And He Is The Helper (ie Gauth)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ashraf Alee Thanwee whilst talking about an incident says, <em>“And so I remembered the happiness of the great helper ie (Gauth al-Azam) rahimahullah (here is talking about Shaikh Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee)</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.123)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Imaadullaah Muhaajir Makkee writes, <em>“The auliya are the pillars from the pillars of Allaah”</em> (Shamaa’im Imdaadiyyah Part 2 pg.55)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [8]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Believing Other Than Allaah Have The Knowledge Of The Unseen</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee  Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Read the following incidence of a shaman having knowledge of the unseen, Mr Zakariyyah (the author of Fadhail Amaal) said <em>“Shaikh Abu Yazeed Qurtubee said, “I heard whoever recites the kalimah 70,000 times will be saved from the fire of Hell.” Upon hearing this I recited the kalimah 70,000 times for my wife and also recited the kalimah for myself as a means of salvation. A young boy used to live with us and it was well known that he had the power of Kashf (ie he could see apparitions) of both Paradise and Hell but I had reservations about this. One day we were eating and all of a sudden he started to scream and began to breath erratically and said my mother is being burnt in the Hellfire, I can see her.” Qurtubee said I was seeing his anxiety and thought I should transfer a set of 70,000 kalimahs to his mother and at the same time see if he is telling the truth about having the ability to see apparitions. So I transferred the kalimah to his mother and I did this inherently in my heart so no one knew of this except Allaah. The boy said, “Oh uncle my mother ie being removed from the Hellfire.” So I benefitted from this incident in 2 ways, firstly the benefit of the recitation of the kalimah 70,000 times as I saw an incident myself first hand and secondly the truth about the boy having the ability to see apparitions”</em> (Fadhail Tableegi Nisaab pg.576)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> [9]</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The People of This World Call Upon Those Who Are Dead, Who Do Not Have The Ability to Speak, Listen, Smell, Hold or To See in This World.</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Deobandee Aqeedah</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah Deobandee said, <em>“An old man who was my fathers friend and also from his sincere servants had the ability to see apparitions and he had a status in seeing apparitions pertaining to the grave. On the second day after my fathers demise he visited his grave and my father said 3 things to him and there were many people who opposed my father. (1) he said say to moulwee Zakariyyah not to worry about them (ie the opposers) they will themselves bare the fruits of their harm, (2) my father had a lot of debt and there were many people who would ask (for their money back) he said do not worry about it (ie it has been paid) (3) always fear the elderly people as their wrong is really right.”</em> (Teen Majaalis pg.185)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [10]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Coming and Goings of Souls Is A Mere Fallacy of These Mullahs And A Means of Filling Their Hell Bent Stomachs In Which The Deobandee are Similar to the Bareilwees</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Deobandee author of Teen Majaalis writes, <em>“Always do good deeds and transfer them to the elders as by doing this their souls are attentive and due to this we seek blessings”</em> (Teen Majaalis pg.211)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[11]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Elder Holy Saints Control this World</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Zakariyyah mentions an incident he had heard from his father, <em>“When the Jamna river is at its shores peak crossing it becomes impossible. There was a man from Panee Pat who was accused of killing someone and he wanted to flee across the river. So he would ask the boat people to take him accross but they would decline  and would say we will drown in the river. So the poor worried man just kept on crying. A man who saw the bad state he was in said to him, “I’ll tell you a solution if you don’t mention my name. A holy shaman/nympholept lives over there in that small hut, so go to him and do whatever he says and be of service to him not leaving anything out. He may swear to you and even hit you but whatever he does do not hit him back. So this poor worried man went to this shaman and did as he was told and as he was told the shaman was rude and obtrusive and said, “Im not no god what can I do?” So the man continued to cry profusely (and crying is something important, may Allaah grant me blessing for me to cry[Zakariyyahs words]) so the shaman said to him, “Go to the river Jamna and say to it, “I have been sent by the man who has never eaten anything in his whole life nor slept with his wife so give me way.” So when this was said, the river gave way.”</em> (Fadhail Sadaqaat pg.528)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[12]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Other Than Allaah Have The Knowledge of The Unseen</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The deobandee author of Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah, Najm ud deen writes, <em>“The Scholars of Deoband do not say this at all that other than Allaah cannot have knowledge of the unseen.”</em> (Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah pg.101)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In one place Najm ud deen writes, <em>“The scholars of deoband also believe that some of the knowledge of the unseen can also be acquired by some of the normal people in addition to the Prophets, Auliyaa and purified ones.”</em> (Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah pg.98)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author of Arwah ath-Thalatha writes, <em>“Maulana Muzaffar Hussain travelled to the house of Allaah on the 23 of Jumadee ath-Thaanee in the year 1282H and on his journey just before he reached Makkah, he fell ill due to diarrhoea. So one day he said to Haajee Imdaadullah, “I wish that I die in Madeenah but as the time of my death is approaching would you kindly perform spiritual communion (ie with Allaah) and find out for me. When Haajee Imdaadullah had completed his spiritual communion he said to Muzaffar Hussain, “No don’t worry you will get to Madeenah.” After a few days Muzaffar Hussain became better and hence travelled to Madeenah. Whilst on his journey, when he was short distance away from Madeenah he became ill again and died on the 10<sup>th</sup> of Muharram 1283H. He was buried near the grave of Uthmaan </em>(t)<em>.”</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.222)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author of Arwah ath-Thalatha writes, <em>“Shah Abdur Raheem Walaytee had a trusted soofee disciple whose name was Abdullaah Khan and was of the Rajpoot caste. His ability was such that if a woman was pregnant in a household and they had come to get a ta’weez from him he would tell them if they were going to have a boy or a girl. So whatever he would say is what would happen.”</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.185)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muftee Azeezur Rehmaan wrote, <em>“Even to this day fountains of blessings are flowing from their tombs.” In another place he writes, “And his tomb and shrine, even now is a place of central benefit and blessings.”</em> (Walee Kaamil pg.54, pg.94)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ashraf Alee Thanwee wrote, <em>“The following actions are established from the Prophet </em>(r)<em> in the state of Barzakh. Looking and being made aware of the actions of the ummah, praying and eating according to the state he is in.”</em> (Nashr ut-Tayyib pg.142)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Anwar Shah Kaashmiri Deobandee wrote, <em>“Many actions are established from the Messenger of Allaah </em>(r)<em> from his grave. For example, the Adhaan, the iqaamah and reciting the Quraan.”</em> (Faidh al-Baaree 1/183)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Zakariyyah writes, <em>“Alee </em>(t) <em>said after the preparation of the funeral I moved forward and said, “Oh Messenger of Allaah </em>(r)<em> Abu Bakr </em>(t)  <em>seeks permission to be buried here. So I saw the hatchway open and a voice said, “Send the friend to his friend.”</em> (Fadhail Sadaqaat pg.950)</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Deobandee Aqeedah</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A disciple of Ashraf Alee Thanwee wrote, <em>“In a dream I was reciting the kalimah Laa Ilaaha Illalaahu Muhammadur Rasoolullah but I say Ashraf Alee instead of Muhammad all the time. My heart said I am making a mistake whilst reciting the kalimah and I should recite it correctly. With this intention I recited the kalimah again thinking that I am reciting it correctly but uncontrollably I say Ashraf Alee instead of Muhammadur Rasoolullaah. Whereas I know this is not correct but uncontrollably the words were being uttered. When this happened for a few times I saw the Shaikh infront of me and the usual people that were with him. During this time whilst I was standing I began to tremble and my body began to move as if I was in a fit. I fell down and screamed loudly, I felt powerless. At this instance I woke up but I was still very weak. Even after I woke up I was still thinking of the Shaikh (ie Ashraf Alee) and when I remembered my mistake regarding the kalimah I intended to remove this thought so that I don’t make such a mistake again. So I sat up and turned and lay on my other side and began to send salutations upon the Prophet but still I kept on saying, Allaahuma Sallee Ala Sayyidana Wa Nabiyina Maulana Ashraf Alee, whereas now I was awake and was not dreaming and yet again it was uncontrollable and as if I was forced and had no control over my tongue. Similar thoughts remained in my mind the same day. The next day my body kept on moving uncontrollably as if I was in a fit and I cried a lot. Even now there are many reasons why I love the Shaikh so much, how can I mention everything.”</em> (Risaalah al-Imdaad pg.35)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Ashraf Alee Thanwee instead of saying to his disciple to remove this thought from his mind and repent to Allaah he gives the following encouraging answer, <em>“Answer: This incident contain reassurance that the one who you refer to is by Allaah a follower of the Sunnah”</em> (24<sup>th</sup> Shawwaal 1335H, Risaalah al-Imdaad pg.35)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ashraf Alee Thanwee brings the following narration of Jaabir (t) concerning the creation of the Messenger of Allaah (r), <em>“Oh Jaabir before Allaah created anything he created your Prophets Noor from his own Noor and not in terms of meaning but his essence itself. He created him with the blessings of his Noor and then that Divine Noor roamed wherever Allaah wished. At that time there was no Lauh, Pen, Paradise, Hell, Angels, Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon, Jinn nor mankind. Then when Allaah wished to create his creation and he divided that noor into 4 parts. With one part he created the Pen, the Lauh with the second part, the Throne with the third part. This hadeeth therefore proves the Noor of Muhammad </em>(r) <em>was the first thing that was created. Similarly Alee </em>(t)<em> narrates the Prophet said, “14,000 years before the creation I (the Messenger of Allaah) was a noor with Allaah.</em>” (Nashr at-Tayyib pg.5-6)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Qaasim Nanautwee complained to Haajee Imdaadullah that whenever he intends to use rosary beads a trouble befalls him in that when he moves them they feel like very heavy stones and his tongue and heart constrict and feel heavy. To this Haajee Imdaadullah answered and said, <em>“This is the blessings of prophecy on your heart and this heavy constricting feeling you feel is when something is being revealed. Allaah wants from you the dawah efforts which the Prophets did for him.”</em> (Suwaaneh Qaasimee 1/258)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Aashiq Ilaahee Meerthy writes, <em>“I have heard him say many a time upon his blessed tongue, “Listen the truth is that which is uttered from ­Rasheed Ahmad (Gangohees) tongue and I swear I am nothing but in this day and age guidance and salvation is lies in following me.”</em> (Tadhkiratur Rasheed 2/17)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah said that Ilyaas said to me, <em>“Thanwees sayings are evidences and proofs for you and me.”</em> (Mahboob al-A’arifeen pg.30)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> In one place Mr Zakariyyah answers a question posed by a person by saying, <em>“You wrote the evidence should only be from the Quraan, Hadeeth or fiqh, as the statements of scholars will not be accepted. I say concerning this, an ­Al­laamah like yourself has the right not to take the statements of the scholars but for someone like me with little knowledge all the statements of the people of the truth and those who are trustworthy are evidence.</em>” (The Problems with the Books of Fadhail and their Answers pg.128)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah said, <em>“I saw my dads sister when she was nearing death she shouted and said, “Hurry and make me sit up and the Prophet </em>(r)<em> is coming, then her soul left her. When my paternal grandfather Maulana Ismaa’eel died there was a crowd for 3 and a half miles from Nizaam ud Deen to Delhi. A man who had the ability to see apparitions saw that Maulana Ismaa’eel said, “Bury me quickly as I am very embarassed because the prophet is waiting for me with his companions.”</em> (Maulana Ilyaas and his Religious Dawah pg.48)</span></p>
