<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question:</strong> Can you please explain the essence and existence of Allah intellectually?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer: </strong>There have always been a handful people in every era who have denied the existence of Allah. Most people in previous nations never rejected or denied the existence of Allah but yet continued to commit shirk with Allah. The Quran in Surah Yusuf states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And most of them believe not in Allah except while they associate others with Him”</strong> <strong>(Surah Yusuf : 106)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Denying the existence of Allah is from the epitome of ignorance, such people are from those who have bankrupt their intellects because anyone else can not deny the existence of Allah, the creator of the universe. This is why the misguided nations which Allah has mentioned in the Quran were all mushriks (polytheists) and none of them were atheists or denied the existence of Allah. All the Prophets who were sent to their respective nations propagated Tawhid and reprimanded Shirk. Surah Ibrahim mentions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>Their Messengers said, &#8220;Can there be doubt about Allah, Creator of the heavens and earth?”</strong> <strong>(Surah Ibrahim : 10)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messengers and Prophets said to their respective nations can anyone doubt that Allah is the creator and owner of the Heavens and Earths? This question is to the individual possessing sound intellect that when he sees the smallest of things he naturally assumes and concludes that an expert made it. This is because it is impossible for any sound intelligent person to believe that even the smallest of things came into existence without a creator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then how can such huge entity like this world come into existence just like that without a creator, the Heavens, the Earth, the Sky, the Sun, the Moon, the Star, the Mountains, the Sea, the Rivers, the Ocean, the Trees and gardens. Did everything come into existence without a creator? Did all of this just happen by itself. Only an insolent and an intellectually retarded individual can utter such foolish and futile statements because an intelligent person would not even think to say such a profanity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Books of history mention an incident that occurred during the Khilafah of the Abbasids. An atheist came to the to the Khaliphs palaces and said he did not believe in the existence of Allah and asked for intellectual evidences. The Kaliph summoned Imam Abu Hanifah who came extremely late. When the Imam was questioned why he came late. He replied, “When I reached the river shore I saw random planks of wood spread out. Then all of a sudden I saw the planks joining each other to form a boat, I then got onto the boat and eventually arrived and thus this is the reason for my late arrival. Upon hearing this the atheist said, “You called such a scholar to talk to me who is talking utter nonsense and saying something which lacks any intelligence.” Upon this the Imam said “Oh ignorant foolish one, you deny that a mere small boat can form just like that, yet you accept this vast Earth came into existence just like that without a creator!!! How do you have the audacity to have such a belief, it is except that you are ignorant.” Upon hearing the intellectual answer the atheist was silenced.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point was to educate the individual of the existence of Allah which everything in the world testifies to. No one other than the intellectually blind can deny the existence of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">32 of the worlds leading scientists or even more than this concluded that Allah exists based on their on scientific backgrounds and research. They presented evidences for this established belief and collated and compiled them into a book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This reality is so clear and manifest that almost all of the intelligent and intellectual people of this world agree that Allah exists but despite this the intellectually blind are communists, socialists and immoral atheists. These people are enemies onto themselves and their minds leading them to deny the existence of Allah. They openly misguide the people, taking them away from the straight path in a vulgar manner and foolishly claim Allah does not exist and constantly repeat, prove Allah exists.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says in the Quran</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And they rejected them, while their [inner] selves were convinced thereof, out of injustice and haughtiness.” (</strong><strong>Surah an-Naml : 14)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ie the people of Musa accepted the truthfulness of Musa (Alayhis Salam) but based on their oppression and arrogance they outwardly rejected his call. Likewise, these oppressive people onto themselves in reality believe in the existence of Allah and their conscious is always fighting them yet they reject this upon their tongues just for the sake of their whims and desires.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we intend to present three evidences for the people in search of the truth who lend an ear and use their intellectually sound minds. We pray that Allah guides these people to the truth. Amin</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will extract benefit from the following ayah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And We have sent down rain from the sky in a measured amount and settled it in the earth. And indeed, We are Able to take it away.”</strong> <strong>(Surah al-Mu’minun : 18)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ayah means Allah placed so much water on the Earth at one time making sufficient for the people until the day of judgement. Then the water separated into oceans and rivers forming sub-soil-water. It is the same water that changes states in the summer and winter. It condenses in the summer and spreads via rain, it spreads via fountains, wells and springs. It forms ice on top of the mountains in winter, which eventually melt and flow into the millions of rivers and streams. The water helps form numerous other entities for example vegetation via irrigation. So from the beginning of time not even one drop of water has decreased or increased in the water Allah gave us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Every person and students knows which we are taught in schools that water is formed by the merging of two gasses namely hydrogen and oxygen and this is an accepted fact by the scientists. We also know the vast oceans also came into existence in this way- by huge quantities of hydrogen and oxygen mixing and enormous quantities of water forming.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now the question is, if the atheists and communists claims there is no creator and Allah does not exist, then let them tell us based on the scientific research that is established with them, when there are still huge amounts of gases-oxygen and hydrogen why do they not mix like they did before and create enormous quantities of water which led to the creation of the seas, rivers and oceans. It is evident, if these gases did mix we would have constant water falling from the skies. We as intelligent individuals know the consequences and outcome, especially all life forms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We see that these huge quantities of gases exist but yet they do not mix as they mixed before to produce the enormous quantities of water. So we ask which entity is preventing the mixing of these gases? Which entity allowed the mixing of these gases previously and yet now they are not allowed to mix except with his permission?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Without a doubt these heretic atheists have no answer except elusive retorts. We also say prove the existence of these gases, they cannot be seen, touched or smelt, yet these atheists believe in its existence! How did they come to know that if they were to mix these gases in huge quantities, the resultant water would destroy the earth and all life form.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, we must accept there is a supreme entity who allowed the mixing of huge quantities of these gases to allow the colossal formation of water for us to be able to live on this Earth. Yet the same supreme entity is preventing the mixing of the very same gases now, this supreme being is Allah The Most High.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No one even tries to deny this except the stubborn heretics and enemies to their own intellects, the atheists. They do not have any responsible answer other than conjecture</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And who is more unjust than one who invents about Allah a lie or denies His verses? Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.” (Surah al-An’am :  21)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Trans Note:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the Shaikh’s methodology in dealing with such issues, in relating it back to the Speech of the Allah first and foremost and then using science instead of using science on its own to prove the existence of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Taken from <em>Bazal al-Aqdi al-Was’a Fi Ajwibah as-Suwalat at-Tis’a</em> (pg.374)</span></p>
