				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not a surprise to most intelligent minds the vile and abhorrent rhetoric that emanates from Mohammad Naveed Ashrafi and his disastrous shenanigans on Ummah channel. His words and comments are well known and inflammatory but Ahl al-Sunnah are well acquainted with this because the forefathers and elders of the Sufi Barelwi sect were indifferent. It is also unsurprising because Naveed Ashrafi is only but treading the path of his elders like Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan who was also very sharp with his tongue and mind as we shall come to see.</p>
<p>Naveed Ashrafi, who has since removed the following post from his facebook, said the following</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-7403 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg?resize=381%2C420" alt="naveed ashrafi" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg?resize=272%2C300 272w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg?resize=768%2C846 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg?resize=930%2C1024 930w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg?w=1440 1440w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/naveed-ashrafi.jpeg?w=1236 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You see dear readers this is the type of rhetoric that emanates from these so called modern day Sufi Barelwis and although at times it can be overlooked  but sometimes such despicable remarks need to be closed down combined with a basic history lesson on the view of the Sufi Barelwi elders, namely Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi who is considered the patron of the Barelwi sect with its origins in the northern indian state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brailwis.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-148 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brailwis.jpg?resize=300%2C150" alt="brailwis" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brailwis.jpg?resize=300%2C150 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brailwis.jpg?resize=100%2C50 100w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brailwis.jpg?w=660 660w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>The Shrine of Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan, venerated by grave worshippers</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The likes of Naveed Ashrafi and others of his ilk have continuously spewed such hate filled rhetoric at the expense of the Salafi&#8217;s and Ahl al-Hadith, who have unquestionably and undeniably been at the forefront in refuting, reprimanding and curbing the horrendous and despicable crimes of the Khariji terrorist renegades for decades. This Saudi and Wahhabi narrative that is oft repeated will be clarified in subsequent posts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The only thing he did get right, was calling us Salafi&#8217;s, Alhamdulillah even the Mushriks and Mushrik tentacles know we follow the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the Salaf us-Saleh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The point being the inflammatory post of Naveed Ashrafi is a clear manifestation of inciting hate based on fallacious and evil ideas. He was also removed from Ummah channel for 12 months or so, due to this remarks about Ahl al-Sunnah while using derogatory terms, nonetheless Naveed Ashrafi himself is unimportant and insignificant when it comes to this narrative because if we retort back to history and look at the lives and teaching of his forefathers, we will find nothing but Khariji, takfiri, hatred, incitement of violence, discord, slur and discord amongst the muslims as well as general society, even to the extent of creating social upheaval, a basic understanding of living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will inshaAllah show in forthcoming articles how Ahmad Raza Khan disseminated and incited hatred and inter Muslim sectarianism just as his ardent underlings are doing today, under the guise of social cleansing of the Salafi&#8217;s and Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama&#8217;ah on their third grade Channels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, prior to that let us look at what one of their own self professed renegades and the recently shamed, debunked and sour loser of the Tawhid Vs Shirk debate, namely Mr Asrar Rashid said about the position and viewpoint of the Spiritual leader and guide of the Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s ie Ahmad Raza Khan on the British. This is his clarification</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9dfDq3Ge_Rk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So here this representative of the Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s is claiming Ahmad Raza Khan was waging war against the British are (this is what this essentially means) and thus the followers of the Barelwi&#8217;s sect are the ones responsible for the discord and civil unrest in England not the Salafi&#8217;s or as the Mr Ashrafi put it the Wahhabi&#8217;s.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact of the matter is this souls are delusioned and ignorant of the basic facts and realities of their own leaders and spiritual guides and due to their infinite thinking capacity they are unable to think beyond the two words that regurgitate in their minds and tongues, ie Wahhabi&#8217;s and wobblers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ask Mohammad Naveed Ashrafi, beg your Theresa May to shut down and control the ignorant, two faced Barelwi&#8217;s sympathesiers who spew deceptive lies and in reality are the real khawarij renegades.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Mohammed Naveed Ashrafi has called out Bibi Theresa May against the Wahhabi&#8217;s, let us remind her and Mr Ashrafi that sometimes sharp people like Mr Ashrafi himself develop dementia and selective thinking. Overwhelmed by sheer hatred that at times in their unbalanced hormonal rage against the Salafi&#8217;s and Ahl Al Sunnah they forget the finer details of their own ancestry which leads them to their psychotic episodes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If Mohammed Naveed Ashrafi had any knowledge of his Ala Hazrat and his spiritual Pirs grandfather, namely Maulana Raza Ali Khan, he would have known his credentials and &#8216;efforts&#8217; in that he was anti British &amp; a freedom fighter and he also vehemently verified the fatwa of &#8216;Jihad&#8217; against the British Government!!! This information and other details are well documented in numerous books and a basic read of readily available books will churn out ample collaborating statements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bigben_2282465b.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-356 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bigben_2282465b.jpg?resize=300%2C187" alt="bigben_2282465b" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bigben_2282465b.jpg?resize=300%2C187 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bigben_2282465b.jpg?resize=100%2C62 100w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bigben_2282465b.jpg?w=620 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps next time he calls out Wahhabi&#8217;s in his idiotic rage, he might also slip in some history lessons of his shirk infested ancestry when he has a chat with Bibi Therasa May.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">oh yes and also, when the likes of Mohammad Naveed Ashrafi are constantly wobbling back and forth in their Sufi Hadra dances, Zikr Mehfils, esoteric dances and trances resembling the Hindus and Jews as part of their heretical belief system of reaching union with the creator and or his incarnation in them, we should not expect anything less from them after all the activities above except spewing the word, &#8216;wobblers&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84_1422014721.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1415 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84_1422014721.jpg?resize=300%2C150" alt="98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84_1422014721" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84_1422014721.jpg?resize=300%2C150 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84_1422014721.jpg?resize=100%2C50 100w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84_1422014721.jpg?w=660 660w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Please excuse the videos but sometimes people need to be spoken to on their level)</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/IBs35BTKG08?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and for crying out loud, this is a lengthy session on the very same channel Mohammed Naveed Ashrafi regularly appears on while spewing and spluttering his venom against the Muslims.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gk4GGjraKdM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and they call us wobblers &#8211; shamelessness has limits but unfortunately these ill mannered people have redefined it. After spending your lives wobbling and busting moves you have the audacity to call us wobblers? We do not know whether to laugh or to cry at such levels of ignorance which have overtaken the Ummah of Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sehsawani (1326H)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Siyanatul Insan An Waswas al-Shaikh Dahlan </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>(Protecting The Human From The Satanic Whisperings of Shaikh Dahlan)</em></strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Subki&#8217;s saying, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;It is rejecting the legislative evidences on the basis of bad thoughts.&#8221; </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sehsawani answers this and says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By Subki saying this he has suppressed the truth but rather confused it. He has left the prophetic texts, the legislative principles, decisive and specific texts for the unrestricted, general and unclear ones, just as the people of desires always do and we shall clarify this with the permission of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are prohibited from venerating the grave of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) which leads to shirk or if it is shirk itself. For example praying near the grave, making it a place of prostration and lighting candles near it, undertaking a journey to it and organising gatherings and events near it. Such prohibitions are well established in the authentic, clear and decisive narrations. Such prohibitions with the specific reasons, which are elucidated in the texts are also applicable to the graves of pious people. They are also included in the affairs which have been prohibited and an impetus in spreading shirk</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How is it possible for the narrations pertaining to the visitation of the grave to be contradictory, narrations which are not even authentic that allegedly evidence visitation of the grave of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). We know the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) did not instruct us concerning such visitation and in addition to the fact that we have clear, precise and authentic texts prohibiting this. All of the scholars of Hadith (Muhadithin) and the Hadith specialists did not declare a single narration to be authentic or even used a single one as evidence. On the contrary they declared every narration to be weak due to fabrication and lies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This also renders Subki&#8217;s claim of ijma of the Salaf and Khalaf to be null and void. This is because if he meant by Salaf, the companions, the muhajirin, the ansar and the tabi&#8217;in, then without a doubt his claim is an absolute lie. We have mentioned before that it is not established from any companion besides Ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhuma), that they would not visit the Prophets (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) grave and offer Salam after returning from a journey. This is not proven or established from the four rightly guided khulafa and neither did anyone support the practise of Ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) .</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abd al-Razzaq transmitted this report from Ibn Umar in his Musannaf from Mu&#8217;ammar from Ubaidullah from Ibn Umar and then says we do not know from any of the companions to have practised this except Ibn Umar&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sehsawani goes onto say</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise Sa&#8217;d bin Ibrahim bin Abd Al-Rahman bin Auf Zuhri was an Imam and the Qadi of Madinah during the era of the Tabi&#8217;in, his son Ibrahim said his father would never go near the grave and he would dislike doing this. So can it be said concerning such Imams that they also opposed the ijma? And or abandoned venerating the moa and grossly failed to raise his rank and station? If they say such is the case then this is nothing except something which makes ones hair stand on end.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The grave worshippers have no ijma with them except what the general masses are doing and this was from the time when there was little knowledge and din. This was from a time when the Sunnah had become weak and righteous actions were deemed to be bad and vice versa. For example making the prophets grave celebratory and making Hajj towards it, supplication towards it and making it a pillar of Hajj to visit his grave just like other places are visited as part of the ritual of Hajj like Arafah, Muzdalifah, Jamarat and the places around the Kabah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is still instilled in the hearts of the grave worshippers which they do not censure nor prohibit but rather they call to and encourage such practises. Whoever opposes them in this, they label as those who do not venerate and respect the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). This is what we call changing the Din and distorting it, if Allah had not taken the responsibility of preserving the Zikr and that a group of people would always remain upon the truth and that those who attempt to distort the Din will not be able to harm them, then the same would have happened just as the affair was with the people of the book. This is all due to following inauthentic ahadith and abandoning the clear authentic and definitive ahadith.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Is it permissible to venerate the dead on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 40<sup>th</sup> day after the demise of the deceased and what is the ruling on the food that which is prepared for such occasions? [Trans note: known as Khatams]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Venerating the dead by preparing food and transferring the reward to the deceased on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 40<sup>th</sup> day is an innovation. There is no evidence or even trace of this in the first 3 generations, hence this is an innovation and the Muslims should warn against this. Allah said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى ٱلۡبِرِّ وَٱلتَّقۡوَىٰ‌ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى ٱلۡإِثۡمِ وَٱلۡعُدۡوَٲنِ‌ۚ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ‌ۖ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلۡعِقَابِ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">       But help ye one another unto righteousness and pious duty. Help not one another unto sin and transgression, but keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is severe in punishment. [al-Maidah:2]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The food should not be consumed as this is also a type of veneration although the food is in and of itself not haram. An evidence which alludes to venerating the deceased and preparing for them on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 40<sup>th</sup> and other days are innovations and impermissible in the Shari’ah are the following statement of the Prophet ﷺ which are clear evidences that veneration on set days are innovations: “Whoever does an action which we have not sanctioned will be rejected (Mardud)” [<i>Trans Note: Bukhārī [no.2697], Muslim [no.1718], Musnad Aḥmad [6:146].  </i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus based on this hadeeth all of the aforementioned actions are innovations and heresies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ also said “The worst of the affairs are the innovations and heresies” [Trans Note: Muslim [no.867], Musnad Aḥmad [14:126], Abū Dawūd [no.4608], Tirmidhī [no.2676] and Mishkāt [no.16] and <em>Bukhari 7277</em>] with slight differences in the wording.]   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We pray that Allah saves our Muslim brothers and sisters from innovations. Upon us is to convey and Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Source: Fatawa Naziriyyah [1:277 – 278] of al-Muhadith Shaikh Sayyid Muhammad Nazir Hussain Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Agreed upon by the [following Shuyukh]:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sayyid Muhammad Abdus Salam</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ibrahim</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Abdul Aziz</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Jazakallahu Khair to Abu Hashim for his assistance</span></p>
