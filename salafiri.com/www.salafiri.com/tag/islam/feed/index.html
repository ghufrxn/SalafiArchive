				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Islām and the Veneration of Graves and Annual Gatherings</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>For the Muslim to Ponder and Reflect</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Ataullah Hanif Bhojiyani [1407H]</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/al-allamah-shaikh-muhammad-ataullah-hanif-bhojiyani-1407h/">[READ BIOGRAPHY HERE]</a></span></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Part 1</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The word used is ʾUrs which alludes to and if very commonly associated with wedding festivities however is Sūfī terminology it means the festivities and gatherings that take place annually around graves (or built up as shrines)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The history of the people of shirk and the Mushrikīn is a testimony that exaggerating their praise for their dead and venerating and respecting graves beyond the normal bounds was from amongst the major reasons they deviated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Corruption and Depravity in Making Graves into Shrines</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Without a doubt the bodies of the deceased and their graves require a given level of decorum however, this does not mean they are venerated by building structures over their graves and turning them into shrines. Likewise, nor does it mean to give these graves and shrines the same status as the house of Allāh, in that it is obligatory to undertake long ardent journeys as part of the Dīn to visit it and recommended to visit the Prophets Masjid and there is certainly no evidence making it permissible to seek aid and assistance from the dead and thereby calling upon them and supplicating to them just as we do with Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Origins of Idol and Grave Worship</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is shameful that in addition to all kinds of gross indecency and open sinning that takes place at such shrines and tombs, they are also venerated and idolised just as the Masajid are. They celebrate the birthdays fuelled with festivities at the graves and they also pray towards them as the Qiblah. They make tawaf of the graves and prostrate to them and in reality this is also idol worship which is shirk. This is the deplorable evil Islam came to eliminate and this is also the rot and foundation of idol worship. Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Qayyim said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Idol worship started with the veneration of the dead by making their pictures and by touching their graves and praying near them (ie their graves).”</em> [Ighāthah al-Luhfān Fī Masāʾid al-Shayṭān [2:197]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Grave Worship is the Hallmark of the Jews and Christians</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also known despite their claim of believing in the oneness of the creator the jews and christians became engrossed in this catastrophic calamity and became deeply embroiled in shirk ie polytheism. In this regard Allāhs wrath was upon them. The Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said five days before his demise,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Beware of those who preceded you (jews and christians) and used to take the graves of their Prophets and righteous men as places of worship, but you must not take graves as mosques; I forbid you to do that.&#8221;</em> [Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim [1:210]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[Trans. Note] the full text of the hadith as narrated by Jundub (RadhiAllahu Anhu), </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“I heard from the Messenger of Allāh</em><em> (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</em><em>) five days before his death and he said: I stand acquitted before Allāh that I took any one of you as friend, for Allāh has taken me as His friend, as he took Ibrāhim as His friend. Had I taken any one of my Ummah as a friend, I would have taken Abū Bakr as a friend. Beware of those who preceded you and used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous men as places of worship, but you must not take graves as mosques; I forbid you to do that.” </em>[Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim [no.532]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Annual Celebrations and Gatherings are the Root of Grave Worship</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the forms of veneration is what has been mentioned in the previous ḥadīth, another form is what they practice in terms of the worship they conduct on their annual birthday celebrations and their days which they celebrate just as they celebrate Eiʿd day as. Shaikh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“As for making structures over graves and venerating them, is unlawful with Allah and his Messenger. It is also veneration to specify a specific time in order to visit these graves and to generally gather around them at a specific time is also a form of veneration celebrations.”</em> [Iqtiḍā Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqim [p.181]   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">he also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Eid is the title of a specific place, a place where there is intent to worship Allah by gathering there. For example Masjid al-Haram, Mina, Muzdalifah, Arafah which have been titled as Eid by Allah. Such are places where the people gather on specific days where they supplicate, make Zikr and offer sacrifice. The Mushrikin also had similar places or gatherings where they would accumulate and perform similar acts (or worship) but when Islam came it finished such acts. The graves of the Prophets and the righteous people also fall under this category.” </em>(Iqtiḍā Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqim (p.156)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning the graves of the Prophets and the righteous people should not be made into places of gatherings or festivities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Taqlid of the Hindu</span>’s</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shah Waliullah writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The habit and norm of the fire worshippers and the idol worshippers of Hindh is to establish a particular day to gather at a specific place to make celebrations. The pir worshippers have followed in their footstep and celebrate Eid Ghadir Kum or annual celebration at the grave of some holy person. They indulge in all kinds of luxuries and extravagance, thereby pleasing shaytan and upsetting the elders.” </em>(Balagh al-Mubin (p.31)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He writes at another instance,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“From the major innovations is to make numerous fabrications concerning the affair of the grave and then to make them into places of festivities and gatherings.”</em> (Tafhimat Ilahiyyah 2:64)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated by</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Abdullah</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>The Definition of Tawhid</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>In the arabic language:</em></strong> It comes from the source    وَحَّدَ يُوَحِّدُ  which means to make something one, or to single out.</p>
<p>For example: If you say (in arabic):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>لا يخرج من البيت أحد إلا محمد  </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>“No one exited from the house except for Muhammad.”</strong></p>
<p>You have singled out Muhammad only from exiting the house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you say (in arabic):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>  لا يقم من المجلس أحد إلا خالد فقط   </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>“No one stood up from the gathering except for khalid.”  </strong></p>
<p>You have also singled out khalid only from the gathering.</p>
<p><em><strong>In Islamic terminology:</strong> (Tawhid means):</em></p>
<p>Singling out Allah in:</p>
<p>-Lordship.</p>
<p>-Divinity (worship).</p>
<p>-Names and Attributes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>The Types of Tawhid</strong></h3>
<p>Tawheed is catergorised into three types:</p>
<p>-Tawheed Rububiyyah (Lordship).</p>
<p>-Tawheed Uloohiyyah (Divinity/worship).</p>
<p>-Tawheed Asmaa wa Sifaat (Names and Attributes).</p>
<p>And the following is an explanation of each catergory with evidences:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Tawheed Rububiyyah (Lordship):</strong></em> it is to single out Allah in: Creation, dominion and governance (of the universe). Or we can say: it is the singling out of Allah most glorious in His actions. Some examples of His actions are: Creating the creation, providing for the creation, giving life and death to the creation and sending down the rain and producing vegetation from the earth and other than that.</p>
<p>The evidence for this are the following at</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>“Unquestionably, His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah, Lord of the worlds.” (Surah 7:54)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is over all things competent. (Surah 3:189)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Say, &#8220;Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges [every] matter?&#8221; They will say, &#8221; Allah ,&#8221; so say, &#8220;Then will you not fear Him?” (Surah 10:31)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Tawheed Uloohiyyah</strong></em> -and it is also referred to as: Tawheed al-‘ibadah- (Divinity and worship): it is to single out Allah most glorious with worship and divinity. For example: Salah (prayer), Siyaam (fasting), Hajj (pilgrimage), Tawakkul (trust), Nadhr (oath), Khawf wa Rajaa (fear and hope) and Muhabbah (love) anf other than that.</p>
<p>The evidence for this are the following at</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me. (Surah 51:56)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, (surah 4:36)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><strong>And We sent not before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that, &#8220;There is no deity except Me, so worship Me.”(Surah 21:25)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Tawheed Asmaa wa Sifaat (Names and Attributes):</strong> </em>it is to attribute to Allah what He attributed to Himself, and what His Messenger (peace be upon him) attributed (to Allah), from attributes of perfection and majestic description, without likening them to the creation, or asking about their nature, and without distorting or denying them.</p>
<p>The evidence for this are the following at</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing. (Surah 42:11)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><strong>And to Allah belong the best names, so invoke Him by them. And leave [the company of] those who practice deviation concerning His names. They will be recompensed for what they have been doing. (Surah 7:180)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Important benefits</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The three types of tawheed are متلازمة (incorporated), meaning any category cannot be separate from the other. So whoever holds the belief in one of these categories, apart from the other(s), is not considered as a Muwahhid (person with complete belief in Tawheed).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">That you know that the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) fought, affirmed the belief in Tawheed Rububiyyah (Lordship). So they knew that Allah was the Creator, the Provider, the Giver of life and death, the One who gave benefit and harm, and the One who controls and manages all the affairs (of the universe)&#8230;but even with that belief, it did not enter them into Islam, and the evidence for this is the statement of the Most High:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Say (O Muhammad, to the polytheists), &#8220;Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges [every] matter?&#8221; They will say, &#8221; Allah ,&#8221; so say, &#8220;Then will you not fear Him?” (Surah 10:31)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Tawheed Uloohiyyah (divinity/worship) is the fundemental theme and call of all the messengers; because it is the foundation that all of ones actions are built upon, and without its correct implementation all of the actions (good deeds) will not be correct. And if it (tawheed uloohiyyah) is not correctly implemented, its opposite, Shirk (polytheism), will occur. And the dispute between the messengers and their people was around this topic of Tawheed (uloohiyyah), so it is obligatory to take caution (in learning it) and learning issues pertaining to it and understanding its origins.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">The permissibility of slaughtering with anything that makes the blood flow, except teeth and other bones</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[380] Rafi&#8217; Bin Khadij (Radi Allahu Anhu) said,<br />
&#8220;We were in the company of the Prophet (Sallalhu Alayhi Wa Sallam) at DhulHulaifa, and the people suffered from hunger. We got some camels and sheep (as booty) and the Prophet (Sallalhu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was still behind the people. They hurried and put the cooking pots on the fire. (When he came) he ordered that the cooking pots should be upturned and then he distributed the booty (amongst the people) regarding ten sheep as equal to one camel then a camel fled and the people chased it till they got tired, as they had a few horses (for chasing it). So a man threw an arrow at it and caused it to stop (with Allah&#8217;s Permission). On that the Prophet (Sallalhu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, &#8216;Some of these animals behave like wild beasts, so, if any animal flee from you, deal with it in the same way.&#8221; My grandfather asked (the Prophet (Sallalhu Alayhi Wa Sallam)), &#8220;We hope (or are afraid) that we may meet the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives. Can we slaughter our animals with canes?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalhu Alayhi Wa Sallam) replied, &#8220;If the instrument used for killing and causes the animal to bleed profusely and if Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on killing it, then eat its meat (i.e. it is lawful) but don’t use a tooth or a fingernail and I am telling you the reason: A tooth is a bone (and slaughtering with a bone is forbidden), and a fingernail is the slaughtering instrument of the Ethiopians.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. Halfahu is said to be called a (medicinal) herb, that is predominantly found in this area and because of this relevance it is named dhul hulayfa. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. The army of Muslims encamped in this valley which had the (spoils of war or) war booty wealth of camels. When they became hungry they hastily slaughtered them and started to cook them. Since they did this without permission of the prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Salam), he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) commanded them to overturn the cooking pots in order to correct their manners and teach them a lesson. The cooked meat was wasted and they listened to the command. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. Essentially this was to teach a lesson that it is not correct to use the war booty wealth used before it is distributed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4. Afterwards the Prophet (Salallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) distributed it. On this occasion a companion asked that if you can&#8217;t find a knife to slaughter the animal then can we use a cane instead or something else. He (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) replied by saying that anything that can cut and is sharp enough to shed blood profusely can be used. However teeth or fingernails are not allowed because teeth are bones and fingernails are a type of bone and they are the knives of the Abyssinians.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5. The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) used to travel at the back of the Muslim army. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6. The leader for his people (citizens) or general (for his army) can immediately make a decision in order to reconcile and rectify the issue. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7. The reason why the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) told the companions to over turn the cooking pots and waste the meat is that so they wouldn&#8217;t make the mistake of getting ahead of themselves without permission again. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8. It is necessary for the leader to be just and fair with his people. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9. You should be just and fair whilst distributing the spoils of war. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10. If a camel, cow, goat etc. runs away and you can&#8217;t catch it and someone shoots it with an arrow, it is permissible to eat it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">11. Whichever tool causes bleeding can be used to slaughter an animal. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">12. It is necessary to say bismillah Allahu Akbar meaning the Takbir at the time of slaughtering otherwise the meat will not be halal. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">13. It is not allowed to slaughter an animal using teeth or fingernails. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">14. It is not allowed to slaughter an animal using a bone no matter how sharp it is.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Hunting With Trained and Untrained Dogs</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[377] </strong><strong>Narrated Abu Tha`laba Al-Khushani (Radiullahu Anhu):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>I came to the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! We are living in a land ruled by the people of the Scripture (i.e. Jews and Christians); Can we take our meals in their utensils? In that land there is plenty of game and I hunt the game with my bow and with my hound (dog) that is not trained and with my trained hound (dog). Then what is lawful for me to eat?&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for what you have mentioned about the people of the Scripture, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat out of theirs, but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash their utensils and eat out of it. If you hunt an animal with your bow after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it. and if you hunt something with your trained hound after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it, and if you hunt something with your untrained hound (and get it before it dies) and slaughter it, eat of it.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;">[REFERENCES]</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bukhari, Book of Slaughtering and Hunting, Chapter: About hunting with a bow [no.5478]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Muslim, Book of The Book of Hunting, Slaughter, and what may be Eaten, Chapter: Hunting with trained dogs and arrows [no.1930]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1)  During hunting if you shoot your arrow and say Bismillah Allahu Akbar and the game (animal) has fallen and died then its meat is halal </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2) If the hunting dog catches the game (animal) and brings it back to you then its meat is halal on the condition that when you released the hunting dog to carry out the hunt you said Bismillah Allahu akbar. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3) If you release an untrained hunting dog to carry out a hunt and it catches the game meat alive then you sacrifice it in a halal manner it is allowed to eat it. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4) This hadith clearly shows the virtue and superiority of the one who has knowledge compared to the one who is ignorant i.e. the trained (knowledgeable) dog compared to the untrained (ignorant of hunting skills) dog. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) It is allowed to use the kufars utensils and clothes on the condition that you can’t get hold of other utensils and clothes. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Before using these type of utensils or clothes they should be washed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) It is necessary to clean used utensils or clothes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) It is allowed to hunt with a trained (hunting) dog and bow and arrow (in this era it’s equivalence such as a gun).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) The takbir should be said at the time of hunting when shooting the arrow, firing the bullet or letting the hunting dog loose. The wording for the takbir is Bismillah Allahu Akbar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) It is allowed to have game meat that has been hunted by a non trained (hunting) dog on the condition that it brings the game back alive and you slaughter it in a halal manner. If the game animal is brought back dead then it is not allowed to eat it.</span></p>
