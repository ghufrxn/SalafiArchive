				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is correct that the one who intentionally abandons the prayer is a disbeliever and that his fast, as well as other acts of worship, are not correct (i.e., accepted) until he repents to Allah (Exalted is He), due to the saying of Allah, Mighty and Majestic:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُوا لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;But if they associated partners [with Allah], all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them.&#8221; </strong><em>(Surah Al-An&#8217;am, 6:88)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Additionally, the meaning of this Ayah is supported by numerous other Ayat and Ahadith which indicate that the actions (i.e., worship) of the one that abandons the prayer are fruitless. Some of Ahlul-&#8216;Ilm (the People of Knowledge) took the view that the one who acknowledges the obligation of the prayer, but leaves it off due to laziness and carelessness, then his fast and other acts of worship are not in vain (i.e., they consider him to be a Muslim). However, the first position is correct &#8211; the one who intentionally abandons the prayer is a disbeliever, even if he acknowledges its obligation, due to the numerous evidences for this position. From these evidences, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>&#8220;Verily between a man and between shirk (polytheism) and kufr (disbelief) is the abandonment of the prayer.&#8221; </strong><em>(Sahih Muslim no.82)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">and he ﷺ also said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><b>&#8220;The covenant between us and between them (the disbelievers) is the prayer, so whoever abandons it has disbelieved.&#8221; </b><em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi no.1621, Sunan ibn Majah no.1079, Sunan An-Nasa&#8217;i no.464, Musnad Imam Ahmad 5:346)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This hadith has been narrated by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa&#8217;i, At-Tirmidhi and ibn Majah through the path of Buraydah bin Al-Husayb Aslami (may Allah be pleased with him) with a sahih sanad (authentic chain of narration).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from ‘Ahkam wa Masa’il Ramadan’ (p.51,52)</em></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>TN</strong>: Imam Al-Sabuni mentions, <strong>&#8220;And the Ahlul-Hadith differed over the Muslim that intentionally abandons the obligatory prayer, so Ahmad bin Hanbal and a group from the scholars of the Salaf (may Allah have mercy upon them) made takfir of him on account of that, and removed him from Islam, due to the authentic narration: &#8216;Between the slave and between Ash-Shirk is the abandonment of the prayer.&#8217; And the way Ash-Shafi&#8217;i, his companions, and another group from the scholars of the Salaf took is that he has not disbelieved (major disbelief), as long as he continues to believe in its obligation.&#8221; </strong><em>(Aqidatus Salaf wa Ashabul Hadith p.279, Dar Al-&#8216;Asimah edn.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Shaykh ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;Verily he does not disbelieve except by abandoning the prayer permanently, meaning he has settled himself upon the abandonment of the prayer, so he does not pray Dhuhr, nor &#8216;Asr, nor Maghrib, nor &#8216;Isha, nor Fajr, then this is the one who has disbelieved. So if he prays one or two of the obligatory prayers, then he has not disbelieved, because this is not the one who has abandoned the prayer, and surely the Prophet ﷺ said, &#8216;Between a man and between Ash-Shirk and Al-Kufr is the abandonment of the prayer&#8217; and he did not say: &#8216;abandonment of a prayer.'&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sharh Al-Mumti&#8217; 2:27, Dar ibn Al-Jawzi edn.) </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Regardless, those that abandon a single prayer should be aware that they have fallen into a grave matter, Imam Adh-Dhahabi narrates that Ibn Hazm said, <strong>&#8220;There is no sin, after Shirk, more severe than abandoning the Prayer until its time ends and killing a Muslim unjustly.&#8221; </strong><em>(Kitab Al-Kaba&#8217;ir p.91, Dar Al-Mirath An-Nabawi edn.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And Allah surely knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from Monthly Al-Ḥadīth Hazro No. 62, P. 40-43.</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">الحمد لله رب العالمين والصلوة والسلام على رسوله الأمين، أما بعد</h3>
<p>All praise is for Allāh, Rabb of the ‘Ālamīn (all that exists), and may His Praise and Peace be upon his Trusted Messenger, to proceed – the permissibility of women praying behind men in the Masājid is established from authentic aḥādīth and āthār of the pious predecessors (Salaf al-Ṣāliḥīn), some of the evidence for this is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1) Sayyidunā ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar  narrated the Prophet ﷺ said, “When your women ask you for permission to go to the masjid at night, then grant them permission.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.865, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.442 Darussalam no.988)</em></p>
<p>Ḥāfiẓ Ibn ‘Abdil-Barr said, “This ḥādīth shows understanding that it is permissible for women to go to the masjid at night, and this is applicable to every prayer (from the general meaning of the ḥādīth)”. <em>(At-Tamhīd 24/281)</em></p>
<p><strong>2) It is narrated from Ummul Mu’minīn Sayyidah Umm Salamah that during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ when the women said the final taslīm of the prayers they would stand [to leave], and the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ and the men (his Companions) would remain seated. Then, when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ stood, the men would also stand. </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.866)</em></p>
<p><strong>3) It is narrated from Ummul Mu’minīn Sayyidah ʿĀʾishah When Allah’s Messenger ﷺ would lead the morning prayer, the women would leave wrapped in their murūṭ (woollen garments), without being recognised due to darkness. </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.867, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.645, Muwaṭṭa of Imām Mālik 1/5 no.3 and no.494 in the recension of Ibn Al-Qāsim)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></em></p>
<p>It is apparent from this ḥādīth that it is permissible for women to offer prayers in the Masājid. There is another narration from Sayyidah ʿĀʾishah in which the Prophet ﷺ said, “Do not prevent the women from going to the Masājid, and they should go (to the Masjid) without perfume while wearing plain clothes.” Sayyidah ʿĀʾishah i said, “If he (the Prophet ﷺ) saw the state of the women today, he would have prevented them (from going to the Masājid).” <em>(Musnad Aḥmad 6/69-70 and its chain is ḥasan)</em></p>
<p>There is another narration from Sayyidah ʿĀʾishah which says that if the Prophet ﷺ saw the state of the women today, he would have prevented them from the Masājid just as the women of Bani Isrā’īl were prevented. <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.869, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.445)</em></p>
<p>It is understood from this ḥādīth that the previous legislation that prohibited women from praying in the masjid is now abrogated – we do not act on the the law of Bani Isrā’īl, but we act in accordance with the Islamic law given to the Noble Prophet ﷺ, the Seal of all the Prophets, until the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p><strong>4) Sayyidunā Abū Qatādah Al-Anṣārī narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said, “I stand for the prayer, and I intend to lengthen it, then I hear the crying of a child, so I shorten the prayer as I dislike that there be a hardship upon his mother.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.868)</em></p>
<p><strong>5) Sayyidunā Anas bin Mālik narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said, “Verily I begin the prayer and I desire for it to be lengthened, then I hear the crying of a child, so I shorten the prayer because I know his crying will cause emotional distress for his mother.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.709, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.470)</em></p>
<p><strong>6) Sayyidah Zaynab Ath-Thaqafiyyah used to report from the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ that he said, “When any one of you women [intend to be] present at ‘Ishā’, then let her not apply perfume that night.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.443)</em></p>
<p><strong>7) Sayyidunā Abū Hurayra narrated the Prophet ﷺ said, “Do not prevent a female slave of Allāh from going to the Masājid of Allāh, and they may leave [to go to the masjid] without being perfumed.” </strong><em>(Musnad Aḥmad 2/438 no.9645 and its chain is ḥasan and it is his wording, Sunan Abī Dāwūd no.565, Ṣaḥīḥ ibn Khuzaymah no.1679, and Ibn Ḥibbān no.2214)</em></p>
<p><strong>8) Sayyidunā Abū Sa’īd Al-Khudrī narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said, “O Assembly of women! When a man goes into sujūd (prostration), then protect your gazes.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ ibn Khuzaymah no.1694 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Ṣaḥīḥ Ibn Ḥibbān no.402, and Ṣaḥīḥ according to Al-Ḥākim upon the conditions of the Shaykhayn (Bukhārī and Muslim) 1/191-192)</em></p>
<p><strong>9) Sayyidunā Sahl bin Sa’d narrated that, “During the lifetime of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, the women were commanded not to raise their heads before the men had sat (after prostration) due to the ugliness of their clothes (i.e., the shapes of their bodies being exposed).” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ ibn Khuzaymah no.1695, Ṣaḥīḥ Ibn Ḥibbān no.2216, and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ. Also, Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.362, 814, 1215 and Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.441)</em></p>
<p><strong>10) Sayyidunā Zayd bin Khālid narrated the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said, “Do not prevent the female slave of Allāh from going to the Masājid of Allāh, and they may leave [to go to the masjid] without being perfumed.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Ibn Ḥibbān no.2208 and its chain is ḥasan, another edition no.2211 and Al-Haythamī also said it is hasan in Majma’ Al-Zawā’id 2/33)</em></p>
<p>In summary, these narrations prove that women are permitted to offer ṣalāh in the masjid, provided that there is no fear of fitnah (temptation). It is also more virtuous for a woman to offer the prayer in her home, due to the fact that prayer in congregation is not obligatory for them.</p>
<p>Sayyidunā ‘Umar&#8217;s wife would go to the masjid offer the ‘Ishā’ prayer, and Sayyidunā ‘Umar did not prevent her from that. <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī no.362, 814, 1215 and Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.441)</em></p>
<p>Sayyidunā Ibn ‘Umar was so strict in this matter, when one of his sons said: “We prevent our women from going to the Masjid.”, he severely admonished him, and beat him. <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim no.442)</em></p>
<p>One woman vowed that if her husband was released from prison, she would pray 2 rak’at (cycles of prayer) in every masjid in Baṣra. Al-Ḥasan Al-Baṣrī said, “She should pray in the masjid of her people.” <em>(Muṣannaf ibn Abī Shaybah 2/484 no.7617, and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</em> – That is, she should not pray in every masjid, but rather she should fulfill the vow by praying in the masjid in her neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Sayyidunā Abū Hurayra said, “The best row (in congregational prayer) for the women is the last row, and the worst row is the first row.” <em>(Muṣannaf ibn Abī Shaybah 2/385 no.7623, and its chain is ḥasan)</em></p>
<p>‘Urwah bin Az-Zubayr said, “It is said that the best row for the women is the last row, and the worst row is the first row.” <em>(Muṣannaf ibn Abī Shaybah 2/385 no.7624, and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</em></p>
<p>Imām Abū Bakr Muḥammad bin Ibrahīm Al-Mundhir An-Naysabūrī said, “Ahlul ‘Ilm (The People of Knowledge) are in agreement that the Jumu’ah (Friday) prayer is not obligatory on women, and they also have consensus that if she attends and prays with the Imam (in congregation), then this is sufficient (i.e., permissible).” <em>(Al-Awsaṭ 6/156 no.864)</em></p>
<p>It is proven and established from authentic aḥādīth and āthār of the Salaf us-Ṣāliḥ that it is permissible for women to pray ṣalāh in the masājid with the condition that they adhere to the etiquettes of Islamic legislation and are veiled, and so on. On the day of Jumuʿah it is preferable for them to go to the masjid, rather than sitting at home, so that they may pray Ṣalāt al-Jumuʿah behind the imām and listen to the sermon to learn matters of the religion.</p>
<p>It is surprising that some people take their women out for Tablīghī Jama’at, then prohibit them from praying in the masjid, so that they remain ignorant and detached from religious education – if their women are forbidden from the masjid, and they keep them away from Masjid An-Nabawī, then these helpless women will be prevented from ṭawāf (circumambulating the Ka’ba) and the virtues of the Haramayn (Makkah and Medinah), and they will also be cut off from offering the Pillars of Ḥajj, and the error in this is self-evident.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><u>وَمَا عَلَيۡنَآ إِلَّا ٱلۡبَلَـٰغُ ٱلۡمُبِينُ</u></h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>“And our duty is only to convey plainly (the Message).” [36:17]</em></p>
<hr />
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Shaykh Zubair ‘Alī Za’ī in explanation of this ḥādīth wrote, “1. The morning prayer should be offered in the darkness (i.e. when it is dark). 2. It is necessary for women to cover themselves with a veil. 3. Every woman should veil herself from men. 4. It is permissible for women to offer prayers in the Masjid…” <em>(Itihaf ul-Basim Fi Tahqiq Muwatta al-Imam Malik, under ḥādīth no.494)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This fatwa of the great Ahl al-Hadith Shaykh, Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan shows the methodology of the Ahl a-Hadith. He clarifies mixing and sitting with people who hold such belief and ideas, let alone cooperating with them. And if Shaykh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan is not from the Akabarin, then I don&#8217;t know who is! Let me warn you dear readers, this Fatwa is not for the faint hearted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Sayyid Nawab Muhamamd Siddiq Hasan Khan Rahimahullah (d.1370/1890) was asked:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) Will the scholars of the Din and the Shari’ah clarify: the muqallidin group who perform taqlid of only one Imam, are they considered to be from Ahl al-Sunnah or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) And is the prayer behind them valid or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Is it permissible or impermissible to let them enter our Masjid and to have sittings and mixing with them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muqallidin of this type in India who have the obvious trait of having enmity and hatred against the people who act on Hadith, hurling slanderous lies and false accusations against them, being irritated with them for saying Amin loudly, raising their hands, placing the hands on the chest and reciting al-Fatihah behind the Imam, which are all established and proven from the authentic ahadith, that are not abrogated and are from raised reports that are not figuratively explained. Likewise, those who commit innovations like Milad, Urs (annual commemorative celebrations for saints) and going into seclusion for 40 days (like Sufis do for meditation and maraqabah) as well numerous other innovations, then they are out of the fold of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah and are like the other deviated sects like the Jahmiyyah, Murjiyyah and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is because they oppose Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l Jama’ah in hundreds of issues, in both Aqidah and actions. In fact, at times some of their beliefs and actions seem to be exactly like that of the Jahmiyyah and the Murji’ah, which will not be hidden from the reader of this treatise. What is to follow, are a few example of the issues, with regards to their Aqidah and actions (a few examples from a whole catalogue) in order to support my claim concerning them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqa’id</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They believe Iman does not increase or decrease, in fact they believe the Iman of an open wicked sinner, the Iman of the Prophets and the Angels is on the same level and equal, which is the Madhhab of the Murji’ah, which is a sect from among the misguided deviated sects as Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal as written in his treatise on Aqidah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>SECONDLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They believe that in all issues of the Din it is obligatory and compulsory to do taqlid of only one Imam, even if it opposes and contradicts the Quran and Hadith, whereas the Hanafi scholars have declared this type of taqlid to be shirk and have discoursed this under the ayah, <strong>“They took their rabbis and monks as lords beside Allah.”</strong> (Surah al-Tawbah, 9:31).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THIRDLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we find from Tafsir Mazhari of Qadhi Thanullah Panipati that the doors of ijtihad were closed with the four Imams and no one can be a mujtahid now, as Fatawa Durr al-Mukhtar mentions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>FORTHLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Isa Alayhis Salam descends, he will do taqlid of Imam A’zam (i.e. Abu Hanifah and this point is mentioned in Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:34.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We see refuge in Allah from these corrupt beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ACTIONS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(They say and hold the view)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) It is permissible for the Muslims to take interest from the non-Muslims in Dar al-Harb (a land that Muslims are at war with) (Sharh Waqayah, 3:130 Urdu) as it is also mentioned in the Farsi translation of Hidayah, published in Nawal Kishore, 3:96. (Durr al-Mukhtar, 3:149-Urdu, 1:43-Arabic).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) If someone has a nose bleed and the bleeding does not stop, then it is permissible for him to write the Quran on his forehead with either urine or blood. This is their respect for the Qur’an (Alamghiri, Delhi Print, 5:134, Arabic 1:154, Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:120-Urdu, Alamghiri, 3:404)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Masturbation does not break the fast as Fatawa Qadhi Khan states as mentioned in volume 1. (Qadhi Khan, 4:361)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) If a person is very aroused and fears fornication, then masturbating is obligatory as Radd al-Mukhtar the notes to Durr al-Mukhtar, Mujtabia Delhi print, p.165.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) If a man wraps his private part (male organ) in a cloth and has sexual intercourse with a woman while fasting and if the cloth is strong, he doesn’t have to repeat the fast nor have a bath for ritual impurity, as is mentioned in Barahana printed Matb’a Husami Lahore, 2:18.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) If a man conducts a wedding ceremony, marrying a man from the west to a woman from the east (meaning there is a difference of one year of journey time by walking) and then the women gives birth in 6 months, the man from the west will be considered to be the father and this will be considered his karamah (i.e. Miracle) even though the man and woman have not met. As mentioned in Fath al-Qadir in the notes to Hidayah, Nawal Kishore, 2:338. (Tablighi Behshiti Zewar, p.240 Lahore)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) Any animal bred while eating pig meat, is Halal as Ghayatul Awthar urdu translation of Durr al-Mukhtar, Nawal Kishore print, 4:196, mentions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) The revenue generated from fornication (i.e. prostitution) is lawful as Chalpi notes to Sharh Waqayah, Nawal Kishore Print mentions, p.298 in the footnotes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) Tanning pig skin purifies it and selling it is also permissible, as Muniyyah al-Musalli, Lahore print, p.32 states (Arabic edn. P.49, Mujtabai print).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10) the permissibility of doing tricks with Zakat. Meaning that if a person gives his wealth to either his wife or gifts it someone else, before the year is complete with the intentions that he doesn’t need to pay zakat, and then the wealth is returned to him after the year is complete, then this is permissible. Imam Abu Yusuf used to do this (Ihya al-Ulum, Arabic Nawal Kishore, 1:11, Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:505, Alamghiri, 10:334-335)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">11) If a man enters (i.e. sexually) a four legged (i.e. Animal) or a dead person and he does not ejaculate, it does not break his fast nor does he have to make ghusl, as Fatawa Qadhi Khan states, Nawal Kishore print, 1:105.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">12) Legal punishments ordered by the Qadhi are implemented inwardly and outwardly. For example, if a person claims that another mans wife is his wife and he gives a false testimony and then wins the trial, the woman will be his. Therefore, she will be lawful for him according to Allah’s law and the people and it is permissible for him to sleep with her and he will not be imprisoned according to Allah’s law. (Hidayah Matba Mustafai, 2:125, Sharh Waqayah, 3:59),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">13) If a person deliberately passes wind after reciting the Tashahhud, his prayer will be complete. (Sharh Waqayah Arabic Matb’a Nawal Kishore, 1:43, urdu 1:401).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">14) If someone borrows someone’s female slave and then commits fornication with her, there is no legal punishment on him despite knowing the female servant is unlawful for him i.e. an illicit sexual relationship. Hidayah Farisi translation, Nawal Kishore, 2:302-303.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 2</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The prayer behind such muqallidin will not be permissible, because we find from what has preceded that the beliefs and actions of these people oppose the way of Ahl al-Sunnah, in fact some beliefs and actions necessitate shirk and some corrupt the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 3</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Letting such muqallidin into your Masajid is impressible according to the shari’ah according to the ayah <strong>“</strong><strong>Expel them from wherever they have expelled you.”</strong> (Surah al-Baqarah, 2:191) and according to the command in the ayah, <strong>“Then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people.”</strong> (Surah al-An’am, 6:68). Therefore, mixing with them, sitting with them, marrying them, being with them in times of sadness and other interactions and connections are all unlawful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be clearly noted the commissioner of Delhi reconciled both parties and also issued a written tract which both parties agreed too, curbing the animosity and to pray behind each other as long as the prayer in not invalidated in order to preserve peace and prevent chaos. However, the muqallidin rejected this reconciliation again and concocted some baseless points. So, they returned to their original ways and began issuing posters and treatise against the people of Tawhid without caring for the reconciliation agreement.</span></p>
