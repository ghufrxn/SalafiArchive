<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Introduction </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a short paper that shall examine the principles of the Ḥanafīs, more specifically, the Deobandīs and Barelwīs and their relationship with the divine ḥadīth of the Nabī ﷺ. The paper aims to discuss and comment on themes such as:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafīs and their stance on Mawqūf narrations of the Ṣaḥābah. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafīs and their attacks on the Ṣaḥābah. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥanafīs and the scathing attack on the rūwāt [narrators] of Bukhārī and Muslim. Why and to what end? </span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafīs and the Nabī ﷺ</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Who criticised the narrations in Bukhārī and Muslim, Imām Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī رحمه الله or the Ḥanafīs and why?</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By no means does this paper seek to delve into the issues of ʿAqīdah or Fiqh in which the Ḥanafīs, that is the Deobandīs and Barelwīs, have rejected the ḥadīth due to their tahazzub (partisanship) and blind following of their Madhhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nor does this paper consider the absurdities of the Ḥanafī-Deobandīs vis a vis their &#8216;fiqh&#8217; which begins and ends with a disarray of fragmented opinions and verdicts which not only oppose the divine texts but also oppose the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥīn and their verdicts. This is something which can be examined by those who have the time and patience to sift through Ḥanafī texts collating the evidences.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To proceed:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For centuries the people of misguidance have been hurling abuse at the Ahl al-Ḥadīth and the Ḥanafīs are no exception to this. It&#8217;s often been said by the Ḥanafīs more specifically the Deobandī sect, that the Ahl al-Ḥadīth are a group of people that reject the sayings and the aḥādīth of the Ṣaḥābah رضوان الله عليهم أجمعين  and in doing so they have resembled the Shīʿah and people of misguidance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Had the Ḥanafīs uttered their saying so as to not give precedence to a saying of a Ṣaḥābī which was not in line with al-ḥadīth al-marfūʿ from Rasūlullāh ﷺ himself then this would be correct and in sync with position of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth, for the Ahl al-Ḥadīth do not permit blind following or clinging to the opinion of anyone in opposition to the sacred ḥadīth from Rasūlullāh ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, the Ḥanafīs in their usual hypocritical way have alluded that such a position of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth is not only erroneous but also an attack on the Ṣaḥābah and the aḥādīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It&#8217;s interesting to note that the Deobandīs are at the foremost in rejecting ḥadīth. In fact, for the Ḥanafī Madhhab, Sunnah and ḥadīth are seen as a secondary source equalled and level on par to qiyās and opinion with the later many times being given precedence over the blessed ḥadīth, as shall be illustrated later on by the permission of Allāh ﷻ the Most High, free from His creation completely. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In so far as ḥadīth is concerned, one can observe a plethora of evidence to substantiate the fact that, the Ḥanafī-Deobandīs have not only rejected the mawqūf riwāyat, that is the traditions reported from the Ṣaḥābah that have not reached the Nabī ﷺ, in fact they&#8217;ve gone further by criticising certain Ṣaḥābah and even attacked the ʿAdālah (عدالة) and Ḍabṭ (ضبط), which means the uprightness and the precision and preservation of ʿilm from the Ṣaḥābah, only because the riwāyah of the Ṣaḥābah were in opposition to the Ḥanafī Madhhab or Ḥanafī analogy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is in fact they, the Deobandīs, who have resembled the Shīʿah in their position and not the Ahl al-Ḥadīth and this chapter aims to substantiate that. One may ask why start with the Ḥanafīs and the Ṣaḥābah in this paper? The reply is due to the fact that the Deobandīs are the most vocal of sects that hoodwinks the masses into believing that they are the defenders of the Ṣaḥābah and have the utmost love for them, of course the opposite is the reality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In any event it is important to begin with the Ṣaḥābah as it is a principle of our ʿAqīdah that the entire understanding of our Dīn is based upon the understanding of the Ṣaḥābah as they learnt directly from the Nabī ﷺ and were thus the conveyors of truth and revelation to the ummah of the Nabī ﷺ. Simply put, if one attacks the Ṣaḥābah, as the Deobandīs do, then the attack is one upon the very foundation and acceptance of al-Islām.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Ḥanafīs and their stance on Mawqūf narrations of the Ṣaḥābah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The beginning of the ‘hoodwinking’ process.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafīs accuse us that we disrespect the Ṣaḥābah by not taking the mawqūf riwāyah over and above the marfūʿ riwāyah if it is in opposition to it. Then it should be noted that the Deobandīs hold a similar view in so far as only when it suits them. Some examples follow of the position that the Deobandīs present before the people which in essence may seem as them saying that they will not allow anyone, even a Ṣaḥābī to be followed if it is in opposition to the ḥadīth and actions of the Nabī ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Of course, the position they retort is pointless as in reality it is nothing short of a sinister plot but to attack the validity of the Ṣaḥābah, reject them, abuse them and do whatever it takes to safeguard the position of their Imām Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله  (d.150 Ah) regardless of the riwāyāt of the Ṣaḥābah or Rasūlullāh ﷺ himself. This is the actual reality and position of the Deobandī sect and the Ṣaḥābah as will follow.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">First, some examples of the ‘official’ doctrinal position espoused by the Deobandīs, which one may be fooled into thinking was written by Ahl al-Ḥadīth ʿulamāʾ rather than Deobandīs. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Sarfarāz Khān Ṣafdar Deobandī Ḥayātī (d. 1430 Ah)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He writes in his book, Rāh-e-Sunnat [رَاه سنت], page: 114, that: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;There is no doubt that the saying of a Ṣaḥābī specifically in this case, ʿAbd Allāh ibn Masūd </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>is accepted and has weight to it, but when we look atʿulūm al-Ḥadīth then there is a difference between that which is marfūʿ (elevated to the Nabī </em><em>ﷺ</em><em>) to that which is mawqūf this cannot be put aside. The station which is deserving of the narrations, which are marfūʿ, cannot be given to the riwāyāt which only reach the Ṣaḥābah and are mawqūf even though they are authentic.&#8221; </em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> Do the Deobandīs therefore advocate no taqlīd of the Ṣaḥābah in the presence of divine texts from the Rasūlullāh ﷺ? If so, do they also advocate no taqlīd of Imām Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله or other than him who are lesser in status than the Ṣaḥābah in the presence of the divine texts? If not, then why? Is Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله a greater mujtahid, faqīh or Imām than the Ṣaḥābah? Or, is Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله  greater in trustworthiness than the Ṣaḥābah? Or, is Abū Ḥanīfa&#8217;s رحمه الله  Ḍabṭ and ʿAdālah greater than the Ṣaḥābah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Seeing as the &#8216;authentic&#8217; mawqūf riwāyāt cannot reach the status of al-ḥadīth al-marfūʿ riwāyāt then what is the status of the sayings of Imām Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله  and the Ḥanafī Maḏhab which on the most part if not entirety are based upon no &#8216;authentic&#8217; asānīd (أسانيد)[mostly disconnected and weak asānīd] going back to Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله, spurious analogy and just opinions of men far lesser than any single Ṣaḥābī? Can one stick blindly to the Ḥanafī Maḏhab in the presence of the sayings of the Ṣaḥābah and Nabī ﷺ and what is the Islamic ruling upon this?</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This is mainly a saying of a Ṣaḥābī and therefore cannot be used as an evidence against the Ḥanafīyyah&#8221;.</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> As per the above comment section with the addition if the Maḏhab of a Ṣaḥābī is not binding upon anybody then how can the Maḏhab of Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله be binding upon anybody else?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He writes in his book, Dars -e- Tirmidhī, page: 169, volume: 2, concerning a riwāyah from Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه he would pray the Qūnut in the Fajr ṣalāh. Whilst commenting on this Taqī ʿUthmānī says the following: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This riwāyah is mawqūf and it is not a dalīl for us&#8221;. </em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Taqī ʿUthmānī also in Dars -e- Tirmidhī, page: 319, volume: 1, that the Ḥanafī&#8217;s have replied to this by saying: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This is not proven from the speech of Rasūlullāh </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> and that which is not proven from Rasūlullāh </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> then the saying or an action Ṣaḥābī is not sufficient to take&#8221;. </em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> simply put, the Deobandī claims the benchmark to follow in all affairs is Rasūlullāh ﷺ himself and not the Ṣaḥābī. How truthful he is in this assertion shall be seen below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also in another place Dars -e- Tirmidhī, page: 191, volume: 1 he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Therefore, the answer which should be given in this is, that this is the action and ijtihād of Ibn ʿUmar </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>and there is no marfuʿ ḥadīth related in this regards. Furthermore, the ijtihād of a Ṣaḥābī is not a ḥujjah especially when are other riwāyāt from the Ṣaḥābah are in opposition to it.&#8221;</em></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Whilst it is acknowledged that some of the Ṣaḥābah who agreed and performed one Witr and riwāyāt are found in this regards, however this was their own ijtihād.

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> why are the Deobandīs hypocritical enough to ferously attack the Ahl al-Ḥadīth who say that the saying of anyone, not even a Ṣaḥābī can be taken which is in opposition to the Nabī ﷺ? Do they apply the same ruling to Abū Ḥanīfa&#8217;s رحمه الله ijtihād as they do to the Ṣaḥābah? If so, then why not apply that not only to the ijtihādāt of Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله but to all his Maḏhab?</span></p>

However, the understanding of a Ṣaḥābī and a riwāyah that is mawqūf from a Ṣaḥābī is not a ḥujjah for us especially since it is in opposition to the Qurʾān, the authentic ḥadīth and the majority of the Ṣaḥābah&#8221;. </em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another place Sarfarāz Khān Ṣaftar, writes in his book, Khazāʾin al-Sunan [ُخَزَائِن السنن] a commentary of Jāmīʿ al-Tirmidhī, page: 64, volume: 3, that: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;No doubt ʿĀʾishah </em><em>رضي الله عنها </em><em>did not believe the dead had the ability to hear but we have read the Kalimah Shahādah of Rasūlullāh </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> and he has informed us that the dead can hear, so should we now follow the Nabī Muḥammad </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> or the Ṣaḥābī ʿĀʾishah?&#8221; </em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> do you apply the same to Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله and his Maḏhab or have you read his kalimah? Do you agree that if one were to take the saying of someone in opposition to the prophet then this tantamount to reading a kalimah of other than the Nabī ﷺ? What is the Islamic ruling for the one who does this action? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If only the ardent Ḥanafī-Deobandīs and Barelwīs could afford the same courtesy to the Ṣaḥābah رضوان الله عليهم أجمعين and Rasūlullāh ﷺ when it comes to leaving their Maḏhab, when it contradicts a authentic ḥadīth or a ḥadīth from the Ṣaḥābah, they continue to blindly follow their Maḏhab&#8221;. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="10">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Ashraf ʿAlī Thānwī (d.1362 Ah) his khalīfah, ʿAbd al-Mājid Darīabādī Deobandī (d.1397 Ah)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He writes in his book, Ḥakīm al-Ummat, page: 275, that: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Ṣaḥābah were not free from mistakes in their ijtihād even though it is accepted that the other pious scholars are less in station to the Ṣaḥābah.&#8221; </em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One can see clearly that the Ḥanafī-Deobandīs themselves and their forefathers have advocated that a saying of a Ṣaḥābī is to be left if it&#8217;s in opposition to a marfūʿ ḥadīth of Rasūlullāh ﷺ, yet when the Ahl al-Ḥadīth past and present have made this claim, they have tried to fool the people into saying that the Ahl al-Ḥadīth are against the Ṣaḥābah and the Ahl al-Ḥadīth are small or lesser Shīʿah&#8217;s by not following the Ṣaḥābah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet everybody knows that it is only the Ahl al-Ḥadīth who propagate the understanding of the Qurʾān and Sunnah by the way of the Ṣaḥābah as understood by the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥīn of this ummah who make taqlīd of nobody, whereas the Deobandīs and Barelwīs have clearly stuck to the sayings of their Imāms in opposition not only to the Ṣaḥābah but the aḥādīth of Rasūlullāh ﷺ. </span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">by</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq al-Athari</span></strong></h3>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> __________________________________________________</h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This Article discusses</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The idea of compiling hanafi books of Hadith to support the Madhab</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Did Mawlana Anwar Shah co-author <em>Athar al-sunan</em> &amp; Shaikh Abdur Rashid Rebuttal of this Claim</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The oppression of Mawlana Zafar against Mawlana Sanbhali for opposing the hanafi Madhab</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Mawlana Ashraf Ali Thanwi on the bigoted stauch fanatical muqallidin</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaykh Mahmud Hasan on Mawlana Ashraf Thanwi and his incompetence </strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The View of Scholars regarding <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan</em></strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">__________________________________________________</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Jawameh, Masanid, Sunan and Ajza and others are from amongst the treasures of Hadith for the Muslim Ummah collectively,  as well as having fundamental roles in that all of the scholars have adhered to them in every era. They have benefited from them with regards to their understanding and comprehension. However It is also a known fact that some of our hanafi scholars have been overwhelmed with the constant reminder and thought that such books contain less narration in support of their madhab. Thus, they attempted to compile and collate ahadith in support of their madhab in order to alleviate this problem to such an extent that they wrote books such as <em><strong>Sahih Bihari</strong></em> instead of Sahih Bukhari and <em><strong>Hanafi Bulugh al-Maram</strong></em> instead if Bulugh al-Maram.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the Indian subcontinent the first person was most probably Maulana Shaikh Abdul Haq Muhaddith Dehlavi who authored <em>Fath al-manan fi ta&#8217;id madhab an-nu&#8217;man</em> based on the methodology of <em>Mishkat</em> of Chapters of Fiqh under which he collated ahadith. Wherein he criticised the opinion and positions of the other jurists and gave precedence to the opinion of Imam Abu Hanifah with great fervour and effort.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad bin Ali Zahir Ahsan &#8216;Shawq&#8217; Nimawi A&#8217;zimabadi also attempted to fulfil this vacuole and thus authored <em>Athar as-sunan</em> and explanatory notes to it titled as <em>at-Ta&#8217;liq al-hasan,</em> which he mentioned himself in his book <em>Radd al-sakin</em> which was printed in 1312H from Qaumi Press in Lucknow. It contained an advertisement and an announcement as follows, in great fervour and effort.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;<em>It is known that Mishkat and Bulugh al-Maram are first taught in the subject of Hadith and their respective authors belonged to the Shafi&#8217;i madhab. Most of the Hadith they contain are in support of the Shafi&#8217;i madhab and contradict the hanafi madhab. This leads to the teachers becoming ghayr muqallid and most of the students become very disheartened with the hanafi madhab after reading these books of Hadith. When the time comes for the six books of Hadith their minds become even more changed. The hanafi scholars have not authored any such book as a teaching primer which contains ahadith from the various books of Hadith which support the hanafi madhab, so these poor student have nothing to study as a primer (from the perspective of the hanafi madhab) and thus why should their beliefs remain as they are and why should they not become Ghayr muqallid under the current circumstances. These are some of the reason and thoughts why this poor servant authored a book of Hadith called Athar as-Sunan. The intent is to collate and compile the ahadith from the well established books of Hadith as well as from rare books in the Arab and non Arab world and then cite their respective chains in the marginal footnotes.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Trans Note: Shaykh Abdur Rashid Fawqani, the son of Shaykh Nimawi has also cited the statement above in his <em>al-Qawl al-hasan</em> (p.14)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Nimawi has cited such adverts in some of his other works with regards to <em>Athar as-sunan</em>. He completed it up to the book of prayer in 1313H. [Trans Note: Shaikh Abdur Rashid Fawqani in his <em>al-Qawl al-hasan</em> has referenced most places and books where Shaykh Nimawi talks about his <em>Athar al-sunan, </em>End of Trans Note]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Trans Note: Shaykh Abd al-Fattah Abu Guddah has confirmed this reason as well as mentioning some other divergent points, he obviously defends the view of the hanafi madhab being hadith and report orientated but the reality is far from this, as it will come clear from the writings, He, Shaykh Abd al-Fattah Abu Guddah says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The reason for compiling this immense beneficial book is what occurred in the course of this century when a group of people in some cities of India arose, before the partition of Pakistan, calling themselves “Ahl al-Hadith,” claiming that the school of the Hanafi masters, which is the school of the majority of Muslims in those large and expansive lands, conflicts with the Prophetic hadiths in many issues, just as they claimed also that the Hanafi masters prefer analogy over the noble hadith, and just as they denied also taqlid of the four Imams (Allah be pleased with them) that are followed, and they lengthened their tongues with respect to Hanafi jurisprudence and more specifically with respect to the jurist of this nation Imam Abu Hanifah.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Outstanding scholars from those Indian lands arose to challenge these deviant beliefs and they falsified these claims through many well-researched hadith-related works. They explained in these (works) the reliance of the Hanafi masters in their jurisprudence and their school on the noble hadiths, and that they prefer the noble hadith and even weak hadith over analogy, and that analogy with its conditions is from the proofs which must be acted upon, and in drawing evidence from the Sunnah and relying upon it, the Hanafis are not less than other than them from the Imams, if not stronger than other than them in relying on hadith and narration.&#8221;</em> Translation taken from (Link Below) from I&#8217;la al-sunan 1:4) End of Trans Note]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq continued and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It must be duly noted that Mawlana Muhammad Anwar Shah Kashmiri wrote in <em>Nayl al-farqadayn</em> that he helped and co-authored <em>Athar as-sunan</em>. Allamah Nimawi&#8217;s son, Mawlana Abdur Rashid Fawqani wrote with regards to what Allamah Anwar Shah Kashmiri wrote in <em>Nayl al-farqadayn</em> that he co-authored the book with him when he said, <em>&#8220;I assisted/aided (him to write it) with him.&#8221;</em>  In that, while Allamah Nimawi was writing <em>Athar as-Sunan</em>, he would send part by part to me and thus in this regard I was the co-author.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Trans Note: One can see the words of Shaykh Anwar Shah Kashmiri from the scan below from the <em>Nayl al-farqadayn</em> (p.56)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Nayl al-farqadayn</em> (p.56)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The claim of Mawlana Anwar Shah co-authoring <em>Athar al-sunan</em> has been reproduced by the Deobandi&#8217;s and affirmed by Shaykh Abd al-Fattah Abu Guddah by him reproducing the words of Shaykh Binnouri in his <em>Tarajim sittah min fuqaha al-alam al-islami, he says</em></span></p>
<div style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Mawlana Muhammad Zahir Ahsan al-Nimawi (d. 1322/1904), Allah have mercy on him, the famous hadith-scholar, author of Athar al-Sunan, would seek assistance from Shaykh (Anwar Shah al-Kashmiri) with regards to the ambiguities of hadith, by correspondence through letter-writing. He would seek help from him while writing his book Athar al-Sunan and he would present to him what he had written piece by piece. This is what I heard from the revered Shaykh (himself), Allah have mercy on him. He said in his book Nayl al-Firqadayn: “The deceased Shaykh (al-Nimawi) while writing that book would send it to me piece by piece, until I became an aide therein; and I added many things to it after him.” The Shaykh, Allah have mercy on him, at that time was a youth whose reputation was not (yet) manifest to the people while the hadith-scholar al-Nimawi was an experienced scholar, and in spite of this, this was his (manner of) interacting (with ‘Allamah Kashmiri), and this shows his intellectual humbleness and his estimation of men. Allah raise both their statuses. (Tarajim Sittah min Fuqaha al-‘Alam al-Islami, p. 29)</em></span></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Taken from the translation of Muzammil Husayn from <span style="color: #000080;"><strong><a style="color: #000080;" href="https://friendsofdeoband.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/taqriz-of-ila-al-sunan-by-shaykh-abd-al-fattah/">HERE</a></strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmad has also reproduced this on this website See <span style="color: #000080;"><strong><a style="color: #000080;" href="http://www.darultahqiq.com/al-qawl-al-hasan-defence-atharus-sunan-shaykh-al-nimawi-2/">HERE</a></strong></span> and presents the same assertion as claimed by Shaykh Abd al-Fattah Abu Guddah, Mawlana Binnouri and Shaikh Anwar Shah himself in his <em>Nayl al-farqadayn</em>, all of which have been cited above. The irony and the sad state of affairs is that on the very same page (link above) Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmad talks about the <em>Qawl al-hasan</em> and this alleged triumph, he perhaps actually forgot to look at the contents of <em>al-Qawl al-hasan</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">http://www.darultahqiq.com/al-qawl-al-hasan-defence-atharus-sunan-shaykh-al-nimawi-2/</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmad shares a digitised edition  (link above) of  Shaykh Abdur Rashid Fawqani&#8217;s <em>al-Qawl al-hasan</em> in which he answers, clarifies and rebuts the claim of Shaykh Anwar Shah Kashmiri regarding his assistance in co-authoring <em>Athar al-sunan</em>, Shaikh Abdur Rashid also cites reasons and gives examples as to why this is an incorrect notion. It is embarrassing to reproduce assertions and then the very same book you share rebuts and refutes the very same claims you present! I am sharing two scans here which show the refutation and rebuttal of the claim of Mawlana Answar Shah Kashmiri, while the avid reader can refer to the link above to download the complete book</span></p>

<em><span style="color: #ff0000;"> al-Qawl al-hasan (p.23)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">End of Trans Note]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq continues,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdur Rashid Fawqani said this is incorrect because when the book was written i.e. the period it was written in, Allamah Kashmiri was still a student as he graduated in 1312H from seeking knowledge of the various sciences. It is however possible that some parts of <em>Athar as-sunan</em> may have been sent to Allamah Kashmiri after it was completed, where he offered his advice and suggestions. (al-Qawl al-hasan p.19.24)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also interesting to note here, that one of the foremost students of Allamah Kashmiri, Mawlana Muhammad Anwari of La&#8217;ilpur expressed his sorrowful anger at the clarification of this reality by Mawlana Abdur Rashid and wrote in one of his letters, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;You did not even control yourself from expressing derogatory remarks about your illustrious venerated father in his praise and nor did you reflect upon &#8216;do not speak ill of the dead except with their goodness.&#8217; You advocated and took full charge against Shah Kashmiri which will not result in anything except pleasing the opponents.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This letter is 2 pages which Mawlana Abdur Rashid answered it in 6 pages, in which he further clarified his stance and position with more clarifications and evidences, that during the time <em>Athar as-sunan</em> was authored, Allamah Kashmiri was a student. However when he (Anwar Shah) was appointed as a teacher in Delhi, he (Mawlana Nimawi) might have sent his research to him after 1313H and sought his opinion in draft form. We found this letter and the response to the earlier letter which Mawlana Abdur Rashid penned himself in an edition of <em>al-Qawl al-hasan</em>. We thought it was appropriate to correct and clear the misunderstanding that was suggested in the passage of <em>Nayl al-farqadayn</em> and hence the reason to mention this here.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was also for this reason (i.e. a book of hadith supporting the hanafi madhab) that Mawlana Ashraf Ali Thanvi authored <em>&#8216;Ihya as-sunan&#8217;</em> but it&#8217;s manuscript was wasted/lost before it even went to print. It is most probable that Mawlana Thanvi realised the need for such a book due to <em>Athar as-sunan</em>. It is mentioned in the letter of Mawlana Abdur Rashid Fawqani which we cited earlier, that he said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Mawlana Muhammad Sahul of Bhagalpur who was the Principle of Madrassah Shams al-Huda in Patna, Aziamabad, mentioned to directly to me, &#8220;We were sitting in a gathering of Shaikh ul-Hindh Mawlana Mahmud Hasan in Deoband when someone said that Mawlana Ashraf Ali Thanvi is writing a book in the same way that Athar as-Sunan was written. When Shaikh ul-Hindh heard this he said &#8220;Mawlana Ashraf Ali is also my student but he cannot write (a book) like Athar as-Sunan.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this was the opinion and thought of the respected teacher about his foremost student and thus we are not in a position to add anything further to this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After a period of time when Mawlana Thanvi thought about this idea again, he authored <em>&#8216;Jam&#8217;e al-athar&#8217;</em> which was a compilation of narrations supporting his Hanafi Madhab, however this could not progress beyond the chapters of Salah and so only this was published. Thereafter he authored <em>&#8216;Tab&#8217;e al-athar&#8217;</em> which was essentially explanatory notes to his <em>&#8216;Jam&#8217;e al-athar,&#8217;</em> in which he attempted to reconcile and clarify mutually contradictory ahadith according to his capability, both books were published in approximately 1315H from Matba&#8217;a Qasimi in Deoband.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then in approximately 1331H he realised both books were very small and brief and were only up to the discussion of the Chapter of Salah, thus the need to have a book on the compilation of Ahadith in Fiqh in support of the hanafi madhab on all of the various differences and discussions. He thought such a book should be precise, concise, explanatory and comprehensive with regards to the narrations and their understanding contained therein. He also thought he would not be able to complete such a task alone by himself and thus passed this mammoth task on to Mawlana Ahmad Hasan Sanbhali.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As Mawlana Ahmad Hasan progressed with this task, Mawlana Thanvi would also progressively review and revise the work and if he felt the need to change anything he corrected it. So this method continued up to the book of Hajj and the book was called <em>&#8216;Ihya as-sunan.&#8217;</em> Later, when Mawlana Sanbhali reviewed and revised the book he altered a lot of things to the extent that he even changed the corrections of Mawlana Thanvi so much so that the original and initial criteria and methodology of writing the book changed. (Ie compiling hadith supporting the hanafi madhab and reconciling the hadith with the madhab) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the first volume was printed Mawlana Thanvi stopped any further publishing of the book due to the numerous gross errors and mistakes because the original guideline and methodological reason the book was being authored were not upheld. So he then passed the task on to Mawlana Zafar Ahmad Uthmani Thanvi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first thing Mawlana Zafar Ahmad Uthmani Thanvi did was to write and publish a clarifying supplement on the first volume published by Mawlana Sanbhali and his gross errors which was called, <em>&#8216;al-Istadrak al-hasan a&#8217;la ihya as-sunan.&#8217; </em>Thereafter, Mawlana Uthmani took on the task from the beginning until the end when he finally completed the book, which was published by Idarah al-Quran al-Ulum al-Islamiyyah Karachi with the name of <em>I&#8217;la as-Sunan</em> in 16 volumes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It must be noted sometimes when Mawlana Uthmani says in <em>I&#8217;la al-Sunan</em> <em>&#8220;Some people say (Qala Ba&#8217;dun Nas)&#8221;</em> he mentions the position of Mawlana Ahmad Hasan Sanbhali from <em>&#8216;Ihya as-Sunan&#8217;</em> and refutes it with great vigour and rancour. In fact in the introduction of the second edition of <em>&#8216;Ihya as-Sunan&#8217;</em> Mawlana Thanvi writes about the methodology and position of Mawlana Sanbhali that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;To the extent that he altered the book from its initial methodology and changed its original purpose and intent.&#8221;</em> (Muqaddimah I&#8217;la al-sunan pg.25)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning, the original manhaj or methodology of the book was the defence of the hanafi madhab but Mawlana Sanbhali continued to support and conform to the position of the muhadithin (ie scholars of hadith) and changed the original and main purpose of the book. It is such audacities of Mawlana Sanbhali that Mawlana Uthmani had to write in one instance, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;May Allah destroy him&#8221;</em> (I&#8217;la al-sunan 7:94)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Sanbhali said concerning the report <em>&#8220;There is no Jumu&#8217;ah or tashriq except in urban cities/towns&#8221; (TN transmitted in Musannaf Ibn Shaybah, Nasb al-Rayah, Fath al-Bari) that</em> Abu Ishaq Sabi&#8217;i narrated it and he became forgetful, to which Mawlana Uthmani replied, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Oh to wonder what a waste of literacy, did you weaken the Hadith just because of Abi Ishaq al-Sabi&#8217;i?&#8221;</em> (I&#8217;la al-sunan 1:1)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather he writes in the introduction to <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan,</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When I say &#8216;some people said in their &#8216;Ihya&#8217; or If I only say &#8216;some people say&#8217; then I intend by this the author of &#8216;Ihya al-sunan&#8217; ie Al-Sanbhali, in this book of his he has brought some intricate allegations on the hanafi&#8217;s and some of the salaf based on hatred, enmity, ignorance and gross errors and thus I have answered them.&#8221;</em> (Qawaid ulum al-hadith p.472)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning that Sanbhali rebelled against the hanafi madhab and thus Uthmani, had to quite frankly answer him in a hostile way. Such instances will be highlighted as we move through this treatise, inshaAllah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Zahid Kawthari writes about &#8216;<em>I&#8217;la al-sunan,&#8217;</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I tremble at (the phenomenon) of this compilation and the organisation (of this book)&#8221;</em> (In the commendation of I&#8217;la al-sunan p.5).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Trans Note: This is what Shaykh Abd al-Fattah al-Guddah cites from Zahid al-Kawthari in his muqaddimah to the <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To such an extent that Mawlana Ashraf Ali Thanwi said this is such a great achievement that has come from the saintly Imdadiyyah Thana Bhavan and one cannot find any other examples like it from other institutes in India. This achievement is the collation and compilation of ahadith which support and conform to the madhab of Imam Azam Abu Hanifah. (Introduction to Qawaid ulum al-hadith p.11)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said that if only &#8216;<em>I&#8217;la al-sunan&#8217;</em> had been compiled and produced from the Saintly Imdadiyyah Thana Bhavan, then this alone was sufficient for its virtue and to karamah (ie miracle) (introduction to Qawaid ulum al-hadith p.12).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have scrutinised this book in the following pages and have concentrated on the principles and rules used by Mawlana Uthmani to authenticate and weaken ahadith. We will look at how the Mawlana uses these principles and also the times he remains silent on narrations from &#8216;<em>Kunz al-a&#8217;mal&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;Jama al-fawaid&#8217;</em>. How he grades narrations in <em>Musnad Imam Ahmad</em> as acceptable when the narrators have been declared to be weak and abandoned by most of the scholars of praise and criticism. How at times he renders a narrator to be contentious on account of the words of a single scholar of Hadith and how such a narrators Hadith is hasan. How at times it is said, tadlis and Irsal of narrators of the first three generations are unproblematic and harmful according to the hanafi&#8217;s and then when their narrations oppose the hanafi madhab, their tadlis becomes problematic and renders their report to be weak! To the extent that if narrations of outright liars and fabricators supports the view of the hanafi madhab, there is an overwhelming level of defence of them and the benefits of why the narrations have been cited!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They have adopted such means and measures of making tawil of the authentic ahadith that it makes one remember the letter Mawlana Thanwi wrote to Mawlana Gangohi wherein he said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Most of the common Muqallidin are so bigoted and staunch that if they come across an Ayah or Hadith contrary to the view of their Mujtahid it does not settle in their hearts and rather they develop feeling of rejecting it in their hearts. Then they turn to tawil, however far fetched it may seem even if the other evidences are far stronger and even if the evidence of the Mujtahid in this issue is not beyond the realms of Qiyas. These people will not necessarily have the urge in their hearts to make tawil but in order to champion and promote the superiority of their madhab, they believe making tawil is obligatory and they cannot accept from their hearts to reject the statement of the Mujtahid for the authentic clear Hadith.&#8221;</em> (Tazkirrah al-rashid 1:131)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All the way from Imam Razi to Shaykh Shah Ismail Shahid (InShaAllah), all the scholars have taken the Muqallidin to task and shared their experiences and thoughts about them, which we will gloss over due to its extent. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You will see InshaAllah, in making tawil of authentic Hadith even the companions were not spared. The narrations Umm Sharik Ansariyyah RadiAllahu Anha, the famous female companion were totally abandoned and rejected by declaring her to be unknown! The narrations of Ai&#8217;shah RadiAllahu Anha were overlooked by declaring her to be woman folk! The Hadith of Abdullah ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhuma and Ibn Zubair RadiAllahu Anhu were sidelined by saying they were younger companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the details concerning this are to follow InShaAllah at their respective place. Other people of knowledge have shared their views and thoughts about such oversight dismissive injustice in <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan</em>. Hence the learned author of &#8216;<em>Ruwat al-hadith allazina sakatu alayhim, aimah al-jarh wat tadil bayna al-tawthiq wal tajhil&#8217;</em> Shaykh Adab Mahmud Al-Hamsh said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This book (ie I&#8217;la al-sunan) has been printed in 21 volumes with 3 introductions and it has with it severe errors and shameless accusations&#8221;</em> (See the footnote of Ruwat al-hadith p.27)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise the Muhaddith of Madinah, Shaykh Hamad al-Ansari said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;As for the book (I&#8217;la al-sunan) it is riddled with fabricated narrations and the evidences used are overwhelmed with narrations which are weak and fabricated.&#8221;</em> (Al-majmua fi tarjamah al-allamah al-muhaddith al-ansari 2:726)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This highlights the reality of this book. One must also remember most of the principles and rules applied in <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan</em> are found in its introduction which has been printed separately and it&#8217;s known as <em>Inha al-sakan</em>, which was later republished with the verification of Shaykh Abu Guddah as <em>Qawaid ulum al-hadith</em>. Shaikh al-Arab wal-Ajam Sayyid Badi al-Din al-Rashidi wrote an academic answer and scrutinised this book which is called<em> Innama Al-Zakan</em>, which was later researched and revised by Shaykh Salah al-Din Maqbul as <em>Naqd qawaid ulum al-hadith</em>. Shaykh Salah al-Din Maqbul quite rightly said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is Qawaid and principles of the hanafi principles but to call it Qawaid ulum al-hadith is somewhat far fetched, it should not be called Qawaid ulum al-hadith but rather it should be called Mahazil (a depravity on) ulum al-hadith.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My Shaikh and Ustadh al-Hafiz al-Muhaddith Muhammad Ghondalwi also refuted and highlighted the mistakes in <em>Inha al-sakan</em> in its marginalia and this edition was with Shaikh Fathi Makki. I had also copied the whole of <em>Innama al-zakan</em> to benefit from it along with the intention of publishing it just like I published (Shaykh Badi al-Din) <em>Jala al-Aynayn</em> (<em>bi takhrij riwayat al-bukhari juz raf al-yadain</em>) however Shaykh Salah al-Din Maqbul preceded me in this noble task. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this critique we have also benefited from <em>Naqḍ Qawaid fi ulum al-hadith</em> and our subject is the methodology used and the application of the hanafi principles and rules in dealing with Hadith and narrators. This critique is based on the first 8 volumes of of <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan</em> and if Allah gives us guidance and blessings we shall analyse the remaining volumes. With the will of Allah most of the principles and rules used by Mawlana Uthmani in <em>I&#8217;la al-sunan</em> have been generically mentioned in this book which highlight and elucidate his methodology and therefore one can surmise from this the affair of the rest of the book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>(I&#8217;la al-sunan fil mizan &#8211; a critical analysis of the well known book on hanafi methodology, p.25-34)</em></span></p>
