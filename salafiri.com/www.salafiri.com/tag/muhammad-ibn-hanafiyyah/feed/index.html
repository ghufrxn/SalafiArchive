				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Defence of Yazid ibn Mu’awiyyah</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Rahimahullah)</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Series Part 17 / Part 3</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">By</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Series Compilers, Translated and Annotated</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Katheer said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“</em><em>The people from all of the lands pledged their allegiance<span id="more-275"></span> (to Yazeed)”</em> (al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 8/79)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abdullaah Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Three years after the tragedy of Karbala when the people of Madina began to revolt with Abdullaah Ibn Zubair the Shaikh of the companions Abdullaah Ibn Umar severely censured this and openly announced his dissatisfaction and complete dissociation from such people</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Narrated by Nafi’ When the people of Medina dethroned Yazid bin Muawiya, Ibn ‘Umar gathered his special friends and children and said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I heard the Prophet saying, ‘A flag will be fixed for every betrayer on the Day of Resurrection,’and we have given the oath of allegiance to this person (Yazid) in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Allah and His Apostle and I do not know of anything more faithless than fighting a person who has been given the oath of allegiance in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Allah and His Apostle , and if ever I learn that any person among you has agreed to dethrone Yazid, by giving the oath of allegiance (to somebody else) then there will be separation between him and me.”</em> (Saheeh al-Bukhaari  Volume 9, Book 88, Number 227)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has been reported on the authority of Nafi, that ‘Abdullah b. Umar </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>paid a visit to Abdullah b. Muti’ in the days (when atrocities were perpetrated on the People Of Medina) at Harra in the time of Yazid b. Mu’awiya. Ibn Muti’ said: Place a pillow for Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman (family name of ‘Abdullah bin Umar But the latter said: I have not come to sit with you. I have come to you to tell you a tradition I heard from the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam). I heard him say: One who withdraws his band from obedience (to the Amir) will find no argument (in his defence) when he stands before Allaah on the Day of Judgment, and one who dies without having bound himself by an oath of allegiance (to an Amir) will die the death of one belonging to the days of Jahillyya.</em> (Saheeh Muslim No. 4562)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find from these nariations from the Bukhaari and muslim clearly that Ameer Yazeed was the legitimate and agreed upon caliph.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abdullaah Ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">When he found out about the death of Mu’awiyyah he continued to supplicate for him for a long time and began to mention his virtues and then said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“for verily his son Yazeed is from amongst the righteous from his household you people should stay there and pledge your allegiance later he went himself and pledged his allegiance.”</em>(Balazaaeee 4/4, al-Imaamah was-Siyaasah 1/202)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah bin Abee Taalib (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Yes the son of Alee bin Abee Taalib and the brother of Hassan and Hussain (Radhiallaahu Anhuma), when the people around him continued to feed him lies and deceits about Ameer Yazeed with the intent of getting him to revolt but when he refused to do so the people around him started to attribute alcohol drinking, abandoning the prayer and carelessness towards the religion to Yazeed. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah answered them by saying </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I did not find the things in himself which you have attributed to him, I have been to him myself and stayed with him and I found that he always prayed and seeking the truth in matters of fiqh and strongly adhering to the Sunnah”</em> (al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 8/233, al-Muntaqa 1/281)L</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah went a step further and began to debate and argue with the people who attributed such heinous claims about Ameer Yazeed, hence Haafidh Ibn katheer mentions, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah was asked to abandon his pledge of allegiance which he had given to Yazeed, he strongly rejected it and in support of Ameer Yazeed he argued and debated with them and refuted their allegations of drinking alcohol and his abandoning of the prayer.”</em> (al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 8/218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Imam Ahmad</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Qadhee Abu Bakr Ibn Arabee said Imaam Ahmad has mentioned Ameer Yazeed in Kitaab az-Zuhd after the companions but before the taabieens which shows he was free from these allegations he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“this is an evidence that he ie yawed had a great status according to Imaam Ahmad as he included him in his list of pious companions and taabieen and they are from those whose statements are followed and from whose admonitions one seeks guidance and he has mentioned him with them. So what basis do the allegations of him drinking alcohol and openly sinning have in comparison to his status which the historians have mentioned, do these people not have any shame.”</em> (al-Awaasim Minal Qawaasim 1/233)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Umar bin Abdul Azeez</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Hajr mentions that Ibn Shauzab said I heard Ibraaheem bin Abee Abd say I heard Umar bin Abdul Azeez say rahimahullah upon Yazeed Ibn Mu’awiyyah (Leesaan ul-Meezaan)</span></p>
