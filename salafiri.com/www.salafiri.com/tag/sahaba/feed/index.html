<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from ‘Fadail As-Sahabah Sahih Riwayat Ki Roshni Mein&#8217; (p.36-39)<br />
Tahqiq and Takhrij by Shaykh Zubair &#8216;Aliza&#8217;i</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna &#8216;Amr bin Al-&#8216;As (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that, <strong>&#8220;I asked the Prophet ﷺ, &#8216;Who is the most beloved person to you?&#8217; He ﷺ replied, &#8216;A&#8217;isha.&#8217; So I said, &#8216;And from the men?&#8217; He ﷺ replied, &#8216;Her father (Abu Bakr).&#8217; So I said, &#8216;And then?&#8217; And he ﷺ replied, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.'&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3662, Sahih Muslim #2384)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Muhammad bin &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib, famously known as Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah (may Allah have mercy upon him), narrated that, <strong>&#8220;I asked my father (Ali bin Abi Talib), &#8216;Which of the people, after the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, are the best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I said, &#8216;Then who?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Umar.'&#8221;¹</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3671)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Sayyiduna Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) has been mentioned in the Glorious Qur&#8217;an, Allah (Exalted is He) says,</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">إِلَّا تَنْصُرُوهُ فَقَدْ نَصَرَهُ اللَّهُ إِذْ أَخْرَجَهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ثَانِيَ اثْنَيْنِ إِذْ هُمَا فِي الْغَارِ إِذْ يَقُولُ لِصَاحِبِهِ لَا تَحْزَنْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَنَا ۖ</h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center">&#8220;And if you do not help him (the Prophet ﷺ) , then surely Allah has helped him when those that disbelieved drove him out, as the second of the two; when they were in the cave, he (the Prophet ﷺ) said to his companion (Abu Bakr): Do not grieve, verily Allah is with us.&#8221; <em>(Surah At-Tawbah, Ayah #60)</em></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;The person that has favoured me the most with his companionship and his wealth is Abu Bakr, and if I were to take anyone other than my Rabb as a Khalil, then I would have taken Abu Bakr as my Khalil &#8211; but the Islamic Brotherhood is superior. Close all the small doors to the Masjid [An-Nabawi] except the door of Abu Bakr.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3654, Sahih Muslim #2382)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that, <strong>&#8220;The Prophet ﷺ asked the Companions: &#8216;Is anyone amongst you fasting today?&#8217; Abu Bakr replied, &#8216;I am.&#8217; He ﷺ said, &#8216;Has anyone amongst you followed a funeral precession today?&#8217; Abu Bakr replied, &#8216;I have.&#8217; He ﷺ said, &#8216;Has anyone amongst you fed the poor today?&#8217; Abu Bakr replied, &#8216;I have.&#8217; He ﷺ said, &#8216;Has anyone amongst you visited the ill today?&#8217; Abu Bakr replied, &#8216;I have.&#8217; The Prophet ﷺ then said, &#8216;[These deeds] are not combined in a man except that he will enter Paradise.'&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #1028, #2387)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>&#8220;I was with the Prophet ﷺ in a garden from the gardens of Madinah &#8211; a man came and asked for permission to enter, so the Prophet ﷺ said, &#8216;Open [the gate] for him, and give him glad tidings of Paradise.&#8217; So I opened the gate, and it was Abu Bakr.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3693, Sahih Muslim #2403)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And it has reached us in one famous Hadith that the Prophet ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Abu Bakr is in Paradise.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3747 and its chain is Sahih, and Ibn Hibban authenticated it in Al-Ihsan #6963)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is narrated from Sayyiduna Anas bin Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that, <strong>&#8220;On one occasion, the Prophet ﷺ, Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar and &#8216;Uthman ascended Mount Uhud, and it shook due to their presence, so the Prophet ﷺ struck it with his foot, and said: &#8216;Be firm O Uhud! Verily there is noone upon you except a Prophet, a Siddiq (truthful one) and Two Martyrs!'&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3686)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Umar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>&#8220;Were the Iman (faith) of Abu Bakr to be weighed against the Iman of the People of the Earth, his would have outweighed theirs.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Kitab Al-Sunnah of &#8216;Abdullah bin Ahmad #821 and its chain is Hasan, Shu&#8217;ab Al-Iman of Al-Bayhaqi #36, Aqidatus Salaf wa Ashabul Hadith of Al-Sabuni #110, and Fadhail Abi Bakr of Khaythama Al-Atrabulsi #133)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The virtues of Sayyiduna Abu Bakr As-Siddiq are so numerous that a summarised article will not be able to contain all of their details &#8211; <strong>the Imam of Ahlus Sunnah, Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal (may Allah have mercy upon him) was asked about a person that curses Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and &#8216;A&#8217;isha, so he said, &#8221; &#8220;I do not see him to be upon Islam.&#8221;² </strong><em>(As-Sunnah of Al-Khallal #779 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal said, <strong>&#8220;I asked my father (Imam Ahmad) about a man that reviles a man from the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ, so he said, &#8216;I do not see him to be upon Islam.'&#8221;</strong> <em>(As-Sunnah of Al-Khallal #782 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Faqih (Jurist), Abid (Worshipper), Tabi&#8217;i, Imam Masruq bin Al-Ajda&#8217; (may Allah have mercy upon him) said, <strong>&#8220;Love for Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and knowledge of their virtues is from the Sunnah.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Kitab Al-&#8216;Ilal wa Ma&#8217;rifatul Rijal #945 and its chain is Hasan, Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jama&#8217;at of Al-Lalaka&#8217;i #2322)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu Ja&#8217;far Muhammad bin &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husayn Al-Baqir (may Allah have mercy upon him) said, <strong>&#8220;Whoever is ignorant of the virtues of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, then he is surely ignorant of the Sunnah.&#8221; </strong><em>(Kitab Ash-Shari&#8217;ah of Al-Ajurri #1803 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Ja&#8217;far bin Muhammad As-Sadiq³ (may Allah have mercy upon him) said, <strong>&#8220;Allah is free from those that disassociated from Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar.&#8221;⁴</strong> <em>(Fadhail Al-Sahaba of Imam Ahmad #143 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu Ja&#8217;far Muhammad bin &#8216;Ali Al-Baqir⁵ (may Allah have mercy upon him) once said while ill, <strong>&#8220;Oh Allah! Verily I take Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar as allies and I love them both, and if there is anything other than this within myself then do not grant me the intercession of Muhammad ﷺ on the Day of Resurrection!&#8221;</strong> <em>(Tarikh Dimashq of Ibn Asakir 57/223 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu Ishaq As-Sabi&#8217;i (may Allah have mercy upon him) said, <strong>&#8220;Hatred of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar is from the Kaba&#8217;ir (Major Sins).&#8221;</strong> <em>(Fadhail Al-Sahaba of Abdullah bin Ahmad #385 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Oh Allah! Fill our hearts with love for Abu Bakr and all of the Noble Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them), and increase us in this love &#8211; Amin!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> This statement of Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali is mutawatir (mass-transmitted) from him &#8211;  Shaykh Al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah said, <strong>&#8220;And it has been mass-transmitted from him (ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib) that he used to say on the pulpit of Kūfa: &#8216;The best of this Ummah after its Prophet is Abū Bakr and ʿUmar.&#8217; This was narrated from him from more than 80 ways (chains of narration).&#8221;</strong> <em>(Minhaj Al-Sunnah An-Nabawiyyah 1/308) </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:]</strong> The Righteous Salaf were severe on this matter &#8211; <strong>A man asked Al-Faryābī about someone that curses Abu Bakr, he said, &#8220;Kāfir.&#8221; He then asked, &#8220;So do we pray over him (the Janāzah)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;How do we do such a thing while he says, &#8216;La ilaaha illAllah&#8217;?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Do not touch him with your hands, push him with a piece of wood until he&#8217;s buried in his pit.&#8221;</strong> (<em>Al-Ibanah As-Sughra of Ibn Battah #196)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">³ <strong>[TN:]</strong> He is Abu &#8216;Abdillah Ja&#8217;far As-Sadiq bin Muhammad Al-Baqir bin &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husayn bin &#8216;Abi bin Abi Talib, his mother was Umm Farwah bint Al-Qasim bin Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, and her mother was Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr, so he was a descendant of Abu Bakr, and due to this he would say, <strong>&#8220;Abu Bakr gave birth to me twice.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Siyar A&#8217;lam An-Nubala</em> <em>6/255)</em> He was an Imam of the Salaf, and the Rafidha took him as the Sixth Imam, and attributed thousands of lies to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">⁴ <strong>[TN:]</strong> Tabarri (or Bara&#8217;a) is a core doctrine of the Shi&#8217;a, which entails disavowal and disassociation from the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ. Muhammad Baqir Al-Majlisi summarised these beliefs as follows: &#8220;Our belief is that absolution is necessary from four idols: Yaghut, Yauq, Nasr and Hubal [Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Mu&#8217;awiyah], and the four female idols: Laat, Uzza, Manat and Shira [&#8216;A&#8217;isha, Hafsa, Hind and Umm Hakam], [&#8230;] Verily these are the worst of Allah&#8217;s creatures.&#8221; <em>(Haqqul Yaqeeen, Published by Jafari Propagation Centre 2012)</em>, and we seek refuge in Allah from such vile beliefs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">⁵ <strong>[TN:]</strong> He is the Sayyid, Al-Imam, Abu Ja&#8217;far Muhammad bin &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husayn bin &#8216;Ali, Al-&#8216;Alawi Al-Fatimi Al-Madini, son of Zayn Al-&#8216;Abidin, and was known by Al-Baqir &#8211; the one that split knowledge <em>(Siyar A&#8217;lam An-Nubala 4/402)</em>. He was an Imam, and a Mujtahid, but the Rafidha took him as the Fifth Imam, and lied upon him greatly.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><em>Taken from ‘Faḍā’il-e-Ṣaḥāba Ṣaḥīḥ Aḥadīth Ki Roshnī Mein’ (p.125-130)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Noble Prophet ﷺ said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“Paradise is obligatory (i.e. guaranteed) for the first army from my Ummah that undertakes Jihād on the Ocean.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 2924)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This Jihād occurred during the time of the Khilāfat of Sayyidunā Muʿāwiya bin Abī Sufyān (<em>Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 6282, 6283)</em>, and Sayyidunā Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān participated in that Jihād <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 2799, 2800).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Sayyidunā ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said: I was playing with the children when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ arrived, I had thought that he arrived for me so I hid behind the door, so he pat me on the back and said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“Go and call Muʿāwiya for me” and he (Muʿāwiya</strong><strong>) used to write the Revelation.</strong> <em>(Dalāi’l An-Nabuwwah of Bayhaqī 2/243, and its chain is ḥasan)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">From this we understand that Sayyidunā Muʿāwiya was a scribe of the Qur’ān, Hafiẓ Ibn ‘Asākir wrote: <strong>“[Muʿāwiya is the] uncle of the believers, and the scribe of the revelation of the Rabb of the Worlds, he accepted Islām on Yawm Al-Fatḥ (the day of conquest).”</strong> <em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/38)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The famous tābi’ī ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Ubaydullāh ibn Abī Mulaykah Al-Makkī narrated that Muʿāwiya prayed one rak’at (cycle) of witr after ‘Ishā, then Ibn ‘Abbās said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“He is correct, verily he is a faqīh.”</strong> <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 3765)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In opposition to this narration, Ṭaḥawī Al-Ḥanafī, “from Mālik b. Yaḥyā (who Ibn Ḥibbān is alone in declaring trustworthy), from ‘Abdul Wahhāb b. ‘Aṭā who said: from Imran b. Ḥadīr,,,” narrated a rejected narration using this chain <em>(Sharḥ Ma’ānī Al-Āthār 1/289)</em>. This narration is rejected on account of it opposing the narration of Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī, and Ṭaḥawīs claim that Ibn ‘Abbās said “He is correct.” by way of Taqiyyah is incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Ṣaḥābī ‘Abdur Raḥmān b. Abī ‘Umayrah narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said for Muʿāwiya: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“Oh Allāh! Make him a guiding one, and guide [others] through him.” </strong><em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhī No. 3842, and he [Imām Abū ʿĪsā At-Tirmidhī] said, “This is a ḥadīth ḥasan gharīb.”, Tārīkh Al-Kabīr of Al-Bukhārī 5/240, Tabaqāt Ibn Sa’d 7/487, Al-Āḥād wal Mathānī of Ibn Abī ‘Āṣim 2/358 No. 1129, Musnad Aḥmad 4/216 No. 17895, and it is a Ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This narration is from Marwān bin Muḥammad and other than him from Sa’īd bin ‘Abdul Azīz, and Marwāns narrations from Sa’īd bin ‘Abdul Azīz are in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim <em>(108/1043, No. 2403 [Darussalam Edition])</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It has been established that Sa’īd bin ‘Abdul Azīz’s narrations were narrated before he lost his memory <em>(As-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 1969)</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>It is narrated from Umm ‘Alqamah (Marjāna) that Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān</strong><strong> arrived in Madīnah and asked ʿĀʾishah</strong><strong> for the cloak and hair of the Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>, then he put the cloak on and dipped the hair into water and drank it and poured it over his body. </strong><em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/106 and its chain is ḥasan, and Marjāna is trustworthy according to Al-‘Ijilī and Ibn Ḥibbān.)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It is narrated from Maswar bin Makhrama that he and one delegation went to Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān and Muʿāwiya fulfilled all his needs, then Muʿāwiya called him saying, “What happened to your criticism of the rulers?”. Maswar said, “Leave this, and have good behaviour as we previously had.” Muʿāwiya said, “No, by Allāh! You have to tell me about yourself and why you are criticising me.” Maswar said that he told him every fault he saw in him. Muʿāwiya said, “No one is free from sin, O Maswar! Do you know how much I have tried to correct the people? One good deed will have the reward of ten, or will you keep counting the sins and forsaking the good actions?” Maswar said, “No, by Allāh! We only mention the sins that we see.” Muʿāwiya said, “We acknowledge every one of our sins in front of Allāh – O Maswar! Do you not have some sins that you fear that if they are not forgiven that you will perish?” Maswar said, “Yes.” Muʿāwiya said, “What has made you deserving of forgiveness that you do not hope for me? By Allāh! I try harder than you to rectify but by Allāh! In two matters, I only prefer one. Between Allah and other than him, I only choose Allah. I am upon this religion in which Allāh accepts righteous actions, He recompenses for good deeds and sins except for those who He chooses to forgive. I hope that for every righteous action I do, Allāh will recompense me many times over. I am facing great matters that neither you nor I can count – I have established the Salah, and Jihād in the way of Allāh, and have established a system that rules by what Allāh has revealed and like this there are other matters that if I told you, you wouldn’t be able to count them – ponder on this.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Maswar said that he understood that Muʿāwiya overcame him in this conversation. <strong>‘Urwah bin Al-Zubayr said, “After this we never heard Maswar censuring Muʿāwiya, he used to pray for his forgiveness.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Baghdād 48/208,209 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Ja’far Aṣ-Ṣādiq, with the following sanad: “Qāsim b. Muḥammad said: Muʿāwiya b. Abī Sufyān said:”, narrated a ḥadīth in which Qāsim bin Muḥammad (bin Abī Bakr) said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“So, the people were amazed at the truthfulness of Muʿāwiya</strong><strong>.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/115 and its chain is ḥasan)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">From this narration we understand that Amīr Muʿāwiya was truthful in the view of the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Sayyidunā ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“I have not seen anyone more befitting, meaning to rule (after the Rightly-Guided Caliphs) than Muʿāwiya.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/121 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Muṣannaf ‘Abdur-Razzāq 11/453 No. 20985)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">‘Irbāḍ bin Sāriyah narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“O Allāh! Teach Muʿāwiya Al-Kitāb and Al-Ḥisāb and save him from the Punishment.” </strong><em>(Musnad Aḥmad 6/127 No. 17152 and its chain is ḥasan, Ṣaḥīḥ ibn Khuzaymah 1938)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Amīr Muʿāwiya</strong> passed away in 60H – one should always stay silent on the battles that occurred between the noble companions due to ijtihad (i.e. they were seeking the truth). Imām of Ahlus-Sunnah Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal said, “Whenever you see a man cursing the companions of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, then doubt his Islām.” <em>(Manāqib Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal of Ibn Al-Jawzī No. 160, and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Tarīkh Dimashq 62/144)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Mu’āfa bin ‘Imrān al-Mauṣilī (d. 185H) was asked about Amīr Muʿāwiya, so he said: <strong>“Nobody can be placed next to the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>, Muʿāwiya was his companion, and he was the brother of Ummul Mu’minīn Umm Ḥabība</strong><strong>, and he was his scribe and the one entrusted [with the writing of] the Revelation of Allāh.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Baghdād 1/209 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Tarīkh Dimashq 62/143)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal said, <strong>“Whoever belittles anyone from amongst the Companions of Messenger of Allāh</strong> ﷺ<strong>, then he does not harbour anything except an affliction, and he has a hidden evil towards the best of the People, and they are the Companions of Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>.” </strong><em>(As-Sunnah of Al-Khallāl 2/477 No. 758, and the Muḥaqqiq said: its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibrahīm bin Maysarah Aṭ-Ṭā’ifī narrated that <strong>‘Umar bin ‘Abdul Azīz</strong><strong> never hit anyone except one man that cursed Muʿāwiya</strong><strong>, so he whipped him. </strong>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/145 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">163 aḥadīth are narrated by Amīr Muʿāwiya in Musnad Baqī bin Makhlad <em>(Siyar A’lām An-Nubalā 3/162)</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Those that narrated from him [from the companions] include:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">[And from the successors:]</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In the view of Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jama’āh, all the Companions are considered truthful in their narrations (‘Ādil) <em>(Ikthiṣār ‘Ulūm Al-Ḥadīth of Ibn Kathīr 2/498)</em>. Those differences that occurred between them out of ijtihad, and the fighting that happened, they are excused, and we should remain completely silent about them. O Allāh! Fill our hearts with a complete love for the Companions and save us from insulting and degrading them! Āmīn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">رضي الله عنهم أجمعين</span></p>
