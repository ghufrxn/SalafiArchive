<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>READ THE LAST PART</strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #008000;"><a style="color: #008000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-35-part-c-shaikh-al-islam-ibn-taymiyyah-728h-demolishing-the-bidah-of-mawlid-what-did-he-really-say/">The Mawlid Papers &#8211; Part 35</a></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s also known as Raza Khani&#8217;s, in a desperate attempt to salvage some misdirected credibility organised a lecture in Luton on Sunday 26th November 2017 at Luton Central Mosque. This was undoubtedly organised in spite of the lecture the Salafi&#8217;s of Luton had scheduled on the same day at Luton Islamic Centre titled &#8216;Mawlid un Nabi &#8211; To Celebrate or Not&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Raza Khani Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s in anger scheduled a lecture titled, &#8216;Mawlid &#8211; Fact not Fiction&#8217; and they invited none other than a disgraced and shambled speaker, who in the past year had been remorsefully recovering from a severe and dismal defeat in a debate. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The deluded individual had duped himself and his ardent blind followers in thinking they could use divine texts revealed by Allah, to justify and evidence the worship and calling upon other than Allah, It did not make any sense to any mature, sensible and sane individual to even think you could use the words of the creator and the words of his chosen Messenger of Allah ﷺ to prove calling upon others, but how can you help those who refuse to think and ponder? We are talking about none other than the Barelwi Sufi Asrar Rashid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same individual in other lectures refers to us, i.e. Salafis as Pseudo Salafis as if this was some kind of obscene swear or a derogatory remark, which will have the desired affect of defamation or degradation. However it does and will have repercussions, and that is we will aptly and happily refer to these Barelwi Sufis as Raza Khani&#8217;s i.e. on the Religion of Ahmad Raza, Rida, Riddah or whatever the Riz Raz Khan he was. Likewise and similarly do not be squeamish or be remotely offended when we start referring to you as Lahabi&#8217;s!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Perhaps, inshAllah we can analyse the lecture itself at a different time but what we found most repugnant was the title of &#8216;Fact not Fiction,&#8217; implying the celebrating of the Mawlid is a something factual, which is obviously ludicrously insane because the Mawlid is a clear, manifest and absolute innovation, a Bid&#8217;ah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What we would like to do, is to see whether the Mawlid is factual or  actually a fiction based on the statements of the Sufi Barelwi Raza Khani&#8217;s Church fathers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You can often hear Asrar Rashid venerating and praising his Barelwi church father, Ahmad Rida Khan in numerous videos and in this regards holds him high esteem and respect. The same Ahmad Raza Khan himself declared the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal to be the day the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died. He said the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born and also died on 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal <em>(Malfuzat 2:220).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask these Mawlid lovers, are you astagfirullah celebrating the birth or death of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ!!! Now let the average Barelwi adherent and sympathiser claim he is celebrating the death of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, this is indeed from the evil tricks of the cursed  Ibis and the shayatin from amongst men. Is this what you call Mawlid &#8211; Fact not fiction, Astagfiruallh!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the problem, that these people do not for a moment think logically with their brains which Allah, from his mercy and blessings bestowed upon them. for how long will you remain ignorant and hide behind those to feign knowledge of the sacred sciences, there is no excuse, and fear the day when your leaders and guides will be exposed for taking you away from the Quran and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Barailwi author and defender of the Mawlid, Abdul-Sam&#8217;i Rampuri clearly says the Mawlid gatherings were conducted in the sixth (6th) century of Islam, he says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Mawlid gatherings which were organised at the end of the sixth (6th) century were considered to be good by the scholars and honourable people.&#8221;</em> <em>(Anwar Sati&#8217;a Dar Bayan Mawlud  wa Fatihah p.50)</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Anwar Sati&#8217;a p.50)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdul Sam&#8217;i Rampuri went onto say</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The selling of goods and products (related to Milad &#8211;  i.e. christmas milad trees, milad cakes, milad lights and HALWA) and with it being specific to the month of Rabi ul-Awwal and then further restricting and designating the 12th day for Milad was practised in later times i.e. at the end of the Sixth (6th) century.&#8221;</em> <em>(Anwar Sati&#8217;a p.159)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There was no Mawlid or a third Eīd during the first centuries of Islam, including the era of the companions, the Tabi&#8217;in and the Atba Tabi&#8217;in, ie the first three generations, what we abbreviate to the Salaf us-Saleh, nor during the period of the great Imāms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Barailwi defender and Churchfather Ahmad Yar Naeemi cites the view of Hafiz al-Sakhawi via the statement of Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Haithami who said (i.e. al-Sakhawi) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Milād was not celebrated by anyone in the first three generations, it was introduced (innovated) later on.&#8221;</em> <em>(Ja&#8217;a al-Haq 1:235)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another Sufi Barelwi church father, Didar Ali, who is held with great esteem also acknowledged and affirmed there was no evidence for Mawlid during the first generation and the Salaf us-Salihin was in fact introduced (innovated/fabricated) later. <em>(Rasul al-Kalam Fi Bayan al-Mawlid wal-Qiyam p.15)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Barailwi Sūfī Hadith explainer, Ghulam Rasool Saeedi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I say: the Salaf us-Salihin meaning the Sahabah and the Tabi&#8217;in did not practise or organise Milad gatherings, and this is correct, however neither did the Sahabah or Tabi&#8217;in prohibit it&#8221;</em> <em>(Sharh Sahih Muslim 3:179)</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Sharh Sahih Muslim 3:179)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The intent here is to show the Mawlid was not practised in the first three blessed generations i.e.  during the time of the companions, successors and their successors i.e. the Salaf us-Saleh. When not a single one of them practised the Mawlid, it shows they were unanimous in its prohibition and that it was an alien concept, so Ghulam Rasool Saeedis assertion they did not prohibit it, is  a very lame and poor line of argument.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, this shows none of the other Sahabah or Tabi&#8217;in practised the Mawlid, because if they had they would been warned and prohibited from doing so by the other Sahabah and Tabi&#8217;in, therefore the last part of the statement of Ghulam Rasool Saeedi is a proof for us. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sahabah and Tabi&#8217;in would not have needed to warn from the Mawlid because they had been instructed by the Messenger of Allah ﷺ not to exaggerate in praise of him like the christians did with Isa Alayhis Salam and they were people who follow the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in totality without following their whims and desires like the Sufi Barelwis do.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Who is Ghulam Rasool Saeedi, well he is someone who the Sufi Barelwis revere due to his knowledge of hadith, he is well respected and has a venerable position with them. He cites an important principle which the sufi Barailwis abhorrently desecrate, he said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;In this regard the correct principle is that any specific act of worship that is to be practised, and there are no preventative factors and despite this the Messenger of Allah ﷺ deliberately abandoned it, then performing such an act is indeed with certainly impermissible and an act of innovation (bid&#8217;ah).&#8221;</em> <em>(Sharh Sahih Muslim 2:545)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, this is the FACT Asrar Rashid and his Barelwi sect would like you to believe, knowing very well their scholars and church fathers were agreed the Mawlid was not celebrated or practised during the first three blessed generations i.e. the Salaf us-Salihun as Asrar Rashid often says. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The real FACT is, the Salaf us-Saleh, the Sahabah, Tabi&#8217;in and Atba Tabi&#8217;in did not celebrate the Mawlid so stop following yourselves and misguiding others.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7500 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?resize=219%2C300" alt="zia-ud-din-madani" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?resize=219%2C300 219w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?resize=768%2C1053 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?resize=747%2C1024 747w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?w=1106 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 219px) 100vw, 219px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a resident of Madinah and spent most of his life there, he received ijazah and Khalifa(ship) from Ahmad Raza Khan when he was in his teens, i.e. 18 years old. He also received Ijazah and Khalifaship from the Sufi Yusuf Nabahani (d.1350/1932), who is revered by both strains of the Hanafiyyah from the sub continent i.e. Deobaniyyah and of course the Barelwiyyah, both arch Sufi&#8217;s. (see <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.darultahqiq.com/qadi-yusuf-al-nabhani-d-1932-ce1350-ah-on-the-jala-al-aynayn-of-numan-al-alusi/">http://www.darultahqiq.com/qadi-yusuf-al-nabhani-d-1932-ce1350-ah-on-the-jala-al-aynayn-of-numan-al-alusi/</a>) </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">he also got ijaza and because the Khalif for the following Sufi&#8217;s (as stated by them)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wasi Ahmad Muhadith Surti, Syed Hussain Al-Hassani Al-Kurdi, Ahmad Al-Shamah Al-Malaki Al-Qadri Marakashi, Syed Abdul Rahman Seraj Makkahi, Badruddin al-Hassani Shami, Ahmad Sharif Asanousi Tarablasi, Abdul Baqi Farangi-Mahali, Ameen Qutabi, Shah Abdul Haq Muhajjar Alla Abadi, Shah Ali Hussain Ashrafi, Nour Yousaf Kachochavi, Abul Khair Meer Dad Makki, Syed Ahmad al-Hariri, Syed Sabbagi, Syed Alawi Bin Abbas Malaki (Father of Syed Muhamad Alawi Malaki Sahib)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Most of them were ardent fanatical Sufi&#8217;s and some of them are of importance, Wasi Ahmd Surti was an arch enemy of Ahl al-Sunnah in the subcontinent, Badr al-Din Hasani revered by both Deobandi&#8217;s and Barelwi&#8217;s, Syed Alawi bin Abbas, the father of the notorious Alawi Maliki who has demonstrated his extreme hatred for Tawhid and its people in his books. He has also been thoroughly refuted by the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama&#8217;ah. Dear readers we find this a web and matrix of deviation of these Deobandi and Barelwis holding the same beliefs in opposition to the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">another interesting link is the leader of these guys</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/green-hat.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7504 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/green-hat.jpg?resize=300%2C183" alt="green-hat" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/green-hat.jpg?resize=300%2C183 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/green-hat.jpg?w=502 502w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ilyas-atari.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7505 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ilyas-atari.jpg?resize=236%2C238" alt="ilyas-atari" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ilyas-atari.jpg?w=236 236w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ilyas-atari.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He has ijazah and Khalifship from the grandson of Zia ud Din Madani, Rizwan Qadiri. Yet again another intertwined link between these brothers in faith. Also we find some refutations of Ilyas Attari Qadiri on his fellow Qadiri Fraternity brother which are accessible via the internet and also Tahir ul-Qadiri&#8217;s comebacks in his usual frantic rants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;">2. <strong>Syed Ahmad Maulana Abul Barkat Qadiri (d.1398/1978)</strong></span></h5>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abul-barkat.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7506 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abul-barkat.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="abul-barkat" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abul-barkat.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abul-barkat.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abul-barkat.jpg?resize=200%2C200 200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abul-barkat.jpg?w=400 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">He was the son of Syed Didar Ali Qadiri who inturn was a direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan and took ijazah from him. Abul Barkat also attended Jamia Naeemia of Naeem ud Din Muradabadi and gained an ijazah in Dars Nizami from him. Naeem ud Din Muradabadi was also a direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi. in 1915c he travelled to Bareli and studied directly under Ahmad Raza Khan and after a year or so Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan gave him an ijazah for all of his books and islamic sciences and wrote the ijazah with his own hand. (Shahansha Baghdad p.89-91, Fadhail Mustafa p.6+)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #333300;">In this way Abul Barkat Syed Ahmad was a student of the students of Ahmad Raza Khan via 2 routes and also had direct ijazah from Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi himself, it obviously does not get any closer than that. So Tahir ul-Qadiri has again direct chain to Ahmad Raza Khan via one person. Dear readers this shows how</span> the fighting between the Barelwis despite their close ties to each other and being direct students of Ahmad Raza. You see, its very easy throwing allegations and making points of confusion all day long against the Salafi&#8217;s and the Ahl al-Hadith but the fact of the matter is the differences between the Sufi Barailwi&#8217;s is of precedent levels. Also remember the very same students of Abul Barkat are the ones refuting and issuing fatawa&#8217;s against Tahir ul-Qadiri and vice versa. This is their reality due to their Sufi Tariqahs and factionalism. The students Abul Barkat are known as Barkati&#8217;s, yet another group and tariqah to disunite and separate the Muslims.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Fir&#8217;aun (Pharaoh) said: &#8220;O chiefs! I know not that you have an ilâh (a god) other than me, so kindle for me (a fire), O Hâmân, to bake (bricks out of) clay, and set up for me a Sarh (a lofty tower, or palace) in order that I may look at (or look for) the Ilâh (God) of Mûsa (Moses); and verily, I think that he [Mûsa (Moses)] is one of the liars.&#8221; </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Al Qasas:38]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Fir&#8217;aun (Pharaoh) said: &#8220;O Hâmân! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways, (36) &#8220;The ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the Ilâh (God) of Mûsa (Moses) But verily, I think him to be a liar.&#8221; Thus it was made fair-seeming, in Fir&#8217;aun&#8217;s (Pharaoh) eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the (Right) Path, and the plot of Fir&#8217;aun (Pharaoh) led to nothing but loss and destruction (for him).</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Ghāfir: 36-37]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are various points of benefit from these āyahs of which some are:</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The prophets and messengers of previous nations also held the creed that Allāh is above the heavens.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">To reject Allāh being above the heavens is to follow the way of Fir’aun the accursed.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed, to reject Allāh being above the heavens is that which leads to misguidance and a removal from the straight path of guidance.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Such a baseless creed of rejecting Allāh being above the heavens makes one’s evil deeds as seem fairing to the person.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Such a creed leads a person to find ways to reject and alter the Shari’ah revealed by Allāh [as was perpetrated by Fir’aun].</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">However, Allāh destroys all false ways and alterations made by the person of false creed.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Tahāwī states:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Those from the Jahmiyyah sect who reject Allāh being high above are Firawnī [upon the way of Fir’aun]. Then those who affirm Allāh being high above are upon the way of Mūsa and Muhammad”.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">[Sharh Aqīdah Tahāwiyyah, pg:259]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And in the heaven is your provision, and that which you are promised.” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Adh-Dhāriyāt:22]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;You worship besides Allâh only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allâh have no power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allâh (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back.” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[al-Ankabūt:17]</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is thus clearly established that the provision of sustenance is with Allāh and He is above the heavens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4] </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Do you feel secure that He, who is over [fī] the heaven (Allâh), will not cause the earth to sink with you, and then it should quake?” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[al-Mulk:16]</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5]</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Or do you feel secure that He, who is over [fī] the heaven (Allâh), will not send against you a violent whirlwind? Then you shall know how (terrible) has been My Warning.” </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[al-Mulk:17]</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imām al-Bayhaqī comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The word [Fī] in these ayaat means over and above. It is saying are you not afraid of your Lord who is above the heavens? Similar to this is the meaning when Allāh says in the Qurān “so travel [Fī] the earth” also ‘and I will crucify you on [Fī] the trunks of palm trees’ [which is what Fir’aun said to the magicians when they believed in Mūsa]. It is clear that the ayah of travelling upon the earth means that the thing ‘above’ is the heavens and Allāh is above them. Therefore, the meaning of these ayaat shall be ‘Are you not afraid of the one who is above His Throne’ as is established in many other ayaat”.</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Al-Itiqād of al-Bayhaqī, pg 42]. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He also states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Abū Abdullah al-Hāfidh said the Shaikh Abū Bakr Ahmad Bin Ishāq Bin Ayūb the Jurist said that ‘The specialist linguists of the Arabic language have said that the word ‘Fī’ is used interchangeably with the word ‘alā’ [above/over] in the language. Allāh said ‘“so travel [Fī] the earth” and ‘and I will crucify you on [Fī] the trunks of palm trees’ here the word Fī in these ayaat means ‘alā’, i.e., over/above. It is likewise with this in mind we understand Allāh’s words in Quran when he says ‘Fī’ the heavens, i.e., it means above His Throne, above the heavens as has been mentioned in numerous prophetic traditions.”</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>[Al Asmā wa Sifāt of al-Bayhaqī, pg 299].</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Shaikh has mentioned twenty chapters under how shirk is manifested in the Ummah. From amongst them he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></span></p>

<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“Do you not know that the owner of the heavens and earth is none other than Allāh, And besides Allāh you have neither any Walî (protector or guardian) nor any helper.” [Al-Baqarah: 107]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Since there is no guardian or helper other than Allāh then how can one seek such help from other than Him? In fact, to do so is to make shirk with Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Shirk has become so embedded in our society that certain people when they meet each other instead of giving the Islamic greetings of salām one will say “O Alī [the companion and 4<sup>th</sup> Caliph] help me” and the recipient will say “My guide and protector Alī help me”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Do these people not see that Alī could not help his son in the travesty of Karbalā in which he was martyred? Nor could he save himself against his killer Ibn Muljim. In reality, Alī himself was always in need of Allāh and did not have the power to benefit and protect himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Those that have abandoned the legislated salām of salutation have shown a clear opposition and enmity to the Lord of all Mankind, Allāh. Allāh says,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">“If Allāh helps you, none can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, who is there after Him that can help you? And in Allāh (Alone) let believers put their trust.” [Āli-Imrān:160]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Muhammad Bin Ishāq al-Mutaalibī said concerning this ayah:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">“If Allāh is aiding you then no person can overcome or humiliate you and the opposite is also the case. Thus do not leave the commands of Allāh for the sake of another but instead leave others instead of the commands of Allāh. The believers should rely only on Allāh and not on others”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">[Durr Manthūr [2:1] as reported from Jarir, Ibn Mundhir and Ibn Abī Hātim]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This ayah shows that even in affairs in which a person has ability help another in this world cannot do so unless Allāh wills and allows. Therefore, to ask creation in that which they have no ability or control is furthermore inconceivable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Then this is why we have been commanded to read in every prayer the Fātiha which has within it:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything).” [Fātiha:4]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Therefore, without doubt the Muslims creed should be based on only seeking help and aid from Allāh but even in this regard some people from amongst those who should know better fell short!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The famous Deobandī sect scholar Mahmūd ul Hasan who they refer to as the ‘Shaikh of India’ said in his tafsīr of this āyah that:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">“This āyah shows that to seek help from other than Allāh’s being is completely impermissible. However, if one was to find a pious person who is accepted and purely to gain the Mercy of Allāh one was to put him before Allāh [as an intermediary] then this is permissible. To seek help from this person will actually be as if one is seeking help from Allāh”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">[Meaning of the Qurān with notes of benefit. V1/2]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">So we say that such explanations open wide the door of shirk with Allāh; and it is with such explanations that the people use to justify to call upon other than Allāh with words such as calling upon the Prophet “Yā Muhammad”, the Angels, Abdul Qādir Jīlāni or other than them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In the battle of Badr when Allāh sent the angels to help the Muslims and the resulting happiness of that Allāh says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">“And Allāh made it not except as [a sign of] good tidings for you and to reassure your hearts thereby. And victory is not except from Allāh, the Exalted in Might, the Wise” [Āli Imran:126]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Explanation</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This means that the sending of the angels has been mentioned just so to reassure the companions and to change their anxiety into happiness and tranquillity. Otherwise, in reality it is not the angels who helped but Allāh alone as is evident from the ayah, and the angels being sent was only by Allāh’s authority and command and He can decide to help whomsoever and however He wants.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“And those whom you call upon besides Him (Allāh) cannot help you nor can they help themselves.&#8221; [Al-Arāf:197]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In reality those who are in the mausoleums, graves and various places where people gather to call upon other than Allāh are in need of the caretakers of the graves and mausoleums to protect the food, wealth and money that the ignorant people leave at their graves. They cannot help themselves from the thieves so how can they help others?</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“And they have taken besides Allāh âlihah (gods), hoping that they might be helped (by those so— called gods). (74) They cannot help them, but they will be brought forward as a troop against those who worshipped them (at the time of Reckoning).” [Yā-Sīn:74/75]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000">Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It means those who have fallen into shirk are hoping for assistance and help from those that they call upon and thus to call upon them is completely futile. Then from amongst these people who call upon others is the like of the Deobandī spiritual guide, scholar, Hāji Imdādullāh Muhājir Makki Hanafī Chishtī Qādrī Naqshbandī Sohrwardī says about his own guide Pīr Shāh Nūr Muhammad whilst addressing him the following couplets of poetry:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000">“You O Nūr Muhammad a special beloved of Allāh</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In India are the deputy of prophet Muhammad</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Whilst you are the helper then what is there to fear</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Due to the love you have of the prophet you shake and are in awe</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><u>Now is the time to help us O Shāh Nūr Muhammad</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">[Shamāim Amrādiyyah pg: 83]</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">I say, if so called scholars have corrupt beliefs such as this then what can one expect of the ignorant lay person? Then it should be known that there is no doubt that such a call for help is shirk with Allāh as is evident from the verses above.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong><u>Some narrations:</u></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ubādah Bin Sāmit narrates that in the time of the Prophet there was a hypocrite who continued to hurt the believers. Some people said let us go to Prophet Muhammad to seek help in this affair. The Prophet upon hearing this said help is not sought from me but only from Allāh alone.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">So if help cannot be sought from the Prophet then how is it conceivable one can ask for those who are less than him in rank and status?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">When this ayah was revealed:&#8221; And warn thy nearest kindred (al-Qur&#8217;an, xxvi. 214), the Messenger of Allāh called the Quraish; so they gathered and he gave them a general warning.

Six in the earth, and one above the heavens.’ He said: ‘So which of them do you take for your ardent requests and fears?’ He said: ‘The one above the heavens.’ He said: ‘O Husain, if you would but accept Islam, I would teach you two phrases that would benefit you.’” He said: “So when Husain accepted Islam, he said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, teach me the two phrases you promised me.’ So he said: “Say: O Allah, inspire me with my guidance, and protect me from the evil of my soul (Allāhumma alhimnī rushdī, wa a`idhnī min sharri nafsī).’”</em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">[Tirmidhī no:3483]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Whilst in a state of kufr the father of Imrān confirmed that it was only Allāh that should be called upon with all requests being made to Him and Him alone being feared. Hence, this was the creed of the disbelievers. What a calamity that today so called Muslims do not even have this same belief and instead seek help, assistance and show reverence and fear to the ones who are dead in the graves!! This companions story should be a lesson to all and we learn clearly that the one true Lord above the heavens should be called upon alone with no partners at all times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Allāh says,</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order, and invoke Him with fear and hope; Surely, Allâh&#8217;s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good-doers.” [Al-Arāf:56]</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">In conclusion, these narrations substantiate that no one can assist, aid, remove a calamity, or with whom trust, love hope and fear should be placed in other than the Lord of the Almighty Throne Allāh Himself. No prophet, angel, saint, scholar or any part of creation as a matter of fact can assist as they do not control the affairs, nor do they have the authority from Allāh to assist nor are they deputies of Allāh to whom Allāh has designated His Power to assist. Indeed, all creation itself is always in need of Allāh so we should therefore only call upon Him.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Ahl-ul-Hadeeth By Dr. Muhammad Deeya ar-Rahman al-Azamee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahl-ul-Hadeeth: Shaykh ul-Islaam said: ‘We do not mean to limit Ahl-ul-Hadeeth just to those who convey hadeeth, write them or narrate them but we mean by them: everyone who rightfully memorises the hadeeth, knowing them and understanding their apparent and hidden meanings and following them in what is apparent and hidden, and also the people of al-Qur’aan.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘The least of their traits is: love of the Qur’aan and hadeeth, researching them, seeking their meanings and practising that which they know is binding upon them. The Fuqaha of hadeeth are better informed about the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- than Fuqaha other than them.’[1]
<p style="text-align: justify;">He mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Ahl-ul-Hadeeth are those about whom the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘What I am upon and my Companions.’ And in another narration: ‘It is the Jamaah, The Hand of Allaah is over the Jamaah.’[2]
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahl-ul-Hadeeth are the best people of the Duniya, as Hafs bin Ghayaath said.[3]
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shafi’ee said: ‘If I see a companion of Hadeeth then it is as if I see a man from the Companions of the Prophet, sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, he is of that status.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">He also said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘May Allaah reward them with goodness on our behalf, they preserved the foundation for us so they have an excellence over us.’[4]
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Alee bin al-Madini said: ‘There are no people better than the companions of Hadeeth. The rest of the people were in search of the Duniya while they were establishing the Deen.’[5] i.e. the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hafidh Ibn Rajab said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Ahl-ul-Hadeeth are an authority in knowing hadeeth and knowing the authentic from the weak hadeeth.’[6]
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Prophet, sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, supplicated for illumination of the one who busies himself with the knowledge of hadeeth, memorizing it, conveying it and understanding it. He, sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, said: ‘May Allaah illuminate the person who hears a hadeeth from me and memorizes it until he conveys it. Perhaps a person who carries Fiqh conveys it to someone with more Fiqh than that person and perhaps the carrier of this Fiqh is not a Faqihi.’[7]
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hafidh Abu Bakr Ahmad bin ‘Alee al-Khateeb al-Bagdadi specifically authored a book which he called ‘Sharf Ashaabul-hadeeth’ (the nobility of the companions of hadeeth). In it mentions Ahadeeth and Athaar from the Companions, Ta’bieen, kings, ministers and others from those who followed them about the excellence of knowledge of hadeeth, being busy with it and the nobility of its people over those of Ahl-ul-Bida’ and those of misguidance from the Zinaadiqa (heretics) who concerned themselves with the knowledge of rhetoric and philosophy. This book is a masterpiece in this subject.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">* Taken from ‘Mu’jam Mustalah al-Hadeeth wa laataif al-Assaneed’ p.61-63</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Umar bin al-Khattab, on the authority of Abdurrahman bin Abaan, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Zayd bin Thabit, RadhiAllaahu anhu, Marfoo’. It was also narrated by Ibn Majah (1/84) a different way on the authority of Zayd bin Thabit. Tirmidhee said it was Hasan and he also said: ‘and in this chapter it is also narrated on the authority of Abdullaah bin Mas’ood, Muadh bin Jabal, Jubayr bin Mut’im, Abu Darda and Anas, RadhiAllaahu anhum Jameean.’</p>
