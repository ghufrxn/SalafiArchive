				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Compiled by</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Here are a few points to consider and recognize before being duped by the perverse understanding of some individuals from the UK who misleadingly would like to show Al-Allamah al-Albani’s alleged praise for al-Qardawi by on mere account of him verifying the ahadith in his al-Halal wa’l Haram (hereon in HWH) or by teaching this book. It appears they intend to water down Salafiyyah and present a false understanding of it while formulating and developing new arguments to cooperate and unite with deviant innovators.    </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Scholars or student of knowledge from the Arab lands or elsewhere do not use such weak arguments to show praising innovators or deviants despite the good they have done on mere account of them verifying hadith or even nominally teaching their book. This is a poor line of argument and sheer desperation. The attempt here by such people is to normalise relations and minimise the corruption caused by these individuals.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">HWH was first published in 1380H/1960CE. Shaikh al-Albani completed its checking in 1387H/1967CE as this date was penned by the Shaikh on the last page (page 224) of his Ghayatul Maram. Meaning the Shaikh produced its checking 7 years after HWH’s first publication. Shaikh al-Albani then wrote his introduction, and this is dated 1399H/1979CE and the first edition when published was dated 1400H/1990CE. We therefore learn Shaikh al-Albani completed his checking of HWH approximately 55 years ago and 32 years before his death!!! So, essentially these individuals are using something which Shaikh al-Albani did over half a century ago to fit a fabricated narrative. How could anyone oppress Shaikh al-Albani like this?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">If the argument is used that Shaikh al-Albani taught HWH, then we know the Shaikhs methodology was to only teach ahadith once he was certain of their authenticity (Refer to Muhammad Bayyumi, al-Imam al-Albani Hayatuhu – Dawatuhu, page 29). We know the deviation of al-Qardawi was not manifest and open as it developed in later years. Therefore, using this argument only shows a total lack of understanding of the reality and deceiving people into thinking Shaikh al-Albani taught a book of al-Qardawi when he was a fully-fledged deviant propagator. Why would a person even do this. It is like saying such and such scholar said this about him 50 years ago. Are these people so desperate that they need to resort to such juvenile arguments?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Some biographers of Shaikh al-Albani like Muhammad ash-Shaybani and others studied with the Shaikh while he was in Damascus. Therefore, the teaching of HWH must have been in Damascus and we know the Shaikh migrated to Amman, Jordan in Ramadhan 1400. So, this still shows the Shaikh teaching HWH at the very latest 20 years before his death while the potential date of this teaching seems even earlier than this. Again, it is injustice for imposters to use a historic situation like this to further their deviant ideas.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Shaikh al-Albani checked al-Qardawi’s HWH due to four reasons</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">(a) Due to the insistence of Fahd b. Ali Al Thani, the son of the ruler of Qatar at the time who wanted HWH republished. This was through the publishing house al-Maktab al-Islami which was initially funded and founded by the Qatari royal family</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">(b) al-Qardawi HIMSELF had a meeting with Shaikh Zuhayr Shawysh – the owner of al-Maktab al-Islami to publish his book. Both agreed Shaikh al-Albani would be requested to takhrij of the ahadith and Shaikh al-Albani agreed. (Shaikh al-Albani, Ghayah al-Maram p.13, (Beirut: Maktab al-Islami, 1414H/1994) 4<sup>th</sup> edition)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">(c) HWH had become widespread among the people (Shaikh al-Albani, Ghayatul Maram p.18), and they were relying on the weak hadith it contained; therefore this was also the reason to present a gloss of the book while teaching it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">(d) al-Qardawi pretty much made everything Halal in the book to such an extent the book is described as “al-Halal wa’l Halal”, meaning al-Qardawi failed to make anything Haram while using weak hadith and in advertently making things Halal. This opposed the Manhaj of Shaikh al-Albani of purifying the Sunnah rulings of Ahkam via his approach of at-Tasfiyyah wat-Tarbiyyah</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Shaikh al-Albani published his checking of the book titled, Ghayatul Maram Fi Takhrij Ahadith al-Halal wa’l Haram and this was first published in 1400/1980 while his introduction is dated 18<sup>th</sup> Safar, 1399. This hadith verification is based on detailed discussions related to hadith sciences, rijal and critical analysis since this was Shaikh al-Albani’s expertise. It was not checked because Shaikh al-Abani liked al-Qardawi or was in favour of his activism and methodological ideas. In fact we learn the opposite that al-Qardawi was impressed and testified to Shaikh al-Albani’s knowledge and his specialist expertise in hadith and its sciences.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Shaikh al-Albani clearly says HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE for any mistake the author made regarding some issue and that he merely made takhrij of the hadith and categorization of authentic and weak and at times critiqued the view of the author. (Shaikh al-Albani, Ghayah al-Maram p.18, (Beirut: Maktab al-Islami, 1414H/1994) 4<sup>th</sup> edition)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Shaikh al-Albani understood the problems and mistakes in the book and focused on hadith and traced them, this is the reason why his work, Ghayatul Maram was never published with al-Qardawi’s book. There is also evidence in later years when al-Qardawi became more aware of Shaikh al-Albani’s stance on political activism, groups, and parties, he removed Shaikh al-Albani’s name from the introduction of his book. This is despite using the Shaikhs numbering system. Al-Qardawi is said to have added his own references in later editions. Shaikh al-Albani did not even print his hadith verification with al-Qardawi’s HWH. The Ghayatul Maram as it stands is considered a separate treatise. So, you do not find al-Qardawi’s views and ideas mixed with Shaikh al-Albani’s.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="9">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Using Shaikh al-Albani “Oh he checked al-Qardawi’s book or taught his book” therefore it is acceptable to get comfortable with innovators and deviants is wrong. This is more so when the same scholar has clear statements reprimanding the very idea he is being falsely accused of. I have already shared this Youtube video, and I share it again to enforce this point in the mind of those who recklessly seek to tarnish the Salafi Manhaj by using the name of the great Muhaddith. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Al-Albaani &#8211; Unity with Asharis, Sufis <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k-DRCDVZrw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k-DRCDVZrw</a></strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="10">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">What are the underlying aims and objectives of such people who disseminate these poor arguments. What do they intend to achieve? This disastrous approach is not only dangerous but also cloaked with evil deviation. Attempting to show the alleged mistake of the Rabbani scholars in Manhaj, relying on the ijtihad of a scholar or scholars from a particular region, ignoring the understanding of the Salaf, all in attempt open bridges to innovators and deviants. Worse still, all this from unqualified, emotionally directed, easily manipulated, and regionally biased individuals who have a history of changing colours for money, likes, favouritism and opposing Salafis on mere account of them not pandering to their skewed opinions and views.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="11">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">The affair of al-Qardawi is well known and clear. Using the example of the interaction of other scholars a hundred times, despite the nature of their interaction does not make it hujjah. Salafis base their arguments and approach on evidence alone and not the actions of men nor the approach of Ahlul Bidah – who formulate a framework and then look for evidence.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="12">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">I have already explained and shown HWH had become increasingly popular and while tracing its ahadith numerous ahadith were found to be weak; rendering things that were deemed lawful by al-Qardawi which were perhaps actually unlawful or the problem of using weak hadith in acts of ibadah or legislating such acts when they were perhaps haram. Therefore, teaching HWH was important for the general Muslims. To illustrate the popularity of HWH, in 1415H/1994CE its 15<sup>th</sup> edition was published.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="13">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Shaikh al-Albani checked 484 ahadith from HWH and 80 were declared weak which would have certainly affected the numerous legal rulings in al-Qardawi’s book. This would be considered something important and imperative and not for this to be misconstrued into casting aspersions of Shaikh al-Albanis Manhaj or attempting to show his leniency. This is the hallmark of great Rabbani scholars.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="14">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">If by sharing this corrupt notion of Shaikh al-Albani teaching HWH the aim was to show leniency with deviants or the permissibility of cooperating with deviants at the cost of distorting the Salafi Manhaj, this was a terrible attempt. Shaikh al-Albani is on record numerous times clarifying the finer details of Manhaj. For example, Amr b. Abdul Munim Salim compiled the Shaikhs Fatawa to Manhaj issues, titled al-Fatawa al-Manhajiyyah (Dar ud-Dhiya 1428H/2008CE). So, if one really wanted to know the Shaikhs views on these issues i.e. cooperating with deviants, a dejected claimant should at the very least be honest to himself and decent to the Muslims and articulate his views from these books and not draw dismal ideas based on his failed unqualified conclusions.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="15">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Likewise and similarly, Salah ud-Din Mahmud as-Sa’id compiled al-Fatawa al-Muhimmah of Shaikh al-Albani in 1430H/2009CE (Dar ul-Ghad al-Jadid), so about 14 years ago. In it he quotes extracted fatawa dealing with groups, working with them, the ruling on numerous groups and parties, the difference between Salafiyyah and other Islamic groups. However, somehow the claimants rendered everything futile and ran with their narrative of blind cooperation with deviants only because they believed differently.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="16">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Shall we reject the numerous scholars and students of knowledge who spent decades with Shaikh al-Albani and propagated his understanding of dealing with detractors of the Salafi Da’wah. Shaikh Isam Musa Hadi mentions,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“I would love to mention to you to you the definition of the Salafi Da’wah, its principles and what is calls to from the speech of an Imam among its Imams, rather a flag bearer and its major caller in the land of Sham. He is my Shaikh and my Ustadh the Imam Muhammad Nasir ud-Din al-Albani, who dedicated his life for more than half a century to the Salafi Da’wah in definition, fundamentals, knowledge, teachings, defending and purifying Islam from what has been attributed to it from Shirk, Bid’ah, evil practices, weak, fabricated, and abandoned ahadith and thus calling people to pure Islam through cultivation and conduct. (ad-Daw’wah as-Salafiyyah Ihdafiha wa Mawqifuha Minal Mukhalifin Laha – The Salafi Da’wah – Its aims and Position Towards its Opposers, page 8).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333300;">This clearly shows a scholar working tirelessly to call people to pure Islam for half a century as all his students and other scholars testify, but a man from UK wants to show and paint Shaikh al-Albani in a different light. This is indeed total oppression against the Shaikh, and it further exposes the Ikhwani Manhaj of such people.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="17">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Shaikh al-Albani is further on record for mentioning al-Qardawi and criticizing him and his views, although this is restricted to hadith. This is in his Silsilah Ahadith ad-Da’ifah (7/260-261 no.3264). Shaikh al-Albani criticises al-Qardawi for attributing a hadith to Sahih Ibn Hibban in the footnotes to his HWH page 79. This further shows Shaikh al-Albani criticised al-Qardawi despite his book al-Ghayatul Maram. Shaikh al-Albani said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“This wicked mistake is not befitting a person of knowledge. Especially since he knows I referenced it in ad-Da’ifah and that I traced this hadith in my checking of his book titled Ghayatul Maram…” (Hussain b. Mubarak al-Fulum al-Matrushi, Kashf al-Litham Amman Zakarahum al-Albani Fi Silsilah ad-Daifah Minal Mu’asirin al-A’lam page 519-520)   </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="18">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Being a Salafi necessitates and requires an individual following the Aqidah and the Manhaj of the Salaf. Salafiyyah is not distorting principles to get intimately comfort with deviant innovators. Shaikh al-Albani said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“The call to the Book and Sunnah based on the understanding of the Salaf of the Ummah is a noble affair of high priority. The outstanding scholar does not shut his eyelids until he sees the flag of this affair fluttering on the lands of Islam, victorious over all calls.” (al-Asalah Magazine, issue 23, 1420H)</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="19">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Shaikh al-Albani was asked a question what books a beginner should study and he mentions some of the books he taught like ar-Rawdatun Nadiyyah, Fiqh us-Sunnah, Riyadh us-Salihin but no mention of HWH (al-Asalah Issue 5, Question 1, page 59 1413H)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="20">
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Shaikh al-Albani said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“To conclude I should say Manhaj is much broader than Aqidah and Tawhid and we must commit ourselves to both the Salafi Aqidah and Manhaj. I would like to mention an author’s words who was not Salafi but would mix with Salafi bothers. He said, “The likes of Muslims who imitate the disbelievers in all domains of their lives and their ways be it political, social, educational, economical, or military is like the one who buys a certain costume that does not fit him, and he tries to wear it. Oh brother, this costume was not designed for you, it was designed for another person not your size. How great this simile is, it is truly a precise one. (al-Asalah Issue 22, Question 3, page 76 1420H)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In response to the first video uploaded by the Hanafi fiqh channel <em><strong>(HFC) </strong></em>they presented that Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani declared a hadith weak in Sahih al-Bukhari.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The youtube video spans approximately 5 and a half minutes without the name of the presenter. The attack on Shaikh al-Albani is that he weakens a hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari. The hadith they are referring to is,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">حَدَّثَنِي بِشْرُ بْنُ مَرْحُومٍ، حَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى بْنُ سُلَيْمٍ، عَنْ إِسْمَاعِيلَ بْنِ أُمَيَّةَ، عَنْ سَعِيدِ بْنِ أَبِي سَعِيدٍ، عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏ &#8220;‏ قَالَ اللَّهُ ثَلاَثَةٌ أَنَا خَصْمُهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، رَجُلٌ أَعْطَى بِي ثُمَّ غَدَرَ، وَرَجُلٌ بَاعَ حُرًّا فَأَكَلَ ثَمَنَهُ، وَرَجُلٌ اسْتَأْجَرَ أَجِيرًا فَاسْتَوْفَى مِنْهُ، وَلَمْ يُعْطِ أَجْرَهُ ‏&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari said, narrated to me Bishr bin Marhum, who narrated from Yahya bin Sulaim on the authority of Isma’il bin Umayyah on the authority of Sa’id bin Abi Sa’id on the authority Abu Hurairah on the authority of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who said, &#8220;Allah says, &#8216;I will be against three people on the Day of Resurrection: 1. One who makes a covenant in My Name, but he proves treacherous. 2. One who sells a free person (as a slave) and eats the price. 3. And one who employs a laborer and gets the full work done by him but does not pay him his wages.” (Bukhari, Kitab al-Buyu’a, Bab Ithmi Man Ba’a Hurran, hadith no.2227)</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They say Shaikh al-Albani weakens this Hadith in <em>Da’if al-Jami (al-Saghir)</em> of Hafiz Suyuti and they present a small scan of the grading on the top right of the video.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scan they scantly showed was of this page, where Shaikh al-Albani, according to them weakened this hadith of<em> Sahih al-Bukhari</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Da&#8217;if Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir Wa Ziyadatuhu (p.590 no.4050)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us now move on to their presentation</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE FIRST POINT &#8211; Ignorant Hanafi Muqallids!</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The presenters of these points are hanafi muqallids, the calamity is that not only are they not scholars, but they are in actual fact &#8211; ignorant blind followers of the hanafi madhab and they have no credentials whatsoever to present these points as they are not scholars. Rather, they adamantly believe they are hanafi muqallids and the job of the muqallid is only but to make taqlid. So we ask them, which hanafi scholar has preceded the hanafi fiqh channel in presenting this point.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If they acknowledge they are ignorant muqallids, why are they exceeding their remit as muqallids of the hanafi madhhab. If they claim the hanafi madhhab allows its followers to do research and present intricate detailed points related to <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>, as well as the array of sciences associated with Bukhari combined with the details of the science of hadith, then show us which hanafi scholars has  preceded you in allowing you to do this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, as it relates to this point, the hanafi muqallid who presented this point under the Hanafi fiqh channel, contradictory to his madhhab, reads a hadith from <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> with a screen image of bookcase with dated books. Seriously brothers, how does a hanafi muqallid go from reading a hadith from Bukhari with all those books behind him while he still remains an ignorant hanafi muqallid? Is it not the case that the aim is to feign Islamic knowledge while projecting an academic scholastic approach? I leave you to decide for yourselves. Seriously, what are some hanafi fanatical muqallids doing in bradford trying to talk about <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and the hadith gradings of Shaikh Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani?</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE SECOND POINT &#8211; Why Single out Bukhari?</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani does not and has not categorically graded the hadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> weak in the <em>Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir</em>. Hafiz Suyuti references the hadith to the <em>Musnad</em> of <em>Ahmad</em> (حم) as well as Bukhari (خ) and not just <em>Bukhari</em>, this is the first point to be noted. The video of HFC, surprise surprise, employ their usual &#8216;unique&#8217; tactics and gloss over the fact that the hadith is also in the <em>Musnad</em> of <em>Ahmad</em>. Thus HFC present to the audience the hadith is only in <em>Bukhari</em>, the very same hadith Shaikh al-Albani grades weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In perspective, Hafiz Suyuti includes this hadith in his <em>Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir</em> and references it to <em>Musnad Ahmad</em> and <em>Bukhari</em>. Shaikh al-Albani grades it weak and then HFC come along and say Shaikh al-Albani grades the hadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> weak. This is an exerted effort to direct false impressions against Shaikh al-Albani.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE THIRD POINT &#8211; The Methodology of Shaikh al-Albani</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani applied the methodology of the scholars of hadith to the verification and authentication of hadith. It was not based on wishful thinking or bigoted partisanship, rather it was honest and upright application of the science of hadith. In Part 3 we added the statement of Shaikh al-Albani himself explaining his reasons.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani was known and is still known as a scholar of the Sunnah, who defended and clarified the Sahih hadith from the weak. The HFC video is presented in a repugnant manner attempting to highlight and portray Shaikh al-Albani undermined and discredited <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>. This was also a miserable attempt to malign the Shaikh and equate him with those who rejected and refuted the hadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em> i.e. the Sahihayn. Shaikh al-Albani applied the framework and the established blueprint for researching hadith, their verification and gradings. Therefore, this was a brazen endeavour to discredit Shaikh al-Albani and the Salafi&#8217;s by saying the Sheikh graded hadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As Muslims, we should always research issues with an open, fair and just mind. There should be a clear distinction between the approach of Shaykh al-Albani and the modern day rationalists to the hadith of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>, where the latter only desire to reject and cause doubts pertaining to the Prophetic hadith and the former applies the sciences of hadith based on reading and research.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani said in clarification of position.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I am compelled by academic honesty to express what I believe is correct and to fulfil my duty, as the researcher who has deep knowledge, I hold an academic reality which was mentioned by Imam al-Shafi&#8217;i who said, &#8216;Allah has decreed that no book should be perfect except His Book,&#8217; therefore some of the scholars objected to some words that were erroneously inserted by some of the narrators in some Sahih ahadith.&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (Riyadh: Maktabah al-Ma&#8217;arif, 1422H/2002c) 2:5-6)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE FOURTH POINT- Shaykh al-Albani&#8217;s View on the Status of the Sahihayn</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, this point is further emphasised why the overwhelming number of statements of Shaykh al-Albani in defence, veneration and propagation of the lofty status and calibre of the two Sahihyan i.e. <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em>. Shaikh al-Albani himself said</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;How can the Sahihayn have the same status (as the Sunans), they (the Sahihahyn) are the most authentic books after the book of Allah with the agreement of the Muslim Scholars from the Muhaddithin and others. They have superiority over the books of Sunan as they collated the most authentic ahadith as the Sahihs. They separated and left the weak ahadith and those with objectionable texts, which they based on strong principles and intricate conditions. They had unprecedented success, such that was not given to those after them who collected Sahih ahadith from the likes of Ibn Khuzaimah, Ibn Hibban, al-Hakim and others.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">It has become a well known and common understanding that a hadith transmitted by the al-Shaykhayn or one of them has passed the test of authenticity and thus is sound and authentic without any deficincy, and this is the principle we also hold. </span>However, this does not mean that every letter, word or phrase in the Sahihayn has a similar status to that which is in the Quran, and that it is not possible for the narrators to have made a mistake and error. Neither do we believe any book is free from error except the book of Allah&#8230;.&#8221;</em> (Muqaddimah Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah p.22-23, see scan below)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Muqaddimah Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah (p.22-23)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani highlights his respect for Imam Bukhari and his Sahih by titling his summary of it as <em>&#8216;Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari&#8217;</em> which shows his respect and love for Imam Bukhari by calling him al-Imam, compare this to the presentation of HFC. Imam al-Albani also said <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> has the status of being unanimously accepted with consensus throughout the ages (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (1:8)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Sahih al-Bukhari with his majestic nature has been universally accepted by the Scholars throughout the ages as I have mentioned in the introduction.&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (2:4)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear Readers, you have read the status and position of Bukhari and the Sahihayn according to Shaikh al-Albani from his Muqaddimah of <em>Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah</em> and his <em>Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari</em>. The former, was printed by a Hanafi Deobandi publishing house in Karachi Pakistan. We also find from this excerpt the view of Shaikh al-Albani, his reverence for the Sahihayn is not what the HFC falsely presents when they distort this presentation and say Shaikh al-Albani </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;attacked&#8221;</span> <span style="color: #000000;">this hadith (video timestamp 2:44). Do you see the deception, gross distortion and deliberate misrepresentation?</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE FIFTH POINT &#8211; Shaikh al-Albani did not Grade this Hadith in Bukhari Weak!</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already mentioned the reference in question relates to <em>Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir</em> which also shows the reference to <em>Musnad Ahmad</em>, so the Shaikh did not categorically grade the hadith in Bukhari to be weak. Shaikh al-Albani in his notes to his <em>Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari</em> discusses the chain and the narrator in question i.e. Yahya bin Sulaim and mentions the views of the Scholars concerning him. Shaikh al-Albani says,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I say, this hadith is a lone report of Yahya bin Sulaim..&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (2:73 no.1050)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani also discusses some of the contentious narrations and additional wordings to ahadith in the introduction of <em>Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari</em> and he mentions this hadith as one of the ones there is a issue with. However, nowhere at all does he grade them weak and categorically says they are Da&#8217;if. This is further supported by two later works of Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s where he further discusses this hadith, which is to proceed, In Sha&#8217; Allah.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE SIXTH POINT &#8211; The Actual View of Shaikh al-Albani Regarding This Hadith</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s discusses this hadith in two separate works which are later than the <em>Da&#8217;if al-Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir</em> and hence serve as his last view and hence regarding of this hadith. It must be noted, and this will only be understood and appreciated by the students of hadith, not by the hanafi muqallids, that there is is a difference in saying the hadith is weak and the isnad is weak. This is not unknown to even the beginner student of hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The View of Shaikh al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani references the hadith in <em>Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir</em> to his <em>Irwa al-Ghalil Fi Takhrij Ahadith Manar al-Sabil</em> (no.1489). In the Irwa dear readers, low and behold Shaikh al-Albani grades this Hadith <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hasan</strong></span> to close to it. (see scan below)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/irwa-cover.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-8116 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/irwa-cover.jpg?resize=376%2C570" alt="irwa-cover" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/irwa-cover.jpg?resize=198%2C300 198w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/irwa-cover.jpg?resize=768%2C1165 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/irwa-cover.jpg?resize=675%2C1024 675w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/irwa-cover.jpg?w=821 821w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Irwa al-Ghalil (5:308 no.1489)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find Shaikh al-Albani grading this hadith to be Hasan or very close to it, when he said <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>&#8220;Hasan or Qaribu minhu&#8221;</em></span> An interesting point to note here is that sheikh al-Albani himself references the hadith to <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> in the referencing. So, dear readers, we see that Shaikh al-Albani graded the very same Hadith Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I ask where are the HFC boys now? The grading of Hasan or very close to it is an indication that there is a concern with the chain.  The hanafi scholars themselves have said similar things like this, that not every hadith in the Sahihayn is 100% Sahih and some of them are not of the highest degree of Sahih. The revered hanafi Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah has said this, which has been reiterated by the likes of G.F.Haddad and others. In Sha&#8217; Allah we shall reproduce this later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s goes onto discuss and scrutinise the hadith whilst presenting his research (Irwa al-Ghalil (5:308-311 no.1489). He concludes by saying, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the ISNAD i.e. CHAIN is weak</span> but <span style="color: #ff0000;">the hadith is Hasan</span> and as for it being Sahih then this has phases. (Irwa (5:310). Shaikh al-Albani looks at the view of Hafiz Ibn Hajr and his reasoning and presents his answers. (Irwa al-Ghalil (5:311)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the footnotes to the Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari Shaikh al-Albani said,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;<em>I say, this hadith is a lone report of Yahya bin Sulaim and he is al-Taifi. The Scholars differed with regards to his veracity and they had three views. Some of them said he was trustworthy like Ibn Ma&#8217;in, some said he was just weak like Ahmad and others, he said (i.e. Ahmad), &#8220;I wrote hadith from him for one year and he would mix the hadith so I abandoned him, and he has an issue with him.&#8221; Some said he is weak when transmitting only from Ubadiullah bin Umar al-Umari like al-Nasa&#8217;i, who said, &#8220;There is no harm with him and he is rejected in hadith from Ubaidullah bin Umar.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>It seems like this is what al-Hafiz (Ibn Hajr) relied on when he said in Fath al-Bari, &#8220;The final conclusion is that the criticism levied against him is specific to when he narrates from Ubaidullah bin Umar and this hadith is narrated from other than him.&#8221; However this is contrary to what he said with firm conviction in al-Taqrib that he (Yahya bin Sulaim) is, &#8220;Truthful but he has a week memory.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>This is what I (i.e. al-Albani) relied upon because those who outrightly criticised him had more knowledge compared to those who weakened him specifically in the narrations from Ubaidullah bin Umar.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And there is a fourth madhab (or view) which is based on a statement of the author (i.e. al-Bukhari) who said, as mentioned in the biographical note of Abdur Rahman ibn Naf&#8217;e as it is in al-Tahdhib, when he said. &#8220;Whatever al-Humaydi transmits from Yahya bin Sulaim is authentic i.e. Sahih.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">We understand from this that, any transmission from other than al-Humaidi are not authentic and the author (i.e. al-Bukhari) has transmitted this hadith from a route other than al-Humaidi, hence</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">I do not know how to reconcile between this statement and the fact that this hadith is transmitted in the Sahih.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> (For further reading) refer to al-Irwa al-Ghalil (no,1489)&#8221;</span></em> (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (2:73-74 no.1050, see scan below)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (2:73-74)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear Readers, this scrutiny of the hadith, its chain based on the sciences of hadith is very clear and the presentation of Shaikh al-Albani is riddled with justice, fairness and the application of the sciences. In fact, it is so precise and meticulous that Shaikh al-Albani refers to the words of Imam Bukhari himself while scrutinising the hadith. Dear readers, is the statement that <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;The hadith is Hasan or near it&#8221;</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;<em>I do not know how to reconcile between this statement and the fact that this hadith is transmitted in the Sahih,&#8221;</em></span> not fair and just which show the knowledge and stature of Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When we return to the <em>al-Irwa al-Ghalil,</em> Shaikh al-Albani said after citing the views of the Scholars of hadith and their grading of Yahya bin Sulaim,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I say: The summary of these statements is that the narrator is in essence trustworthy however he is weak in terms of his memory, especially in his narrations from Ubaidullah bin Umar and excluded from this is whatever al-Humaidi narrates from him, which is Sahih i.e. authentic. This hadith is not narrated via al-Humaidi from him (i.e. Yahya) and neither is it the one Bukhari transmits and nor has anyone else transmitted it in this manner. I do not know from which angle al-Bukhari transmitted it from him as the understanding of Bukhari&#8217;s earlier statement that anything transmitted from other than al-Humaidi  from him is not authentic.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Hafiz Ibn al-Hajr&#8217;s answer to this statement is unsatisfactory which is mentioned under the explanation of this hadith where he says, &#8220;Yahya bin Sulaim who is al-Taifi, resident of Makkah and the scholars have differed with regards to his authenticity and al-Bukhari does not have any other mawsul hadith except this one from him. The conclusion is that this statement (i.e. of Bukhari) is concerning and specific to his narrations from Ubaidullah him Umar and as such this hadith is not via his route.&#8221; (Irwa al-Ghalil (5:309)</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani then goes onto answer this view of Hafiz Ibn Hajr, in summary he says the scholars said Yahya has a bad memory and those who restrict his hadith from Ubaidullah bin Umar being weak are incorrect because the statements of the scholars are detailed and hence cannot be restricted. Also that a group of scholars including the likes al-Daraqutni have weakened Yahya due to his poor memory is understood as detailed criticism. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani goes onto say that al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr himself has summarised the statements of the scholars when he in <em>al-Taqrib</em> that Yahya bin Sulaim is truthful but had poor memory. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani then alludes to two mistakes of Hafiz ibn Hajr when he first said the hadith was in <em>Sahih Muslim</em> in his <em>Bulugh al-Maram</em> and the second that after Hafiz Ibn Hajr mentions in <em>Muqaddimah Fath al-Bari</em> (p.172 &#8211; Muniriyyah print) in the biographical note of Yahya there is no other hadith from him in <em>al-Bukhari</em> other than this one, he says, <em>&#8220;He has a basis (for this hadith) other than this transmission.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However there is no other basis for this hadith with Bukhari which Ibn Hajr alludes too nor with anyone else. and Allah knows best. (Irwa al-Ghalil (5:309-311), see the scan from Irwa</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, this is the reality of the so call attack of Shaikh al-Albani on <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>, where we have shown how the Shaykh used the words of the Imams of Ahlus Sunnah themselves and even the words of Imam Bukhari himself, likewise and similarly the understanding and grading of al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr when he presented his scrutiny and analysis of this particular hadith.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE SEVENTH POINT &#8211; al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr and his Analysis of this Hadith</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr also alludes to the issues pertaining to this hadith as well as the narrator, Yahya bin Sulaim in several places, he says in <em>Fath al-Bari</em>,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Yahya bin Sulaim who is al-Taifi, resident of Makkah and the scholars have differed with regards to his authenticity and al-Bukhari does not have any other mawsul hadith except this one from him, he also transmits from him in al-Ijarah [no.2270] via another transmission.

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Fath al-Bari (5:705 no.2227)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Hafiz Ibn al-Hajr in his entry in the <em>Tahdhib al-Tahdhib</em> mentions statement of praise and criticism from the scholars of hadith and rijal. At the end of the biographical note he summarised his view by saying, <em>&#8220;I say..&#8221;</em> and then he goes onto mention his conclusion without any specific words but cites the statements from the Imams and Scholars of hadith and rijal who say Yahya was Hasan, truthful, Saleh, his hadith are written, trustworthy, there is no harm in him, and also that he is not strong, he would confuse hadith, weak,  made mistakes in hadith, he did not preserve hadith and had weak memory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr then concludes his entry by saying,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;al-Bukhari said in his Tarikh in the entry of Abdur Rahman bin Naf&#8217;e that whatever al-Humaydi narrates from Yahya bin Sulaim is authentic i.e. Sahih.&#8221;</em> (Tahdhib al-Tahdhib (Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 1415H/1994c) 11:196-197 no.7882)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr then summarises this in his <em>Tarqib</em> and said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Truthful but he has a week memory.&#8221; (Taqrib ul-Tahdhib (Riyadh: Dar ul-A&#8217;simah, 1416H), no.7613 p.1057)</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani was not the first scholar of hadith to critically discuss Yahya bin Sulaim as many great scholars, Imams and critical analysts of Hadith had preceded him. We know this because al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr establishes a whole chapter in his <em>Hadi al-Sari</em> where he mentions the names of narrators who were criticised and were narrators of Sahih al-Bukhari and then proceeds to answer them alphabetically and systematically. (Hadi al-Sari Muqaddimah Fath al-Bari (Riyadh: Dar Tayybah, 1432H/2011c) 2:1002)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Under Yahya bin Sulaim he says,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Yahya bin Sulaim al-Taifi, Resident of Makkah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Ahmad said I heard one hadith from him, Ibn Ma&#8217;in, al-E&#8217;jli, Ibn Sa&#8217;d said he was Thiqah, Abu Hatim said he was was truthful but not a hafiz, Nasa&#8217;i said there is no harm in him and he is munkar al-hadith when narrating from Ubaidullah bin Umar. al-Saji said he made mistakes in the hadith he narrated from Ubaidullah bin Umar. Ya&#8217;qub bin Sufyan said he was a righteous man, there is no harm in his book, if he transmits from his book his hadith are Hasan and if he transmits from memory then know they are denied/rejected.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>I say: The Shaykhan ie Bukhari and Muslim have not transmitted anything from him when he narrated from Ubaidullah bin Umar, and he has no hadith in Bukhari except this one from Ismail bin Umayyah from Sa&#8217;id al-Muqbari from Abu Hurairah from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ &#8220;Allah says, &#8216;I will be against three people.. al-hadith.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We find that even al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr knew that some of the earlier critical analysts scrutinised this narrator and Shaikh al-Albani was not the first. We also learn of Hafiz&#8217;s own grading of Yahya and his reservations about the chain as well as Imam Bukhari&#8217;s statement concerning the transmission of al-Humaydi via Yahya bin Sulaim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We know the issue relates to the memory of Yahya bin Sulaim and perhaps the central issue rests and revolves around Yahya narrating from his book or from memory because he is truthful. al-Hafiz ibn Hajr himself draws conclusion when he cites what Imam Yaqub bin Sufyan said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was a righteous man, there is no harm in his book, if he transmits from his book his hadith are Hasan and if he transmits from memory then know they are denied/rejected.&#8221; (al-Ma&#8217;arifah wa&#8217;l Tarikh (3:51), Hadi al-Sari (2:1214), Tahdhib al-Tahdhib (11:197)</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE EIGHTH POINT &#8211; Imam Bukhari&#8217;s View on Yahya bin Sulaim</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani drew understanding and conclusion from the words of Imam Bukhari himself when he said <em>&#8220;Whatever al-Humaydi transmits from Yahya bin Sulaim is authentic i.e. Sahih.&#8221; </em>Meaning that any other route was understood and considered to be weak. The reader should bare in mind that Shaikh al-Albani based his research on the words of Imam Bukhari himself and yet the HFC attack Shaikh al-Albani! If only the ḥanafi Deobandi muqallids were able to look beyond their hatred and animosity for the Salaf, the Salafi&#8217;s and their scholars, may Allah open their hearts and the hearts of their followers to the truth, Amin</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, this point, that Imam al-Bukhari preferred this transmission i.e. from al-Humaydi from Yahya bin Sulaim and held it to be authentic is further evidenced in his <em>Tarikh al-Kabir</em> where he cites a chain from al-Humaydi from Yahya bin Sulaim from Ibn Khuthaim from Abdur Rahman bin Naf&#8217;e from Abu Hurairah. (Kitab Tarikh al-Kabir (Hyderabad: Da&#8217;irah al-Ma&#8217;arif al-Uthmaniyyah, 1957c) 5:356-358 no.1135)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani has reiterated this elucidation of Imam al-Bukhari when he mentioned this very hadith in the introduction of his <em>Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari</em> when he said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Its chain includes a narrator who was differed over (by the scholars with regards to his authenticity). What is accepted is that he had a poor memory. Al-Bukhari himself indicates that the narration of the one who he narrates this hadith from is not valid. You can refer to his statement there, so that you may be prudent with regard to matters of your religion and the hadiths of your Prophet.&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (2:8)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE NINTH POINT &#8211; Many Scholars of Hadith have Weakened, Criticised and Disagreed with Ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari, Why Only Attack Shaikh al-Albani?</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many Imams, Scholars of Hadith and critical analysts have criticised numerous ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari as well as the narrators. From the likes of Imam Muslim, Imam Abu Zur&#8217;ah, Imam Abu Hatim, Imam Abdur Rahman ibn Hatim, Imam Dhuhali, Imam al-Daraqutni, Imam Abu Dawud, Imam al-Tirmidhi, Imam al-Nasa&#8217;i, Imam al-Bayhaqi, Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Hafiz al-Dhahabi, al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr and many more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact Imam al-Daraqutni authored a whole book scrutinising the hadith of Sahih al-Bukhari called <em>&#8216;al-Tattabu&#8217;a&#8217;</em>, he had contention with approximately 78 ahadith. al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr responded to every claim of Imam al-Daraqutni and devoted a large part of his <em>Hadi al-Sari</em> clarifying the issues and concerns over <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>, the ahadith, the text and narrators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Abu Mas&#8217;ud al-Dimashqi (d.401H) wrote &#8216;<em>Atraf al-Sahihayn&#8217;</em>, in which he contested some of the hadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari,</em> al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr answered his claims in <em>Hadi al-Sari</em> (1:568+). Interestingly Hafiz Abu Mas&#8217;ud al-Dimashqi also answered some of the contentions of Imam al-Daraqutni.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Abu Ali al-Ghassani (d.498H) authored &#8216;<em>al-Tanbiyyah Alal Awham al-Waqi&#8217;ah Fil Sahihayn Min Qibal al-Ruwah&#8217;</em>, where he also scrutinised the chains and narrators in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>, al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr also answered his points in <em>Hadi al-Sari</em> (1:568+). Some researchers have attributed another book to Hafiz Abu Ali al-Ghassani in his critical analysis of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> which titled, <em>&#8216;al-Taqayyid al-Mahmal.&#8217;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Imam and erudite scholar, Hafiz Ibn Abdul Hadi said the wording of one hadith in Bukhari was wrong. (Tanqih al-Tahqiq (2:104). Hafiz Ibn al-Jawzi went to the extent of declaring some hadith of the Sahihayn to be fabricated!! and there are many other examples we can cite.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The hanafi scholars themselves have weakened so many ahadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari </em>that it is horrendously hypocritical to focus on Shaykh al-Albani and turn a blind eye to your own <em>&#8216;Buzurgs.&#8217; </em>Well this is not something HFC should be worried about because we will do this for you In Sha&#8217;Allah, since you decided to be hero&#8217;s. Some hanafi scholars of the past and present have weakened some of the narrators in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> while others have weakened some of the ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is strange how the HFC have singled out Shaykh al-Albani for their attack while turning a bigoted blind eye towards their own scholars. More information regarding this is to follow. In Sha&#8217; Allah and then we will see how HFC responds when he uncover and reveal centuries of criticism levied against Sahih al-Bukhari by the hanafi and deobandi scholars past and present. Yes and I will be mentioning <em>&#8216;Sahih al-Bihari&#8217;</em>!!!!</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE TENTH POINT &#8211; Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s Research and Analysis on the Hadith of Sahih al-Bukhari Around Was on 10 or so Ahadith</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point here is that Shaikh al-Albani applied the hadith sciences, his research and the understanding of the earlier scholars and critical analysts to<em> Sahih al-Bukhari</em>, and he already mentioned that he did not specifically devote time to check <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> due to its station. However, when he did, he found roughly between 10-12 ahadith he had concerns with and they varied in their nature as I have mentioned in a previous part.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholars I mentioned the previous point,  In each case we find their criticism and scrutiny was limited to a very small number of hadiths, and it was always based on academic, fair-minded, methodological research. So then why is there this big fuss about Shaikh al-Albani attacking <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>, the books which has such acceptance they said and also make youtube videos titled, <em><strong>&#8216;Al-Albani weakens hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari.&#8217;</strong></em></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE ELEVENTH POINT &#8211; The Hanafi&#8217;s like Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah and His View of Sahih al-Bukhari </strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is known Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah &#8211; the little Kawthari, had a lot of love for the deobandi elders and this is a stark reality which is acknowledged by everyone. Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah venerated and lauded the Deobandi scholars, he praised them and mentioned their virtues and service to Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s grading of this hadith under discussion was Hasan or close to it. So was Shaikh al-Albani the only one who declared Hadith in Bukhari as Hasan? The answer is no, as others before as well as the likes of Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah said the same</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">G F. Haddad said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The fact is that they are all sahih but not all of them reach the same high degree of sahih. This is in essence what al-Dhahabi concluded concerning the few narrators of the Sahihayn whose grading was questioned: “The narration of one such as those, does not go below the rank of hasan which we might call the lowest rank of the sahih.” Shaykh Abu Ghudda comments in the margin:</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">“This is an explicit confirmation that al-Bukhari and Muslim did not confine themselves, in the narrations of their respective books, only to narrate hadiths that have the highest degree of sihha.”<span style="color: #000000;">(Emphasis mine) </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;">(Living Islam website)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here is the scan from the <em>al-Muwaqizah</em> showing Hafiz al-Dhahabi&#8217;s words and the statement of Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE TWELFTH POINT &#8211; Regurgitating Asharite Claims from Hasan Saqqaf and the Likes</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These points have been raised before by the likes of Hasan Saqqaf and co which were reproduced in the shambled book al-Albani Unveiled authored by Sayf ad-Din Ahmed ibn Muhammad Amirul Islam, which was throughly refuted. HFC, the muqallids that they are relied on these shambled works to produce their equally poor attempt to discredit Shaikh al-Albani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hasan Saqqaf cites this as the first example of Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s contradictions in his Tanqadhat al-Albani al-Wadhihat (1:10 no.1)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Al-Albani Unveiled (p.7)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Everyone knows who Hasan Saqqaf is, he is an Asharite Shafi who was staunch and bigoted. He spent day and night attacking Shaikh al-Albani and the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah. Since then he has manifested himself as a Khariji open clear cut Rafidhi Shi&#8217;i. When the likes of the author of Al-Albani Unveiled praised him and lauded him titles like Shaykh and Scholar of Hadith. These people do not mention his names nowadays, I wonder why? When you attack the Sunnah and its people, this is what happens. These are the elders of the likes of HFC. The likes of Hasan  Saqqaf who attacked and reviled the illustrious companions, yet you talk about Shaikh al-Albani attacking the Sahabah Kiram!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Look at the incredible immaturity of the compiler of al-Albani Unveiled, he says, <em>&#8220;Little does he know that this hadith has been narrated by Ahmad and Bukhari from Abu Hurayra.&#8221;</em> Now who will enlighten this genius that the <em>Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir</em> itself has references (i.e. Ramuz) to Ahmad and Bukhari in key form as i have mentioned previously.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani said about the likes of Hasan Saqqaf and his ilk,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;At the other end of the spectrum, s</em><em>ome writers have no respect at all for as-Sahihayn, and they reject its ahadith, any that are not in accordance with their rational thinking and their whims and desires, such as al-Saqqaaf, Hisan and (Muhammad) Ghazzali.

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Silsilah Ahadith al-Sahihah (6:93, no.2540)</strong></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE THIRTEENTH POINT &#8211; The Hanafi Scholars and Sahih al-Bukhari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since the HFC have opened this bab, everything is going to pass through. We will show in the forthcoming parts the dealings of the hanafi scholars of the past and present, in how they criticised, scrutinised and weakened hadith in Sahih a-Bukhari as well heavily criticised the narrators of Bukhari. How they used various garbs and disguises to attack the Muhadithin and Sahih al-Bukhari themselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The HFC only attempt to discredit <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> themselves by causing false aspersions and distorted presentations. Dear readers, the biggest attack on <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> is rejecting its hadith knowing very well they are clear and authentic whilst hiding behind madhhabs or the statements of Imams. Dear readers, the HFC was active in making two videos against Shaikh al-Albani because he allegedly weakened hadith in Bukhari, but is it unfair to say the biggest attack and rejection of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> is dismissing and not acting on its hadith, and there are so many examples which are well known the deobandi hanafis outrightly reject and dismiss</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rest assured, we will be looking at all of your scholars, past and present with regards to their shenanigans and playful tactics with the Sahihayn.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE FOURTEENTH POINT &#8211; Only the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is Infallible</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This point relates to the fact that Shaikh al-Albani is fallible, despite being a great Imam, a Hafiz, a Muhaddith and a formidable Scholar of Hadith and its sciences in this century. If Shaikh al-Albani made a mistake, he made a mistake, we do not blindly defend him or distort reality, as this is what Shaikh al-Albani taught us, that we do not have partisanship and blind imitation of anyone other than the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So even if Shaikh al-Albani scrutinised a hadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and indicated weakness in it, then he has a right to do based on academic research due to his ijtihad and knowledge. So he is either wrong or right i.e. he gets one reward or two rewards. This is what the scholars do, however on the other hand the despondent detractors on one hand claim they are hanafi deobandi muqallids yet on the other hand have titles like Mufti, Muhaddith and Shaykh ul-Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The issue is, when a group of muqallids attempt to publicly malign, vilify and attack Shaikh al-Albani with the sole aim of propagating hate and animosity, it is only fair we look at the allegations with a fair, just and open mind. We present the facts while separating the truth from the lies, bias and distorted youtube videos.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE FIFTEENTH POINT &#8211; Conclusion:- Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s View Framework, Outlook and Reprimand of the Despondent Antagonists &amp; His View of the Sahihahyn</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since the aim of the Hanafi fiqh channel was to discredit Shaikh al-Albani and the Salafi&#8217;s, It is pertinent to cite more statements of Shaikh al-Albani from his various works to show the readers, the methodology of this great Shaykh. Shaykh al-Albani was asked,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Question: Are there weak hadith in Bukhari and Muslim?</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Answer: This affair is as Imam al-Shafi&#8217;i said Allah has decreed that no book should be perfect except His Book. Bukhari and Muslim took great care and diligence in the Din of Allah and thus they collated what they considered to be authentic from the ahadith of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>To the extent that it is authentically reported about al-Imam al-Bukhari that he had memorised 600,000 ahadith of which 200,000 were authentic and from them he selected 8,000 to be placed in his Sahih.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>This is why you will not find even in this time a book which is so pristine as to the likes of these two books, however we know only the Prophets are infallible but this does not mean you will not find one letter, a phrase or even a short hadith to be incorrect in Sahih al-Bukhari. However, neither does this mean the ahadith in Bukhari and Muslims cannot be used as evidence.&#8221;</em> (al-Masa&#8217;il al-Ilmiyyah al-Fatawa al-Shari&#8217;ah &#8211; Fatawa al-Shaikh al-Allamah Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani Fil Madinah Wal Imarat (Tanta: Dar al-Dhiya, 1427/2006) p.212, Fatawa al-Imarat no.113, see scan below)</span></p>

Therefore it does no service to knowledge and it is not wise at all for me to focus my efforts on examining as-Sahihayn and ignore the ahadith to be found in the four Sunans and elsewhere, which are not known whether they are Sahih or Da‘if. But during my academic research, I came across some ahadith in a-Sahihayn, or in one of the two, and realised that there are some ahadith that are Da‘if! But whoever has doubts about my ruling concerning some ahadith, let him refer to Fath al-Bari, where he will find very many things that al-Hafiz Ahmad ibn Hajr al-Asqalani critiqued. </em>(Fatawa al-Shaykh al-Albani (Cairo: Maktabah Turath al-Islami, 1414/1994) p. 565)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We also also know Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s view of the Sahihhayn, its ranks and status as well as the hadith contained therein, he was consistent throughout his life and hence we can go as far back as 1969, almost 30 years before he passed away. in 1389/1969 Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s checking of the <em>Mukhtar Sahih Muslim</em> by Imam al-Mundhiri was published, in the introduction he said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This is with the exception of the Sahihayn which have been universally accepted by the Scholars and being safe and free from weak and objectionable ahadith, which are numerous in the books of the Sunnah like the four Sunans and others.&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar Sahih Muslim (Beirut, Maktab al-Islami, 1407/1987), ed. 6th, p.6, see scan below)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Mukhtasar Sahih Muslim (p.6)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, what has preceded is the reality regarding Shaikh al-Albani and his alleged attack on the Sahih of Imam al-Bukhari and his grading the hadith weak in it. The other examples posed by the HFC will similarly lack any form of lateral thinking due to their muqallid hanafi mindsets coupled with tahazzub, ta&#8217;assub and blind ardent fanaticism for their madhab. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This fanatical extremism is not shy of hatred and animosity for Ahl al-Sunnah, the Ahl al-Hadith and the Salafi&#8217;s. These self styled young brothers, who admittedly are lay muqallids, making youtube videos, with &#8216;books&#8217; behind them as their screen are most certainly pushing way beyond their pay grades. Some friendly advice to them is to humble themselves and realise and know their worth, maqam and manzilah with regards to these sacred sciences and the great scholars of this Ummah, like Allamah Rabbani Shaikh al-Muhaddith Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani, Rahimahullah.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Shaikh al-Albani on the Bigoted Hanafi Asharite Fanatics &#8211; Between al-Kawthari, Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah, The Ghumari&#8217;s, Mahmud Sa&#8217;id Mamduh, Muhammad Ghazzali and Modern Mutazilites Hadith Rejectors and Madhabists</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I leave you with these succinct and pertinent words of Allamah al-Albani</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I have mentioned these examples so that readers may be prudent with regard to matters of their religion and will have a clear understanding of the hadiths of their Prophet and be certain of the soundness of the report mentioned above: “Allah has decreed that no book should be perfect except His Book.” Thus they will also not be deceived by what has been written by some of those who want to stir up trouble against us, such as the ignorant muqallids and madhhabists who talk nonsense about what they do not know, say what they do not know and ignore what they already know. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Examples of such people are the likes of The extreme one from Halab Abu Guddah &#8211; the little Kawthari, similar to his likes the Egyptian despondent Mahmud Sa&#8217;id and whoever is upon their way. One may read my refutations upon the two in some of my introductions to various books, for example my introduction to Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah, my introduction to Adab al-Zufaf Fi Sunnah al-Mutahharah, and my new introduction to Mukhtasar Sahih Muslim of Hafiz al-Mundhiri with my checking which is under print and is due to be released soon In Sha Allah with my new notes and checking.   </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And on the other hand there are some people who have made some contributions in some fields of knowledge or in the field of da‘wah (calling people to Islam) – even if it is on the basis of their own understanding – who show audacity in refuting that which they do not like of sahih ahadith, which they regard as da‘if despite the consensus of the ummah in accepting that hadith. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>They do not reject it on the basis of sound principles of this noble branch of knowledge and the rules of knowledge according to the muhaddithin, or because of some doubts that they developed about one of the narrators of that hadith, for they have no knowledge of that and they have total disregard for the knowledge of people who specialise in that field. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Rather they base their argument on their own whims and desires or on their education that was far removed from correct Iman which is based on the Qur’an and authentic Sunnah, in taqlid of the Orientalists and the enemies of the Din, and those who imitate them of westernised people such as Abu Rayyah al-Misri, Izz al-Din Baliq al-Lubnani, Shaikh Muhammad al-Ghazzali and others who have afflicted this ummah in recent times, who reject authentic ahadith on the basis of whims and desires, and cause confusion to some Muslims because of the fallacious arguments they present. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Similar to this are those people who are occupied with this knowledge but are overpowered with bigoted partisanship (Ta&#8217;assub) for their madhabs, following their desires such that they have weakened so many authentic ahadith, For examples the likes of al-Kawthari, Abdullah al-Ghumari, his brother Shaikh Ahmad, Shaikh Isma&#8217;il al-Ansari, so whoever wants to know anything about this then let him refer to my introduction to Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah and the introduction of my books Adab al-Zufaf Fi Sunnah Mutahharah and others where you will find the most surprisingly astonishing things. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Allah, may He be exalted, is the One Whose help we seek and ask Him to protect the Sunnah from the hands of the ignorant, those who would tamper with it and the ignorant who follow whims and desires; we ask Him to make us recognise the efforts of the early imams in service of the Sunnah, who laid out for us principles and rules for knowing what is sound and what is not. Whoever adheres to those principles and rules will be following a clear way, and whoever deviates from that will go far astray. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And May allah have mercy on al-Imam al-Bukhari who gained unprecedented precedence in this field and thus compiled this al-Sahih, and selected hadith from thousands of hadith of the Prophet ﷺ, May Allah reward with an immensely good reward on behalf of Islam and the Muslims.&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (p.8-10)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">QUESTION</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people claim it is permissible to make tabarruk ie seek blessings from the relics of the scholars and righteous people; they present evidence and say the companions sought blessings from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, so what is the ruling concerning this affair? Also in the form that is deemed permissible, is not a non-Prophet being compared to the Prophet of Allah ﷺ? Also is it permissible to seek blessing from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ after his demise? And is it permissible to seek wasilah ie intercession of the blessings of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ?</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is impermissible to seek blessing from the relics of anyone other than the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, for example the water remaining after wudu, his hair, his sweat or any other part of the body. All of these things are specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and this is because Allah had blessed his body and anything else that he touched. This is the reason why no companion sought blessing or virtue from each other during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ or after his death, even to the extent that blessings or tabarruk was not sought from the four rightly guided Khulafa Rashidun or from the other virtuous companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, such actions and the understanding of the companions is a clear and manifest evidence they understood tabarruk ie blessings to be specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ which was impermissible for anyone else. It is also impermissible for anyone who is not a Prophet because it leads to and is a means to Shirk with Allah which is also the false worship of others. Likewise, and similarly it is not correct to make wasilah of the essence or selfness of Prophet ie dhat, his attributes, his blessings, his station and status because it lacks evidence. This is also due to the fact that it is a means and also leads to Shirk with Allah, this is extremism as well as exaggeration in the status and station of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the reasons is is impermissible is because none of the companions adopted or practiced this type of wasilah. If this was something good, they would have surely preceded us.  Another reason why it is impermissible is because it opposes evidence s from the Shari’ah. Allah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Allah has the most beautiful names, so call him by them.” (al-A’raf:180)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Apart from Allah&#8217;s name, it is permissible to make wasilah through his attributes like Honour, mercy and speech which is established and proven from the authentic hadith, in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would seek refuge in Allah through his Speech, Honour, Mercy and Power. (Muslim no.2202, 2708).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also by having Iman in Allah and his Messenger, it is a means of loving both. Hence it is permissible to seek nearness or closeness to Allah via his righteous good deeds. This is exemplified in the incidence of the people of the cave, who sought shelter in a cave from rain when eventually a rock covered the entrance and blocked it. The people did not have the power to remove the rock, so they began to figure out a way in how to deal with the calamity, and so they agreed to supplicate to Allah by mentioning the good deeds they had done, and would use them as interecessors. So one used his good conducts with is parents as a means to seek nearness to Allah, so the rock moved a little. The second person used his deed of abstaining from fornication as a means to seeking closeness to Allah despite having the ability to do so, so the rocked moved a little more. The third person sought means of closeness by mentioning his good deeds of being honest and trustworthy, eventually the rocked moved from the entrance of the cave and they were eventually able to leave. This is an incident of the people or nations before, so It contains admonition and guidance for us all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This answer has been further expounded by Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim in their respective books. Allamah Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan has also addressed it in his <em>Fath al-Majid Sharh Kitab al-Tawhid.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the hadith of the blind man who sought intercession through the Prophet ﷺ which also mentions the Prophet ﷺ interceded on his behalf, so Allah restored his sight (Ahmad 4:134, Tirmidhi no.3579, Ibn Majah 1404, see also Shaikh al-Albani’s al-Tawassul wal-Wasilah p.75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we should know, this hadith did not mention his station or status as a means of closeness or intercession but rather it was due to the supplication of the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, his intercession, using his own wasitah and wasilah as the hadith clearly states. Furthermore, the people will go to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for this type of intercession on the Day of Judgement so that Allah makes Judgement on them quickly (Bukhari 7410, Muslim 193).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, and similarly the people of Jannah will come to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and ask him to intercede with Allah on their behalf for them to enter Jannah quickly (Muslim 196).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the aforementioned forms of Wasilah, whether they are related to when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was living or the afterlife, all in all of them are related to the Wasilah or du’a of intercession and not due to his selfness, ie Dhat or due to the right of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Tuhfatul Ikhwan Bajwibah Muhimmah Tataluq Biarkan al-Islam</em> (Question 5 p.29), see also <em>Majmu’a Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawah</em> (7:67)   </span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Publishers Introduction</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the main aims of Salafi Research Institute is to uphold the views of Ahl al-Sunnah wa Ahl al-Ḥadīth with regards to the matters of creed and manhaj as established by the pious predecessors namely the Salaf us-Ṣāleḥ.  In serving this aim we within SRI continuously strive to rebut and clarify the doubts posed by deviant ideologies based on authentic clear and pristine teachings of the Qurʾān and Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In line with the above; we present to you the second part in a series answering the false arguments presented for the impermissible forms of Tawassul and Istighātha.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This and other research papers, we hope In-Shāʾ-Allāh, will aid the Sunnī Muslim to protect himself from the misinterpretations, distortions and alterations of the people of deviation and innovation. With the aid and assistance of Allāh, The Most Merciful; these articles and research papers will be released and shared on a periodic basis. May Allāh have Mercy on us and grant us the understanding of the correct ʿAqīdah of Ahl al-Sunnah waʾl Jamaʿah and the Salaf us-Ṣāleḥ.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sūfī’s, including the likes of the Barewlī’s and Deobandī sects use this ḥadīth of Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha as proof for making Tawassul through the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Prophets. They claim the wording of the ḥadīth is proof for the permissibility of wasīlah through the Prophets. The proceeding discourse investigates this ḥadīth by looking at its authenticity and a brief overview of the text.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the end, we have touched on the ridiculously despicable claim made by some desperate abhorrent people, who tried to allege our beloved and beautiful Prophet, Muḥammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) committed necrophilia. When such people have no share of any academic discourse they always resort to such despicable lies and weak arguments to defame Islām. This then is an answer to the Ḥadīth of Fātimah bin Asad; The mother of ʿAlī RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnhumā</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Ḥadīth</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">عن أنس بن مالك قال‏:‏ لما ماتت فاطمة بنت أسد بن هاشم أم علي رضي الله عنهما دخل عليها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فجلس عند رأسها فقال‏:‏ ‏&#8221;‏رحمك الله يا أمي، كنت أمي بعد أمي، تجوعين وتشبعيني، وتعرين وتكسيني، وتمنعين نفسك طيباً وتطعميني، تريدين بذلك وجه الله والدار الآخرة‏&#8221;‏‏.‏ ثم أمر أن تغسل ثلاثاً فلما بلغ الماء الذي فيه الكافور سكبه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بيده، ثم خلع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قميصه فألبسها إياه، وكفنها ببرد فوقه، ثم دعا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أسامة بن زيد وأبا أيوب الأنصاري وعمر بن الخطاب وغلاماً أسود يحفرون، فحفروا قبرها، فلما بلغوا اللحد حفره رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بيده وأخرج ترابه بيده، فلما فرغ دخل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فاضطجع فيه فقال‏:‏ ‏&#8221;‏الله الذي يحيي ويميت، وهو حي لا يموت، اغفر لأمي فاطمة بنت أسد، ولقنها حجتها، ووسِّع عليها مدخلها بحق نبيك والأنبياء الذين من قبلي فإنك أرحم الراحمين‏&#8221;‏‏.‏ وكبر عليها أربعاً، وأدخلوها اللحد هو والعباس وأبو بكر الصديق رضي الله عنهم‏</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>It is narrated by Anas bin Mālik. He said: When the mother of ʿAlī bin Abū Ṭālib — Fātimah bint Asad bin Hāshim (RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnhumā— died, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) called on her and sat down by the head of the bed and said, “O dear mother, may Allāh have mercy on you. After my mother, you were the one I regarded as my mother. When I was hungry you fed me to the point of saturation while you yourself remained hungry. Then you helped me put on clothes and instead of eating yourself, you gave me nice things to eat. You did all this for Allāh’s pleasure and for a good reward in the Hereafter.” Then he (the Prophet) commanded to bathe her three times. When camphor water was brought, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) poured some water into his hands. Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) took off his shirt and clothed her with it and used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin. Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) sent for Ūsāmah bin Zayd, Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī and ʿUmar bin al-Khaṭṭāb and the Abyssinian slave to dig up the grave. So they dug her grave. When they reached near the laḥd, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) dug it up and drew the soil out with his own hands. When he finished, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) entered and lay down in (the grave), and said, “It is Allāh Who controls life and death, and He is Ever living and will never die. (O Allāh,) forgive my mother—Fātimah bint Asad— and help her answer properly at the time of questioning and through the mediation/right of Your Prophet (Muḥammad) and the former Prophets, Surely You are infinitely Merciful.” Then he repeated, “Allāh is Great” four times (i.e. led the funeral prayer). Then he, ʿAbbās and Abū Bakr as-Ṣiddīq lowered her into the grave.</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abū Nuʿaym al-Aṣfahānī said after transmitting the report,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is Gharīb from the Ḥadīth of ʿĀṣim and al-Thawrī and we do not write it except it being the lone report of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ.” </em>(<em>al-Ḥilyah ul-Awliyāʾ wa Ṭabaqāt al-Aṣfiyā</em> (3:121, under the entry of ʿĀṣim bin Suleimān al-Aḥwal no.226), Beirut: Maktabah Khanjī/Dār al-Fikr, 1416H/1996)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also transmits it with the same chain in <em>Maʿrifah al-Ṣahābah</em> and he cites the same chain as the Ḥilyah. (<em>Maʿrifah al-Sahābah</em> (6:3408, tarjamah no. 3970 no.7783), Riyadh, Dār al-Waṭan, 1419H/1998)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Nūr al-Dīn al-Haythamī said after transmitting it,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“No one narrates it from ʿĀṣim except Sufyān and it is a lone report of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ.”</em> (<em>Majmaʿa al-Baḥrayn</em> (6:362), Riyadh: Maktabah Ibn Rushd, 1413H/1992)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He, al-Haythamī also said after transmitting it in his <em>Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid</em> said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Transmitted by Ṭabarānī in al-Kabīr and in al-Awsaṭ and Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ is in the chain who was declared trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim, however he has weakness with him and the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ.”</em> (<em>Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid</em> (9:256-257), Cairo: Maktabah al-Quddūsī, 1414H:1994)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī narrates from Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ (<em>Kitāb al-Maʿrifah wal-Tārīkh</em> (3:513), Madīnah: Maktabah al-Dār, 1410H), <em>Mawḍeḥ al-Awhām al-Jamʿa waʿl Tafrīq</em> (2:96-97)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said he wrote narrations from 1,000 teachers and all of them were trustworthy as stated by Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr in his <em>Tahdhīb al-Tahdhīb</em> under the entry of Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān (<em>Tahdhīb al-Tahdhīb</em> 11:337 no.8138), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1415H/1994).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, this renders Rawhū to be trustworthy according to Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Aḥmad al-Ḥākim al-Kabīr brings his entry in his book of names and kunyahs, without any praise or criticism. (<em>Kitāb al-Asāmī wal-Kuna</em> (3:419 no.1637), Madīnah: Maktabah al-Ghurabāʿ al-Athariyyah, 1414H/1994)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy brings under Rawhū bin Ṣalāh’s entry says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Weak…. he does not have many ḥadīth narrated from (names of narrators) and some of them are rejected.” He also cites a few other reports under Rawhū’s biographical entry and says these two aḥadīth are unpreserved.”</em> (<em>al-Kāmil Fiʾl Duʿafaʾ al-Rijāl</em> (4:553-554 no.668), Riyādh: Maktabah al-Rushd, Edn. Māzin al-Sarsāwī)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy thus further indicates the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ by mentioning two unpreserved chains.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dāraquṭnī brings his entry in his book and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ bin Sayābah, he narrates from Ibn Lahiyyʿah and from al-Thawrī and others, he was weak in ḥadīth and he resided in Miṣr.”</em> (<em>al-Muʿtalif waʾl Mukhtalif </em>(3:1377), Beirut: Dār al-Gharb al-Islāmī, 1406H/1986)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Ḥāfiẓ al-Burqānī’s question to Imām al-Dāraquṭnī he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abuʾl Ḥasan (ie Imām Dāraquṭnī) said to me, I heard Abū Ṭālib say, the brother of Maymūn, his name was Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī, he was a resident of Miṣr, he said to me, “We are in agreement (ie the people of ḥadīth) that we do not write the ḥadīth of three people of Miṣr, (1) ʿAlī bin al-Ḥasan al-Sāmī (2) Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and (3) ʿAbd al-Munʿim bin Bashīr.”</em> (<em>Suwālāt Abī Bakr al-Burqānī lil-Dāraquṭnī Fī al-Jarḥ waʾl Taʿdīl</em> (p.56-57 no.18), Cairo: Maktabah al-Qurʿān, ?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Burqānī further said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“And then Abuʾl Ḥasan (ie Imām Dāraquṭnī) said to me, Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, he is also referred to as Rawhū bin Sayābah Miṣrī, likewise ʿAbd al-Munʿim Miṣrī and ʿAlī bin al-Ḥasan al-Sāmī Miṣrī.”</em> (<em>Suwālāt Abī Bakr al-Burqānī lil-Dāraquṭnī Fī al-Jarḥ waʾl Taʿdīl</em> (p.57)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people of a country know its people better, especially when it comes to praise and criticism and this is a general principle. Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī was given the title of al-Ḥāfiẓ and he was also a resident of Miṣr, the likes of Imām al-Ṭabarānī narrated from him. He died in the year 296H. (<em>Tārīkh Baghdād</em> (5:8).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is why Imām al-Dāraquṭnī specifically mentions Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī as a resident of Miṣr and he further emphasises this by mentioning the names of the three narrators and refers to them as al-Miṣrī. The affair of the other two narrators is very disparaging which gives us an indication of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ. (refer to the general books of Rijāl)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī brings his entry in his book on making distinctions between narrators without mentioning any praise or criticism and clarifies Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, is also Rawhū bin Sayābah al-Ḥarithī and then brings the statement of Imām al-Dāraquṭnī, where he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ bin Sayābah.”</em> (<em>Mawḍeḥ al-Awhām al-Jamʿa waʾl Tafrīq</em> (2:96-97) Beirut: Dār al-Fikr al-Islāmī, 1405H/1985)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Ḥibbān added his biographical note in his book of trustworthy narrators, he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, from the people of Miṣr, he narrates from Yaḥyā bin Ayūb and his countrymen and Muḥammad bin Ibrāhīm al-Bawshanjī narrates from him, he was from the people of Miṣr.”</em> (<em>Kitāb al-Thiqāt</em> (8:244), Hyderabād: Daʾirah al-Maʿārif al-Uthmāniyyah, 1393H/1973)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Sijzī asked Imām al-Ḥākim about him and he replied,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāh, trustworthy and safe, he was from the people of Shām.”</em> (<em>Suwālāt Masʿud bin ʿAlī al-Sijzī Maʿa Asilah al-Baghdadiyīn ʿAnn Aḥwāl al-Rūwāt Lil Ḥākim</em> (p.98 no.68), Beirut, Dār al-Gharb al-Islāmī, 1408H/1988)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Mākūlā after mentioning him says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ bin Sayābah, who narrates from Ibn Lahiyyʿah, al-Thawrī and others, he was declared weak in ḥadīth and was a resident of Miṣr.”</em> (<em>al-Ikmāl Fī Rafʿa al-Irtiyāb ʿAnn Muʿtalif Fī al-Asmā wal-Kunā waʾl-Ansāb</em> (5:15), Hyderabād: Daʾirah al-Maʿārif al-Uthmāniyyah, 1383H/1963)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The words of Imām Ibn Mākūlā, <em>“He was declared weak ie Ḍaʿfūhu.”</em> Indicates a number of scholars of Ḥadīth declared him to be weak and hence indicates a general agreement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-ʿAsqalānī said under his entry,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ibn ʿAdiyy weakened him, Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned him in his al-Thiqāt, al-Ḥākim said he was trustworthy and safe, Ibn Yūnus mentioned in Tārīkh al-Ghurabāʿ he was from the people of Moṣul and resided in Miṣr and they narrate from him, and narrations which are rejected have been transmitted from him (ie he would narrate rejected narrations). al-Dāraquṭnī said he was weak in ḥadīth.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We looked at the <em>Tārīkh al-Ghurabāʿ</em> of Ibn Yūnus and were unable to find his statement on Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, this does not indicate in any form that Ibn Ḥajr erred but rather that we were unable to find it, therefore, if anyone does find Ibn Yūnus’s statement please do inform us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī said in his biographical note on Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ibn ʿAdiyy weakened him, Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned him in his al-Thiqāt, al-Ḥākim said he was trustworthy and safe.”</em> (<em>Mizān al-ʿEitidāl</em> (3:87 no.2804), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1416H/1995)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In his reference work on the history of Islām, Imām al-Dhahabī includes an entry for him, after mentioning the people he narrated from as well as those who narrated from him, he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He has reprehensive (Manākīr-narrations), Ibn ʿAdiyy said he is weak, Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned him in his al-Thiqāt, he died in Ramaḍhān in Miṣr in (2)33H, he was from the last people who narrated from Musā, Yaḥyā and Saʿīd. al-Ḥākim said he was trustworthy and safe and a Shāmī.”</em> (<em>Tārīkh al-Islām wa Wafyāt al-Mashāhīr al-ʿAlām</em> (17:160-161 no.138), Beirut: Dār al-Kitāb al-ʿArabī, 1411H/1991)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr, Imām al-Dhahabī and others have taken al-Ḥākims view from al-Sijzī and mentioned it in their respective books. Likewise, it is possible that Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr also quoted the view of Ibn Yūnus from his <em>Tārīkh al-Ghurabāʿ.</em> The intent here is to show Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr in his <em>Lisān</em> takes the statement from the books of the earlier scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī further brings his entry in his book of weak and abandoned narrators.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also brings him in his other book on weak narrators, wherein he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ al-Miṣrī, he narrates from Ibn Lahiyyʿah, Ibn ʿAdiyy weakened him and he is also called Ibn Yasābah (this is a typo it should Sayābah).”</em> (<em>al-Mughnī Fiʾl Ḍuʿafāʾ</em> (1:356 no.2139), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1418H/1997), Edn.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn al-Jawzī has also classed him as a weak and abandoned narrator, he mentions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, or they say Rawhū bin Shibābah (it should be Sayābah), his kunyah is Abaʾl Ḥārith, he narrates from Ibn Lahiyyʿah, Ibn ʿAdiyy said he is weak.” </em>(<em>Kitāb al-Ḍuʿafāʾ wal-Matrūkīn </em>(1:287 no.1643), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah,?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Ḥāfiẓ Ibn al-Jawzī cites this report in his book of fabricated and weak narrations under the chapter of the virtues of Fātimah bint Asad, and then transmits it with his chain through to al-Ṭabarānī and thereafter says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>The author (ie referring to himself) says this is a lone report of Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ who is from the unknown narrators and furthermore, Ibn ʿAdiyy has declared him to be weak.”</em> (<em>al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Fīʾl Aḥadīth al-Wahiyyah</em> (1:268-269 no.433), Faiṣalabād: Idārah ʿUlūm al-Atharīyyah, 1399H/1979), Cf.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Dhahabī in his summary of the <em>al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Fīʾl Aḥadīth al-Wahiyyah </em>of Ḥāfiẓ Ibn al-Jawzī again grades Rawhū weak thus showing his consistency.

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ṭabāranī transmits in in his al-Awsaṭ p.356-357 part of the Majmaʿa al-Baḥrayn and he said, “no one has transmitted this from ʿĀṣim except Sufyān and it’s the lone report of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and it is mentioned in Majmaʿa 9:257 that Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is in the chain, who was declared trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim, however he has weakness in him and the rest of the narrators are the narrator of the Ṣaḥīḥ and Abū Nuʿaym also transmitted it from the author in al-Ḥilyah 3:121.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>My Shaykh (ie Shaykh al-Albānī) has challenged the statement of Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythami in his Silsilah Āḥadith al-Ḍaʿīfahʾ no.23, where he says in Majmaʿa the rest of the narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ, that Aḥmad bin Ḥamād (bin Zughbah), who although is in himself trustworthy the authors of the Ṣaḥīḥs have not transmitted from him as only al-Nasāʿī transmits from him.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ḥamdi ʿAbd al-Majīd al-Salafī answers the authentication of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“As for Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who has been declared to be trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and Hakim, then it is well known about both of them that they are mutasāhil ie lenient. He was declared to be weak by Ibn ʿAdiyy and Ibn Yūnus said he would narrate rejected narrations. Darāquṭnī said he is weak in Ḥadīth and Ibn Mākūlā weakened him and Ibn ʿAdiyy said after transmitting two of this ḥadīth he has many āḥadīth and some of them are abandoned.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Thus, this is detailed criticism from the specialist critical analysts, furthermore, his narrations are rejected and this is the case with this narration and when he is alone in reporting such ḥadīth they are rejected and cannot be used as evidence therefore, the ḥadīth is is weak.” </em>(<em>Muʿajam al-Kabīr</em> (24:351-352), Cairo: Maktabah Ibn Taymiyyah, 1415H/1994)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The verifier of <em>Majmaʿa al-Baḥrayn Fi Zawāʿid al-Muʿajamayn</em>, ʿAbd al-Quddus bin Muḥammad Naẓīr also declared the chain to be weak as well as the narrator Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ. (<em>Majmaʿa al-Baḥrayn</em> (6:361)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAbd Allah bin Ṣiddīq al-Ghumārī also acknowledges that Rawhū has some weakness with him and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū, his weakness is light.”</em> (<em>Ittihāf al-Azkiyaʾ Bijawāj al-Tawassul bil-Anbiyāʾ waʾl Awliyāʾ (p.11)</em> (?: ʾAlī Raḥmī, p.11) and (p.20) cited from <em>Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ</em> (p.146)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albānī also categorically grades it to be weak. He quotes the references first and then the chain followed by the words of Imām al-Ṭabarānī and Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythamī and then proceeds to answer al-Haythamī’s claim. We have quoted the words of Shaikh al-Albānī via the words of Shaikh Ḥamdī ʿAbd al-Majīd al-Salafī that only al-Nasāʿī transmits from Aḥmad bin Ḥamād bin Zughbah. Shaikh al-Albānī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“and his statement “the rest of the narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ” is highly disputable as Zugbah is not from the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ’s, rather they did not transmit from him except al-Nasāʿī, I say we know from this that he is in of himself trustworthy. What therefore remains is the affair of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, and he is a lone reporter as al-Ṭabarānī said and also what al-Haythamī mentions the authentication of Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim but his weakening (by al-Ṭabarānī) has precedence over their statements due to two issues. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The First:</em></strong><em> He is criticised and criticism takes precedence over praise with conditions. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The Second:</em></strong><em> Ibn Ḥibbān is lenient in his authentication of narrators and he has authenticated many narrators who are unknown to the extent that at times he clarifies he does not know who they are nor their fathers as Ibn ʿAbd al-Hādī has mentioned in al-Ṣārim al-Munkī. </em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albānī adds a footnote at this point and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have mentioned some examples (of Imām Ibn Ḥibbāns leniency) in ‘al-Radd ʿAla al-Taʿqub al-Ḥathīth (p.18-21) and then in the introduction of my book, ‘Taysīr Intifāʿ al-Khalān Bikitāb Thiqāt Ibn Ḥibbān’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albāni continues and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The affair is the same with al-Ḥākim and his lapses which are not hidden from the one who is well acquainted with biographies and narrators. Therefore, their statements do not hold weight when there are contradictions even when there is undetailed criticism and the reasons for the criticism is not mentioned but then how about the affair with Ibn Ṣalāḥ when the details are mentioned…”</em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then Shaikh al-Albānī then mentions the criticism and disparaging remarks of the scholars of ḥadīth which have preceded. He continues and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“You have seen how the Imams of criticism (Aiʿmah al-Jarḥ) are in agreement in their words in the weakening of this narrator and they clarify the reason for his weakness due to him narrating rejected reports. The same applies to this report in which he is alone in reporting and thus he is rejected and not used as evidence and therefore, no one is deceived by this praise and authentication except the ignorant or the one with other agenda’s.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>After what has preceded it is apparent to a fair minded person that when Shaikh Zāhid al-Kawtharī spoke about this ḥadīth he was not just with the knowledge of this science. He attempts to strengthen this ḥadīth and he only mentioned the praise and authentication of Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and totally failed to mention the criticism and disaparaging remarks which were greater than those who authenticated him. (Refer to (p.379) Maqalāt al-Kawtharī)</em> (<em>Silsilah Āḥadīth al-Ḍaʿīfahʾ</em> (1:79-82 no.23), Riyadh, Maktabah al-Māʿrif, 1412H/1992)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albāni continues and shows the contradictions of al-Kawtharī and his principles and takes charge of the claims, showing his double standards on the authentications of Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim. He also answers the claim the reason for the criticism is not mentioned and proceeds to mention the reasons. Shaikh Mamḥūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ despite his valiant digressive efforts fails to answer the reason for the criticism as he gracefully glosses over it in his <em>Rafʿ al-Minārah</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It must be noted Shaikh Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ’s response to Shaikh al-Albānī’s answer to this report are significantly inadequate and falls short of being even remotely convincing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albānī further answered some of their retorts and replied directly back to them in his book on Tawassul and went onto to say some of their points were laughable, he said after quoting the text of the ḥadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;al-Haythamī said in Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid (9:257) &#8220;al-Ṭabarānī reports it in al-Kabīr and Awsaṭ and it contains Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who is declared reliable by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim, but is somewhat weak. Then the rest of its narrators are those of the Ṣaḥīḥs.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>I say: by the way of Ṭabarānī it is reported in Abū Nuʿaym in Ḥilyahtul Awliyāʾ (3:121) and their chain of narration is weak since Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who is one its narrators is alone in narrating it as Abū Nuʿaym himself said. Then Rawhū is declared to be weak by Ibn ʿAdiyy, and Ibn Yūnus said, &#8220;Weak and reprehensible things are reported from him.&#8221;al-Dāraquṭnī said, &#8220;He is Ḍaʿīf (weak) in ḥadīth.&#8221; Ibn Mākūlā said, &#8220;They declare him weak.&#8221; Ibn ʿAdiyy said after quoting two of his ḥadīth, &#8220;He reports many Āḥadith and some of them are reprehensible.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So they agree upon his weakness, so the ḥadīth is weak ie munkar since he is alone in reporting it. There are some people who try to strengthen this ḥadīth based upon the declaration of Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim that Rawhū is reliable. However, this will not benefit them due to what is known with regard to their leniency in declaration of reliability.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So this saying of theirs when opposed by sayings of other scholars does not carry any weight even if the declaration of weakness by the other scholars is not explained, so how about when the reason for weakness is made clear as is the case here? I have also fully explained the weakness of this Ḥadīth in al-Ḍaʿīfah no.23 and so I will not repeat that here.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The antagonists whom we have indicated quote that which can only cause laughter, saying, &#8220;Shaikh Nāṣir judged it to be weak, so we ask that he tell us who from the scholars of ḥadīth has declared this ḥadīth to be weak.&#8221; We quoted those who declare its narrator Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ to be weak, and he is alone in reporting it. This automatically means weakness of the ḥadīth unless someone is found to report it along with him, and Abū Nuʿaym had denied that there is anyone supporting this narration, unless another narration of it is found, and that is not the case!</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Then they say, &#8220;Even if we accept that it is weak, then it is only slightly weak which would not prevent action upon it, since it is a case of acting on a ḥadīth whose weakness is not severe in that which relates to mere encouragement and warnings, which is allowed by the scholars of Ḥadīth and Fiqh.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>I say: there is no encouragement in this ḥadīth, nor does it explain some excellent for an action which is already established as being practised in the sharīʿah. Rather it is speaking about something which may be permissible or may not be permissible, therefore it is being used to establish a sharīʿah ruling, if it were authentic. Furthermore, these people are quoting it as a proof for this form of Tawassul about which there is disagreement. So when you accept its weakness then it is not permissible to use it as proof. I do not think any intelligent person would agree that it pertains tore encouragement and warnings. Rather this is the way of those who flee away from submission to the truth, they say things which no intelligent person would say.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tawassul: It&#8217;s Types and Its Rulings</em> (p.101-102) Eng.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr also said the same with almost identical words in <em>his al-Nukt ʿAla Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ</em> (1:275) as does Imām Ibn ʿAbd al-Hādī in his <em>Ṣārim al-Munkī</em> (p.256, 259)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Those Who Authenticated Rawhū in Ṣalāḥ and the Chain</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From those who have authenticated the chain are,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-Haythamī wherein he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>Narrated by al-Ṭabarānī with a good chain…”</em> (<em>Ḥāshiyyah al-ʿAllāmah Ibn Ḥajr al-Haythamī ʿAla Sharḥ al-Ayḍaḥ Fi Manāsik al-Ḥajj Lil Imām al-Nawawī</em> (p.500), Beirut: Dar al-Ḥadīth, ?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said the same in his <em>al-Jawhar al-Munaẓẓam Fī Ziyārah al-Qabr al-Sharīf al-Nabawī al-Mukarram</em> (p.110-111), Cairo: Maktabah Madbūlī, 2000)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An infamous writer Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed has alleged, <em>‘Imām al-Samhūdī in his Khulaṣatul Wafāʾ bi-Akhbār Dār al-Muṣtafā has apparently mentioned that this Ḥadīth has a Jayyid Sanad.’ </em>However, al-Samhūdī said the opposite, wherein he asserts and acknowledges weakness in the chain as is evident from his words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Samhūdī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Transmitted in al-Kabīr and Awsaṭ with a chain containing Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who was declared trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim however he has weakness whereas the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ.”</em> (<em>Wafāʾ al-Wafā Biakhbār Dār al-Muṣtafā</em> (3:898-899), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1404H/1984), Cf. <em>Khulāṣah al-Wafā Biakhbār Dār al-Muṣtafā</em> (p.421), Madīnah: al-Maktabah al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1392H/1972), another edition (2:369), Dr. Muḥammad al-Āmīn)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">None of the earlier scholars authenticated the chain except the later ones as mentioned above and they were from the 8th-9th century. This authentication of the later scholars has to be scrutinised and investigated before it is taken as accepted. Even this in the current state only leaves the view of Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-Haythamī to be investigated as Ḥāfiẓ Samhūdī pointed to its weakness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Naturally al-Kawtharī cites the significant words of this report and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The narrators of this ḥadīth are trustworthy except Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and al-Ḥākim said he was trustworthy and safe and Ibn Ḥibbān brings his entry in his al-Thiqāt.” </em>(<em>Maḥqū al-Taqawwūl Fī Masalāḥ al-Tawassūl</em> (p.4), Cairo: al-Maktabah al-Azhariyyah lit-Turāth, 2006), also from <em>Maqalāt al-Kawtharī</em> (p.340), Cairo: Maktabah al-Tawfiqia, ?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, al-Kawtharī himself acknowledges the leniency of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim in the same book <em>al-Maqalāt</em> as mentioned by Imām al-Albānī in <em>Silsilah al-Ḍaʿīfahʾ</em> (1:81), yet here they take and accept the same leniency as evidence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad ibn ʿAlawī al-Malikī quotes it in his book and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is a difference of opinion regarding one of the narrators, Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ, however Ibn Ḥibbān mentions him in his al-Thiqāt and al-Ḥākim said he was safe and trustworthy. So both of them, the two Ḥāfiẓs authenticated the ḥadīth. Likewise al-Haythamī followed up on this in (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid) and said Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is in the chain, Ibn Ḥibbān declared him to be trustworthy as did al-Ḥākim, however, he has some weakness and the remaining narrators are the narrator of the Ṣaḥīḥs.”</em> (<em>Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ</em> (p.146), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1430H/2009)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamdūḥ does the same and claims the narration is Ḥasan. He also quotes the statements of the scholars as we have mentioned above. He says the scholars have differed over Rawhū, some have said he is weak and others have declared him trustworthy. (<em>Rafʿ ul-Minārah Li-Takhrīj Aḥadīth al-Tawassul wal-Ziyārah</em> (p.147-148), Cairo, Maktabah al-Azhariyyah Lit-Turāth, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʿIsā Himyarī jubilantly went on to assert the Ḥadīth is Ṣaḥīḥ ie authentic according to the conditions of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim and Ḥasan according to the conditions of others. (<em>al-Tāʾmul Fī Ḥaqīqah al-Tawassul</em>, p.214-215)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a little imaginative of Himyarī to say the ḥadīth is authentic according to the condition of both Imām Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">G.F. Ḥaddād has also attempted to authenticate this report while relying on the works of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ and Muḥammad bin ʿAlawī al-Malikī. He pushes the line of argument of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ that the criticism is undetailed which is laughable as we have shown in this discourse. The Sūfī Aḥmad Daḥlān has also attempted to authenticate this report as does al-Ḥabīb al-Jifrī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The central argument of the detractors is that Rawhū is differed over and that the criticism levied against him is not detailed but rather general and therefore we take the general praise and authentication of him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and accepted by the detractors themselves that Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim are both mutāsahil ie lenient with their gradings and authentication. It does not make sense for them to accept this and leave the criticism. They couple this argument with the fact the criticism and discrediting is undetailed and vague, therefore one retorts to the position of praise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This has been answered by Shaikh al-Albānī and the scholars before him wherein he mentions the reasons Rawhū is weak. The main reason being he would narrate rejected narrations and that his narrations were rejected themselves. At times he would be a lone reporter of narration without any support.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAmr bin ʿAbd al-Munʿim explains that Imāms al-Ṭabarānī, Abū Nuʿaym and Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythamī have all declared this to be a lone report of Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and none of the other students and companions of Sufyān narrates this from except Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and these other students of Sufyān were memorisers and trustworthy narrators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Imām Ibn Ḥibbān citing Rawhū in his <em>al-Thiqat</em>, it is not tantamount to trustworthiness as he is known to be lenient ie Mutasāhil. Whatever he mentions under his entry in his <em>al-Thiqāt</em> does not clarify the affair of Rawhū except that it is information as we have shown under his entry, which has preceded. Rather we find this entry alludes to all of his narrations being of the rejected type.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is because Imām Ibn Ḥibbān in his entry states he narrates from the people of Misr and the people of Miṣr narrate from him, however in this report Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ narrates from Sufyān al-Thawrī, who was not from the people of Miṣr, therefore this alludes to it being strange and odd as Abū Nuʿaym has highlighted with his words when he said, <em>“It is Gharīb from the ḥadīth of ʿĀṣim and al-Thawrī and we do not write it except it being the lone report of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Ḥākim is even more lenient than Imām Ibn Ḥibbān, ie more mutasāhil, as al-Suyūṭī has quoted from Ḥāfiẓ al-ʿIrāqī who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Ḥākim is more lenient than him (ie Ibn Ḥibbān</em>)” (<em>al-Tadrīb al-Rāwī</em> (1:108)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAmr bin ʿAbd al-Munʿim goes into detail answering the authentication of Imām al-Ḥākim and answers Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ’s discussion on the validity of al-Ḥākim’s statement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān’s authentication. This is also inaccurate and needs investigation, in fact such a point is rejected. Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr quotes the statement of Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī that he wrote narrations from 1,000 teachers from Ḥāfiẓ al-Mizzī’s <em>Tahdhīb al-Kamāl </em>(23:324).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Dhahabī rejects this assertion and claims and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I say he does not have that many teachers except roughly about 300, so where are the remainder? And the ones which are mentioned a group (of scholars) have weakened them.”</em> (<em>Siyar ʿAlām al-Nabulāʾ</em> (13:181)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Summarised from ʿAmr ʿAbd al-Munʿim Salīm’s, <em>Hadmul Minārah Liman Ṣaḥḥaḥa Āḥadīth al-Tawassul wal-Ziyārah</em> (p.126-134), Ṭanṭā: Dār ul-Dhiyāʿ, 1422H/2001)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Fawzān bin Sābiq bin Fawzān al-Fawzān (d.1373H) also weakened Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and this report. (<em>al-Bayān waʾl Ishār Likashf Zaig al-Mulḥid al-Hāj Mukhtār</em> (p.363), Beirut, Dār al-Gharb al-Islāmī, 1422H/2001)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muqbil also alludes to Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ being weak in his checking of the narrators in <em>Sunan al-Dāraquṭnī</em>. (<em>Tarājim Rijāl al-Dāraquṭnī Fi Sunan</em> (1:225 no.550), Ṣanʿa, Dār al-Athār, 1420H/1999)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair ʿAlī Zaʾī graded the report to weak on account of the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ according to the scholars of Ḥadīth. He also argued, even if he was authentic the second problem is the tadlīs of Sufyān al-Thawrī. Shaikh Zubair said seven scholars of Ḥadīth classed Rawhū to be weak,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Ibn ʿAdiyy, (2) Ibn Yūnus, (3) al-Dāraquṭnī, (4) Ibn Mākūlā, (5) al-Dhahabī, (6) Ibn al-Jawzī, (7) Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah al-Baghdādī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān, al-Ḥākim authenticated him and Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī narrated from him. These three authentications are rejected based on the criticism of the majority of the scholars of ḥadīth. (<em>al-Ḥadīth no.76, Ramaḍḥān 1431H/September 2010, p.9-12).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, rather it is argued there is only actually one scholar who praised him and that is Imām al-Ḥākim with two words of <em>Thiqah al-Māmūn</em> and therefore holding onto just the words of al-Ḥākim, whose authentication is known to be unreliable.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imām Ibn Ḥibbān&#8217;s Authentication of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The detractors rely on the alleged authentication of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān, that he entered Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ in his <em>al-Thiqāt</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Firstly:</strong> We have shown and mentioned from the words of the scholars it is generally well known that Imām Ibn Ḥibbān was lenient in his gradings, and even the detractors have admitted and accepted this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> Imām Ibn Ḥibbān renders this report to be weak on account of saying Rawhū only narrated from the people of Miṣr, where as in this narration he narrates from Sufyān, who was a Kūfan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> Imām Ibn Ḥibbān entering Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ in his <em>al-Thiqat</em> does not necessitate he did not have reprehensive weak and or rejected narrations. This is because Imām Ibn Ḥibbān includes other narrators who have reprehensible and rejected narrations in the same book. For example, he includes Muḥammad bin ʿAbd Allāh bin ʿAmr in his <em>al-Thiqāt</em> and says about him that some of his Āḥadīth are manākīr ie of the reprehensible rejected type. (<em>al-Thiqāt</em> (7:417)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Leniency &#8211; Tasāhul of Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The statement of Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭī quoting Ḥāfiẓ al-ʿIrāqī has preceded where both Imams Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim were declared to be lenient as quoted by Shaikh ʿAmr bin ʿAbd al-Munʿim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Dhahabī is also of the view that Imām al-Ḥākim was lenient. (<em>Zikr Man Yuʿtamad Qawlihi Fiʾl Jarḥ wat Taʿdīl</em> (p.159) Cf. <em>al-Muwaʿqizah</em> (p.83)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Sakhawī also categorises Imām al-Hākim to be lenient. (<em>al-ʿAlān Bil-Tawbih Liman Zam al-Tārīkh</em> (p.168), <em>al-Mutakallimūn Fiʾl Rijāl</em> (p.137)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAbd al-Rahman Yahyā al-Muʿallamī al-Yamānī outlined the methodology of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and his categorisation of trustworthy narrators and those who he includes in his book, amongst them are those who are unknown ie majhul, because they do not fit the other categories. (<em>al-Tankīl Bimā Fī Ṭanīb al-Kawtharī Min al-Abāṭīl</em> (1:437-438 no.199)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The detractors have again themselves admitted and clearly acknowledged in their various writings that both Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim are lenient and mutasāhil. For example, Muḥammad Zāhid al-Kawtharī has admitted this himself in his <em>Maqalāt </em>(p.185) as mentioned by Shaikh al-Albānī in his <em>Silsilah aḤadīth al-Ḍaʿīfahʾ</em> (1:81).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Regarding another ḥadīth and the narrator contained, Shaikh al-Albānī quotes Muḥammad Zāhid al-Kawtharī as saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Yes Imām Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned him in his al-Thiqāt however his method in al-Thiqāt is that he mentions narrators in it when he is unaware of any criticism against them but this does not take them out of the condition in being unknown according to the other scholars and thus Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr has refuted Imām Ibn Ḥibbān&#8217;s inconsistencies in his Lisān al-Mizān.”</em> (<em>Maqalāt</em> (p.309)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>I say: we find the madhab from the words of al-Kawtharī, which is, that he does not rely on the authentication of Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim because both of them are lenient ie mutasāhil. Therefore, how is that he can declare the ḥadith under discussion to be authentic and he does this just on the basis of them authenticating Rawhū ibn Ṣalāh, especially since others who are more knowledgable than them in terms of narrators declare him weak.”</em> (<em>Silsilah Āḥadīth al-Daʿīfahʾ</em> (1:82)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ẓafar Aḥmad Uthmānī has also categorised Imām al-Ḥākim as being lenient in two of his works. (<em>Iʿla al-Sunan</em> (2:107), <em>Qawaʾid ʿUlūm al-Ḥadīth</em> (p.189)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So they apply the rule when it suits their needs and desires while rejecting and overlooking it when it does not serve their intent and purposes in promoting the incorrect type of Tawassul and Wasīlah. Shaikh al-Albānī has yet again highlighted their inconsistencies and discrepancies while they play non the wiser card.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muḥibullāh Shāh al-Rāshidī al-Sindhī has also indicated the leniency of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/imam-ibn-hibban-was-he-strict-or-lenient-in-grading-narrators-shaikh-muhibullah-shah-rashidi-al-sindhi-1415h/"><strong>SEE HERE</strong></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muḥammad Bashīr Sehaswānī also discusses the narration and we conclude with his words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We find that Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is in the chain who is weak. He was declared to be weak by Ibn ʿAdiyy and according to Sakhawī he was of the intermediate level of criticised narrators. There is no reliance on Ibn Ḥibbān mentioning him in his al-Thiqāt because he is well known to authenticate unknown narrators which we have already mentioned from Mizān al-ʿEitidāl. Likewise, al-Ḥākim’s lone authentication is also unworthy to be relied upon as he is from the lenient ones.”</em> (<em>Ṣiyānatul Insān ʿAnn Waswasah al-Shaikh Daḥlān </em>(p.132)</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> The Report has a Broken or Disconnected Chain ie inqitʿa.</strong></span></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ hearing this report from Sufyān al-Thawrī is suspect and questionable from two separate indicative factors, both of which allude to Rawhū not hearing or even meeting Sufyān al-Thawrī let alone reporting this narration.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Indicative Factor &#8211; Timeline</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The time difference between Sufyān’s death and Rawhū’s is contentious. Sufyān died according to most reports in 161H and Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ died in 233H (<em>Lisān al-Mizān</em> (2:540), <em>Mizān al-ʿEitidāl </em>(3:87), <em>Tārīkh al-Islām</em> (17:161 no.138)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, there is a difference of approximately 72-73 years between their deaths and if Rawhū heard this report from Sufyān, he would have least been 16-20 years old making his birth date approximately 141-145H, taking Rawhū’s age to the late 80’s and early 90’s. It would also lead to the idea of Rawhū hearing from Sufyān al-Thawri during his later life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This should also be coupled with the fact that Sufyān al-Thawrī was a Mudallis. It is known that Imām, ʿAmīr al-Muʿminin Fil-Ḥadīth, al-Hujjah, al-ʿAbid, Sufyān al-Thawrī was an Imām of Ahl al-Sunnah and a preserver of ḥadīth of the highest level yet still he was a mudallis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Sufyān would to tadlīs from weak narrators.”</em> (<em>Mizān ul-ʿEitidal</em> (2:169), <em>Siyar ʿAlām an-Nabulāʾ </em>(7:242, 7:274).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr also said he was a mudallis. (<em>Ṭabaqāt al-Mudallisīn</em> (p.32 no.51) and <em>Taqrīb ut-Tahdhīb</em> (no.2458 pg.394) in another ed. (p.197), <em>an-Nukt</em> (2/621), <em>Irshād al-Sārī</em> (1:286)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām ʿAbdullāh ibn al-Mubārak also said Sufyān al-Thawrī would do tadlīs. (<em>Tahdhīb ut-Tahdhīb</em> (4/102)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Rajab                  (<em>Sharḥ ʿEllal at-Tirmidhī</em> (1:358)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nawawī and Suyūṭī (<em>Tadrīb ar-Rāwī Sharḥ Taqrīb</em> (1:263) in another ed. (1:230)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Indicative Factor – Country</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rawhū could not have heard from Sufyān al-Thawrī because Rawhū only narrated from the people Miṣr and only they narrated from him, whereas Imām Sufyān was from Kūfah! Remember Imām Ibn Ḥibbān said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, from the people of Miṣr, he narrates from Yaḥyā bin Ayūb and his countrymen and Muḥammad bin Ibrāhīm al-Bawshanjī narrates from him, he was from the people of Miṣr.”</em> (<em>al-Thiqāt</em> (8:244)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the other scholars have also alluded to Rawhū only narrating from the people of Miṣr, like Ibn Yūnus, Ibn Mākūlā and al-Dāraquṭnī. These two important factors further indicate the weakness of this report based on the chain and the narrator. Furthermore, Ḥāfiẓ al-Mizzī brings a detailed entry of Sufyān al-Thawrī and lists all the people who narrated from him without mentioning Rawhū as his student or from the people who narrated from Sufyān. (<em>Tahdhīb al-Kamāl Fī Asmāʿ al-Rijāl</em> (11:161-164 no.2407), Beirut, Muassisah al-Risālah, 1408H/1987)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It can be argued with regards to the first point, that the meeting between Rawhū and Sufyān is still possible, however based on general norms it seems highly unlikely, norms like lifespans, travelling to different lands, possible meetings etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If someone says the Imāms have mentioned Rawhū narrates from Sufyān, then we say they have mentioned this based on the chains of narration or transmission of reports where Rawhū reports on Sufyān’s authority, it does not however make this a reality or fact.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>BENEFIT &#8211; Revisiting Imām Ibn Ḥibbān’s Authentication</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is highly pertinent to mention according to Imām Ibn Ḥibbān’s own statement in his <em>al-Thiqāt,</em> he himself renders this report to be weak due to Rawhū narrating from Sufyān, who was from Kūfa, so how can they present his authentication.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Matters of belief are not accepted if they are lone reports according to the principles of the detractors. The Ḥanafī madhab, the Ashʿarī’s and Maturidī’s.</strong></span></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no other option but to accept that this report is a single lone narration of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ based on the clarifications and elucidations of the scholars of Ḥadīth from the likes of Imām al-Ṭabarānī, Ḥāfiẓ Abū Nuʿaym and Ḥāfiẓ Nūr al-Dīn al-Haythamī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The principle of the detractors whether Ḥanafī, Ashʿarī or Matūridī is that lone reports ie Khabar al-Ahād are not aceepted in matters of creed and Imān because for them matters of belief must be based on certainty and therefore issues that are in relation to belief and disbelief cannot be established by Aḥād or single lone reports. One can refer to <em>Usūl Sarkhasī</em> (p.116), <em>Fawātih al-Rahmūt</em> (2:136) and other general book on Ḥanafi ʿUsūl.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The antagonists present this report as an evidence for Tawassul and since it is related to matters of belief and Imān, it is imperative that it must be mutawatir and not Khabr al-Aḥād in order for them to accept it.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Other Chains for this report</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad ʿAlawī al-Malikī and others have mentioned other reports which differ in the wording, whilst some of them do not even mention the the words the detractors attempt to prove their belief system from. All of these other narrations are either weak, with weak and unknown narrators or the chains are unconnected and are mursal. G.F. Haddād has also admitted some of these reports do not contain the contentious words.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answering the Fallacious Claim of Necrophilia</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ignorant people of other faiths, in their emotionally filled rants and outbursts against Islām allege the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) slept with the body of Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha based on the wording of this ḥadīth. Such horrible claims are often regurgitated by people who follow and believe in Christianity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an outright lie and a desperate attempt to discredit Islām, such claims are often raised by people who have not read anything about Islām and rather just take some information from websites, who extend most of their efforts to concoct fallacious allegations against Islām.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treacherous claim rests on the words  فاضطجع  They claim the word means to sleep, lay down ie he lay down with Fātimah bint Asad to have sex with her and this Arabic word is often used to denote to lie down and sleep with someone. We seek refuge in Allāh from such lies and aspersions. Āmīn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Firstly:</strong>  we have shown this ḥadīth is weak in the preceding discourse, but let’s assume for arguments sake that it was authentic, then;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> The word اضطجع means to lie, lie down, recline, repose and sleep according to the well known Arabic dictionaries. It does not mean to sleep or to lay down for sex. This is also the word the Christians use in their Arabic translation of the Bible. Hence, they say وَدَخَلَ أَلِيشَعُ الْبَيْتَ وَإِذَا بِالصَّبِيِّ مَيْتٌ وَمُضْطَجعٌ عَلَى سَرِيرِهِ. [<em>And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed</em>. (2Kings 4:32) Kings James Version).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So one asks, does the word laid here also mean, ‘lay to have sex?’ Of course it does not! Then why is this meaning specified and restricted to the ḥadīth only.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> the wording of the ḥadīth clearly mentions the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) entered the grave after it was dug and the body of Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha had not been lowered into the grave. The Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) lay in the grave after it was dug by his companions. The grave had a Laḥd, which is a horizontal opening in the vertically dug grave. The Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) also dug the grave and the Laḥd after which he lay in it. Thereafter, he stood up and eventually the body was lowered into the grave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should therefore be noted; the body was lowered into the grave after he stood up &#8211; the body was not even in the grave when he was lying down in it! What kind of necrophilia was this? We presume the claimants can further shed some light on this matter, for the claimants are likely to know the reality and details of necrophilia the best, perhaps from experience in the modern Christian atheistic world, because surely one only accuses others of things they have experience, practice and knowledge about.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask again? How is the alleged incident even possible when the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) did not even lie next to the body, unless the detractors have developed other forms of sex!!! Again, this would not be surprising because this is what happens when you abandon your scriptures by distorting the divine message they contained.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The wording of the report further shows the great care and love the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) had for Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha, the alleged wording says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>When camphor water was brought, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) poured some water into his hands. Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) took off his shirt and clothed her with it and used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This showed the love and care the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) had for her due to her status. The detractors show more affection and care for animals and dogs and regularly bathe them, how about Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha, who was his paternal aunt and looked after him just like his mother! At what expense is the human mind and intelligence being carelessly wasted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fourthly:</strong> another indication which shows the futility of this repulsive allegation is the fact that the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) used his shirt and wrapped it around her and then used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin, the words are,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>“Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) took off his shirt and clothed her with it and used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again, a sane, upright and normal human being asks, why would a person use their own shirt to wrap the corpse of his paternal aunt &#8211; a mother like figure, then use his own sheets as her coffin, then dig her grave with his own hands, then lie in her grave and supplicate to the creator to forgive and have mercy on her (allegedly as the ḥadīth is weak), then to have her lowered in the grave, then unfasten the coffin sheets and shirt and then indulge in necrophilia? Absolutely preposterous!   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like to exercise our common sense by using our brains and minds, given to us by our creator and ask, what were the other companions doing during this incident of necrophilia? Why do this in the grave and not on the ground if they were looking?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people have no idea about the stature, uprightness and credibility of the illustrious companions, that they would allow someone to do such a heinous act in front of them. The companions were powerful, they were Ūsāmah bin Zayd, Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī, ʿUmar bin al-Khaṭṭāb and the Abyssinian companion, May Allāh be pleased with all of them. Who does not know the lofty credentials of ʿUmar bin al-Khaṭṭāb, that even satan was forced to change paths when he would see him due to his, principles, morals, standards, character and firm belief. That the likes of these companions just stood there and watched this evil incident to unfold.       </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fifthly:</strong> the detractors should know in Islām purification and cleanliness play a pivotal role in the daily life of Muslims. For example, Muslims are instructed to hold their private parts with their left hand because they have been instructed to eat with their right. They are instructed to sit down while relieving themselves, they are instructed to protect themselves and their clothes from urine and faeces, they are instructed to clean themselves with water, they are instructed to wash their hands everytime they relieve themselves, they are instructed to conceal their private parts from others and much more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muslims were given these instructions by the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam), whose words in the Religion are taken as divine texts, ie from the Prophetic Ḥadīth. This said, the rules, regulations and etiquettes for sexual intercourse between legally married partners in Islām require a greater level of purification and cleanliness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being, on another occasion the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) asked his companions to help lower a body into a grave, and he asked them if any of them were in a state of sexual impurity, ie if they had spent the night with their lawful wives. One of the companion who was in a state of sexual impurity was asked not to help in lowering the body (Bukhārī).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This honours the deceased, ie the people who help lower the deceaseds body are in a state of ritual purity and clean. So when a person is in a state of sexual impurity and he is not allowed to partake in lowering the deceased, then how about the act of sexual intercourse with a corpse! Let alone the rules and regulations Muslims have when it comes to intimacy and intercourse.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We mentioned examples of how Muslims uphold purification and cleanliness while relieving themselves and at the same token the clever people who regurgitate these treacherous lies about the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallm), are the same people who do not even wash their hands when they go to the toilet, they have cascades of urine droplets on their clothes and toilet seats. They are the same people who would not bathe for weeks, just less than 100 years and when they would bathe, the whole family would use the water, whereas our glorious Prophetic Divine teachings go back 1400 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is absolutely absurd and a despicable aspersion to even suggest this notion of necrophilia, which is an outright treacherous lie.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have shown this ḥadīth is weak and to use it to prove and argue impermissible tawassul is incorrect, contrary to the authentic evidences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By the two weak slaves of Allāh,</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many Sufi writers, whether they belong to the Ashari and maturidi theological rhetoric school of thought or whether they belong to the two sub continent sects of Deoband or Barelwi, all utilise and use the incident and the story of the people of the cave to either justify their impermissible tawassul and wasilah or they incorrectly deduce from the ayah in Surah Kahf the permissibility of buildings structures over graves and in turn this leading to shirk and grave worship and also relic worship. They further interpret this ayah and use it is a their most convincing argument to establish the permissibility of building domes over graves, relics and religious holy sites and thus arguing existence of the Green dome as well other mausoleums and shrines. These such shrines and tombs are widespread in the muslims lands and are commonly known as darbars or dargahs in the sub continent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These Sufi&#8217;s argue based on ayah 21 from Surah al-Kahf (18)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png"><img class=" wp-image-7473 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?resize=548%2C210" alt="18_21" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?resize=300%2C115 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?resize=768%2C294 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?resize=1024%2C392 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?w=1350 1350w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?w=1236 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;And thus We made their case known (to the people), that they might know that the Promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour. (Remember) when they (the people of the city) disputed among themselves about their case, they said: &#8220;Construct a building over them; their Lord knows best about them;&#8221; (then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): &#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong><strong>Surah al-Kahf (18):21</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sufi Barelwi churchfather and the student of the students of Ahmad Raza Khan, Mufti Ahmad Yar Khan Naeemi (d.1391H) said in his acclaimed book amongst his sufi followers says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Construction of some buildings near or in the vicinity of the grave of the common muslims is no doubt forbidden, but it is allowed (jaiz) in the case of islamic scholars and expert theologians&#8230;.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">he goes onto say</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is Jaiz (permissible) to construct a building near or around the shrines of illustrious &#8216;Mashaikh,&#8217; Aulia and Islamic scholars. Its justification is found in the ayah of the Holy Quran, the deeds of the Sahabah and the common Muslims and the sayings of the scholars. The holy Quran, while describing the event of Ashab-e-Kahaf (and then mentions the ayah above)&#8230;&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then goes onto bring the explanation of Ismail Haqqi (1127H) a Sufi of the Naqshabandi order from his <em>Tafsir Ruh al-Bayan</em>, the avid reader can refer to it or from the works of Naeemi. Ahmad Yar Khan Naeemi goes onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Holy Quran has mentioned two things of these people: (1) to hold mutual consultation about building a shrine and making a dome around the As-hab-e-Kahaf. (2) constructing a masjid near them, denying nothing which shows that these two actions were lawful in the past and are also lawful even today as is proved by the book of principles.&#8221;</em> (Ja&#8217;a al-Haq (p.328-329 Eng Tran. p.279-280 Urdu)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we can see the Sufi Barelwis and their compatriots have misconstrued this ayah to establish the permissibility of making structures, shrines, tombs and even mosques/masjids over graves when the reality is far from this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first thing to understand in this regard is, and numerous Imams of the Salaf have mentioned this, the people of the time denied the hereafter and that they would be raised again. Ikrimah mentions some people from amongst them claimed only the souls will be raised again without the bodies. (<em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> 3:747, <em>Tafsir al-Tabari</em> 15:270-271, <em>Tarikh Tabari</em> 2:46)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Qurtubi mentions something similar, that there was a righteous ruler at the time and some people differed concerning the raising of the soul and body. Some people became doubtful and denied the raising of the body and claimed only the souls will be raised while the earth will consume the bodies. Others argued and said both the body and soul will be raised. This became a difficult matter for the King to answer, who later spent time pondering the answer until the incident of the people of the cave. (<em>Tafsir Qurtubi</em> 10:380, see also <em>Mukhtasar Tafsir al-Qurtubi</em> 2:313)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Meaning of Masjid in the Ayah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr clarifies the meaning of masjid in the ayah and brings the statement of the illustrious companion and explainer of the Quran, Abdullah ibn Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The people said honour your brothers, so the people after thinking and pondering  said we will make a masjid over them. Then they began praying over them, seeking forgiveness for them and supplicating for them.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tagliq al-ta&#8217;liq</em> 4:264)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So here, praying over them refers to praying their funeral prayer which is further evidenced by the fact that they supplicated for them and asked Allah for forgive them. There is no mention of erecting ornate structures, shrines, tombs, mausoleums, darbars etc and certainly making a masjid over their grave so that people continue to pray over them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the explanations of this ayah by the various explainers of the Quran who use the word masjid in this context is solely and mainly praying the funeral prayer of the people of the cave, seeking forgiveness and supplicating for them. The Sufis cite the words of Fakhar al-Din al-Razi who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Some people said that the door of the cave should be closed so that nobody can enter it and the affair of the People of the cave are hidden. Some said that It is better to build a masjid at the door, this saying proves that these people were righteous people of Allah who wanted to worship him and offer their prayers.&#8221; </em>(Tafsir al-Kabir 5:75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fakhr al-Din al-Razi also said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><b>&#8220;</b>And when Allah said <b>&#8220;</b>Those who prevailed over their affair<b>&#8220;</b> this refers to the leader of the Muslims or the friends of Ashab al-Kahf or the leaders of town. <b>&#8220;</b>We will surely build a masjid over them<b>&#8220;</b> so that we can worship Allah in it and preserve the affairs or affect of the people of the cave with the masjid.&#8221;</em> (Tafsir al-Kabir 5:475]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again this refers to the funeral prayer and also to make a masjid to preserve their &#8216;Athar&#8217; which can be understood as their affair or their affect meaning their worship of Allah and singling him out as one and his Tawhid. This is the message of the people of the cave, the Tawhid of Allah The Mighty and Majestic. This is what the leaders and the people wanted to preserve and even if this is understood as a masjid, they wanted to preserve their effect i.e. the worship of Allah. It is not how the sufi barelwis project in the building of structures riddled with shirk and bidah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti and al-Mahalli said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>&#8220;</strong>They were disputing<b>&#8220;</b> That is, the believers and the disbelievers, <b>&#8220;</b>among themselves their affair<b>&#8220;</b> i.e. the affair of the youths, with regard to building something around them; <b>&#8220;</b>so they<b>&#8220;</b>, the disbelievers, said, <b>&#8220;</b>Build over them<b>&#8220;</b> that is, around them, <b>&#8220;</b>a building&#8221; to cover them up; &#8220;their Lord knows them best.’ Those who prevailed regarding their affair&#8221; i.e. the affair of the youths, “i.e. the believers &#8221; &#8220;We will verily set up over them) around them &#8220;a Masjid&#8221; for prayers to be performed therein. And this indeed took place at the entrance of the cave.&#8221;</em> (Tafsir al Jalalyn 2:4)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti further said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Imam Ibn Abi Hatim narrates from Suddi, the kind go the country called the religious leaders of his nation and consulted them concerning the affair of the people of the cave. The King was known as Decius and the youth of the cave had gone missing during his era and he had written their names on a tablet on the city gates. (When the youth returned to buy something) they read the names and it was the same people. The king was happy as these people who he though had died were in actual fact alive and then it became well known among the people that Allah had raised the dead from the living. The King said he would make a place of worship near their graves and I will continue worshipping Allah in it until I die. Abdur Razzaq and Ibn Abi Hatim transmit that Qatdaah said, &#8220;<strong>those who won their point said..&#8221; </strong>this refers to their rulers and leaders. Ibn Abi Hatim transmits from Sa&#8217;id ibn Jubayr who said the King made a church over the graves and wrote Ibna al-Arakanah, Ibna al-Dahqin.&#8221;</em>  (<em>Tafsir Dar al-Manthur</em> 4:569-570)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows they never built anything on the cave or over the graves but rather a masjid at the entrance, therefore, using this as an evidence to make mosques over graves is incorrect and a wrong understanding.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Tabari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Mushrikeen said: We will build a building over it and worship Allah in it but the Muslims said: We have more right over them and we will surely build a mosque so that we can pray there and worship Allah.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tafsir at-Tabari</em> 15:149)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Qurtubi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The view of the majority is the height from which a grave it is to be lowered which is higher than a handspan. The height to keep is for it to be recognised and for it to be respected (as in not walked over as flat earth). This is the situation with the grave of our Prophet Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and both of his companions.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tafsir Qurtubi</em> 10:380)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also says something very similar and along the same lines in his book al-Tazkirrah (p.86)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Qurtubi further explains it was the reign of Decius in which the youth went missing, he had the names written down and in the later generations when they returned to buy something from the city, the ruler at the time was righteous and pious etc. Imam Qurtubi further mentions the ruler said we will build a structure to remember them by. The people on the religion of the youth said make a masjid and the unbelievers said we will makee our place of worship or a resting place over them. The Muslims objected and said we will make a masjid. When some of the people went to the cave they noticed the cave had closed and the people had vanished. According to a report of Abdullah ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) Allah concealed their affair from the people, hence the ruler suggested making a a structure to remember them by. (<em>Tafsir Qurtubi</em> 10:380, al-<em>Maharrar al-wajiz</em> 3:507)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then Imam Qurtubi goes on to cite many narrations in the prohibition of making masjids and places of worship over graves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Kathir and Imam Tabari mentions when one of them returned to the city to buy some food, things had change and so had his money. Once they find out things were not adding up they presented him to the ruler, the roman ruler, Decius. Then Decius and the people followed the person to the cave and he entered the cave himself first. (<em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> 3:747, <em>Tafsir al-Tabari</em> 15:271).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Kathir goes on to say it is not know how he entered the cave or what happened thereafter. Another view was, the ruler was Theodosius, who was a believer, who also entered the cave and embraced the people. They later left and the people of the cave went back to sleep and eventually died. (<em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> 3:747-748, <em>Tafsir al-Tabari</em> 15:277 and <em>Tarikh Tabari</em> 2:46)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Kathir further mentions the people were leaders and people of influence or suggested the idea of building a structure over or near their graves however the questions is, were they such and worthy to be followed. Therefore it is very questionable for them to be followed in this because the Messenger of Allah ﷺ cursed the jews and christians for making places of worship on the graves of their prophets. (<em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> 3:747-748)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are other similar sayings the other explainers of the Quran have mentioned, Nasafi in <em>Tartib al-Madarik</em> (3:18), Abu Hayyan in <em>Bahr al-Muhit</em> (7:158), Imam Ibn al-Jawzi cites the view Imam Ibn Qutaybah <em>Za&#8217;d ul-Masir</em> (5:124) as well his own view as Shaykh al-Albani brings (5:123) as we proceed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Clarification of Shaykh Muhammad Shinqiti</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He refutes those who use this ayah as evidence for making places of worship on graves and those who do not have knowledge say this is something encouraged from the Quran and Sunnah, whoever holds this view is from the most ignorant of creation. So are we to follow this group who say lets make a masjid over them? or were they disbelievers, who it is impermissible to follow? There is a difference if they were people of Fatrah or a group of disbelievers. If it is said they were disbelievers, then there is no problem because this is not evidence for us (<em>Tafsir Qurtubi</em> 10:379), He says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;If they claim they were Muslims, then we answer and say it is not hidden from the most deficient in intelligence that they were Muslims from a previous nation and that it this does not oppose the authentic clear text transmitted from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ except those whose intelligence is confused. This is because the Messenger of Allah ﷺ before he passed away cursed those who build places of worship over the graves. Therefore, it is clear whoever follows the ways of those who advocate building places of worship over graves have been cursed from the tongue of the most trustworthy and honest, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.&#8221;</em> (<em>Adwa al-Bayan</em> 3:159)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Statement of Imam Abdul Aziz Ibn Baz</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn Baz said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The answer to that is: that Allah has told us about the leaders and powerful people of that time, and that they said these words. That does not imply that He liked that or approved of them, rather He said that by way of blaming them and condemning their action. This is indicated by the fact that the Messenger sallalahu alayhi wasallam to whom this verse was revealed and who was the most knowledgeable of people as to how it should be interpreted, forbade his ummah to build mosques over graves, warned them against doing so, and cursed and condemned those who did that.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">If that had been permissible, then the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alayhi wasallam would not have discouraged it in such emphatic terms, and gone to the extent of cursing those who did it, and said that they are the most evil of mankind before Allah. This is sufficient to convince the seeker of truth. Even if we were to assume that building places of worship over graves was permitted to those who came before us, it is not permissible for us to follow their example in that, because our sharee’ah abrogates the laws that came before it, and our Messenger sallalahu alayhi wasallam is the Final Messenger whose Shari&#8217;ah is complete and universal. He has forbidden us to build mosques over graves, so it is not permissible for us to go against him. We must follow him, adhering to that which he brought and abstaining from anything from the ancient laws that goes against that or any custom that appeals to the one who does it but goes against that. For there is nothing more perfect than the laws of Allah and there is no guidance better than the guidance of the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alayhi wasallam</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Allah is the One Whom we ask to help us and all the Muslims to adhere firmly to His religion and to follow the shari’ah of His Messenger Muhammad sallalahu alayhi wasallam in all that we say and do, both outwardly and inwardly, in all our affairs, until we meet Allah, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Near. May Allah send blessings and peace upon His slave and Messenger Muhammad and his family and companions, and those who follow his guidance, until the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</em> (<i>Majmu Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawi’ah li Samahat al-Shaykh Ibn Baz </i>1:434)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani&#8217;s Answer</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani cites the doubt of the Sufi&#8217;s who say in regard to this ayah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This ayah evidences the permissibility of making masajid over graves and the point of deduction is that the people who said this were the followers of Isa Alayhis Salam i.e. christians as it has been mentioned in the books of Tafasir. Therefore, we find it was permissible to make a mosque over graves in their shari&#8217;ah as Allah mentions this without reprimanding it. Thus the principle is, if Allah mention a ruling of the previous nations without rejecting it then it is also shariah for us which means that it is permissible for us to do the same as mentioned in this ayah.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tahzir al-Sajid</em> p.48)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani answers this and says there are three answers to this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>First Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is established in the knowledge regarding the principles i.e. Ilm al-Usul that previous shariahs i.e. legislation before the advent of Islam is not shariah for us, there are numerous evidences for this which. As an example Imam Ibn Hazm brings approximately 50 or so evidences to prove the previous shariahs were not incumbent upon us. (<em>al-Ihkam Fi Usul al-Ahkam </em>5:16)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani adds a note and says these can referred to in larger volumes on Ilm al-Usul and specifically<em> al-Ihkam Fi Usul al-Ahkam</em> of Ibn Hazm and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani continues and says one such evidence for this is the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) that he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I have been given five things that no Prophet before was given, a Prophet was sent to his respective nation whereas i have been sent to the whole of mankind.&#8221; </em>(Bukhari Muslim and I have referenced it in al-Irwa ul-Ghalil no.285)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even if the aforementioned ayah alludes to making masjid over graves, it was in the previous shariahs which have been since abrogated and neither does it command us to act on this ayah and therefore it is not permissible for us to make mosques over graves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Second Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even if we were to accept their statement that the previous shariahs were incumbent upon us, then this still has another binding condition intertwined with it which is that there can be nothing that contradicts or opposes it from our shariah. This however this is not the case because this condition is missing because mutawatir (overwhelming number of) ahadith prohibit making masjids over graves. This is a clear evidence to indicate the previous shariah is not incumbent or binding upon us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Third Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not hold the aforementioned ayah alludes to the permissibility of making mosques over graves in the previous shariahs i.e. in the legislation of Isa Alayhis Salam because it only shows some people expressed an idea or thought to build a masjid on the people of the cave &#8211; Ashab al-Kahf. There is no clarification whether they were believers. Even if we accept they were believers there is no clarification if they were righteous and obedient to the shariah of Isa Alayhis Salam but rather some evidences show they were not following the shariah (of Isa Alayis Sallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The View of Hafiz Ibn Rajab (795H)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence Hafiz Ibn Rajab (795H) wrote in the explanation of the hadith, <em>&#8220;May the curse of Allah be upon the jews and christians who built places of worship over the graves of their Prophet.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This hadith which prohibits making places of worship over the graves of Prophets is also evidenced in the Quran where Allah says about the people of the Cave  &#8211; Ashab al-Kahf, <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong>This ayah shows making places of worship on graves were the actions of the people of power and leadership which shows this had no basis or ruling in their shariah but rather they just wanted to do this based on their wishes as being the leaders and people of power. This was not the action of the people of knowledge and virtue who were obedient and following the guidance revealed to their Prophets who were also the companions and helpers.&#8221;</em> (Fath al-Bari 65:280 from al-Kawakib al-Darari &#8211; manuscript from in Maktabah al-Zahiriyyah. TN. See also Fath al-Bari 2:397 of Ibn Rajab)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The View of Shaykh Ali bin Urwah and Hafiz Ibn Kathir</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ali bin Urwah concurs and supports Hafiz Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir, he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ibn Jarir has cited two statements on explanation of this ayah, the first being that, we will build a place of worship, they were believers and the second statement was that they were polytheists &#8211; mushriks, Allahs knows best. What is apparent is that they were people of power and influence but what they said was not the truth because the statement of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) is that he cursed the jews and christians for making places of worship on the graves of their Prophets. His intent was to warn his Ummah from this evil action. There is also a report Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) during his reign they found the grave of Prophet Danyal in Iraq with his scrolls. He quickly buried him with his book, concealing it from the people.&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar al-Kawakib 10:208:2, Tafsir Ibn Kathir 3:78)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani adds a notes to the statement of Imam Ibn Jarir that Imam Ibn al-Jawzi mentioned exactly the same in his Za&#8217;d al-Masir 5:123, Maktab al-Islami)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani continues and said, we find from these details, using this ayah to make places of worship over graves is totally incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The View of Allamah al-Muhaqqiq Alusi (1270H)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This ayah has been used to prove the permissibility of building shrines over the graves of the pious people. From the people who have put forward this deduction are Shihab Khafaji which he mentions in his notes to al-Baydawi, However this deduction is totally and absolutely incorrect, false and corrupt.&#8221;</em> (Ruh al-Ma&#8217;ani 5:31)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albnai says, then Allamah Alusi cites some ahadith in prohibition of this issue and supports it by citing a statement of Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Haithami, which I have presented on (p.22 -Tahzir al-Sajid)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Statement Shaykh al-Albani is referring to on (p.22) is where Hafiz al-Haithami said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Building places of worship/masjids over graves means to pray next or on top of them.&#8221;</em> (al-Zawajir 1:121)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani continues and says, &#8220;then, Allamah Alusi in his book, <em>&#8216;Sharh al-Minhaj&#8217;</em> also cites another statement of Hafiz Ibn Hajr Haithami, where he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;A group of scholars have issued an edict to demolish all the structures built over graves in Qarafah in Egypt, even the mausoleum of Imam Shafi&#8217;i which was build by a revering ruler. Every Muslim should, if no problems arise, demolish and ground every structure (built over graves) and if troubles and problems are likely to arise it becomes the responsibility of the leader and ruler. These points have been taken from Ibn al-Raf&#8221;ih&#8217;s book &#8216;Kitab al-Sulah'&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;then Allamah Alas goes onto say it can be argued (i.e. they argue) making places of worship over graves was permissible in the previous shariahs based on the ayah of Surah al-Kahf and presenting evidences from previous shariahs is something the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) would do. For example he said whoever sleeps or forgets to pray he should pray immediately when he remembers or wakes up (This hadith is authentic and referenced in the Sahihayn and it is not correct to say it has been narrated as it indicates weakness in the terminology of the scholars as i have clarified in Salah al-Tarawih (p.63-64), also i have referenced this hadith in Sahih Abi Dawud no.461, al-Irwa no.263), and he presented the ayah, &#8220;and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat) for My Remembrance.&#8221; (Surah Taha 20:14). whereas this command was given to Musa Alayhis Salam which was mentioned in the Quran as an incident. Likewise and similarly Imam Abu Yusuf when there is a need for Qisas between husband and wife, Imam Karkhi when there needs to be Qisas between a servant and master, Dhimmi and Muslim have used as evidence the ayah, <strong>&#8220;And We ordained therein for them: &#8220;Life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wounds equal for equal.&#8221; But if anyone remits the retaliation by way of charity, it shall be for him an expiation&#8230;&#8221; (Surah al-Ma&#8217;idah5:45)</strong> therefore we can also use the ayah from Surah al-Kahf as evidence.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">The answer to this doubt is that the previous shariahs have some bearing on us but this now absolute, complete and with restriction but rather it is restricted with conditions that Allah mentions a ruling or command without rejecting and remember rejecting what the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) says is also rejecting Allah. We have already read Allahs Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) has cursed those who make places of worship on graves. It must also be succinctly noted, if making places of worship over graves was something permissible and acceptable in the Shariahs before the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) would not have cursed them for doing this. furthermore, this ayah (18:21) is not like the other ayahs which have been mentioned from which the Imams made deductions or used as evidence compared to the other ayahs. This ayah merely mentions the idea of a group of them wanting to build a place of worship over their graves and it just shows their honour not that they should be followed. Therefore until it is not established that anyone from amongst them was infallible nothing can be considered to be part of our shariah. Another reason that this is overlooked is that they were leaders and people of power who were less obedient to their religion and more fervent in their leadership.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">We find that the first group were believers who were aware of the prohibition of making places of worship over graves and hence decided to make a closed entrance to the grave without any connection tot he people of the cave. The other group who were leaders, people of power and influence did not accept their view and decided to build a place of worship of their graves.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">If if someone wants to hold this later and second view of <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221;</strong> it did not mean the prohibited type of place of worship on their graves which is cursed but rather wanted to make a place of worship ear or next to the graves. Hence according to the narrations of Suddi and Wahb, they clearly state this type of building a place of worship which is not prohibited. At the very most it can be understood as Masjid al-Kahf just as Masjid al-Nabawi. (TN. This is incorrect as Masjid al-Nabwi is titled that because the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) built it not because it was next to the grave.)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">It can also be argued and presented the people wanted to make a place of worship on the mount where the cave was situated. There is a report in this regard from Mujahid, the ruler at the time left the people of the cave in there places and wanted to build a place of worship on the mountain in remembrance of them. This is what seems the closest to the apparent meaning of the ayah.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, this is only applicable if the assumption is made that the people of the cave woke up and died later and if they went to sleep again after waking up, i.e. they were still alive (as the ayat indicate) and did not die, then this whole discussion and using this ayah for this interpretation is null, void and has no bearing whatsoever.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani adds a note and says that Allamah Alusi further cited the statement of Hasan al-Basri who said a place of worship was built on the cave, ready for them when they would wake up. Alusi then said the basis of this statement, the people of the cave did not die when they returned to the cave but rather slept like they had done before. Some said they would remain asleep until the Mahdi comes, when they will wake up and help him. However all of these statements are without authenticity and are somewhat spurious. (Ruh al-Ma&#8217;ani 5:31)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Alusi contines and says whoever has any guidance and truth will not have the audacity to hold onto the generality of this ayah and a view opposing and contradicting the clear authentic ahadith and reports. Whoever uses this ayah to prove building places of worship over graves is extreme ignorance and misguidance and yet despite this scholars for names sake render the actions of these ignorant people to be permissible, from what they do to the graves of the pious people. This includes raising the heights of graves, making them rectangular and solid, hanging ornaments from them, praying towards the graves, kissing them, having festivals there etc and they all of this under this ayah of Surah al-Kahf and the incident of the people of the cave as well as other narrations. One such report being the ruler persevered the people of the cave with specific woodland would organise annuals birthday celebrations, however all of these issues are innovations and new things and have not an iota of importance in the opposition to what Allah and his Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) are as such in formulating a new religion which Allah gave them no permission.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In order to know and to seek the truth look at the actions and dealings of the companions with the best grave on the planet, the grave of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam)? What was their practise in visiting his grave and offering salutations? Then compare their actions and practises with these grave worshippers and how much of a stark and dire difference there really is? What did the comparisons do and what are these grave worshippers doing.&#8221; (Ruh al-Ma&#8217;ani 15:31-32) End of the words of Allamah Alusi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answering and Refuting the Reckless Speech of a Contemporary &#8211; &#8216;Abu </strong><b>Faiz Ahmad al-Siddiq al-Ghumari&#8217;</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: A contemporary whilst discussing this ayah of Surah al-Kahf instead of debating permissibility has gone to the extreme extent and claimed it is recommended. The points of deduction are somewhat new and different to those previously mentioned and details answers to them have preceded. This individual says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This ayah proves the permissibility of making masjid over graves because Allah mentioned their statement, <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them&#8221;</strong> without shunning, correcting or refuting it&#8230;&#8221;</em> (TN &#8211;<em>Ihya al-maqbur min adillati jawaz bina al-masajid ala qubur</em> p.21+, <em>I&#8217;lam al-rak&#8217;e al-Sajid Bi-Ittihazu al-Qubur Masajid</em> p,70)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All three Ghumaris, Ahmad, Abdullah and Abdul Aziz have authored books against Shaykh al-Albani but two of them in particular on this issue, the first by Ahmad Ghumar, &#8216;Ihya al-Maqbur Min Adillati Jawaz Bina al-Masajid Ala Qubur&#8217; and Abdullah Ghumari, <em>&#8216;I&#8217;lam al-rak&#8217;e al-sajid bi-ittihazu al-qubur masajid.&#8217;</em> The arguments in both books are similar without anything new and anything that was new Shaykh al-Albnai answered.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mu&#8217;allami mentions something similar in his book that they claim it is recommended, whereas others believe it is in fact obligatory to makes places of worship over graves. He calls them ignorant extremists. (al-Bana&#8217;u alal qubur p.55+)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani goes onto say, this analysis has two answers</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the refuting, correction or shunning is not mentioned, and holding this to be the correct view is within of itself incorrect except if it is proven the people who said <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong>are muslims and people who were also obedient and followed the respective shariah of their Prophet. However there is no such indication int he ayah and what seems closer to the truth and reality is they may not have even been Muslims  or at the very least were not practising or righteous muslims but rather were evil disbelievers, this has preceded from the statements of Ibn Rajab Hanbali and Ibn Kathir. In such circumstances mentioning their statements without refuting or shunning it is actual essence reprimanding it and this is because attributing a statement or action of the disbelievers of evil sinners and then mentioning it is sufficient as a censure and refutation of it by in of itself. Therefore, using the silence or the lack of reprimand as evidence from the aforementioned ayah under discussion  is incorrect and this is further supported by the second answer</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This deduction and the extraction of this point can be considered to be correct by the people before and the current day people by those who follow their whims and desires based on their ways and principles, who only consider the Quran to be the Din without have any respect, reverence and giving any importance whatsoever to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). However the belief and principles of Ahl al-Sunnah wal Jama&#8217;ah are that both the Quran and Sunnah is to have Iman and conviction in both of them. They believe in the following authentic well known hadith where the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Be attentive that I have been given the Quran and something similar to it. in another report it mentions he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, &#8220;Whatever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) makes unlawful then it just like Allah made it haram or unlawful.&#8221;</em> (Mishkat, Kitab al-Iman, Bab al-Ei&#8217;tisam no.163)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How can the contemporary say Allah never reprimanded or refuted the statement of these people when they said, <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong>whereas it has been refuted and rejected in mutawatir hadith. Allah cursed these people via the speech of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and therefore what can more clear and manifest in terms of a refutation than this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Using the ayah of Surah al-Kahf to establish the permissibility to build places of worship over graves of the Prophets in opposition and in contradiction to the mutawatir hadith is just like proving the permissibility of taking pictures and idol worship from the following statement of Allah with regard to the Jinns obeying the commands of Suleiman Alayhis Salam,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;They worked for him as he desired, (making) high rooms, images, basins as large as reservoirs, and (cooking) cauldrons fixed (in their places). &#8220;Work you, O family of Dawud (David), with thanks!&#8221; But few of My slaves are grateful.&#8221; (Surah al-Saba 34:13)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is done by overlooking all of the ahadith which prohibit making pictures and the prohibition of idol worship, however any muslim who have Iman in the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) will not have the audacity to do this. This concludes the answer to the deduction these people use from the ayah of  <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong>End of the words of Shaykh al-Albani from <em>Tahzir al-Sajid Min Ittihazu al-Qubur Masajid</em> p.48-58)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Former Mufti of Egypt</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The former mufti of Egypt, Ali Gomaa/Jumua also used this ayah to prove the permissibility of building places of worship over graves, he generally uses the same arguments when it comes to this ayah and its incorrect interpretation. He has been answered in a book over 300 pages titled, &#8216;<em>Isti&#8217;dhah bi al-Ghafur min bid&#8217;ah bina al-masajid wa-qibab ala al-qubur, wa-ma‘ahu ta‘aqqubat ala mughalatat fatwa al-duktur AlI Jum‘ah fī bina al-masajid ala al-qubur.&#8217; </em>by Abu Anas ibn Abdul Maqsud.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdur Rahman Mu&#8217;allami al-Yamani (1386H) has given a very detailed answer to the deductions and points drawn by these people from this ayah, He discusses it great length and in intricate detail which will be too lengthy to reproduce here, so let the avid reader refer to it. (Al-Bana&#8217;u al-alal qubur p.7+)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Making masjids over graves is not from the Din of the Muslims, rather it is prohibited it from established texts from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and according to the agreement of the Imams of the Din. In fact it is impermissible to make masjid over graves, whatever is practised in those masjids even with the intent of praying near them, and all of the Imams of the Din are unanimous in prohibiting this.&#8221;</em> (Majmu&#8217;a al-Fatawa 27:477)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Imams are agreed in not building masjid on graves.&#8221;</em> (Majmu&#8217;a Fatawa 22:145)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said another time,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Scholars have said it is impermissible to build masjid/places of worship over graves.&#8221;</em> (Majmu&#8217;a Fatawa 27:77)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s Ahmad Yar Khans points and deductions then they are irrelevant and poor without any substance to the because we have shown the meaning he extracts from the ayah are a dire exaggeration of his imagination because none of the points mention the making of shrines or tombs on graves and doing and saying it is permissible or recommended by the likes of Ahmad Yar Khan and Ahmad Siddiq Ghumari is a clear distortion of the ayat of the Quran.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point of Ahmad Siddiq Ghumari and Ahmad Yar Khan Naeemi are further refuted by the authentic hadith of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) which Ai&#8217;shah (RadhiAllahu Anha) narrates,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Um Salama told Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) about a church which she had seen in Ethiopia and which was called Mariya. She told him about the pictures which she had seen in it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) said, &#8220;If any righteous pious man dies amongst them, they would build a place of worship at his grave and make these pictures in it; they are the worst creatures in the sight of Allah.&#8221;</em> (Bukhari no.434, Muslim no.528)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">See also Bukhari no.1330, Muslim 529 for a hadith with a very similar meaning</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;These Masajid which have been built on the graves of the Prophets, the righteous, rulers and others, then it is a must to demolish them or by any other means, this is such an affair that I do not know of any difference of opinion between the well known scholars.&#8221;</em> (Iqtida Sirat al-Mustaqim 1:330)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To emphasise on the point of Shaykh al-Albani and his answer to Ahmad Siddiq Ghumari that whatever Allahs Messenger ﷺ declared to be unlawful is divine legislation i.e. shariah and thus we have a very explicit hadith from Jundub (RadhiAllahu Anhu), the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said 5 days before his death,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Beware, the people before you would places of worship on the graves of their Prophets and righteous people, beware attentively DO NOT make graves as places of worship for verily I forbid you from that.&#8221;</em> (Muslim no.532)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith is as explicit as it will get and if this does not suffice the individual of sound intellection and mindset, then we do not know what will. The readers can also refer to short but succinct treatise of Imam Shawkani, Sharh al-sudur fi thrill rafa al-qubur, where he discusses the issues in generally and brings numerous hadith to show the unlawfulness of building masjid or places of worship over graves. The later is also referenced and checked by Shaikh abdul Muhsin al-Abbad, wherein he also brings some points of benefit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find from the statements of the scholars, making graves as places or worship or masjid over graves is impermissible in our shariah due to the clear authentic texts. Furthermore, that we cannot use the ayah from Surah Kahf to justify its permissibility due to the answers which have preceded. In this article we have not cited the overwhelming number of hadith which clearly mention this prohibition because inshAllah they will be perhaps presented at a different time</span></p>
