<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Synopsis of the Khawārij</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">In the modern world today, various groups, organisations and movements have emerged that have misrepresented and manipulated the image of Islam, this is not to say the media hasn’t played its unscrupulous role. There has been considerable destruction, loss of innocent life and the lives of millions have changed due to the events of the last two to three decades. The devastation faced by the Muslims has been distressing and disturbing. A great part of the blame rests with modern day groups and sects, which have and are still evolving with new and dangerous narratives. In the following series of articles, we will look at the origins and emergence of the Khawārij sect and the many strands they take in current times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Who Are the Khawārij?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Khawārij are those who primarily rebelled against the Sunnah and the Jamāʿah (i.e. Ahl al-Sunnah waʾl Jamāʿah or the Muslim Community) and they left or abandoned the greater body of the Muslims. Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Kathīr (d.774H) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">They are called Khawārij because they stopped obeying the ruler (the Imām) and therefore they became independent of the Sharīʿah of Islam.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">al-Shahrastānī (d.548H) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Imām or ruler – upon whom the whole Ummah is agreed upon and is united behind, so whosoever does Khurūj i.e. rebels against them, will be called a Khārijī. This is whether the Khurūj is during the time of the Ṣaḥābah, during the time of the rightly guided Khulafāʾ or even after their time from amongst the Tābiʿīn or whether it is in the era of any Muslim ruler.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajar (d.852H) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">Khawārij is the plural of Khārijah, these people are innovators and they were called Khawārij because they left the Dīn of Islam, they rebelled and made Khurūj against the best people of the Muslim Ummah.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imām Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr (d.463H) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Khawārij are the people who distort the Book of Allāḥ and made thr blood of the Muslims lawful and they want to declare Muslims to be un believers due to their sins. They raise the sword against them and they opposed the Jamāʿah. The declared the prayer to be obligatory upon the menstruating woman, they also believed there was no rajam (stoning) of the adulterer and they were of the view to lash them 100 times. They also held the view that ritual purity could only be achieved by using flowing water or water that was in very large quantities. They had many other issues in which they opposed the Jamāʿah of the Muslims i.e. Ahl al-Sunnah. Similarly, they innovated many new things in the Dīn and they left the Dīn just as an arrow leaves its prey.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Here we find the Khawārij have been described with a few characteristics, that have been repeated by many Scholars. For example, they went to extremes and eventually left the religion. The example of attaining ritual purity was a prime example. The Khawārij also had other hallmarks and it is these signs and characteristics that are rampant and evident on a whole array of people in our midst who claim to be upon the path of Ahl al-Sunnah. Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) describes them further with another sign, he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">One of the first innovations spread in Islam was the Bidʿah of the Khawārij.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">So, the Khawārij were the first sect of Islam who rebelled and made Khurūj against the body of the Muslims i.e. Ahl al-Sunnah, while raising the sword due to their false beliefs, defective methodology and tyrannical oppression of the Muslims. Imām Ibn Taymiyyah further said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">The very first people of innovation who separated from the Jamāʿah of the Muslims were the Khawārij.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Khawārij have historically always troubled and harmed the Muslims in every era and century. This is why, from Divine texts we find they were condemned and we were commanded to fight them. Aḥadīth transmitted in this regard are so numerous that they reach an overwhelming level. An example of this is the ḥadīth:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Abū Ghālib reported: Abū Umāmah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, The Khawārij are the worst of those slain under the heavens, and the best of those slain are those who were killed by them. They are the dogs of Hellfire. They were Muslims and then became unbelievers.’ I said, ‘O Abū Umāmah, is this something you say?” Abū Umamah said, ‘No, rather I heard it from the Messenger of Allāh Sallalalhu Alayhi Wasallam</span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>.’</strong><a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;">

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[GRADING AND REFERENCES]</span></strong> – [<i>Hasan-</i> good] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Asaakir narrated this from Muhammad Ibn Abdurahmaan Ibn Ubaydullah al-Qattaan (Tareekh Dimishq (1/102)) and Abul Abbaas Muhammad Ibn Ya’qoob al-Asam narrated this from Abbaas Ibn Waleed Ibn Mazeed (Juz al-Asim: (no.51), also Haakim (4/509) hadeeth (no.8554) Bayhaqee (Dalail an-Nubuwah (6/448)) and Aboo Na’eem al-Isbahaanee (Hilyatul Awliyaa (5/252) and other than them have transmitted it from the chain of Sa’eed Ibn Abdul Azeez from Yunus Ibn Maysarah Ibn Halbis from Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and both Haakim and Dhahabee have declared it authentic on the conditions of Bukharee and Muslim! </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Both of these chains (of Bayhaqee and Asim) are <i>[Hasan]</i> good.  </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[BIOGRAPHY OF THE NARRATOR OF THE HADEETH]  </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A Summarised comprehensive discussion of Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) is as follows: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Name and lineage:</b>    </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Muhammad Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas Ibn Waa’il Ibn Haashim Ibn Sa’eed Ibn Sa’d Ibn Sahm Ibn Amr Ibn Hasees Ibn Ka’b Ibn Lu’ay Ibn Ghaalib al-Qurashee as-Sahmee al-Makkee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Students: </b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Aboo Umaamah As’ad Ibn Sahl Ibn Haneef (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), Anas Ibn Maalik (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), Jubayr Ibn Nafeer al-Hadhramee, al-Hasan al-Basree, Humayd Ibn Abdurahmaan Ibn Awf, Zar Ibn Jaysh al-Asadee, Saalim Ibn Abee al-Ja’d, as-Saa’ib Ibn Furookh ash-Shaa’ir, Sa’eed Ibn Musayyab, Shuayb Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas Waalid Amr Ibn Shuayb, Ta’oos Ibn Kaysaan, Aamir ash-Shu’bee, Abdullah Ibn Buraydah al-Aslamee, Abdullah Ibn Ubaydullah Ibn Abee Maleekah, Ataa Ibn Abee Rabaah, Ikrimah Mawlah Ibn Abbaas, Amr Ibn Deenar al-Makkee, Qaasim Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abee Bakr as-Siddeeq, Mujahid Ibn Jabr, Masrooq and Abu Burdah Ibn Abee Musa al-Ash’aree and other than them. Rahimahullah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Virtues:</b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) gave Abdullah Ibn Amr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) permission to write his hadeeth. (Sunan Abee Dawood: (no.3646) and its chain is authentic, Musnad Ahmad (2/162) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. Aboo Hurayrah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, “There is none among the companions of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) who has narrated more Hadiths than I, except `Abdullah bin `Amr (bin Al-`As) who used to write them and I did not.” (Saheeh Bukharee (no.113) His written collection is famously known as as-Saheefah as-Saadiqah from the chain of Amr Ibn Shuayb from his father from his grandfather. (Also see al-Muwatta, Ibn al-Qaasim’s narration with my verification (pg.49-50) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. Handhalah Ibn Khuwaylid al-Anmbaree (al-Ghazzee/<i>Thiqah</i>) narrated: “I was with Mu’awiyah (Radiullahu anhu) and two men came arguing about the (cutting off the) head of Ammaar (Ibn Yassaar (Radiullahu anhu), both of these men were claiming to have killed him. Then Abdullah Ibn Amr (Radiullahu anhu) said, “Whichever one of you wants to be happy, then be happy (!) because I heard the Messenger of Allah (Sallalaahu Alayhee wa sallam) say, “a rebel (rebellious, insurgent) group will kill him (Ammaar (Radiullahu anhu).” Mu’awiyah (Radiullahu anhu) said, “Why are you with us (in the battle of Sifin)?”  He (Abdullah Ibn Amr (Radiullahu anhu) replied, “My father complained to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalaahu Alayhee wa sallam) about me, so he said (to me), “whilst your father is alive then obey (listen and follow him) and don’t disobey him”. So (that’s why) I am with you and I don’t kill and fight.” (Musnad al-Imaam Ahmad (2/164-165) hadeeth (no.6538) and its chain is authentic). Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, “What is my connection with Sifin and what is my connection with killing and fighting the muslims? I wish that I died 10 years ago. By Allah! I didn’t strike a sword in this (battle), nor throw a spear and neither did I shoot an arrow. (Tabaqaat Ibn Sa’d (4/266) and its chain is authentic)    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Knowledge of narrations:</b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The number of his narrations is 700 from which 7 are in the in the Saheehayn (TN. Saheehayn means the two Saheehs i.e. Saheeh Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Death:</b><b> </b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the incident (event) of Hirrah, Dhul Hijjah 63 Hijri (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a major difference of opinion as to when he died and the writer of this book has given preference the saying of Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. And Allah knows best. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the Allaah’s salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow their path until the Day of Resurrection. The title <em>fitnah of Takfeer</em>: The Trials and Tribulations associated with imputing kufr (disbelief) on Muslims (rulers or ruled), is one of the most dangerous fitan in our times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This misleading thought has spread amongst many of the youth in the Muslim world, east and west, north and south. Many of these youths are greatly motivated by their emotions and their vigilant care concerning the deen. As such, they took many of that which they received from the followers of desires. These followers of desires have renewed the principles and thoughts of the early <strong>Khawaarij (dissidents)</strong> and have become an extension of them. This has led to declare takfeer on the Islamic societies at large and on all Muslim leaders, without exception. The consequences of this have been very terrible. Blood is being shed.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Definition of Kufr:</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To better understand takfeer, it is necessary to first define kufr. Linguistically, the term kufr means, “<strong>covering and shielding</strong>.” If an object covers something, then that object kafarahu (covered and shielded it). Similarly, it is said that the farmer when he puts the seed in the ground and covers it with soil is a kafir from the linguistic aspect, since he covered the seed with dirt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the Islamic meaning, sometimes the word kufr means the major kufr, which takes a person out of the fold of Islaam. Kufr could also refer to the lesser type, which does not take a person from the fold of Islaam, known as al-kufr al-asghar. Islamically, the kafir is called a kafir because he covered and shielded the favor of Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala). Therefore, the kafir did not recognize the favor of Allaah upon him and did not give thanks to Allaah. Rather, he denied the favor of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahlus-Sunnah (adherents to the Sunnah) is on the medium course, with respect to all fundamental matters in Islaam. They are between the two extremes, the excessive ones who exceeded the limits and the negligent ones. Allaah described this in Noble Qur’an (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>«Thus, we have made you a just nation» Surah al-Baqarah (2:143)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, regarding the matter of takfeer, Ahlus-Sunnah is on a medium course between extremism and negligence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kafir is of two types. The first type is <strong>al-kafir al-aslee</strong> (the orginal kafir). This includes all of those who are not Muslims including the Christians and the Jews. Anyone who doubts the kufr of al-kafir al-aslee is himself a kafir. The second type is the <strong>apostate</strong> who was born to two Muslim parents, who in the stage of adulthood rejected Islaam, either by speech or by action.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Views of Ahlus-Sunnah and the Different Sects Regarding Takfeer:</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The people are divided into three categories regarding takfeer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first category is <strong>al- Khawaarij</strong>. They impute kufr on the Muslim due to major sins; with some have gone to the extent to impute kufr on the Muslim due to minor sins. Similarly, they impute kufr on any Muslim who does not believe the same as them. As such, they have made the blood and wealth of most Muslims permissible. This group has an extension in our time and exists in many parts of the Muslim world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second group is <strong>al-Murji’ah</strong>. They claim that eeman (faith) is not affected by any sinful act, even if the Muslim commits a major sin. They say all Muslims are believers, and nothing affects faith. Although the beliefs of al-Murji’ah comprise different positions, this is an overall summary of their views.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ahlus-Sunnah</strong> are on a medium course between the two extremes. They don’t rush to impute kufr on the Muslim while not refraining from imputing kufr on him if the person commits that which Allaah and/or His Messenger declared to be kufr. However, they note, “<em>The Muslim who may say or do that which is considered kufr should not have kufr imputed on him specifically until the evidence is established on him, with all the conditions of imputing kufr fulfilled and all the impediments removed.”</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Important Matters Regarding Takfeer</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>First</strong>, before takfeer can be established, all conditions must be fulfilled and all impediments removed. From the conditions of making takfeer are: knowledge, choice, intent, deliberate action or saying of kufr, and its acceptance. This implies determining whether the person knows his action is kufr, and he has chosen it, without being compelled. Moreover, it must be shown that the person was deliberate in his action and is content with it. From the impediments of takfeer are: affirmation of an error, ignorance, compulsion, and misinterpretation. Ahlus-Sunnah checks into both the impediments and conditions before imputing kufr on a specific person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>second</strong> important matter is that imputing kufr on someone is an extremely dangerous matter. No one should indulge in takfeer, except those who are firmly established in knowledge and fulfill certain criterion. This arises from the fact that takfeer is the right of Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). Therefore, it can only be established by those who are the inheritors of the Prophets, the ulama (scholars) who make clear the ruling of Allaah and His Messenger; they are the only ones qualified. Anyone else who involves himself in takfeer is on a dark path of transgression and claims for himself a special right with Allaah. Hence, it is not permissible to make takfeer on anyone expect the one whom Allaah and His Messenger declared to be as such. Due to the seriousness of takfeer and its limits as established by Allaah and His Messenger, Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, rahimahullah, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“That is why the people of knowledge and Sunnah did not resort to making takfeer on those who opposed them, even if the opponent makes takfeer on them. This is because the matter of kufr is a legal right established by shariah, and therefore, the person can not punish by the like, just like if someone who belies you and makes lies against you, you can not spread lies about him, or if someone fornicates with members of your family, you can not fornicate with members of his family. This is because fornication and lying are haraam (unlawful) being <strong>Allaah’s right</strong>. Similarly, takfeer is a right that belongs to Allaah. Hence we do not impute kufr except on whom Allaah and His Messenger declared as such.” [Ar-Rad ‘Alal Bakri, v. 3, p. 381].</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The danger involved with takfeer is not limited to the transgression against the right of Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’ala). The person who imputes kufr on the others also risks falling into that which he accused his brother with. This is in line with the hadith of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallaam),</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Any person who calls his brother, ‘Ya Kafir (Oh Unbeliever), has in fact done an act through which this unbelief would return to one of them. If it were so as he asserted, then the kufr of the man was confirmed, but if it was untrue, it returns to him (the one who labeled it on his Muslim brother).” [Reported by Muslim and At- Tirmithi.]</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, in another narration, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If somebody accuses another of Fusuq (by calling him ‘Fasiq’ i.e. a wicked person) or accuses him of Kufr, such an accusation will revert to him (i.e. the accuser) if his companion (the accused) is innocent.” [Bukhari].</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>third</strong> important matter is that takfeer causes hate amongst people, especially amongst those who are referred to as kafir since no one likes to be labeled as a kafir. In fact, this can lead to fights and bloodshed, which will inflict evil on the individuals involved and the society at large.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, rahimahullah, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“And it is not the right of anyone to impute kufr on anyone of the Muslims even if he errs and does wrong until evidence is established upon him and the matter is made clear to him. And the one whose Islaam is affirmed with certainty then it ceases not to exist with him due to doubt. Rather his (state) of Islaam comes to an end only after the establishment of the proof and the elimination of the unclarity.” [Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, v. 12, p. 501]</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Takfeer Practiced in Our Times:</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>First</strong>, a type of takfeer practiced in our time is the unrestricted takfeer on the Muslim rulers who do not rule by the rule of Allaah. This generalization, without details, has led many of the young Muslims to conclude that it is permissible to rebel against these rulers by force. Consequently confrontations, bloodshed and other problems arising from this are still growing. Moreover, it is bringing chaos and instability to the Muslim world as it is evident to everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, this thought did not stop at the rulers but has been extended to the government employees, security forces, and others. It has also reached many imams of masajid (mosques), muadhineen (those who give adhan), and scholars. This arises from the pretext that these are all collaborators with the government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This pretext has even been extended to the Muslim society at large. Those who do not hold to the belief of these groups are considered kafir. This is not an issue in a vacuum; this is real. As such, one is not surprised as to why they kill Muslims or bomb places where there are many Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has reached the extent that these groups have called for the complete disassociation from their societies, thinking that all of the society is kafir so they can not stay with them. They even abandon their wives if they do not adhere to the same belief as the person holding the takfeer principle; similarly, if a wife holds this takfeer principle, they say it is incumbent upon her to leave her husband if he does not agree with that. Furthermore, they tell their followers not to make the congregation prayers in the mosques claiming these are not real mosques, and that the imams of these mosques are not Muslims since they were assigned by the government. This is happening in some Muslim countries.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Solution:</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The solution to this problem is to <strong>spread the knowledge of the righteous predecessors, alilm ash-shari’ saheeh (the correct knowledge of Islaam)</strong>. This comes from the knowledge taught by the reliable scholars and the books of the salaf. The young should return to the ulama to seek their advice instead of following these so-called thinkers and their takfeeri books. All of those who write advocating this methodology are not even known for being from the true ulama holding to the path of the salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Muslim societies and governments should take the <strong>corrective approach</strong> of adhering to the shar’eeah. Once this is done for the sake of Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’ala), then the promise of Allaah to bestow strength and steadfastness upon the ummah will surely be manifested.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, there should always be a <strong>hand extended to our youth who may have influenced by takfeer</strong>. There should be useful discussions in this matter and a refuting of the views held by them based on evidences and proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is anything we need to emphasize every now and then, whether regarding this matter or the understanding of Islaam as a whole, it is that people should be very serious about knowing Islaam from its two sources, the Qur’an and the way of the Rasool Allaah (Messenger of Allaah) in accordance with the understanding of the companions. This is the criteria of safety; this is the path that every Muslim should give his utmost effort to learn; this is the true safeguard mechanism for the individual and thus for the family and the society at large.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">And Advice to the Youth:</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, we all know that emotions are real, and care for Islaam is a strong motivation to its adherents. The motivation by care, sincerity, and emotion if not guided by the following of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in accordance with the way of the salaf, then it can turn into a blazing fire of destruction. Hence, a sincere advice is stressed again for all of our youth: seek knowledge from its reliable sources and from the ulama who are on the path of the companions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May Allaah the most High guide us and our Muslim youth to be on the path of righteousness and wisdom, and may Allaah, the Most High, safe guide this ummah from the fitnah of takfeer.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well-known to anyone with the slightest amount of common sense that hijacking planes and kidnapping embassy officials and similar acts are some of the greatest universal crimes that result in nothing but widespread corruption and destruction. They place such extreme hardships and injuries upon innocent people, the extent of which only Allāh knows.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, it is also well-known that the evil and harm of such crimes don’t affect one specific country or group. Rather, the dangers affect the whole world over. No doubt, whenever crimes are of this nature, it becomes obligatory upon the governments and other responsible authorities, such as the scholars and others, to give them the highest of concern and attention and to expend all possible efforts in preventing their evils and in eradicating them.2</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ṣāliḥ al-Luḥaydān (1) on Political Insurgencies (2)</span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Question:</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Are political overthrows, insurgences, and revolutions from the characteristics of Islām and forms of Jihād? </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Answer: </span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The question should more appropriately be, “Is chaos and causes of unjustified bloodshed from Islām?” because this is the actual meaning of such things. Those actions are the most severe factors that destroy Islāmic lands. If we look at the nonbelievers, for example the Jewish country (Israel) which contains resources and support from all over the world, we find that not once did a political overthrow occur. We do not find, during these times, overthrows and revolutions in the major nations of the east and west. No one supports and starts political overthrows and insurgences except for someone that has no concern for the well-being of his own nation or for its security. These are ways of jeopardizing the very existence of a nation, cultivating enmity among its people, spilling blood, and allowing its enemies to gain control over it. The evil of such tactics are obvious, yet the good of them is rare and minute and most of the time nonexistent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first overthrow to occur with regards to the Muslims was the insurgency against ‘Uthmān (RadhiAllahu Anhu) which eventually resulted in his murder. All the Companions unanimously agreed upon the evil of that action. So, it is compulsory upon every single Muslim to free himself and abstain from these affairs. When the Prophet (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) was asked about the leaders, he commanded that everyone must listen to and obey them, and he forbade division and disunity. Also, when a group of senior scholars from Baghdad (during the Abbasid rule) came to Imam Ahmad talking bad about the Abbasid ruler, he then became angry with them and warned them from such things. So, these are evil, despised actions and the good lies only in following the Salaf.3 </span></p>
