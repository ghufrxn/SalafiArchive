				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>[This is a slight elaboration on the hypothetical situation whether a muqallid should look for daleel. In this brief reply we produce evidence to show the methodology of the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was to give more information and knowledge to a questioner.]</em></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>باب مَنْ أَجَابَ السَّائِلَ بِأَكْثَرَ مِمَّا سَأَلَه (53)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Chapter: Whosoever Answered a Questioner More Than What was Asked</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Explanation of the chapter</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">This chapter is concerning the etiquette of answering a question. The need for this chapter arose due to a principle which some jurists mention, that a mufti should answer a question according to the questioners enquiry only (i.e. limit information). So, Imam al-Bukhari wanted to clarify it was not the intended meaning used by some jurists and that additional knowledge or information cannot be given to a questioner. Giving additional knowledge or information is from the generousity of knowledge and is a praiseworthy act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">حَدَّثَنَا آدَمُ، قَالَ حَدَّثَنَا ابْنُ أَبِي ذِئْبٍ، عَنْ نَافِعٍ، عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم‏.‏ وَعَنِ الزُّهْرِيِّ، عَنْ سَالِمٍ، عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَنَّ رَجُلاً سَأَلَهُ مَا يَلْبَسُ الْمُحْرِمُ فَقَالَ لاَ يَلْبَسِ الْقَمِيصَ وَلاَ الْعِمَامَةَ وَلاَ السَّرَاوِيلَ وَلاَ الْبُرْنُسَ وَلاَ ثَوْبًا مَسَّهُ الْوَرْسُ أَوِ الزَّعْفَرَانُ، فَإِنْ لَمْ يَجِدِ النَّعْلَيْنِ فَلْيَلْبَسِ الْخُفَّيْنِ وَلْيَقْطَعْهُمَا حَتَّى يَكُونَا تَحْتَ الْكَعْبَيْنِ</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>[with 2 chains] “A man asked the Prophet </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>, &#8220;What kind of clothes should a Muhrim (someone making Umrah or Hajj) wear? He replied, &#8220;He should not wear a shirt, a turban, trousers, a head covering garment or any material coloured with Saffron or Wars (types of colours and fragrance). And if he has no slippers, he can use Khuffs (leather socks) but they should be cut to be below the ankles.&#8221;</strong> (Sahih al-Bukhari no.134).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Narrators in the Chain</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Adam:</strong> He is Adam b. Abi Ayyas al-Asqalani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Ibn Abi Dhi’b:</strong> He is Muhammad b. Abdur Rahman al-Mughirah b. Harith b. Abi Dhi’b and Abu Dhi’b is Hisham b. Shu’bah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Az-Zuhri:</strong> He is Muhammad b. Muslim ibn Shihab az-Zuhri</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Salim:</strong> He is the son of Abdullah b. Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Linguistic Clarification</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Al-Burnus:</strong> Is a type of coat or garment which has a hat sewn onto it. Generally speaking the people of Morocco and Algeria wear such garments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Al-Warsu:</strong> Is a type of plant that has a fragrance which is used to colour garments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Benefits of the Hadith</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">This hadith conveys the manner in which the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam answered questions, in how his answers were complete and sufficient. The questioner asked what should a Muhrim wear but he Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam in his answer mentioned what he should not wear. Indicating, anything besides these things were permissible since this list could be extensive. This is just like a patient asking a Doctor what he could eat and the Doctor replies by saying abstain from such and such thing but you can eat everything else.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The conclusive element of this hadith is the questioner asked about affairs he had a choice over, meaning what he could wear or not wear based on his options or choice. However, the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam further explained other important matters. This was additional knowledge given to the questioner. Once a group of people asked about making Wudu with sea water and the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">“Its water is clean (i.e. pure to make Wudu from) and its dead animals are lawful to consume.”<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Whereas the question was just concerning Wudu but the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam answered with additional knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The wearing of the Khuffayn is for the one who does not have shoes or slippers. This position further refutes and answers the people who say the top of the feet should be open whilst in a state of Ihram, this is because leather socks cover the feet completely, therefore their statement has no basis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(Shaykh Abdullah Nasir Rehmani, <em>Sharh Kitab al-Ilm Minas-Sahih al-Bukhari</em> (pp. 261-263) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>NOTES</strong>   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Sunan Abi Dawud – Kitab at-Taharah – Bab al-Wudu Bima al-Bahr (no. 83), Jam’i at-Tirmidhi Abwab at-Taharah – Bab Ma Ja’a Fi Ma’a al-Bahr Innahu Tahur (no. 69) Shaykh al-Abani authenticated it.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This fatwa of the great Ahl al-Hadith Shaykh, Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan shows the methodology of the Ahl a-Hadith. He clarifies mixing and sitting with people who hold such belief and ideas, let alone cooperating with them. And if Shaykh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan is not from the Akabarin, then I don&#8217;t know who is! Let me warn you dear readers, this Fatwa is not for the faint hearted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Sayyid Nawab Muhamamd Siddiq Hasan Khan Rahimahullah (d.1370/1890) was asked:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) Will the scholars of the Din and the Shari’ah clarify: the muqallidin group who perform taqlid of only one Imam, are they considered to be from Ahl al-Sunnah or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) And is the prayer behind them valid or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Is it permissible or impermissible to let them enter our Masjid and to have sittings and mixing with them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muqallidin of this type in India who have the obvious trait of having enmity and hatred against the people who act on Hadith, hurling slanderous lies and false accusations against them, being irritated with them for saying Amin loudly, raising their hands, placing the hands on the chest and reciting al-Fatihah behind the Imam, which are all established and proven from the authentic ahadith, that are not abrogated and are from raised reports that are not figuratively explained. Likewise, those who commit innovations like Milad, Urs (annual commemorative celebrations for saints) and going into seclusion for 40 days (like Sufis do for meditation and maraqabah) as well numerous other innovations, then they are out of the fold of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah and are like the other deviated sects like the Jahmiyyah, Murjiyyah and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is because they oppose Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l Jama’ah in hundreds of issues, in both Aqidah and actions. In fact, at times some of their beliefs and actions seem to be exactly like that of the Jahmiyyah and the Murji’ah, which will not be hidden from the reader of this treatise. What is to follow, are a few example of the issues, with regards to their Aqidah and actions (a few examples from a whole catalogue) in order to support my claim concerning them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqa’id</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They believe Iman does not increase or decrease, in fact they believe the Iman of an open wicked sinner, the Iman of the Prophets and the Angels is on the same level and equal, which is the Madhhab of the Murji’ah, which is a sect from among the misguided deviated sects as Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal as written in his treatise on Aqidah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>SECONDLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They believe that in all issues of the Din it is obligatory and compulsory to do taqlid of only one Imam, even if it opposes and contradicts the Quran and Hadith, whereas the Hanafi scholars have declared this type of taqlid to be shirk and have discoursed this under the ayah, <strong>“They took their rabbis and monks as lords beside Allah.”</strong> (Surah al-Tawbah, 9:31).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THIRDLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we find from Tafsir Mazhari of Qadhi Thanullah Panipati that the doors of ijtihad were closed with the four Imams and no one can be a mujtahid now, as Fatawa Durr al-Mukhtar mentions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>FORTHLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Isa Alayhis Salam descends, he will do taqlid of Imam A’zam (i.e. Abu Hanifah and this point is mentioned in Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:34.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We see refuge in Allah from these corrupt beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ACTIONS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(They say and hold the view)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) It is permissible for the Muslims to take interest from the non-Muslims in Dar al-Harb (a land that Muslims are at war with) (Sharh Waqayah, 3:130 Urdu) as it is also mentioned in the Farsi translation of Hidayah, published in Nawal Kishore, 3:96. (Durr al-Mukhtar, 3:149-Urdu, 1:43-Arabic).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) If someone has a nose bleed and the bleeding does not stop, then it is permissible for him to write the Quran on his forehead with either urine or blood. This is their respect for the Qur’an (Alamghiri, Delhi Print, 5:134, Arabic 1:154, Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:120-Urdu, Alamghiri, 3:404)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Masturbation does not break the fast as Fatawa Qadhi Khan states as mentioned in volume 1. (Qadhi Khan, 4:361)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) If a person is very aroused and fears fornication, then masturbating is obligatory as Radd al-Mukhtar the notes to Durr al-Mukhtar, Mujtabia Delhi print, p.165.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) If a man wraps his private part (male organ) in a cloth and has sexual intercourse with a woman while fasting and if the cloth is strong, he doesn’t have to repeat the fast nor have a bath for ritual impurity, as is mentioned in Barahana printed Matb’a Husami Lahore, 2:18.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) If a man conducts a wedding ceremony, marrying a man from the west to a woman from the east (meaning there is a difference of one year of journey time by walking) and then the women gives birth in 6 months, the man from the west will be considered to be the father and this will be considered his karamah (i.e. Miracle) even though the man and woman have not met. As mentioned in Fath al-Qadir in the notes to Hidayah, Nawal Kishore, 2:338. (Tablighi Behshiti Zewar, p.240 Lahore)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) Any animal bred while eating pig meat, is Halal as Ghayatul Awthar urdu translation of Durr al-Mukhtar, Nawal Kishore print, 4:196, mentions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) The revenue generated from fornication (i.e. prostitution) is lawful as Chalpi notes to Sharh Waqayah, Nawal Kishore Print mentions, p.298 in the footnotes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) Tanning pig skin purifies it and selling it is also permissible, as Muniyyah al-Musalli, Lahore print, p.32 states (Arabic edn. P.49, Mujtabai print).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10) the permissibility of doing tricks with Zakat. Meaning that if a person gives his wealth to either his wife or gifts it someone else, before the year is complete with the intentions that he doesn’t need to pay zakat, and then the wealth is returned to him after the year is complete, then this is permissible. Imam Abu Yusuf used to do this (Ihya al-Ulum, Arabic Nawal Kishore, 1:11, Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:505, Alamghiri, 10:334-335)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">11) If a man enters (i.e. sexually) a four legged (i.e. Animal) or a dead person and he does not ejaculate, it does not break his fast nor does he have to make ghusl, as Fatawa Qadhi Khan states, Nawal Kishore print, 1:105.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">12) Legal punishments ordered by the Qadhi are implemented inwardly and outwardly. For example, if a person claims that another mans wife is his wife and he gives a false testimony and then wins the trial, the woman will be his. Therefore, she will be lawful for him according to Allah’s law and the people and it is permissible for him to sleep with her and he will not be imprisoned according to Allah’s law. (Hidayah Matba Mustafai, 2:125, Sharh Waqayah, 3:59),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">13) If a person deliberately passes wind after reciting the Tashahhud, his prayer will be complete. (Sharh Waqayah Arabic Matb’a Nawal Kishore, 1:43, urdu 1:401).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">14) If someone borrows someone’s female slave and then commits fornication with her, there is no legal punishment on him despite knowing the female servant is unlawful for him i.e. an illicit sexual relationship. Hidayah Farisi translation, Nawal Kishore, 2:302-303.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 2</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The prayer behind such muqallidin will not be permissible, because we find from what has preceded that the beliefs and actions of these people oppose the way of Ahl al-Sunnah, in fact some beliefs and actions necessitate shirk and some corrupt the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 3</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Letting such muqallidin into your Masajid is impressible according to the shari’ah according to the ayah <strong>“</strong><strong>Expel them from wherever they have expelled you.”</strong> (Surah al-Baqarah, 2:191) and according to the command in the ayah, <strong>“Then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people.”</strong> (Surah al-An’am, 6:68). Therefore, mixing with them, sitting with them, marrying them, being with them in times of sadness and other interactions and connections are all unlawful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be clearly noted the commissioner of Delhi reconciled both parties and also issued a written tract which both parties agreed too, curbing the animosity and to pray behind each other as long as the prayer in not invalidated in order to preserve peace and prevent chaos. However, the muqallidin rejected this reconciliation again and concocted some baseless points. So, they returned to their original ways and began issuing posters and treatise against the people of Tawhid without caring for the reconciliation agreement.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muqallidin argue, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong><em>&#8220;These people read a few books here and there and they think they have become Mujtahids of the era.&#8221;</em></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Jalil Samrudi (d.1393H) <em>Rahimahullah,</em> answers and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an old sickness of the muqallidin which they employ due to their desires, in order to declare the scholars of Ahl Al-Hadith ignorant and also a trick to deceive the ignorant people. They do not sense an accomplishment unless they say these words. It is stated in  &#8216;<em>Din al-Khalis&#8217;</em> (2:138) (Of Shaykh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;These people are extremely harsh with someone who issues a verdict according to the Quran and Sunnah, they declare him to be an ignorant person while ignoring his verdict due it to being contrary to the verdicts of their leaders whom they consider to be upon the truth.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;<small class="english">And those who have wronged are going to know to what [kind of] return they will be returned.&#8221; (al-Shu&#8217;ra:227)</small></span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is just idle speech and had they proven the Ahl al-Hadith were ignorant from the statements of scholars it would have been considered and looked into, is it not be the case and the opposite that the scholars have declared the muqallidin ignoramuses. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Qayyim said in <em>al-A&#8217;lam al-Muwaqi&#8217;een</em> (1:7)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Abu Amr (Ie ibn Ibn Abdul Barr) and other scholars said the people are agreed and have a consensus (Irma) that the muqallid is not considered to be from the people of knowledge.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Bakhtari said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;It is known the scholars are blessed with knowledge and the Ignorant people of taqlid said to the people of knowledge they were enemies.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Juwayni well known as Imam al-Haramayn said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The ruling on the muqallid is that he is a lay person (i.e. jahil)&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, no scholar has expressed taqlid to be knowledge and therefore one cannot ascertain points and views just by uttering them. Knowledge is what Allah and his Messenger ﷺ said and what the companions said and not anything contrary to this. Mulla Ai Qari said in<em> Sharh Fiqh al-Akbar,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Anything which does not have Akhbarana or Hadathana (i.e. he informed us or narrated a hadith to) are satanic whisperings.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And whoever wants to benefit further from such issues then let him refer to my treaties, <em>&#8216;al-Ba&#8217;ith al-hathith fi fadhal ilm al-hadith wa ahlila al-dahith&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;Irsal al-barid liqat&#8217;e lifa ahl al-taqlid wal-tardid liman as ahl  al-hadith ill awl al-jadid&#8217; </em></span></p>

<h2><strong>Someone Who Has Excelled in Studying a Madhhab Such that He Has Memorised It and Bases His Answers on it Alone is Not Called a Scholar but a Muqallid–So What of Someone Who Has Studied Nothing At All?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Questioner: </strong>A questioner is asking saying, ‘A Muslim who has memorised one of the four schools of thought and has accepted what it permits and [also what it] does not sanction, is it allowed for him to give a religious verdict based upon that to those who ask him questions?’</p>
<p><strong>Al-Albaani: </strong>It is not allowed for him to give a <em>fatwa</em> based upon what he has learned from his <em>madhhab </em>except by clarifying that it is the <em>madhhab </em>of so and so and not upon the basis that it is some knowledge which he has arrived at through his own personal study–because the blind-follower is not a scholar, the blind-follower is narrating what he has heard.</p>
<p>So based upon this he should say, ‘The answer to what you asked about according to the <em>madhhab</em> which I have studied is such and such,’ and he should not say, ‘The answer is such and such,’ because the difference between these two answers is that the second one, i.e., being resolute that the answer is such and such, this is the state of the scholar who is versed in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p><strong>As for the blind follower, even if he is from the major, from those who are assumed to be from the major scholars, as long as he is a blind-follower then he is not a scholar.</strong></p>
<p>In the opinion of the scholars, a scholar is the one who is as Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<p align="center"><em>“Knowledge is, “Allaah said … His Messenger said …</em><br />
<em>The Companions said …” and it is not hidden.”</em></p>
<p>This is the scholar.</p>
<p>As for a person who has spent his life studying the sayings of a particular<em>madhhab</em> without knowing whether its proofs are from the Book or the<em>Sunnah</em> or <em>ijmaa’</em> or <em>qiyaas</em>–then he is a blind-follower, and according to the agreement of the scholars, the blind-follower is called ignorant and is not called a scholar.</p>
<p>For this reason in the book of judgments found in the books of <em>fiqh</em> it is stated that, ‘… it is not allowed for a <em>jaahil </em>[an ignorant person] to be given the position of a judge,’ the scholar explaining this said, ‘Namely, the blind follower,’–however much he knows about his <em>madhhab</em> he is still a blind follower and is not a scholar for whom it is permissible to give a religious verdict [<em>fatwa</em>].</p>
<p>And from the fruits of this distinction between the real/true scholar and between what some of the blind-followers have aptly named a, ‘figurative/metaphorical scholar’, i.e., a blind-follower, the difference between these two is that the real/true scholar gives a religious verdict based upon proof, he either says, ‘Allaah said,’ or ‘Allaah’s Messenger said,’ or ‘The consensus [<em>ijmaa’</em>] in this is …’ or he says, ‘There is no text [concerning the issue at hand] but I’m just giving my opinion, and this is my <em>ijtihaad</em>, and whoever has something better than it, let him bring it to us.’</p>
<p>As for the metaphorical/figurative scholar, i.e., the blind-follower, he is the one who gives an answer based upon his <em>madhhab</em>–and since the common folk do not differentiate between true/real knowledge and metaphorical knowledge, then this metaphorical scholar has to say, ‘My <em>madhhab</em> is such and such,’ and he should not say, ‘The answer is such and such,’–<strong>because he is not acquainted [with true knowledge] and he does not know.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Shaikh Shah Waliullahs Dehlawi’s (1176H) Inclination in Fiqh and his Hanafiyyah </strong></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>al-Allamah Shaikh Muhammad Ismaeel Salafi (1378H)</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaikh Shah Waliullah and those who were upon his way did not want to staunchly restrict themselves to any one school of thought in terms of their beliefs, principles and fiqh. They wanted to act upon the issues which were presented by scholars of hadith and the four madhabs without any restrictions or obligations. Although he apparently was a Hanafi [1] he preferred to give precedence to the positions of the scholars of hadith and the Shafi’s.</p>
<p>In current times the deobandis show great reverence and affiliation with Shaikh Shah Waliullah and his family however their actions, inclinations and thought processes are in total contradiction and in opposition to the thoughts and understanding of Shaikh Shah Waliullah, his family and his followers.</p>
<p>The Deoband (ie their school) of today is almost entirely indifferent from the Barelwis of today and any differences between them are merely polemics.</p>
<p>We will find from the following clarifications the extent of Shaikh Shah Waliullah digressive thinking with regards to his fiqh and the sheer restriction and staunchness of the deobandis. They cannot bear to hear anything negative about themselves whereas Shaikh Shah Waliullah did not tire and abstain from practising and acting upon the Shafi madhab.</p>
<h3><b>The Hadith of Qulatain</b></h3>
<p>There is huge difference of opinion between the Shafis and the Hanafis with regards to the purification of water and the Hadith of the Qulatain is at the forefront of this. The hanafis say the Hadith is mudhtarib (confused) and the Shafis understand it to be authentic. So Shaikh Shah Waliullah understood that the Hanafi and Maliki elders did not come across the ahadith or their understanding was erroneous.</p>
<p>He says, “The Hadith of Qulatain is authentic and has been transmitted via numerous routes.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/117).</p>
<p>Meaning the doubts and discussions that arose due to this Hadith pertaining to purification, Shaikh Shah Waliullah favoured and sided with the shafis and excused the hanafis and malikis on the basis that the Hadith was not widespread in earlier times.</p>
<h3><b>Reciting Fatihah Behind The Imam</b></h3>
<p>This disagreement between the hanafis and shafis, wether to recite fatihah behind the imam is famous and numerous treatises have been authored on this subject. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“The individual praying behind the imam, it is obligatory for him to listen and to remain silent (ie not to recite loudly). If the Imam recites loudly then he should recite between the pauses. If the imam is reciting quietly then he may recite as he wishes. However he should not recite the Fatihah loudly so that it contends and mixes with the recitation of the imam. The first way is what I prefer (ie reciting between the pauses) and this is how we reconcile the ahadith in this regard.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/7)</p>
<p>There is balance in Shaikh Shah Waliullahs statement as he does not prefer the staunchness from both parties (ie to either remain totally silent or to recite the Fatihah loudly and contend with the imam)</p>
<h3><b>Raf ul-Yadain and Witr</b></h3>
<p>Shaikh Shah Waliullah said whilst discussing raising of the hands whilst going into ruku and the witr prayer, he said,</p>
<p>“The truth according to me is that this sunnah is optional wether to pray one rakah witr or three and raising of the hands is better then not raising as their are numerous ahadith for raising of the hands and they are established. A person should not get hung up about and cause dissension for himself.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/8)</p>
<p>It is apparent during those times such acts caused animosity and hence his statement was an encouragement to both sides.</p>
<h3><b>Travelling to Visit Graves.</b></h3>
<p>It is common amongst the people to undertake long journeys to visit graves of holy people and their mausoleum. They would do this just as if they were going on Hajj. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“The truth according to me is that visiting (ie undertaking a journey) graves, a place of worship of a wali and mount Toor are prohibited to visit and they are equal in their prohibition.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/153)</p>
<p>The deobandis and barelwis who love visiting graves speak very fervently about his topic but Shaikh Shah Waliullah position is in concurrence with that of Shaikh ul-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and other Imams of Tawhid.</p>
<h3><b>Nullifiers of Wudu</b></h3>
<p>The jurists differ over what nullifies wudu and Shaikh Shah Waliullah’s position is,</p>
<p>“The Asal ie the fundamental reason that obligates wudu is what is expelled from the two private parts and everything other than this is returned to this principle.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/149)</p>
<h3><b>Witr</b></h3>
<p>There is difference of opinion concerning the witr. The Hanafi jurists say they are obligatory whereas the scholars of Hadith say they are Sunnah. Shaikh Shah Waliullah’s position is,</p>
<p>“The truth is that witr are Sunnah mu’akidah (to be performed with designation) and Ali, Ibn Umar and Ubadah as-Samit (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) expounded them to be Sunnah.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/13)</p>
<h3><b>Qunut</b></h3>
<p>The Hanafi jurists consider the Qunut in the witr prayer to be obligatory where as the Shafis consider the Qunut in the fajr prayer to be obligatory, Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“There is difference of opinion regarding the ahadith and also amongst the position of the companions and the successors about the Qunut in the fajr prayer, according to me reciting or not reciting the Qunut is optional except during a great calamity where a few words are to be said before the ruku which is what I prefer as the ahadith establish the dua against the tribe of ra’al and Dhakwan as was later abandoned. This is not a text that totally abrogates the Qunut however it must be remembered that the Qunut is Sunnah that is not to be continuous forever.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/9)</p>
<h3><b>Combining Prayers</b></h3>
<p>The jurists differ whether to combine the prayers due to a reason, the hanafis believe it is not permissible to combine the prayers at all, whether at the earlier time or the later time and Jam Suri (apparent combining) is not even really combining but a form of combining. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said there are essentially 3 times for prayer, Asr is extracted form Dhuhr and Isha from Maghrib thereby reducing the prayer time between the 2 prayers and reducing laziness from Dhikr, he said</p>
<p>“The one with the shariah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) combined both at the earlier and later time but he did not order for this to be practised regularly nor emphasised it, just as he did not emphasise on the delayed prayers.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/18)</p>
<h3><b>The Takbirs For Eid</b></h3>
<p>The Hanafi jurists the Ahlul Hadith jurists differ over the number of takbirs for the eid prayer and the method of the eid prayer. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“There are 7 takbirs in the first rakah before the recitation and 5 takbirs before the recitation (just as the people of Haramain do ie the Ahlul Hadith) however the practise of the Kufiyeen [2], (ie the hanafis) say there are 4 takbirs before the recitation just like the funeral prayer and 5 takbirs after the recitation in the second rakah, however the Sunnah and the practice of al-Harmain (ie the people of Makkah and Madinah) is given precedence.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 2/23)</p>
<h3><b>Amount of Water</b></h3>
<p>The Hanafi and Shafi jurists differ with regards the quantity of water (for purification). The later Hanafi jurists quantify it as 2 large quantities (Dardah) whereas the Shafis say 2 Qulatain. So if a water well becomes impure there is some strange and obtuse Qiyas in how to purify the well with large buckets. Shaikh Shah Waliullah said,</p>
<p>“There is nothing in this discussion which is reliable or anything obligatory that should be acted upon.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/217)</p>
<p>Then he said,</p>
<p>“The scholars have long debated the amount of water in a well containing a dead animal and if the water is flowing, however nothing is reported from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in this regard.” (Hujatullah al-Balighah 1/147)</p>
<p>There are numerous issues Shaikh Shah Waliullah has cited in his Hujatullah, Musfa and Muswa in which he has sided with the Shafi and Ahlul Hadith jurists, which clearly highlights that he was far from staunch bigotry and did not favour narrow mindedness (to remain within the madhab). We also find that the earlier Hanafi scholars in general were not as bigoted and staunch as they are today. This bigotry started in the 4th century and gained prominence right up to the 9th century.</p>
<p>The fundamental way in preventing and reprimanding innovations is to follow the way of the Salaf. Taqlid of the Imams also played a part preventing the spread of innovation however with this came the bigotry of the reverence of these individuals. Due the variant opinions of the companions and following the way of Salaf based on the greater benefit it is highly unlikely that bigotry would take hold.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Taken from Tehrik Azad Fikr (pg.74-80)</span></p>
<p>Translator notes</p>
<p><em>[1] Here Shaikh Salafi is referring Shaikh Shah Waliullah being a Hanafi based on the understanding of how the Hanafi scholars of the past were for example Imam Tahawi, Imam Ibn Abil Izz etcetera in that they were not staunch and bigoted. </em></p>
<p><em>[2] This is a another important clarification that if Shaikh Shah Waliullah was a Hanafi in the sense the current day hanafis understand Hanafiyyah and then he would not have said kufiyeen ie referring to the Hanafi scholars. It is also evident from the style of the language that he did not count himself from amongst the hanafis as they see it. It however cannot be denied that his main learning and understanding was the Hanafi madhab and this is what we believe. Yet, it is biased to label him Hanafi as the current day hanafis label themselves to be Hanafi as their is a stark difference and even this small article has demonstrated that.</em></p>
