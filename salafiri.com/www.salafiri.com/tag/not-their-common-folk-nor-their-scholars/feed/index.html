				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Q: Al &#8216;Allaamah Shaikh Saalih Al Fawzaan (hafithahullah) was asked during his explanation of the book Ighaathatul Lahfaan Min Masaa&#8217;idish Shaytaan 1/14/1435 H.O noble Shaikh -may Allah give you success- is it permissible to sit with the common-folk of the people of innovation?</strong></p>
<p>A: There is no good in them. Do not sit (with them), NOT their common-folk nor their scholars except in the case where you want to explain to them and clarify to them their innovation so that perhaps they will abandon it.</p>
