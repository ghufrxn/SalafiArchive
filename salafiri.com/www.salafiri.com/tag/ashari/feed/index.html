				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<h3><span style="color: #000080">Hadith No. 7443</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Yusuf bin Musa narrated to me: Abu Usamah narrated to me from Al-A&#8217;mash, from Khaythamah, from &#8216;Adiy bin Hatim who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;There is none amongst you except that his Rabb will speak to him, there will be no interpreter between them nor a veil to veil Him.&#8221; </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left">
<h3 style="text-align: left"><span style="color: #000080">Explanation of Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him)</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">And in this Hadith is a refutation of those that speak with &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217;¹, and its meaning is that Allah will introduce speech (yuhdithu al-qawl) in that Hour, He speaks to the one who is alone with him in that Hour, and those that speak with &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217; (i.e., the Asha&#8217;irah) say: &#8220;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi is eternal, however, Allah creates sounds when He wishes for someone to hear, and it is an expression from Al-Kalam An-Nafsi.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And on account of this, some of the intelligent said: The Madhab of the Asha&#8217;irah regarding the Speech [of Allah] is the Madhab of the Jahmiyyah, rather it is even worse! For verily they say that which is heard [in recitation] and that which is written in the Masahif is created, and it is [nothing more than] an expression from the [true] Speech of Allah, and as for the Speech of Allah then it is that which is in His Self, it is not heard and He does not speak when He wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the Jahmiyyah, then they said, &#8220;That which is heard is the Speech of Allah in reality, however it is created.&#8221; So who is closer to that which is correct? The Jahmiyyah, and this is the reason they said, &#8216;The speech of the Asha&#8217;irah regarding the Speech [of Allah] is worse than the speech of the Jahmiyyah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the reality of the matter, then there is no difference between them and the Jahmiyyah, for verily they are in agreement that what was heard by Muhammad ﷺ, and what was heard by Musa (Peace be upon him), and what will be heard in the future is all created. But the Asha&#8217;irah say that is an &#8216;Ibarah (Expression)² from Al-Kalam An-Nafsi, and these people say: &#8220;No! Rather it (the Speech of Allah) is a creation that He created, He created sounds which are heard, and He attributed them to His Self as a way of honouring and venerating.&#8221; &#8211; So this Hadith clearly refutes those that claim that the Speech of Allah is [just] the Meaning established eternally within His Self, and they have narrated that the Speech [of Allah] is like [His] Knowledge or [His] Will.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>(Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin, Sharh Kitab At-Tawhid min Sahih Al-Bukhari p. 437, 438,<br />
Dar Al-Kalim At-Tayyib, 1st Edn.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Translators Notes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>&#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi:&#8217; </strong>The Asha&#8217;irah reject that Allah has volitional actions (actions tied to His will), and this led to their belief in &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217;, the corrupt belief that Allah does not speak, rather the &#8216;Speech (Kalam)&#8217; is merely a single indivisible meaning which is established in His Essence &#8211; as for the Qur&#8217;an that we have with us which is written in the Mushaf and memorised by all Muslims, then it is <strong>created</strong> and merely an &#8216;Expression (&#8216;Ibarah)&#8217; of the Meaning which subsists within the Essence of Allah. Some went as far as claiming the Qur&#8217;an we have with us is the speech of Jibreel (Peace be upon him), rather than the Speech of Allah! Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;The Ash&#8217;ariyyah say: What is in the Mushaf is not the Speech of Allah, rather it is an &#8216;Ibarah (Expression) from Him [&#8230;] and these letters which are in the Qur&#8217;an, and the sounds which the Messenger heard, or Jibreel heard, verily it is created.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sharh Fath Al-Bariyyah bi-Talkhis Al-Hamawiyyah p. 314)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Madhab of Ahlus-Sunnah regarding the Speech of Allah: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu &#8216;Uthman As-Sabuni said, &#8220;And the Ahlul-Hadith testify and believe that the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah and His Book, and His Revelation, and that which He revealed is uncreated, and whoever speaks with its creation (i.e., that the Qur&#8217;an is created) and believes in it is a Kafir according to them.&#8221; <em>(Aqidatu&#8217;s Salaf wa Ashabu&#8217;l Hadith p. 165, Dar Al-&#8216;Asimah)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Muhammad bin Isma&#8217;il Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;I met more than 1000 men from the People of Knowledge: [From] the People of Hijaz, and Makkah, and Madinah, and Kufa, and Basrah, and Wasit, and Baghdad, and Sham (Levantine Region), and Misr (Egypt) [&#8230;] and I did not see one of them differ on these matters: [&#8230;] and that the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah, uncreated&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad of Imam Al-Lalaka&#8217;i 1/273-274, Dar Al-Lu&#8217;lua)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Abu Zur&#8217;ah and Abu Hatim Ar-Raziyayn said, &#8220;We reached the scholars of all the cities, in Hijaz, &#8216;Iraq, Sham, Yemen, and from their Madhab was: Al-&#8216;Iman is speech and action, it increases and it decreases, and the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah, uncreated from all aspects [&#8230;] and whoever claims that the Qur&#8217;an is created then he is a disbeliever in Allah Al-&#8216;Adhim, with a disbelief that removes him from the Religion, and whoever doubts his disbelief &#8211; from those that understand [this issue] &#8211; then he is [also] a disbeliever&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad of Imam Al-Lalaka&#8217;i 1/278-282, Dar Al-Lu&#8217;lua)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Ibn Battah narrated from Imam Ahmad who said, &#8220;And whoever says that verily Allah will not be seen in the Hereafter, then he is a Jahmi who has surely disbelieved&#8221; and &#8220;They will look at their Rabb, and He will look at them, and they will speak to Him, and He will speak to them, However He wills, Whenever He wills.&#8221; <em>(Al-Ibanah &#8216;an Shari&#8217;atu&#8217;l Firqatu&#8217;n Najiyah #47-48, Dar Al-Rayah)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Harb Al-Kirmani, companion of Imam Ahmad and Ishaq bin Rahuyah, transmitted consensus on this issue saying, &#8220;And the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah by which He speaks, uncreated, so whoever claims that the Qur&#8217;an is created then he is a Jahmi Kafir.&#8221; <em>(Ijma As-Salaf fi&#8217;l-I&#8217;tiqad p. 64, Dar Al-Imam Ahmad)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;Ahlus-Sunnah w&#8217;al-Jama&#8217;ah have agreed upon that Allah speaks, and His Speech is an Attribute in truth, established for Him in a manner which is befitting for Him. And He, Exalted is He, speaks with letters and sounds, however He wills, whenever He wills, and His Speech is an attribute of His Essence (Sifat Dhatiyyah) in terms of genus, and it is an attribute of action (Sifat Fi&#8217;liyyah) in terms of occurrences.&#8221;</strong> He commented on his own speech, explaining, &#8220;This is because it is connected to His Will, and every attribute connected to His Will is an attribute of action, and Speech in its essence is an attribute of the Essence, for verily Allah has not ceased and does not cease to be One that Speaks.&#8221; <em>(Sharh Fath Al-Bariyyah bi-Talkhis Al-Hamawiyyah p. 303, 304) </em></li>
</ol>
<p>² Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilani said, &#8220;So whoever claims that it (the Qur&#8217;an) is created, or an &#8216;Ibarah, or that the recitation is other than what is recited, or he says: &#8216;My articulation of the Qur&#8217;an is created&#8217;, then he is a disbeliever in Allah Almighty, he is not to be mingled with, or fed, or married, or neighboured&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Al-Ghunya li-Talibi 1/128, Dar Al-Kutub Al-&#8216;Ilmiyyah)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Setting the Foundations</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hamza Yusuf</strong></span> in a youtube video attempts to misue the hadith, &#8220;<strong>Verily you shall conquer Constantinople. What a wonderful leader will her (army) leader be, and what a wonderful army will that army be</strong>&#8221; to claim Allah&#8217;s Messenger Prophecised this blessed leader will be Sultan Muhammad Fatih (Mehmed II) and since he was a Maturidi, Allah&#8217;s Messenger ﷺ blessed the Maturidiyyah!!! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hamza Yusuf </strong></span>begins by stating the Muslims had no councils to determine what orthodoxy is and isn’t, this sets the foundations for his later claim that the Ummah agreed upon 3 schools of Aqidah (Ash’ariyyah, Maturidiyyah, Athariyyah), and all praise is for Allah who gave us proofs to follow the Salaf in his Majestic Book:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>And the foremost to embrace Islâm of the Muhâjirûn (those who migrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and the Ansâr (the citizens of Al-Madinah who helped and gave aid to the Muhâjirûn) and also those who followed them exactly (in Faith). Allâh is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success. [At-Tawbah : 100]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">And as has come in the <strong>Sunnah</strong> regarding the excellence of the Salaf:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">A man asked the Prophet ﷺ which of the people are best, He ﷺ said, “The generation I am in, then the second (after) then the third (after them).” (<strong>Sahih Muslim</strong> no.2536)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">So once the superiority of the Salaf has been established, we can return to the works of the Salaf and their students who wrote <strong>Ijma’ (consensus)</strong> works establishing the true Aqidah of Ahlus-Sunnah and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>compare this to the Aqidah of the latecomers of the Asha’irah and Maturidis who followed their forefathers from the Jahmiyyah in the Sifat of Allah (attributes)</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Abu Hatim and Abu Zur’ah (Ar-Raziyayn)</strong> said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“We reached the scholars of all the cities of <strong>Hijaz, Iraq, Egypt, Sham, and Yemen, and this was from their madhab (position)</strong>: Iman is speech and action, increasing and decreasing….And they also prohibited from joining the sittings of Ahlul-Kalam and looking into the books of the Mutakallimin, and they both would say: “Sahibul Kalam will not be successful, ever.” (<strong>Aqidah ar-Raziyayn: Sharh Usool Al-I&#8217;tiqad Ahlus Sunnah</strong> of Lalaka&#8217;i 1:137, (Dar Al-Hadith: Cairo, 1420H/2003CE)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">This shows agreement of the Salaf on matters of belief and the fundamentals of Islam; this was the orthodoxy of the Muslims and what they unanimously agreed upon on matters of belief.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">And <strong>Imam</strong> <strong>Harb b. Isma’il</strong>, the Scholar of Kirman, companion of Imam Ahmad, said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“This is the madhab of Imams of knowledge and the people of athar and Ahlus Sunnah who are known to hold onto it and who are followed in it from the Companions of the Prophet Sallalahu alayhi Wasallam until our time. And I met whoever I was able to meet from the scholars of <strong>Iraq, Hijaz, Sham</strong> and other lands and whoever opposed anything from these Madhahib or critices them or faults those who adopt it then he is an opposer, an innovator who leaves the Jama’ah and deviated from the Manhaj of the Sunnah and the path of truth…” (Harb b. Isma’il al-Kirmani, <strong>Ijma’ As-Salaf Fil I’tiqad</strong> of (p.33-34), Dar Al-Imam Ahmad, 2nd Edition, 1433H/2012CE)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">He continued and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“Al-Iman is in speech, deeds, intention, and holding onto the Sunnah.” And “Whoever claims that ma’rifah (i.e. acknowledgment of iman) in the heart benefits even if he does not speak with it then he is a Jahmi” (<strong>Ijma As-Salaf fil I&#8217;tiqad</strong>, (p.35-39)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">This book by <strong>Imam</strong> <strong>al-Kirmani</strong> who died in <strong>280H</strong> was authored as based on the consensus of the Salaf on matters of Aqidah or Creed, which again shows the Salaf and Ahlus Sunnah had an established, clear and well outlined belief system which nullifies the need to have some Christian equivalent counsel!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">And <strong>Imam Al-Bukhari</strong> says in his <strong>Sahih,</strong> a book which has been accepted by the entire Ummah, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“And it [Iman] is Speech and action, and it increases and decreases.” (<strong>Sahih Al-Bukhari, Kitab ul-Iman</strong>, (1:193), Dar At-Ta&#8217;seel, 1433H/2012CE)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #333300;"> And <strong>Abu Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Sallam</strong> wrote, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“And I looked into the ikhtilaf of the two groups (on the matter of Iman), then I found that the Kitab and Sunnah both confirm the group that deemed Iman to be Niyyah and Speech and Action, entirely.” (Abu Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Sallam: <strong>Kitab ul-Iman</strong> of (p.10), Maktabah Al-Islami, 2nd Edition, 1403H/1983CE)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">And verily this work of his (<strong>Kitab Al-Iman</strong>) was authored before Al-Maturidi was even born.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #003300;"><img class=" wp-image-9377 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1.png?resize=384%2C576" alt="Picture 1" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1.png?resize=200%2C300 200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1.png?resize=768%2C1153 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1.png?resize=682%2C1024 682w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1.png?w=818 818w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">And <strong>Abu Mansur Al-Maturidi</strong> in his<strong> Kitab At-Tawhid</strong> discussing Iman, says it is ‘Tasdeeq’ i.e. belief of the heart, and it is clear that the Maturidis are in agreement with the Jahmiyyah that Iman is a matter of the heart alone, with slight differing (i.e. Ma’rifah or Tasdeeq), and from these points it is evident that the Maturidis (along with their Ash’ari counterparts) are most definitely not from some sort of 3 standardised schools of Ahlus-Sunnah as the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sufi Hamza Yusuf</span></strong> tries to claim, rather they are from the extreme murji’ah and directly went against the consensus of the Salaf in many matters pertaining to Aqidah. Now we have established that the Salaf and their students indeed did pen down works on what is Orthodox Islamic Creed, and the latecomers from Ahlul-Kalam were in clear opposition to this creed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Imam al-Bukhari</strong> in on record for saying,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"> “I met more than <strong>1000 men</strong> from the people of knowledge, from the people of <strong>Hijaz, Makkah, Madinah, Kufah, Basrah, Wasit, Baghdad, Sham and Misr</strong>…..and not a single one of them differed regarding these affairs….” (Al-Lalaka’i, <strong>Sharh Usul I’tiqad</strong>, 1:361+ (Riyadh/Madinah, an-Nashiral-Mutamayyiz/ Dar un-Nasihah, 1436H/2015CE)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Imam al-Bukhari</strong> mentions some of the names of the great scholars he met and took Aqidah from and details his visitation to the various Muslims lands, even the number of times he visited the vast Muslim cities, all to show the unanimous agreement of the Muslims on aspects of belief or what Hamza Yusuf refers to as orthodoxy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Imam Al-Lalaka’i</strong> himself in his book <strong>Sharh Usul al-I’tiqad</strong> sets out to establish the clear belief the Companions and Successors were upon with clear and precise evidence and he has entries for numerous scholars and their orthodox beliefs and he died in <strong>418H</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">From the time before <strong>Imam al-A’jurri</strong> was from <strong>360H</strong> and he clarifies in his book <strong>ash-Shari&#8217;ah</strong> the deviation of the misguided sects and the group or the Jama’ah upon the correct belief system, way before the structured formation of the Ash’ari or Maturidi creedal systems.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">There are a plethora of books that establish and clarify the agreed and ratified belief system of Ahlus Sunnah, much earlier and before the Ash’ari or Maturidi schools were established!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hamza Yusuf</span></strong> further contradicts himself when he said in the introduction of his translation of <strong>The Creed of Imam al-Tahawi</strong> where he said, <strong>“For centuries, Muslims followed simple, concise doctrinal texts that unified them and prevented from falling prey to those who would challenge the central tenets of faith.”</strong> (The Creed of Imam al-Tahahwi, (p.8)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hamza Yusuf</span> </strong>continues and says,<span style="color: #ff0000;">“So, the Prophet was praising a Hanafi, Maturidi, Naqshbandi…” Verily, you shall conquer Constantinople. What a wonderful army that army will be, and what a wonderful commander that commander will be. [The narration used]</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">It is not uncommon to see <strong>Ahlul Kalam – Ash’ari and Maturidis</strong> desperately citing this narration as the Prophet ﷺ praising a Maturidi, and thus evidence the Maturidi creed is upon the truth and an acceptable school of Aqidah. Those that possess any intellect would be able to see through this faulty appeal on multiple levels. In reality this has become somewhat of a compulsive and repugnant behaviour with them which is ultimately the result of bigoted partisanship and blind following<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>A Look at the Sanad</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">The narration transmitted in Al-Bukhari’s, <strong>at-Tarikh al-Kabir</strong> (2:441 no.1754) (an-Nashir al-Mutamayyiz: Riyadh:1440H/2019) and in <strong>Musnad Ahmad</strong> (31:287 no.18957) (ar-Risalah al-A’lamiyyah: Dimashq, 1436H/2015CE) is with the following chain</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: right;"><span style="color: #333300;">قَالَ لِي مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ الْعَلاءِ ، قَالَ : حَدَّثَنَا زَيْدُ بْنُ حُبَابٍ ، حَدَّثَنَا الْوَلِيدُ بْنُ الْمُغِيرَةِ الْمَعَافِرِيُّ ، عَنْ عُبَيْدِ بْنِ بِشْرٍ الْغَنَوِيِّ ، عَنْ أَبِيهِ ، سَمِعَ النَّبِيَّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ يَقُولُ : &#8221; لَتُفْتَحَنَّ القسطنطينية فَلَنِعْمَ الأَمِيرُ أَمِيرُهَا وَلَنِعْمَ الْجَيْشُ ذَلِكَ الْجَيْشُ  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Zayd b. Hubab </strong>(Trustworthy, Kufan)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;"><em>from</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Walid b. Mughira </strong>(Trustworthy, Egyptian)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;"><em>from</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Ubayd b. Bishr </strong>(Majhool, Kufan)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">One can immediately see that a Kufan is narrating from an Egyptian, from a Kufan again, the first point we can ponder on. Furthermore, Zayd b. Hubab is alone in narrating this from Walid, i.e., he is the exclusive narrator. Furthermore, Walid b. Mughira is exclusively narrating from Ubayd or Abdullah b. Bishr, who is <strong>Majhool</strong>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #333399;">Shaykh Shu&#8217;ayb Arna&#8217;ut in his Tahqiq of Musnad Ahmad (31:287 no.18957) (ar-Risalah al-A’lamiyyah: Dimashq, 1436H/2015CE)</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Considering these factors, the narration has been weakened by <strong>Shaykh Al-Albani</strong>, <strong>Shaykh Arna’ut</strong>, and <strong>Shaykh Ahmed Shakir</strong>. Nothing more than <strong>Ahlul-Bid’ah</strong> clutching straws to find ways to defend their beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">The narrations authenticity is doubtful and at the very most it is questionable. Although some people like <strong>Muhammad Hamud at-Tasamani</strong> said the hadith was Hasan in <strong>al-Fawa’id as-Saniyyah Min al-Hadith al-Waridah Fi al-Qustantiniyyah</strong> (p.72), Shirkah Dar ul-Basha’ir al-Islamiyyah: Beirut, 1440H/2019CE). He further repeats the claim of this prophecy is for Sultan Muhammad Fatih al-Uthmani who conquered Constantinople   </span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Other narrations regarding the Conquest of Constantinople </strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Abu Hurairah</strong> Radhi Alahu Anhu reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam saying:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">You have heard about a city, one side of which is on land and the other is in the sea (Constantinople). They said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, yes. Thereupon he said: The Last Hour would not come unless seventy thousand persons from Bani lshaq would attack it. When they would land there, they will neither fight with weapons nor would shower arrows but would only say: &#8220;There is no god but Allah and Allah is the Greatest,&#8221; and one side of it would fall. Thaur (one of the narrators) said: I think that he said: The part by the side of the ocean. Then they would say for the second time: &#8220;There is no god but Allah and Allah is the Greatest&#8221; and the second side would also fall, and they would say: &#8220;There is no god but Allah and Allah is the Greatest,&#8221; and the gates would be opened for them and they would enter therein and, they would be collecting spoils of war and distributing them amongst themselves when a noise would be heard saying: Verily, Dajjal has come. And thus they would leave everything there and go back. (<strong>Sahih Muslim</strong> (no.2920)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">This authentic narration regarding the conquest of Constantinople can be found in Sahih Muslim, and this narration establishes that that the conquest will be during end-times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Another authentic narration from <strong>Anas b. Malik:</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">&#8220;Constantinople will be conquered with the coming of the Hour.&#8221; (<strong>Jami at-Tirmidhi</strong> (no.2239), Sahih in Mawqoof form)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Shaikh Zubair Ali Za’i</strong> was asked,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Question:</strong> Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said, “The first army from my Ummah that wages jihad on the sea, Paradise is guaranteed for them”. (<strong>Sahih al-Bukhari</strong> (no.2924). Was Mu’awiyyah (Raḍi Allāhū ʾAnhū) the first to wage Jihad on the ocean (/sea)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Answer:</strong> <strong>Mu’awiyyah b. Abi Sufyan</strong> (Raḍi Allāhū ʾAnhū) participated in this first Jihad on the ocean. (<strong>Sahih al-Bukhari</strong>, (no.2799-2800).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">This Jihad occurred during the Caliphate of Mu’awiyyah (Raḍi Allāhū ʾAnhū). (<strong>Sahih al-Bukhari</strong>, (no.6282-6283) Wal-Hamdulillah. (<strong>Al-Hadith Magazine, Issue</strong> <strong>27</strong>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Shaikh Zubair Ali Za’i</strong> further explains in his <strong>Tahqiqi Maqalat (1:305+)</strong>.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>War Expedition to Constantinople and the Virtue of Mu&#8217;awiyyah RadhiAllahu Anhu</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: right;"><span style="color: #333300;">حَدَّثَنِي إِسْحَاقُ بْنُ يَزِيدَ الدِّمَشْقِيُّ، حَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى بْنُ حَمْزَةَ، قَالَ حَدَّثَنِي ثَوْرُ بْنُ يَزِيدَ، عَنْ خَالِدِ بْنِ مَعْدَانَ، أَنَّ عُمَيْرَ بْنَ الأَسْوَدِ الْعَنْسِيَّ، حَدَّثَهُ أَنَّهُ، أَتَى عُبَادَةَ بْنَ الصَّامِتِ وَهْوَ نَازِلٌ فِي سَاحِلِ حِمْصَ، وَهْوَ فِي بِنَاءٍ لَهُ وَمَعَهُ أُمُّ حَرَامٍ، قَالَ عُمَيْرٌ فَحَدَّثَتْنَا أُمُّ حَرَامٍ أَنَّهَا سَمِعَتِ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَقُولُ ‌‏ أَوَّلُ جَيْشٍ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَغْزُونَ الْبَحْرَ قَدْ أَوْجَبُوا ‏&#8221;‌‏.‏ قَالَتْ أُمُّ حَرَامٍ قُلْتُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ أَنَا فِيهِمْ‏.‏ قَالَ ‏‏ أَنْتِ فِيهِمْ ‏&#8221;‌‏.‏ ثُمَّ قَالَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏&#8221;‏ أَوَّلُ جَيْشٍ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَغْزُونَ مَدِينَةَ قَيْصَرَ مَغْفُورٌ لَهُمْ ‏&#8221;‌‏.‏ فَقُلْتُ أَنَا فِيهِمْ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ‏.‏ قَالَ ‏لاَ</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Khalid b. Madan: That Umayr b. Al-Aswad Al-Anasi told him that he went to Ubadah b. As-Samit while he was staying in his house at the sea-shore of Hims with (his wife) Umm Haram. Umayr said. Umm Haram informed us that she heard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, &#8220;Paradise is granted to the first group of my followers who will undertake a naval expedition.&#8221; Umm Haram added, I said, &#8216;Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)! Will I be amongst them?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;You are amongst them.&#8217; The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, &#8216;The first army amongst&#8217; my followers who will invade Caesar&#8217;s City (Constantinople) will be forgiven their sins.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Will I be one of them, Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)?&#8217; He replied in the negative.&#8221; (<strong>Sahih al-Bukhari</strong> (no.2924)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">There were attacks on Caesars city (i.e. Constantinople) during the era of the <strong>Companions.</strong> Historically we find the following expeditions,</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong> 1. Mu&#8217;awiyyah RadhiAllahu Anhu </strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">He led an expedition in 32H (<strong>Tarikh Tabari</strong> (4/304), <strong>al-Ibar</strong> of al-Dhahabi (1/24), <strong>al-Muntazam</strong> of Ibn al-Jawzi (5/19), <strong>al-Bidayah</strong> (7/166).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">We also learn that he attacked the Constantinople and other Roman lands 16 times between the years 48H and 52H. (<strong>Al-Bidayah</strong> 8/133).</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong> 2. Sufyan b. Awf RadhiAllahu Anhu</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">In 48H (<strong>al-Isabah</strong> 2/56). This view was also mentioned by <strong>Muhammad al-Khudayri</strong> in his book <strong>Muhadharat al-Umam al-Islamiyyah</strong> (2/114). He was sent by Mu&#8217;awiyyah RadhiAllahu Anhu.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong> 3. Abd al-Rahman b. Khalid b. Al-Walid</strong></span></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">حَدَّثَنَا أَحْمَدُ بْنُ عَمْرِو بْنِ السَّرْحِ، حَدَّثَنَا ابْنُ وَهْبٍ، عَنْ حَيْوَةَ بْنِ شُرَيْحٍ، وَابْنِ، لَهِيعَةَ عَنْ يَزِيدَ بْنِ أَبِي حَبِيبٍ، عَنْ أَسْلَمَ أَبِي عِمْرَانَ، قَالَ ‏:‏ غَزَوْنَا مِنَ الْمَدِينَةِ نُرِيدُ الْقُسْطَنْطِينِيَّةَ، وَعَلَى الْجَمَاعَةِ عَبْدُ الرَّحْمَنِ بْنُ خَالِدِ بْنِ الْوَلِيدِ وَالرُّومُ مُلْصِقُو ظُهُورِهِمْ بِحَائِطِ الْمَدِينَةِ، فَحَمَلَ رَجُلٌ عَلَى الْعَدُوِّ فَقَالَ النَّاسُ ‏:‏ مَهْ، مَهْ، لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ، يُلْقِي بِيَدَيْهِ إِلَى التَّهْلُكَةِ ‏.‏ فَقَالَ أَبُو أَيُّوبَ ‏:‏ إِنَّمَا نَزَلَتْ هَذِهِ الآيَةُ فِينَا مَعْشَرَ الأَنْصَارِ لَمَّا نَصَرَ اللَّهُ نَبِيَّهُ وَأَظْهَرَ الإِسْلاَمَ، قُلْنَا ‏:‏ هَلُمَّ نُقِيمُ فِي أَمْوَالِنَا وَنُصْلِحُهَا، فَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى ‏{‏ وَأَنْفِقُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلاَ تُلْقُوا بِأَيْدِيكُمْ إِلَى التَّهْلُكَةِ ‏}‏ فَالإِلْقَاءُ بِالأَيْدِي إِلَى التَّهْلُكَةِ أَنْ نُقِيمَ فِي أَمْوَالِنَا وَنُصْلِحَهَا وَنَدَعَ الْجِهَادَ ‏.‏ قَالَ أَبُو عِمْرَانَ ‏:‏ فَلَمْ يَزَلْ أَبُو أَيُّوبَ يُجَاهِدُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ حَتَّى دُفِنَ بِالْقُسْطَنْطِينِيَّةِ</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Aslam Abu Imran said: We went out on an expedition from Medina with the intention of (attacking) Constantinople. AbdurRahman ibn Khalid ibn al-Walid was the leader of the company. The Romans were just keeping their backs to the walls of the city. A man (suddenly) attacked the enemy. Thereupon the people said: Stop! Stop! There is no god but Allah. He is putting himself into danger. Abu Ayyub said: This ayah was revealed about us, the group of the Ansar (the Helpers). When Allah helped His Prophet (ﷺ) and gave Islam dominance, we said (i.e. thought): Come on! Let us stay in our property and improve it. Thereupon Allah, the Exalted, revealed, &#8220;And spend of your substance in the cause of Allah, and make not your hands contribute to (your destruction)&#8221;. To put oneself into danger means that we stay in our property and commit ourselves to its improvement and abandon fighting. Abu Imran said: Abu Ayyub continued to strive in the cause of Allah until he (died and) was buried in Constantinople.&#8221; (<strong>Sunan Abi Dawud</strong> (no.2512), authenticated by Shaykh al-Albani. It has also been cited in <strong>al-Mustadrak</strong> of al-Hakim (2/84-85), <strong>Tafsir al-Tabari</strong>, (2/118-119), <strong>Tafsir Ibn Abi Hatim</strong> (1/330-331), <strong>Ahkam al-Quran</strong> of al-Jassas (1/326-327)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Another Hadith in <strong>Abu Dawud</strong> (no.2687), which although has weakness in it, establishes the expedition of Abd al-Rahman and Abu Ayub RadhiAllahu Anhu.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">These hadith and reports show Constantinople was conquered during the era of the <strong>Companions</strong> and therefore <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hamza Yusuf’s</strong></span> warping the true narrative to fit the maturidi belief system is disingenuous. Those who are truly deserving of these glad tidings are the <strong>noble Companions</strong>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From what we know of al-Ghazālī is that he retracted from his ardent Ashʾarī approach and returned back to the way of Ahl al-Sunnah or as he described, <em>Madhhab al-Salaf</em>. We find that he eventually denounced the Kalām approach or the way of the Kalāmiyyah. This has been well documented and accepted by many authorities, while some are still denying this established fact. What we learn from this historical fact and what is of primary focus is the rejection of the kalām system; which was adopted by many in order to understand the divine attributes or the Asmāʾ wa’l-Ṣifāt of Allāh. However, it must be said that actually never totally left Ashʿarism and began taking early steps<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, how much he left and how much of the creed of the Salaf he adopted is open for much discussion and debate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī censured the kalām approach and therefore believed it was no longer an acceptable or viable approach for the the common Muslims. This eventually led al-Ghazālī to author is well known, <em>Iljām al-ʿAwām ʿAn ʿIlm al-Kalām</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī wrote this treatise to aid the Muslims masses shortly before he died, and I will discuss the details and importance of this treatise later. It is similarly imperative to understand the various stages in al-Ghazālī’s life and the treatises he wrote and to correlate them with his theological views, which will essentially offer insight to his beliefs as well as his Ashʿarism and kalām approach. Unfortunately, these substantial changes or stages in al-Ghazālī’s life failed to create an acceptable understanding in some Islamic and modern academics, who continue to promote al-Ghazālī as an all out ardent Ashʿarī, who traversed this theological discourse uniformly throughout his life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an incorrect notion as the proceeding pages will evidence, it is however, acceptable to believe that he retained many aspects of Ashʿarism which was inevitable because to his lifelong attachment to this theological school. Al-Ghazālī also denounced and repudiated key premises of Ashʿarism, which were considered central ideas of Ashʿarism and I mention some of them further as we proceed through this paper, In-Shāʾ-Allāh. So, in order to evidence his denunciation and retraction from orthodox Ashʿarite beliefs and the Kalāmiyyah approach or theological rhetoric, we move onto the various stages in al-Ghazālī’s life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We find from those who knew him on a personal level, there were other concerns with his personality and approach which perhaps led to some of these changes, self realisation, criticism from his contemporaries and personal experiences, all seem to have played a relevant part. It would therefore, be important to present a brief synopsis of this to get a broader picture of his mindset.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Perspectives on al-Ghazālī</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī was someone who had a level of acumen and intelligence, he was pleased and aware of his knowledge and capabilities. He had ability to discern between different ideologies and methods of creed derivation, all of which is deduced from his summary of the various approaches he mentions in his <em>Munqiḍh</em>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> He was unsparing with his comments and rebuttal of the other sects, namely the Batinī’s and philosophers.  He was also not shy to express his contempt and scorn on them and used harsh words. We can draw lessons from this while showing the Ashʿaris and other bystanders how al-Ghazālī himself was unforgiving to other deviant creeds and belief systems, giving the Ashʿari’s and other sympathisers something to reflect over. A contemporary of al-Ghazālī, ʿAbd al-Ghāfir al-Fārisī (d.529H) says about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I visited him many times and it is without inference that whatever I saw of him in the past with regards to malice and harshness towards people, he looked down on them through his being led astray and by what Allāh had given him in terms of thought and expression and through the seeking of rank and position, had come to be the opposite and was purified from stains. I used to think there was a level of pretence with him, but I realized after investigation, it was the opposite to what I had thought and that he was a man who had recovered after being mad.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This serves as a direct account from a contemporary evidencing al-Ghazālī changing during his life and his approach in general to the Shariʿah. He also shows his dislike for taqlīd and blind following in general, where he encourages people to seek the truth and develop ones own Madhhab, he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, stop relying on the Madhhabs and seek the truth by looking into issues and become a founder of a Madhhab. Do not follow a guide like a blind man so that he leads you along while there are thousands of similar guides around you, calling out to you that he ruined and misguided you from the right path.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These statements and others show al-Ghazālī was an independent thinker, just like his teacher al-Juwaynī, he was not shackled and bound by the chains of taqlīd or blind following or imitation. Al-Ghazālī and al-Juwaynĩ were independent theologians, which perhaps the main reason why they left fundamental Ashʿarism and departed from many aspects, as if they were both unfaithful Ashʿarites. If having a culmination of anti taqlīd sentiments, being independent, having a precedence of his teachers, there is no doubt this approach led al-Ghazālī to depart from Ashʿarism, how much is the focus of discussion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Stages in al-Ghazālī’s Life</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī while passing through a number of stages during his life, also authored a number of works that depicted and offered an insight to his thought. This paper will not exhaust these various stages of his life, but rather it will highlight some key changes, which essentially reveal some of his final views.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was born in 450H in Tus and received his early education in a madrassah around 465H, he went to study in Jurjan.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Around 473H he travelled to Nishapur to study at the acclaimed Nizāmiyyah school. At the Niẓamiyyah he studied with one of the leading authorities of the Ashʿarī school, ʿAbd al-Mālik al-Juwaynī (d.478H) who had some sort of influence over him.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> It is a given without a doubt that he must have studied ʿAqīdah, theology and subsidiary issues including kalam, and philosophy at the Niẓāmiyyah school and also independently with the various teachers at the madrassah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the death of al-Juwaynī,<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> he went on to serve the minister Niẓām al-Mulk of the Seljuq empire in Baghdad, as part of an advisory board. On this board they debated and discussed an array of issues ranging from ʿAqīdah and fiqh. Al-Ghazālī remained with Niẓām al-Mulk for approximately six years. Then in 484H Niẓām al-Mulk appointed him as a professor at the Baghdad Niẓāmiyyah school which he had founded. He remained as a professor at the Niẓāmiyyah for approximately four years until 488H where he served as the chair of Shafiʿī fiqh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was in Baghdad when al-Ghazālī really focused and exerted extensive time consulting the books of the philosophers. In fact, he spent half of his time in Baghdad, approximately two years as he mentions in his autobiographical discourse, <em>Munqidh Min al-Ḍalāl.</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> When he completed his research he proceeded to write a number of treatises outlining the aims of the philosophers and refuting their ideas.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī even at this early age showed signs of crisis in his approach and belief. In some places he outlines his views which become manifest through his writings. One of the earliest periods of skepticism he displayed was during the time he started to delve deeper into the Islamic sciences and leaving for Baghdad from Nishapur. It was during this period that began having doubts about his approach to the Islamic sciences. He became very doubtful, his intellectual thought failed him and he was unable to reconcile his uncertainties with reason or any of the other sciences he knew. At the same time, he became very ill, lost his appetite and was in a state of sheer confusion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It will not be surprising to learn, during this period in Baghdad between 484-488H, while serving as a professor of Shafiʿī fiqh in the Baghdadi branch of the Niẓāmiyyah and after researching the ideas and principles of the philosophers and refuting and answering their claims, al-Ghazālī suffered a nervous break down.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> While in Baghdad he extensively studied philosophy and its books and wrote a number of treatise<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> in refuting them. Al-Ghazālī says he studied the books of the philosophers for two years while he remained in Baghdad.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to understand al-Ghazālī experienced this breakdown after reading and writing about the philosophers which was understood to be ‘a crisis of faith’. How tragic is it then; to see novice Ashʿarīs claim philosophy is the recourse to understand ʿAqīdah and the tenets of Imān? This clearly demonstrates how uninformed and the lack of knowledge the new age Ashʿarī has, who is oblivious of the unprecedented dilemma al-Ghazālī had to contend with.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to biographers and historiographers, this bewildered state of confusion lasted for approximately six months.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> When he recovered from it, which al-Ghazālī described as, ‘when Allāh illuminated his heart’. It was after this period when he decided to study in great depth four groups, the Mutakallimūn, the Bāṭiniyyah, the Philosophers and the Ṣūfī’s. He authored his well known book, <em>Munqidh Min al-Ḍalāl (Deliverance from Error)</em> based on his study of these four groups while outlining his own discourse, understanding and personal journey, as it was a semi autobiography of his journey to the truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After suffering his nervous breakdown and his crisis of faith, al-Ghazālī excused himself from his teaching post under the guise of travelling to Makkah for Ḥajj<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> but in reality it was ruse to get away and use the time to self reflect. In 488-489H he travelled to Damascus where he remained for two years,<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> spending time on worship and meditating the Ṣūfī way. It is perhaps during this period he began writing his <em>Iḥyāʾ ʿUlūm al-Dīn (Revival of the Islamic Sciences)</em>. He then travelled to Jerusalem, where he wrote his <em>al-Risālah al-Qudsiyyah (The Jerusalem Tract)</em>. He then travelled to Hebron in Palestine and then eventually on to Makkah and Madīnah. He spent a short while there and then returned to Baghdad for a brief period before moving on to his ancestral home of Tus around 490H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He remained in Tus for ten years until approximately 499H in retirement. Then the son of Niẓām al-Mulk, Fakhr requested al-Ghazālī to resume teaching at the Niẓāmiyyah school in Nishapur, where al-Ghazālī had begun his Islamic journey. It is not known how long he remained in Nishapur teaching<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> but a conservative estimate is about 2-3 years, as we know he died in his home town of Tus where he lived for a few years before he died in 505H.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We therefore, learn that al-Ghazālī’s life, from the time he began seeking knowledge throughout his career can be divided into six distinct periods with some overlap between the fifth and sixth period.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Period – 465-478H</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This early learning period from 465H when he first began seeking knowledge until 478H, when al-Juwaynī, who was teaching at the Niẓāmiyyah school in Nishapur died.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Period – 478-488H</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This teaching and advisory period can be summarized as the Baghdad Niẓām al-Mulk period. Where he served as an advisory minister to him for six years and under his courtesies. He went onto accept the chief Shafiʿī jurist position for four years, all at the Baghdad branch of the Niẓāmiyyah school.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Third Period – 488-490H</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This period can be aptly described as the deep crisis and revival period. In this period al-Ghazālī suffers from an enormous breakdown in the Rajab of 488H which lasts for six months. It is then followed with a period of two years of travel, search for the truth coupled with writing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fourth Period – 490-499H</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This period can undoubtedly be described as the retirement period. Al-Ghazālī retired to his ancestral home of Tus. What he exactly did during this period is not well documented.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fifth Period – 499~503H</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This period can be classified as his resumption period, wherein he returns to Nishapur to the Niẓāmiyyah to continue teaching at the behest of Fakhr al-Mulk. It is difficult to ascertain the exact length of this period; however, we can can make certain presumptions. Al-Ghazālī completed his major work on Uṣūl al-Fiqh, <em>al-Mustaṣfā Min ʿIlm al-Uṣūl</em> around 503H as some of the manuscripts of the book indicate. It would make sense if, <em>Al-Mustaṣfā</em> being a work of Uṣūl al-Fiqh was written during this period when he renewed his teaching at the college as it’s a work that would be written while teaching and not retirement. Nonetheless, it is also possible of potential overlaps from this period to his last peri0d of final retirement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Sixth Period – 503-505H</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The final retirement period, wherein he returns to native Tus until he dies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The importance of dividing al-Ghazālī’s life in such a manner will allow us to place certain treatises to these specific periods and thereby map his transformations. He also cross references many of his works, which further allows us to form an approximate chronology; this will also assist us to record theological changes through his life.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I divided al-Ghazālī’s life into six parts; I found this easier to show his respective works on theology, philosophy and theological rhetoric during these distinct periods and in turn his transformation. ʿAbd al-Karīm al-ʿUthmān, in his <em>Sīrah al-Ghazālī wa Aqwāl al-Mutaqaddimīn Fihi (The Biography of al-Ghazālī and the Statements of the Earlier [Scholars] About Him)</em> divided this period into five and also dates the treatises that are relevant to our paper.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>  The most extensive research is perhaps offered by ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Badawī, who authored, <em>Muʾallafāt al-Ghazālī</em>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> He presents four periods.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> I have focused on the works related to kalām, philosophy and Aqidah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We find from this tabulation that after reading and researching on Kalam and Philosophy during his early period this led to al-Ghazālī having a breakdown. He went onto write the <em>Iḥyāʾ,</em> the al-<em>Arbāʿīn</em>, the<em> Fayṣal</em> and the more important works of <em>al-Munqiḍh</em> and the Iljām, both of which refute and repudiate the ideas of Kalām and any other approaches.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Ghazālī’s Views on Kalām</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī described ʿIlm al-Kalām (Kalām for short) or commonly known as the Mutakallimūn<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> as those who claim to follow theory and speculation. He uses the words Ahl al-Raʾyy waʾl Naẓar, meaning the people of opinion and speculation.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a> We therefore, find even the definition of kalām poses a serious problem to the orthodoxy of Islamic Creed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the key factors in why al-Ghazālī perhaps rejected and denounced the way of theological rhetoric was due to the harms associated with it. He believed the kalām approach had both benefits and harms coupled with both advantages and disadvantages. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">We refer to ʿIlm al-Kalām and say it has advantages and disadvantages, usefulness and harm, commendable and obligatory as the need arises. When it is harmful it is unlawful and from its harm is that it raises doubts and undermines the pillars of Imān and strips them of their certainty and definiteness. These points are confused at first and then reestablishing them through evidences is uncertain and varies among individuals.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī further outlined a nominal system in utilizing his writings to correct any wavering issues of belief. He advised those who were of a single theological background and were not subjected to the polemics of theological discourse, that such people should rely on his foundation of beliefs in his <em>Iḥyāʾ</em>. That children and those exposed to theological polemics read and learn <em>al-Risālah al-Qudsiyyah Fī Qawāʾid al-ʿAqāʾid</em>. If further, an adolescent was astute and aware of doubts or he was skeptical, this then indicated uncertainties and the beginning of disbelief has started, in such a case he should be reading <em>al-Iqtiṣād Fī al-Iʿtiqād</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī then, which is the most crucial part, he says if doubt, uncertainty and disbelief persist, then kalām is useless and redundant in attempting to establish belief in the fundamental aspects of ʿAqīdah and Imān.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This approach is contrary to the modern day apprentice Ashʿarī, who misleadingly endeavors to bolsters support for Ashʿarism – claiming, salvation or redemption from ‘atheism’ lies through the approach of kalām. Al-Ghazālī disproves this notion or theory from the onset, showing the falsehood of the modern self styled novice Ashʿarī. We find the Ashʿarī neophyte’s propagating ʿIlm al-Kalām and philosophy as the only and essential resolution to most theisms, during the process of which they embark on a scathing attack on the Salafīs for the allegedly simplistic approach to complex matters of theology.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī further expresses his view regarding kalām, wherein he conveys its objectives but is conversely critical of its methodology. He says in general conclusion regarding kalām,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I carefully studied and pondered over it. I consulted the treatises of the experts of this science and I also composed a few treatises on the subject. I learnt that this science, although it fulfilled its aim, it did not attain my aim. Where its aim and intent should be to preserve the ʿAqīdah of Ahl al-Sunnah and defend it from the corruption of the people of innovation (Ahl al-Bidʿah).<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In order to emphasise his point – kalām being redundant to ascertain tenets of ʿAqīdah, he affirms the existence of the true, pristine and divine ʿAqīdah. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah sent to his servants through the message of his Messenger, an ʿAqīdah which is the truth and a means of rectification for his Din and the affairs of this world and all of this (i.e. ʿAqīdah) have been set by knowing the Quran and reports (hadith). Then Shayṭān misguided the innovators with his evil whisperings with principles that opposed the Sunnah. So the people adopted these plots and almost corrupted the true ʿAqīdah for the people.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī does not invalidate kalām in totality, he mentions its advantages and some token benefits but is also swift in mentioning its major disadvantages and harms. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah then brought forward a group of mutakallimūn to defend the Sunnah with the system of theological rhetoric (i.e. kalām) to expose the heresies of the reprehensive innovators which opposed the documented established Sunnah. This is therefore, the origin of theological rhetoric and its people.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Ghazālī’s Ashʿarism</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī has various statements concerning the Ashʿaris and the the Ashʿarism which can only be interpreted as him departing from the theological school, in whatever capacity while retaining certain aspects of it. This in line with his <em>al-Iljām</em> and other works makes perfect sense, more so when we have established when they roughly authored. He says for example,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Perhaps you might say, your words (ie. Al-Ghazāli’s) in this book are divided into those which conform to the school of the Ṣūfīs and those which conform to the school of the Ashʿarites and some Mutakallimūn. So, the words are to be only understood according to a particular school, which one of these schools is correct.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here al-Ghazālī and based on the views of others, makes a distinction between the school of the Ṣūfīs and the Ashʿarites and some of the Kalamiyyah. He concludes by making the premise that only one school is correct. If he was a fully fledged Ashʿarī, al-Ghazāli had no need to address this dilemma in this way, this therefore suggests the contrary with his ardent Ashʿarism, as claimed by the later adherents of the theological school, mores on in our era on the various social media platforms. In another statement al-Ghazālī is again seem to take a middle path between the Ashʿaris and the Ḥanābillah ie the Salafī creed. In retrospect, they don’t seem like the words of an established Ashʿari elder. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Because each group of people declare the detractors to be disbelievers and connect with them the denial of the Messenger of Allāḥ Sallalahu alayhi Wasallam. The Ḥanābillah declare the Ashʿarites as unbelievers, alleging that they deny the Messenger when he talked about the Faqwa i.e. aboveness of Allāh and His sitting on the throne. The Ash’arites declare the Ḥanābillah to be disbelievers, alleging that they are anthropomorphist.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further answers a rhetorical question:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Question: Should the names and attributes of Allah be applied as they are or should ta’wil be made of them using reason (i.e logic)? Qadi Abu Bakr’s (al-Baqillani) view is that its possible to make ta’wil of them provided the Shari’ah does not prohibit or restricts it or if it (i.e. the Shari’ah) shows the literal (Zahir) meaning does not apply to Allah. Al-Ash’ari’s (Abul Hasan) view is they should be taken as they are because it is impossible to apply metaphorical (majaz) meanings to the description (i.e. wasf/kayfiyyah), accept when it permissible (according to the Nusus). Our view is to separate the issue and say, what is simplified to the Name should be readily accepted. As for what can be simplified to the description and does not require permission for interpretation and also be readily accepted.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, at another instance he talks about Ashʿarīs in the third person, making a distinction that he was not part of them with designation. He says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ashʿarīs and Muʿtazilah went on to adopt taʿwil because of excessive investigation. They went onto admit the taʿwīl of many literal senses. Those closest to the Hanabillah in matters of the Hereafter are the Ashʿaris. They affirm most of the literal senses except a few. The Muʿtazilah have gone further in the taʿwīl than the Ashʿarīs. With this, they (i.e. the Ashʿarīs) are compelled to use taʿwīl in matters.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We essentially find from these statements a level of incoherence and confusion from al-Ghazālī in following traditional Ashʿarism. This is perhaps an important premise to establish his resignation from Ashʿarī doctrines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A person who looks at the central beliefs of the Ashʿarī theological school will come to know al-Ghazālī failed to adhere to them. For instance, the issue of al-Aṣlaḥ (optimism), Jawhar al-Farḍh (atomism) and the soul, his views were different. This is what led Ibn Khaldūn to conclude that logic, although it was a science used by other civilisations, it was denounced by early Muslim scholars and theologians. It later developed credence due efforts of al-Ghazāli and others like al-Razī. Ibn Khaldūn said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be known early Muslims and early speculative theologians (i.e. ʿIlm al-Kalām) greatly disapproved of the study of this discipline. They vehemently attacked it and warned against it. They forbade the study and teaching of it. Later on, ever since al-Ghazālī and al-Rāzī, scholars have been somewhat more lenient in this respect. Since that time, they have gone on to study logic, except for a few who have recourse to the opinion of the ancients concerning it and shun it and vehemently disapproved of it.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī was concerned about the common people (the awwām) and this is what perhaps led him to depart from orthodox Ashʿarism in order to help them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Although we don’t find any direct statements from al-Ghazālī denying he was an Ashʿarī, we do find his opposition to traditional Ashʿarite theology and views, which was possibly the onset of him returning to the true creed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Ghazālī’s </strong><strong><em>Iljām al-ʿAwām ʿAn ʿIlm al-Kalām</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have already introduced the Iljām. He authored it two weeks before he died. The <em>Iljām</em> is authentically established from al-Ghazālī and several authors have attributed it to him. Al-Subkī<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> (d.771H), al-Ḥusaynī al-Wāsiṭī<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a> (d.776h), Ibn Qāḍhī Shuhba<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a> (d.779H) and al-Zabidī<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a> (d.1205H). Contemporary authors have also attributed it to him like, ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Badawi<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>, ʿAbd al-Karīm al-ʿUthmān<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>, ʿAbdul al-Amīr al-Aʿsam<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a> and Mashhad al-Allāf.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Most researchers are also agreed al-Ghazāli authored the Iljām two weeks before he died. One manuscript is dated the 1<sup>st</sup> of Jumāda al-Thānī, 505H whereas he died on the 14<sup>th</sup> of the same month. Mashhad al-Allāf said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">A book on the Way of the Salaf and is the last book that al Ghazālī wrote at the beginning of Jumāda al-Akhir, 505H, that is, shortly before his death on Monday, Jumāda al-Akhir 14, 505H by no more than two weeks.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is considered a very important work of Imam al-Ghazālī because you can clearly read in it that his method was the same as that of the righteous predecessors (al-Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ), so much so that <em>Iljām</em> is named in some manuscripts as <em>Risāla fī Madhhab Ahl al-Salaf</em> (<em>A Treatise on the Way of the Salaf</em>) in which he emphasized Imam Mālik’s statement as the foundation of his subject sticking to it, and repeating it in a number of places.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Badawī confirmed the aforementioned entries on Iljām, giving additional listings of it in Brockelmann, the British Museum, and several other sources.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Manuscripts of the <em>Iljām</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the introduction of the Dār al-Minhāj edition it is accepted as the book of al-Ghazālī<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a>. It further mentions his student Abū Saʿīd al-Jāwalī al-ʿIrāqī transmitted it from him in Baghdad and many major scholars have attributed it to him.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The introduction mentions 6 different manuscripts of the <em>Iljām</em> and offer details of each one.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a> From them, the most relied upon is that of Shahīd ʿAlī Pasha and is housed in Istanbul no.1712. It is a complete manuscript and the closest to in time to the author. It mentions the manuscript is dated just 3 years after the death of the author.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a>  The manuscript is dated as the middle of Shaʿbān 507H, which makes it just 2 years, this is a mistake in the introduction. The confusion is over when the original book was written and when it was further copied. A colophon on the manuscript clearly says it was completed on the 1<sup>st</sup> of Jumāda al-Akhar, 505H while the manuscript was copied in 507H.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a> The <em>Iljām</em> has been published many times in Cairo, Istanbul and Beirut.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Contents of the <em>Iljām</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have already mention al-Ghazālī’s view on the contradictions and disadvantages of kalām and says that it is only useful in some matters. In the Iljām he presents his views of disapproving of Kalām and that it did not lead to the standard of knowledge in belief in Allāh. He said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Acquired by the speculative proofs of Kalām based on propositions that are acceptable only because of their popularity with leading scholars, the ignominy involved in repudiating them, and the people’s aversion to any dissemination of doubt in them. In this manner, the science of Kalām is useful in some theological matters, constituting a justified belief (Taṣdīq Jāzim) for the few who do not perceive the possibility of its contradictions.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was of the view that beyond this, he saw little or no benefit in Kalām advocating instead of teaching of Qurʾanic proofs to the common people.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a> al-Ghazālī in the <em>Iljām</em> distances himself from the Ashʿarī approach to divine attributes, which was to make taʿwīl – figurative interpretation and rather aligns himself with the Salafi approach of abandoning taʿwīl. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say that it is unlawful (harām) for preachers on the pulpits to answer questions that delve into taʾwīl and elaborates (on sifāt); rather the preacher’s duty is to confine themselves to what we have mentioned here as well as the Salaf, strongly emphasizing Allah’s sanctity and negating anthropomorphism.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī opens the <em>Iljām</em> with the following words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Know that the truth with the people of insight, in which there is no doubt, is the Madhhab al-Salaf. By that I mean the way of the companions and the followers (Tabiʿīn).<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The way of the Salaf is true and is opposite to bidʿah, which is blameworthy…..The common people delving into interpretation (taʾwīl) of Sifāt is a blameworthy bidʿah……Therefore, opposition to it-abstinence from speculative inquiry into sifat (i.e. Kalām) is recommended and praiseworthy.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reception of al-Ghazālī’s View and the <em>Iljām</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mashaad al-Allāf said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book (<em>Iljām</em>) is one of the most authentic books attributed to [al-Ghazzālī], yet Orientalists eschewed it because of its commitment to the Sunna, maxims, and lessons pertaining to the unification of Muslim ranks and their guidance to the straight path. Orientalists tried to disregard it and misdirect students of knowledge away from it.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ (d.643H) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">In several places, al-Ghazālī eloquently articulated fleeing from everything besides this path (of kalām and taʾwīl), and ultimately reined in every scholar and lay person to it with his bridle – i.e., his book <em>Iljām al-ʿAwām ʿAn ʿIlm al-Kalām</em>. It is definitely the last book of al-Ghazālī, in which he urged them to adhere to the way of the Salaf and those who followed them.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mullā ʿAlī al-Qārī quotes the view of the Ḥanafī scholar, Sirāj al-Dīn al-Qazwinī (d.750H) who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ghazālī came around to accepting that taʾwīl was unlawful after he had praised it.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some later Ashʿarites apologists like Saʿīd Foudah and Ḥussayn Athāys tried with great endeavor in pushing al-Ghazāli used kalām.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a> Fiazuddin Shuʿayb said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reactions of Ashʿarīs to al-Ghazzālī’s apparent adoption of the Way of the Salaf varied: they either belittled his knowledge of kalām or persisted in typecasting him as a proponent of Ashʿarī thought. The latter is obvious in the works of Ibn ʿAsākir (d. 1176), al-Subkī (d. 1370), and Ibn Khaldūn (d.808/1406), to name a few.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mālikī scholar al-Māzarī (d.530), for example, when asked about al-Ghazālī’s theology, said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for ʿilm al-kalām, which constitutes the foundations of the religion (uṣūl al-dīn), al-Ghazālī also wrote on it but did not expatiate it or attain mastery (mustabḥir) of it. I investigated the reason, discovering that it was due to his study of philosophy (falsafa) before achieving mastery in uṣūl al-dīn; consequently, his reading of falsafa caused him to take an audacious approach on semantics but was lax toward realities. That is because falsafa proceeds on its own thoughts ungoverned by rulings of sharīʿa or without fear of contradicting the leaders who follow it.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Subkī responds to his and says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I concur with al-Māzarī’s statement that he was not proficient (mustabḥir) in kalām, but I argue that his feet were firmly rooted in it, though not to the same extent as they were in the other sciences; so his opinion is speculative. As for his statement that al-Ghazālī was preoccupied with falsafa before he engaged uṣūl al-dīn, it is not so; rather, he did not study falsafa until after he had delved into uṣūl al-dīn, as he himself clearly explained in <em>al-Munqidh Min al-Ḍalāl</em>. Furthermore, al-Māzarī’s claim that al-Ghazālī read falsafa before becoming proficient (mustabḥir) in uṣūl al-dīn, which comes after his previous statement that he was not proficient (mustabḥir) in uṣūl al-dīn, is contradictory.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Makdisi wrote,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">His work entitled Iljām al-ʿAwām ʿAn ʿIlm al-Kalām was a source of embarrassment to the Ashʿarite propagandists who reacted to it in various ways…the Ashʿarite apologists (in general) do not mention Ghazzālī’s Iljām itself, though their concern about it and his reference to Shāfiʿī in the Iḥyāʾ as prohibiting Kalām  is evident….<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fiazuddin Shuʿayb said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Ghazzālī had his fair share of critics among Shiʿīs, Muʿtazilīs, Zanādiqa, and Sunnīs, such as al-Māzarī, al-Ṭarṭūshī (d. 520/1127), Ibn Ṣalāḥ (d. 643/1245), Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1327), Ibn Qayyim (d. 751/1350), and others who differed with him on a wide range of issues, including Arabic grammar, philosophy, Sufism (taṣawwuf), Ḥadīth, and Kalām<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62">[62]</a></span></p>

I have discussed the Arabic editions in a later footnote. The publication of this works also has an interesting history. The text of <em>al-Munqidh </em>was discovered in 1842 by Auguste Schmölders who translated the text and published it in French for the first time. Its first English translation appeared in 1909 by Claude Field, <em>The Confessions of Al Ghazzali </em>(London: John Murray, 1909) and then again titled as <em>The Faith and Practice of al-Ghazālī</em> (London: George Allen and Unwin Ltd, 1953) by M. Montgomery Watt, the recent reference point for Yasir Qadhi! Richard Joseph McCarthy also translated it <em>Deliverance from Error</em> (Boston: 1980). Reprinted 1<sup>st</sup> edition, <em>Deliverance from error: An annotated translation of al-Munqidh min al Dala</em><em>̄</em><em>l and other relevant works of Al-Ghaza</em><em>̄</em><em>l</em><em>ī</em>. (Louisville: Fons Vitae, 1999). 2<sup>nd</sup> edition, 2001. in 2001 again, a husband and wife from al-Azhar University, Dr. Muhammad Muhammad Abū Laylah and Dr. Nurshif ʿAbd al-Raḥīm Rif’at published a critical Arabic edition with an English translation of the <em>Munqidh</em> titled, <em>Deliverance from Error and Mystical Union with the Almighty</em> (Washington: The Council for Research in Values and Philosophy, 2001). The edition bears a certificate from the Director General of the Department for Research, Writing and Translation at al-Azhar al-Sharif Islamic Research Academy, Sami Sharʿawī that the Munqidh contains nothing that contradicts Islamic ʿAqīdah and we have no objection to its publication.  (Introduction to the Arabic (page F) English section, 329).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>ʿAudhu Billāhi min ash-Shayṭān al-Rajīm, Bismillāh al-Raḥmān al-Raḥīm. </em><em>Alḥamdullilāhi Rabbil ʿAlamīn, waṣalatu wassalām ʿala rasūlillahil karīm, wa ʿala alihī wa aṣḥābī wa man tabiāhum bi-eḥsan ilaʾ yaum al-dīn; wa baʿḍ. </em>All Praise belongs and is directed to the <em>Rabb</em> of everthing that exists, praise and salutations be upon His final beloved Messenger, Muḥammad H, his revered family and his noble companions and upon those who follow them in good until the end of times, to proceed,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The following book is an abridgment of Shaykh Muṣṭafā Bāḥu’s, <em>ʿ</em><em>Ulamā</em><em>ʾ</em><em> al-maghrib wa muqāwamatuhum al-bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah, waʾl-taṣawwuf waʾl-qubūriyyah wa</em><em>ʾ</em><em>l-mawāsim</em> – <em>The Moroccan Scholars and their Resistance to Religious Innovation, Ṣūfism, Grave-Worship and Rites</em>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This part of the book features a clarification of the creed of the early Mālikī scholars, their defence, support and dissemination of the belief system of the pious ancestors – the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ. The tract, therefore, rescinds the claim of the latter-day adherents and promoters of the Ashʿarī creed, who insolently allege the Mālikī scholars were Ashʿarī. Similarly, it exposes the deliberate denigrations of these quasi and ‘synthetic’ Mālikīs’, who have absolutely no connection whatsoever with the formidable Mālikī predecessors! The book also presents a brief historical overview discoursing the spread of the Ashʿarī madhhab.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the last (5th) part highlighting the reality of the Hanafi Fiqh Channel (HFC) and their flagrant attach on Shaikh Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani, we thought this was sufficient, and we believe it, InshaAllah is, on all accounts in exposing the reality of these so called Deobandi Ash&#8217;ari Hanafi&#8217;s who take the mick out of the Hanafiyyah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We thought it pertinent to give the readers the last dose in this series concerning the reality of the hanafi church fathers and what the view of the hanafi elders was regarding Sahih al-Bukhari. It will also show the reality of these so called apologists for modern Hanafism. In essence the reality of this quagmire of Deobandi Hanafi Ash&#8217;ari Maturidism is nothing but neo-Jahmism while opposing the divine texts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The HFC produced a second attempting to malign Shaikh al-Albani and his analysis of Sahih al-Bukhari, we say, let this part be a response to all subsequent responses from the HFC. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From here on, we will limit our words in order to highlight and emphasise the severity, depravity and repulsiveness of this view of the early hanafites and THEIR view of Sahih al-Bukhari.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Jamal ud-Din Yusuf bin Musa al-Malati al-Hanafi (d.803)</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a Hanafi Judge from Halab who settled in Cairo, apart from the &#8220;ODD&#8221; views and Fatawa of &#8220;GETTING HIGH&#8221; (just like the Hanafi Fiqh Channel) and others that he issued, we will sidestep them and just look at the main point, he said,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No words can express this &#8216;ATTACK&#8217; on Sahih al-Bukhari that according to this hanafi elder, who was a judge and from the head of the Hanafi Madhhab who said, whoever looks in Bukhari becomes a Zindiq i.e. a disbeliver. Oh Deobandi Hanafi Ash&#8217;ari Maturidi&#8217;s, die in shame.</span></p>
