<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(Rahimahullah)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Series Part 20 / Part 4</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>By</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Series Compilers, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Issue Of Cursing Yazeed (Rahimahullah)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From The Words of Imaam Ghazaalee, Revered With The Soofee Bareilwee Hanafees. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This issue unfortunately is very common custom nowadays in that cursing and abusing yazeed rolls off the top of the tongue such much so that big so called Allaamahs and scholars consider this normal and permissible. Furthermore the standard is that there is no harm in abusing or cursing Yazeed all in the name of loving Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and so in this is a definite sign of loving Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and the Ahlul Bayt is cursing and abusing Yazeed (Rahimahullah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However these Soofee Bareilwee Hanafees doing this on their tv channels, like DM Digital, Ummah, Noor etc on a daily basis is contrary the Sunnah and these soofee bareilwees manifest elements of their shee’ism. These people are unaware of the Sunnah and also ignorant of the position of the Scholars of research and verification who have prohibited and warned from cursing and abusing Yazeed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They also clarified that Yazeed directly himself had no involvement in the unlawful death of Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), nor did he order any such tragedy and nor was he happy with what occurred. We will just present the statements of Imaam Ghazzalee who is well respected and revered amongst the soofees and bareilwee Hanafees, he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is not correct that he (Yazeed) killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), or gave such an order nor was he happy or in agreement with this so when all of this is not established from him how can one conjecture or assume this about him as assuming (such negative) things about a Muslim are Haraam (unlawful) as Allaah the Most High said, <strong>“Oh You who believe beware of a lot of conjecture for verily some conjecture is sin.”</strong>  This action does not clarify the actual reality if you do not know and it is obligatory for every muslims to assume good about another Muslim and so it is possible that </em><em>same should apply to him (ie Yazeed)”</em> (Wafyaat al-A’yyaan 2/450)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly he said in another book,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If you are asked, is it permissible to curse Yazeed because he killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) or he was the one who ordered the killing? Then we will answer, this is not established or proven in reality and up until it is not established or proven it is not permissible to say he killed or gave the order to kill Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)”</em> (Ihyaa Uloom ud-Deen 3/131)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He Imaam Ghazzalee further said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Supplicating on behalf of Yazeed for Allaah having mercy upon his is not permissible but rather it is recommended and it is constitutes the supplication, “Oh Allaah Forgive all the Believing men and women” because Yazeed was a believer, and Allaah knows best.”</em> (Wafyaat al-A’yyaan 2/450)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ghazaalee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whoever thinks that Yazeed ordered the death of Hussain or he agreed to it then that person is the worst fool.”</em> (Taareekh Ibn Khalkaan 1/465) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Refer to the previous parts for further statements from Imaam Ghazzalee.<tt> </tt></span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Faqeeh, The Mujtahid, The Muhaddith</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hurairah</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(Radhiallaahu Anhu)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Series Part 19 / Part 8</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>By</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Hafidh Sher Muhammad </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Series Compilers, Translated and Annotated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous tabiee (successor) Abu Salamah bin Abdur Rahmaan went to Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) when he was in pain during his last days and said, “Oh Allah cure Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu). Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Oh Allah do not return me  (ie back to normal health) Oh Abu Salamah if you can die then die I swear by him in whose hand my soul is in, the scholars will come upon a time when they will prefer death <span id="more-460"></span>over pure red gold (a very rare and very expensive commodity) and in the near future a time will come upon the people that when they walk past a Muslims grave they will wish they were the one in the grave.” (Tabaqaat Ibn Saad 4/337-338)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) was nearing his death he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“do not erect a tomb over my grave and do not take fire with me (ie my coffin) and take me to the graveyard quickly as I heard the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam) say when a believer is placed on the resting table he says take me to the next stage quickly and when a disbeliever or sinner is placed on the table he says oh I am ruined and destroyed where are you taking me? (Musnad Ahmad 2/292 <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.7914</span>, Tabaqaat Ibn Saad 4/338)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“When I die do not lament or wail over me because no one lamented or wailed over the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam)” (Taareekh Dimishq of Ibn Asaakir 17/282)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) had an astounding and incredible memory due to the supplication of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam). Once Marwaan bin al-Hakam al-Amawee wrote some ahadeeth from Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) and in the following year he returned and said to Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) he has lost the book he had copied the hadeeth into so can you tell me them again. So Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) told him the ahadeeth again and when the 2 books were compared (some have said the book was later found) there was not a difference in a single letter. (al-Mustadak al-Haakim 3/510)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) would narrate ahadeeth he would he would begin by saying, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Abul Qaasim the truthful Messenger of Allah (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam)  said, </span><span style="color: #000000;">“Whoever intentionally lied upon me then his abode will be in the hellfire” (Musnad Ahmad 2/413 <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.9350</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">would swear by Allah and say he would lie on the floor due to extreme hunger and would tie stones to his stomach (to suppress) his hunger.” (Saheeh Bukhari <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.6452</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) would say to his daughter, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Do not wear gold for I fear the flames (of the fire) for you.”(Hilyatul-Auliyaa 1/380)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Shaafiee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) was the greatest preserver of hadeeth on this earth”(Taareekh Ibn Asaakir 17/253)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) would say. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Oh Allah do not keep me alive  until 60 Hijree” (Taareekh Dimish Of Abee Zur’ah ad-Dimishqi <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.234</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) said another time, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Oh Allah do not keep me alive until when the young ones rule” (Dalaail an-Nabuwwah 6/466, of Imaam Baihaqi)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) presented some dates to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam) and asked him to supplicate for blessings upon them. So the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam) gathered the dates and supplicated on them and said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Take these dates and put them in a pot and whenever you wish take some but do not take all of them and spread them.” Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) said I spent so much of the dates in the way of Allah that we used to eat them and give them to people. The pot always used to be near my room up until Uthmaan (Radhiallahu Anhu) was martyred and the pot broke and was lost.”(Sunan Tirmidhee <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.3839</span>, Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.6498</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are many virtues of Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) more than 700 taabieen ie successors learnt the knowledge of hadeeth from him and many of the companions including Umar (Radhiallahu Anhu) relied upon. According to his supplication he either died in 57, 58 or 59H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Ishaaq (Ibn Khuzaimah) said (summarised- also mentioned in a previous series in greater detail), “4 types of people criticise Abu Hurairah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1)   The Jahmiyyah wa Mu’attilah Sect</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> (2)   The Khawaarij</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(3)   Qadariyyah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(4)   The Juhala (the ignorant ones)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> (Mustadrak al-Haakim (3/513)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">I invited my mother, who was a polytheist, to Islam. I invited her one day and she said to me something about Allaah’s Messenger (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam) which I hated. I came to Allaah’s Messenger (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam) weeping and said: Allaah’s Messenger, I invited my mother to Islam but she <span id="more-439"></span>did not accept (my invitation). I invited her today but she said to me something which I did not like. (Kindly) supplicate Allaah that He may set the mother of Abu Hurairah right. Thereupon Allaah’s Messenger (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam) said: O Allaah, set the mother of Abu Hurairah on the right path. I came out quite pleased with the supplication of Allaah’s Prophet (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam) and when I came near the door it was closed from within. My mother heard the noise of my footsteps and she said: Abu Hurairah, just wait, and I heard the noise of falling of water. She took a bath and put on the shirt and quickly covered her head with a headdress and opened the door and then said: Abu Hurairah, I bear witness to the fact that there is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allaah and Muhammad is His bondsman and His Messenger. He (Abu Hurairah) said: I went back to Allaah’s Messenger (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam) and (this time) I was shedding the tears of joy. I said: Allaah’s Messenger, be happy, for Allaah has responded to your supplication and He has set on the right path the mother of Abu Hurairah. He (the Prophet) praised Allaah, and extolled Him and uttered good words. I said: Allaah’s Messenger, supplicate to Allaah so that He may instil love of mine and that of my mother too in the believing servants and let our hearts be filled with their love, whereupon Allaah’s Messenger (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam) said: O Allaah, let there be love of these servants of yours, i.e. Abu Hurairah and his mother, in the hearts of the believing servants and let their hearts be filled with the love of the believing servants. (Abu Hurairah said: This prayer) was so well granted by Allaah that no believer was ever born who heard of me and who saw me but did not love me. (Saheeh Muslim <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.2491</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-A’raj reported that he heard Abu Hurairah as saying: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">You are under the impression that Abu Hurairah transmits so many ahadeeth from Allaah’s Messenger (may peace up upon him); (bear in mind) Allaah is the great Reckoner. I was a poor man and I served Allaah’s Messenger (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam) being satisfied with bare subsistence, whereas the immigrants remained busy with transactions in the bazzar; while the Ansar had been engaged in looking after their properties. (He further reported) that Allaah’s Messenger (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam) said: He who spreads the cloth would not forget anything that he would hear from me. I spread my cloth until he narrated something. I then pressed it against my (chest), so I never forgot anything that I heard from him. (Saheeh al-Bukhaari 2047, Saheeh Muslim 2492)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah Ibn Umar once said to Abu Hurairah, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“you used to accompany the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) more than us and you used to learn the most ahadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam)” (Sunan Tirmidhee <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.3836</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Bakr (Radhiallahu Anhu) sent Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) as the announcer at the last sermon (Saheeh al-Bukhaari <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.369</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) narrated a hadeeth and the mother of the believers A’ishah said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Abu Hurairah has spoken the truth” (Tabaqaat Ibn Saad 4/332)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Bukhaari has narrated with a good chain from Abee Salamah from Abu Hurairah Abdush-Shams. (at-Taareek al-Kabeer 6/132 <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.1938</span>). so we find that Abu Hurairahs (Radhiallahu Anhu) name before he accepted Islaam was Abdush-Shams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“I accompanied the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam) for 3 years.” (Kitaab al-Ma’arifah Wat-taareekh 3/161)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous successor ie taabi’ee Humaid bin Abdur Rahmaan al-Humairee said Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) spend 4 years in the company of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam). (Sunan Abee Dawood <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.81</span>, Sunan Nasaa’ee 1/130 <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.239</span>, Haafidh Ibn Hajr authenticated it in Buloogh al-Maraam)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) said he was present with the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam) at the battle of Khaybar (Taareekh Abee Zura’h <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.232</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) would pray the tahajjud prayer and he would do so spending a third of a night and his wife would also spend a third of a night and so would his son. (Kitaab az-Zuhd of Imaam Ahmad <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.177</span> <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.986</span>, Kitaab az-Zuhd of Abee Dawood <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.298</span>, Hilyatul-Auliyaa 1/382, 383)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During his governance Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) would walk through the Bazzar with sticks he would pick up. (Kitaab az-Zuhd of Abee Daawood <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.297</span>, Hilyatul-Auliyaa 1/384-385).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah ibn Raaf’e narrates I asked Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) why are you called Abu Hurairah? He replied, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Are you not scared of me?” I replied, “I am I swear by Allah I am scared of you.” Abu Hurairah replied, “I used to herd sheep for my family and I used to have a kitten and in the evening I used to leave him in a tree and in the day I used to play with him and so the people famed me with the title of Abu Hurairah (the father of cats) (Tabaqaat Ibn Saad 4/329).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad ibn Seereen was asked about Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) so he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“He was fair in complexion and he was pleasant soft hearted person and he used to use Henna (on his hair) and he would have a cotton based clothes.”(Tabaqaat Ibn Saad 4/333-334)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah (Radhiallahu Anhu) was an enemy of those who were enemies of Allah and his Messenger (Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam).”(Tabaqaat Ibn Saad 4/335)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Defence of Yazid ibn Mu’awiyyah</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Rahimahullah)</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Series Part 17 / Part 3</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">By</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Series Compilers, Translated and Annotated</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Katheer said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“</em><em>The people from all of the lands pledged their allegiance<span id="more-275"></span> (to Yazeed)”</em> (al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 8/79)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abdullaah Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Three years after the tragedy of Karbala when the people of Madina began to revolt with Abdullaah Ibn Zubair the Shaikh of the companions Abdullaah Ibn Umar severely censured this and openly announced his dissatisfaction and complete dissociation from such people</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Narrated by Nafi’ When the people of Medina dethroned Yazid bin Muawiya, Ibn ‘Umar gathered his special friends and children and said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I heard the Prophet saying, ‘A flag will be fixed for every betrayer on the Day of Resurrection,’and we have given the oath of allegiance to this person (Yazid) in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Allah and His Apostle and I do not know of anything more faithless than fighting a person who has been given the oath of allegiance in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Allah and His Apostle , and if ever I learn that any person among you has agreed to dethrone Yazid, by giving the oath of allegiance (to somebody else) then there will be separation between him and me.”</em> (Saheeh al-Bukhaari  Volume 9, Book 88, Number 227)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has been reported on the authority of Nafi, that ‘Abdullah b. Umar </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>paid a visit to Abdullah b. Muti’ in the days (when atrocities were perpetrated on the People Of Medina) at Harra in the time of Yazid b. Mu’awiya. Ibn Muti’ said: Place a pillow for Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman (family name of ‘Abdullah bin Umar But the latter said: I have not come to sit with you. I have come to you to tell you a tradition I heard from the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam). I heard him say: One who withdraws his band from obedience (to the Amir) will find no argument (in his defence) when he stands before Allaah on the Day of Judgment, and one who dies without having bound himself by an oath of allegiance (to an Amir) will die the death of one belonging to the days of Jahillyya.</em> (Saheeh Muslim No. 4562)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find from these nariations from the Bukhaari and muslim clearly that Ameer Yazeed was the legitimate and agreed upon caliph.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abdullaah Ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">When he found out about the death of Mu’awiyyah he continued to supplicate for him for a long time and began to mention his virtues and then said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“for verily his son Yazeed is from amongst the righteous from his household you people should stay there and pledge your allegiance later he went himself and pledged his allegiance.”</em>(Balazaaeee 4/4, al-Imaamah was-Siyaasah 1/202)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah bin Abee Taalib (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Yes the son of Alee bin Abee Taalib and the brother of Hassan and Hussain (Radhiallaahu Anhuma), when the people around him continued to feed him lies and deceits about Ameer Yazeed with the intent of getting him to revolt but when he refused to do so the people around him started to attribute alcohol drinking, abandoning the prayer and carelessness towards the religion to Yazeed. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah answered them by saying </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I did not find the things in himself which you have attributed to him, I have been to him myself and stayed with him and I found that he always prayed and seeking the truth in matters of fiqh and strongly adhering to the Sunnah”</em> (al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 8/233, al-Muntaqa 1/281)L</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah went a step further and began to debate and argue with the people who attributed such heinous claims about Ameer Yazeed, hence Haafidh Ibn katheer mentions, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah was asked to abandon his pledge of allegiance which he had given to Yazeed, he strongly rejected it and in support of Ameer Yazeed he argued and debated with them and refuted their allegations of drinking alcohol and his abandoning of the prayer.”</em> (al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 8/218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Imam Ahmad</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Qadhee Abu Bakr Ibn Arabee said Imaam Ahmad has mentioned Ameer Yazeed in Kitaab az-Zuhd after the companions but before the taabieens which shows he was free from these allegations he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“this is an evidence that he ie yawed had a great status according to Imaam Ahmad as he included him in his list of pious companions and taabieen and they are from those whose statements are followed and from whose admonitions one seeks guidance and he has mentioned him with them. So what basis do the allegations of him drinking alcohol and openly sinning have in comparison to his status which the historians have mentioned, do these people not have any shame.”</em> (al-Awaasim Minal Qawaasim 1/233)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Umar bin Abdul Azeez</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Hajr mentions that Ibn Shauzab said I heard Ibraaheem bin Abee Abd say I heard Umar bin Abdul Azeez say rahimahullah upon Yazeed Ibn Mu’awiyyah (Leesaan ul-Meezaan)</span></p>
