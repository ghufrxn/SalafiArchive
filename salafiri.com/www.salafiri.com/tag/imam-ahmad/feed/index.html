<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“Laa Tashirbil Maa Minal Bi’er Wa Fiyhee Galaazatun”</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“DO NOT DRINK (O SALAFEE) FROM THE WELL IN WHICH THEIR IS IMPURITY (BIDAH AND AHLUL BIDAH)”</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is not hidden from the salafees of the West that for some time now there has been a very relaxed approach in the affairs of dawah, especially, in calling to the pure, unadulterated and unblemished dawah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Of course, when one considers in depth the reason for the weakening and disunity of the salafees generally and in the west specifically, then there are many reasons as to why we have fallen from the peak all the way down! No doubt, becoming weak in taqwa, aqeedah and manhaj amongst many other matters come to mind as the foundational reasons for where we find ourselves today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, the purpose of this risaalah is not to list and discuss all the various factors that have made us fall to new depths but to consider carefully one factor which some may say is the single most considerable matter that has led to the salafee and his dawah suffering, that is leaving the door open for ahl ul bidah to enter our masaajid and thus our hearts!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence the title of this risaalah is a metaphorical one, in that, we must never allow ourselves to be influenced by ahl ul bidah and all that they call to from wretchedness and deviation. Allahs aid is sought.</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us consider some principles that ought to be the cornerstone of the salafee yet we have shamelessly deemed fit to move away from light toward darkness in our manhaj.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>{1} The importance and benefit in refuting not only the innovation but also the innovator.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah commented: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Some of the people said to Imaam Ahmad that ‘I find it difficult to critisize (narrators in the chain of narrations) that they have some problems and are like so and so? Imaam Ahmad replied, ‘if you and I remain silent, then how will the ignorant one know the authentic from the unauthentic narration?” (Majmoo al-Fataawa 28/231)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise is to Allah! Pay attention to how these few words of the salaf sum up the necessity to clarify the aqeedah and manhaj of those that have erred concerning it. For the one who ponders upon the words of Imam Ibn Tyamiyyah carefully will come to realise that this was said concerning a narrator who may have a weak memory or some other minor defect in narrating hadeeth, then what about the one who openly corrupts the Aqeedah and Manhaj, lying on Allaah (like the various callers to shirk and bidah from the various sects today) and our noble prophet? The one whom Allah has blessed will see that it is far more urgent and necessary to clarify the condition of this one!</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, the intellectual one is required to take one step further and he will realise that Imaam Ibn Tyamiyyah through the words of Imam Ahmad “how will the ignorant one know” is informing us that the basis of having the correct deen is to take it from those who are ahl us sunnah {the trustworthy ones} and not Ahlul Bidah {those that have sold their deen being the disparaged ones} for they will only spread knowledge which is corrupt and vain, thus leaving the ignorant as an ignorant one.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So noble reader know that it was due to the foresight bestowed upon Ibn Taymiyyah by Allah that he concluded this discussion by saying: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Had Allah not made the upright repel the evil ones {Ahlul Bidah} harm, the religion would be corrupted and this corruption is far greater than that being caused when during war the people are conquered. Verily, when they take over a country they do not corrupt and take over the heart and that which is in it related to the deen, but they do it over a long period. On the other hand, the people of Bidah they corrupt the hearts from the outset.” (Majmoo al Fataawa 28/232)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So it is clear to see that the Ahlul Bidah are like the serpent whose venom is deadly and at the same time instant in that they will affect and perverse the heart of the salafee. How much of a calamity is it that the person of innovation be allowed to take a place in our hearts and masaajid yet we know full well the venom of him and his innovation! Allah is the protector and his aid is sought!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, it is not difficult to deduce from the words of Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah that “Had Allah not made the upright repel the evil ones {Ahlul Bidah} harm, the religion would be corrupted” that this no doubt shows the superiority and status of the scholar, but most particularly the one who clarifies the affairs of the aqeedah and manhaj .</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 6">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is from the great blessing of Allah that in every time he sends scholars who ‘remove the hair from the flour’ and clarify the affairs. In current times where would we be had we not had the likes of Shaikh Ibn Baaz, Shaikh Albaanee, Shaikh Uthaymeen and currently Shaykh Rabee May Allah bless them all and have mercy on them. Ameen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet the calamity has struck those who belittle the dawah of these scholars past and present being affected and infected by the false principles around them and Ahlul Ahwaa. The irony of it, they “refute” those from amongst these scholars who they say they do nothing but to “refute”! May allah guide us all!</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>{2} The salafee will not have as his companion an innovator, rather, he will be judged by the one whom he befriends.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So once the salafee has safeguarded himself by adhereing to the above principle in, refuting the innovator and innovation, it is upon him then that he further distinguish and safeguard himself from the innovator and a means of doing this is that he does not have the ahl ul bidah as his companion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This principle and the one above are connected and understand it well may Allah have mercy on you, that, “every time a salafee has a companion from the people of innovation it is usually at this tage that he will open his heart to the innovator, not being able to rebuke him or his innovation”. So for this reason we find the tremendous saying of Abu Dardaa who said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“It is from the fiqh (understanding of a person) that he [chooses] those whom he walks with, whom he enters upon (visits) and whom he sits with.” (al-Ibaanah 2/477)</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 7">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Yahyaa bin Katheer said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Sulaimaan bin Daawood alaihis salaam said: Do no pass a judgement over anyone with anything until you see whom he befriends.” (al-Ibaanah 2/464)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Moosaa bin Uqbah, the Syrian, approached Baghdaad and this was mentioned to Imaam Ahmad. So it was said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Look at whose residence he goes to and with whom he resides and finds shelter.” (al-Ibaanah 2/480)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Imaam Al-Awzaaee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Whoever hides his innovation from us will not be able to hide his companionship from us.” (al-Ibaanah 2/476)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah have mercy on you, look at those who were far noble, upright and god fearing than you and I, yet they had a strong stance to those who corrupted the deen and not having any links with them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask, which one today is more knowledgeable in aqeedah and manhaj concerning how to deal with the ahl ul bidah and the principles of al jarh wa tadeel than Al Awzaaee? Yet ponder on the noble saying of al-Awzaaee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bring forth your men if you are truthful! So do not be Oh Salafee like the one who deludes himself thinking that the Ahlul Bidah will not affect him as his companion but know that the effect of this companionship will be so severe upon you that you will not be able to hide it! Allahs protection is sought.</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 8">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>{3} The obligation to clarify the dawah and the one who does so is not the cause of disunity.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Saaleh al-Fawzaan was asked, “Many of the people say that the refuters of Ahlul Bidah are separators, causing separation?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh replied: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Yes, they cause separation between truth and falsehood. This is correct. We make a distinction between the truth and falsehood, between the people of truth and those of falsehood. We are going to refute ahl ul bidah and so did the scholars refute ahl ul bidah. This is not the cause of division, but its to gather the people upon the truth, because with people remaining upon misguidance and the speech which is falsehood then it is this that causes division amongst the muslims. As for clarifying the truth for the people, so they can gather upon it, then this is the dawah towards unity and not the dawah towards separation. The dawah towards separation is when it is said ‘the people of falsehood are not to be refuted’. This is dawah of disunity if only they ponder! And allah knows best”{Q&amp;A session, Riyaadh, 2011}</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a short but tremendous advise and reply by Shaikh Fawzaan, may allah preserve him. One can see with great clarity from the shaikhs words tha he allies truth and falsehood as matters which cannot be mixed and similarly equates this by saying that the possessors, that is, people of truth and falsehood cannot therefore mix. A fundamental principle summarised by the sheikh in a few words, glory be to Allah.</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 9">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Noble reader, despite such clarifications you will still here some that say that their is no point in refuting ahl ul bidah or even speaking about them. Some go further and say that ‘ to discuss and backbite Ahlul Bidah is a waste of time and of no benefit’. So what then? Read on.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>{4} One of the distinguishing signs of Ahlul Bidah is that they ask for less refutation, whilst the Salafee is balanced and he will refute when it is required.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Unfortunately, a severe illness has crept in amongst salafees today and the people are told that to refute is not the correct way and that this hardens the heart and causes harshness and so on. So consider the following saying, and consider it over and over again for it encapsulates the manhaj of the salaf, who were the most balanced and kindest of people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">It is reported from al-Abbââs bin al-Waleed that ‘Uqbah said: “I was once with Arta’ah bin al-Mundhir when one of the people in the gathering said, “What do you say about a man who sits with the followers of the Sunnah and mixes with them, but when the followers of Bid’ah are mentioned he says, ‘Spare us from mentioning them, do not talk about them?’” Arta’ah said, “He is one of them, do not let him confuse you about his condition.” I felt this was strange, so I went to al-Awzaa’ee – and he used to clarify these matters when they came to him. He said, “Arta’ah is right, the matter is as he said; this person forbids talking about [Ahlal-Bid’ah], so how can [people] be on guard against them if they are not exposed?” (Ibn ‘Asââkir, Tâârîkh Dimishq 8/15)</span></em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 10">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So have you pondered enough! Clarifying the affairs is a cornerstone of dawah salafiyyah and to oppose this is to oppose the essence of the dawah for which there is no burhaan.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>{5} Laa Tashribul maa minal bi’er waa fiyhee ghalaazatun.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here, we end this short risaalah with the inspiring words of Imaaam Awzaee. I could not find a more suited reference than this which purely corresponds with the title of this risaalah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is reported that Imaam al-Awzaa’ee (d157H) wrote:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“O Muslims, fear Allâh and obey Him, and accept the advice of the sincere advisers and the exhortation of the exhorters, and know that this knowledge is religion, so be careful about what you do [in it] and from whom you take [it] and who you follow and who you trust your religion to. For verily, the followers of Bid’ah are all falsifiers and liars, neither are they careful nor do they fear and protect [against wrongdoing], and nor are they to be trusted to not distort what you hear. They say what they know not when criticizing and decrying or when affirming their lies. But Allâh encompasses what they do. So be on guard against them, suspect them, reject them and distance yourselves from them, for this was what your earlier scholars and the righteous latter ones did and instructed others to do. Beware of rising against Allâh and becoming instruments in the destruction of His religion and undoing its handholds by respecting the innovators, for you know what has come down to us about respecting them.And what stronger respect and veneration can there be than taking your religion from them, following them, believing them, being close to them and helping them in alluring those they allure and attracting those they attract of the weak Muslims towards their ideas and the religion they practice? This is enough to be considered a partnership and contribution to what they do.” (Ibn ‘Asââkir, Târîkh Dimishq 6/361-362).</span></em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 11">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">we find no need to add anything further then what has been said by Imaam Awzaaee. It is enough, sufficient, enough!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ones in need of pardon of their lord, Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">By</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Series Compilers, Translated and Annotated</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Katheer said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“</em><em>The people from all of the lands pledged their allegiance<span id="more-275"></span> (to Yazeed)”</em> (al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 8/79)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abdullaah Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Three years after the tragedy of Karbala when the people of Madina began to revolt with Abdullaah Ibn Zubair the Shaikh of the companions Abdullaah Ibn Umar severely censured this and openly announced his dissatisfaction and complete dissociation from such people</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Narrated by Nafi’ When the people of Medina dethroned Yazid bin Muawiya, Ibn ‘Umar gathered his special friends and children and said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I heard the Prophet saying, ‘A flag will be fixed for every betrayer on the Day of Resurrection,’and we have given the oath of allegiance to this person (Yazid) in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Allah and His Apostle and I do not know of anything more faithless than fighting a person who has been given the oath of allegiance in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Allah and His Apostle , and if ever I learn that any person among you has agreed to dethrone Yazid, by giving the oath of allegiance (to somebody else) then there will be separation between him and me.”</em> (Saheeh al-Bukhaari  Volume 9, Book 88, Number 227)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has been reported on the authority of Nafi, that ‘Abdullah b. Umar </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>paid a visit to Abdullah b. Muti’ in the days (when atrocities were perpetrated on the People Of Medina) at Harra in the time of Yazid b. Mu’awiya. Ibn Muti’ said: Place a pillow for Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman (family name of ‘Abdullah bin Umar But the latter said: I have not come to sit with you. I have come to you to tell you a tradition I heard from the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam). I heard him say: One who withdraws his band from obedience (to the Amir) will find no argument (in his defence) when he stands before Allaah on the Day of Judgment, and one who dies without having bound himself by an oath of allegiance (to an Amir) will die the death of one belonging to the days of Jahillyya.</em> (Saheeh Muslim No. 4562)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find from these nariations from the Bukhaari and muslim clearly that Ameer Yazeed was the legitimate and agreed upon caliph.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abdullaah Ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">When he found out about the death of Mu’awiyyah he continued to supplicate for him for a long time and began to mention his virtues and then said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“for verily his son Yazeed is from amongst the righteous from his household you people should stay there and pledge your allegiance later he went himself and pledged his allegiance.”</em>(Balazaaeee 4/4, al-Imaamah was-Siyaasah 1/202)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah bin Abee Taalib (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Yes the son of Alee bin Abee Taalib and the brother of Hassan and Hussain (Radhiallaahu Anhuma), when the people around him continued to feed him lies and deceits about Ameer Yazeed with the intent of getting him to revolt but when he refused to do so the people around him started to attribute alcohol drinking, abandoning the prayer and carelessness towards the religion to Yazeed. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah answered them by saying </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I did not find the things in himself which you have attributed to him, I have been to him myself and stayed with him and I found that he always prayed and seeking the truth in matters of fiqh and strongly adhering to the Sunnah”</em> (al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 8/233, al-Muntaqa 1/281)L</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah went a step further and began to debate and argue with the people who attributed such heinous claims about Ameer Yazeed, hence Haafidh Ibn katheer mentions, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah was asked to abandon his pledge of allegiance which he had given to Yazeed, he strongly rejected it and in support of Ameer Yazeed he argued and debated with them and refuted their allegations of drinking alcohol and his abandoning of the prayer.”</em> (al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 8/218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Imam Ahmad</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Qadhee Abu Bakr Ibn Arabee said Imaam Ahmad has mentioned Ameer Yazeed in Kitaab az-Zuhd after the companions but before the taabieens which shows he was free from these allegations he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“this is an evidence that he ie yawed had a great status according to Imaam Ahmad as he included him in his list of pious companions and taabieen and they are from those whose statements are followed and from whose admonitions one seeks guidance and he has mentioned him with them. So what basis do the allegations of him drinking alcohol and openly sinning have in comparison to his status which the historians have mentioned, do these people not have any shame.”</em> (al-Awaasim Minal Qawaasim 1/233)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Umar bin Abdul Azeez</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Hajr mentions that Ibn Shauzab said I heard Ibraaheem bin Abee Abd say I heard Umar bin Abdul Azeez say rahimahullah upon Yazeed Ibn Mu’awiyyah (Leesaan ul-Meezaan)</span></p>
