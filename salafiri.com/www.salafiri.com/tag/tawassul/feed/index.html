<span style="color: #ff0000;">DECEMBER 26, 2020 / SUNNI HANAFI</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Refuting http://www.salafiri.com/pinned-ebook-dismantling-the-proofs-for-tawassul-and-istigatha-with-conclusive-evidences-part-2-the-%e1%b8%a5adith-of-fatimah-bint-asad-radiallahu-anha-and-the-tawassul-of-me/</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Some pseudo-Salafis have began to make allegations of weakness on the hadith of Sayyida Fatima bint Asad رضى الله عنه .</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">For example they say that</span> “Imām Dhahabī in his summary of the al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Fīʾl Aḥadīth al-Wahiyyah of Ḥāfiẓ Ibn al-Jawzī again grades Rawhū weak thus showing his consistency. (Talkhīs Kitāb al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Li-Ibn al-Jawzī (p.91 no. 218), Riyadh: Maktabah al-Rushd, 1419H/1998)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Irshād ul-Ḥaq al-Atharī said in his notes to al-ʿEllal after mention the statements of Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy, Imām al-Dāraquṭnī, Imām Ibn Mākūlā, Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Yūnus, the authentication of Imām al-Ḥākim and the entry of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān in his al-Thiqāt as mentioned in Lisān (2:465),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I say their leniency (tasāhul ie of al-Ḥākim and Ibn Ḥibbān) is well known and al-Shaikh al-Albānī has mentioned in Silsilah al-Daʿīfaʾ no.23 so refer to it.” (al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Fīʾl Aḥadīth al-Wahiyyah (1:269 footnote no.5), Edn, Khalīl Mayyis (1:270 footnote no.8)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They do ta’wil of Imam al-Hakim and Imam Ibn Hibban’s tasHih yet they consider us “deviant and people of innovation” for doing tawasul/istighatha. If the followers of the pseudo-Salafi/Wahabi movement have any intellectual honesty, they will tell me why they have not considered Imam al-Hakim or Imam Ibn Hibban a deviant for doing tasHih of a narration on tawassul.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Barelwi in order to bulk the size of so called reply reproduced large chunks of my paper, whereas his response is a few paragraphs if that. In his response he the unnamed one] fails to make any recourse to the books related to the science of hadith, rijal and or without reference to any classical books other than emotive polemics, so nothing usual here for typical Barelwis so far.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Unnamed begins with the accusation of ta&#8217;wil, meaning explaining the authentication of Imams al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban. The unnamed author hid behind a generality, that this attribution to al-Hakim, that he authenticated it came from al-Haythami in his (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid (9:256-257), Cairo: Maktabah al-Quddūsī, 1414H:1994) and Majma&#8217;a al-Zawaid, 18:736 under no.15388)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">So, the accusation levied against me should be put first and foremost to al-Haythami, who despite citing Ibn Hibban&#8217;s and al-Hakim&#8217;s authentication continued to class it weak!!! I wonder why the unnamed author forgot this very little but important information? I guess, al-Haythami is also a pseudo Salafi? I reproduce the words of al-Haythami and what I wrote in the paper,</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;He, al-Haythamī also said after transmitting it in his Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid said,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Transmitted by Ṭabarānī in al-Kabīr and in al-Awsaṭ and Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ is in the chain who was declared trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim, however he has weakness with him and the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ.” (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid (9:256-257), Cairo: Maktabah al-Quddūsī, 1414H:1994)&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>al-Haythami himself organised the Thiqat of Ibn Hibban, so he was fully aware of Ibn Hibban&#8217;s entry for Rawhu, yet despite this he still graded him weak. (Tartib Thiqat Ibn Hibban,5:393 no.3979. 1st edn (Mansura: Dar Ibn Abbas, 1440H/2019).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Hamdi answered the very point made by this brother and i quoted this, and it is well known amonsgt the circles of hadith, that Ibn Hibba and al-Hakim were mutasahil, if someone does not even know the basic, they should refrain from discussing things way over their head. Shaykh Hamdi said,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Ḥamdi ʿAbd al-Majīd al-Salafī answers the authentication of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and says,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“As for Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who has been declared to be trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and Hakim, then it is well known about both of them that they are mutasāhil ie lenient. He was declared to be weak by Ibn ʿAdiyy and Ibn Yūnus said he would narrate rejected narrations. Darāquṭnī said he is weak in Ḥadīth and Ibn Mākūlā weakened him and Ibn ʿAdiyy said after transmitting two of this ḥadīth he has many āḥadīth and some of them are abandoned.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thus, this is detailed criticism from the specialist critical analysts, furthermore, his narrations are rejected and this is the case with this narration and when he is alone in reporting such ḥadīth they are rejected and cannot be used as evidence therefore, the ḥadīth is is weak.” (Muʿajam al-Kabīr (24:351-352), Cairo: Maktabah Ibn Taymiyyah, 1415H/1994)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, I also quoted the Sufi Shaykh ʿAbd Allah bin Ṣiddīq al-Ghumārī he also acknowledged the weakness of Rawhū. He said,</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Rawhū, his weakness is light.” (Ittihāf al-Azkiyaʾ Bijawāj al-Tawassul bil-Anbiyāʾ waʾl Awliyāʾ (p.11) (?: ʾAlī Raḥmī, p.11) and (p.20) cited from Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ (p.146)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">So, this charge should be levied against these personalities too, especially Hafiz al-Haythami. In reality this is nothing but pure desperation and a feeble attempt to answer what I wrote. The unnamed author failed to even cite one reference and he called its a refutation!</span></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Leniency of Imam al-Hakim</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr in this introduction to his <em>Lisan ul-Mizan</em> indicates and alludes to the leniency of Imam Ibn Hibban by discussing some of his principles. (Lisan ul-Mizan 1:208-209, ed Abu Guddah Abdul Fattah (Beirut: Dar al-Basha&#8217;ir, 1423H / 2002CE).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">And the Imam as-Salah, in his reference work for hadith, <em>Ulum al-Hadith</em> also grades Imam al-Hakim as lenient. (Ulum al-Hadith, 22 (24th edition (Damascus/Beirut: Dar al-Fikr /Dar al-Fikr al-Ma&#8217;asir, 1440H / 2019CE) ed. Nur ud-Din al-&#8216;Itr</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imams al-Nawawi and al-Suyuti in his <em>Taqrib and Tadrib al-Rawi Fi Sharh Taqrib al-Nawawi</em> both held the view that Imam al-Hakim was lenient. al-Suyuti even went onto say that Imam al-Dhahabi rendered many of al-Hakims hadith in his al-Mustadrak weak and even compiled a treatise of around 100 fabricated narrations. This all indicates towards th leniency of Imam al-Hakim (Tadrib al-Raw 1:112. (Riyadh: Dar al-Taybah, 1422H) 5th edition ed. Abu Qutaybah Nazar Muhammad al-Faryabi).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi himsef alludes to the lenenicy of al-Hakim and says himself that he collated the fabricated and weak ahadith in al-Hakims al-Mustadrak (Siyar al-A&#8217;lam al-Nubala, 17:175)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi very clearly declares Imam al-Hakim to be Mutassahil, he says, &#8220;Like the the type that is referred to as Mutasaahil like al-Hakim (Ma&#8217;rifah ur-Ruwat al-Mutakkalm Fihim Bima Yujad ar-Radd, 15. (Dar al-Ma&#8217;rifah)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi said another time. &#8220;The mutasahil (lenient ones) are like at-Tirmidhi, al-Hakim and ad-Daraqutni sometimes&#8221; (al-Muqizah Fi Ilm Mustalah al-Hadith, 83. ed. Abdul Fattab abu guddah. (Beirut: Maktabah Matbuat al-Islamiyyah, 1425H) 8th edition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Shaykh Salim al-Hilali brings a long passage from al-Lucknowi&#8217;s <em>al-Rafa&#8217; wa&#8217;t-Takmil</em>, 282-308, who in turn quotes Hafiz al-Sakhawi saying the same in his <em>Fath ul-Mughith</em> (Kifayah ul-Hifzah Sharh a-Muqaddimah al-Muqizah, 323. (UAE: Maktabah al-Furqan, 1422H / 2001CE) 2nd edition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Ibn al-Mulaqqin also attributed Tasahul to Imam al-Hakim (al-Muqn&#8217;i Fi Ulum al-Hadith, 67. (KSA: Dar al-Fawaz)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr does the same in his <em>al-Nukt Ala Ibn as-Salah</em>, 314.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">IMAM IBN HIBBAN</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000080;">The author of this below standard reply wont be able to grasp the finer details and Imam Ibn Hibban&#8217;s methodology in his <em>ath-Thiqat</em>, which is the core theme of his contention, namely Rawhu&#8217;s inclusion in the Thiqat. The Imam outlines he is likely to include narrators who have also been criticised and Rawhu is one of them (Kitab ath-Thiqat, 1:11. 1st edition. (Beirut: DKI, 1419H/1998CE)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">al-Lucknowi outlines Ibn Hibban&#8217;s methodology in his <em>Thiqat</em> and concludes, Ibn Hibban was lenient in his Tawthiq. (ar-Rafa&#8217; Wat-Takmil Fi Jarh wa&#8217;t-Ta&#8217;dil, 332-339. 4th edition (Pakistan: Maktaba Maroofia, 1433/2013), edited Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Ghuddah Abdul Fattah endorses this view and also says the view of the Hanafi Zafar Ahmad Thanwi in his </span><em style="color: #000080;">Qawaid Fi Ulum al-Hadith</em><span style="color: #000080;">, 180. He further said numerous scholars have attributed Tasahul to Imam Ibn Hibban from the classical and contemporary scholars. He goes onto say that even al-Kawthari, who undoubtedly is probably highly respected by the author of this reply, also indicates tasahul of al-Hibban this in several places in his <em>Maqalat</em>, 69, 185, 303. (ar-Rafa&#8217; Wat-Takmil Fi Jarh wa&#8217;t-Ta&#8217;dil, 335, footnote 2).</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">This then makes the argument of the detractor redundant as instead of applying Sunni sciences, he applies the usual emotion and this is not how we scrutinise reports. Therefore, in conclusion the TasHih of Imam al-Hakim and the grading of Imam Ibn Hibban is problematic. The Sufi authors have also acknowledged this as I presented in the paper.</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Furthermore they say:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">“Shaikh Zubair ʿAlī Zaʾī graded the report to weak on account of the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ according to the scholars of Ḥadīth. He also argued, even if he was authentic the second problem is the tadlīs of Sufyān al-Thawrī. Shaikh Zubair said seven scholars of Ḥadīth classed Rawhū to be weak,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Ibn ʿAdiyy, (2) Ibn Yūnus, (3) al-Dāraquṭnī, (4) Ibn Mākūlā, (5) al-Dhahabī, (6) Ibn al-Jawzī, (7) Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah al-Baghdādī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān, al-Ḥākim authenticated him and Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī narrated from him. These three authentications are rejected based on the criticism of the majority of the scholars of ḥadīth. (al-Ḥadīth no.76, Ramaḍḥān 1431H/September 2010, p.9-12).Shaikh Zubair ʿAlī Zaʾī graded the report to weak on account of the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ according to the scholars of Ḥadīth.

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Let’s assume this is true- for sake of argument. There is a big question – what is the similarity between the tad`if of, Imam al-Daraqutni or Ibn al-Jawzi or Ibn Adiyy or Allamah al-Dhahabi and those of today, like Zubair Alizai? One main difference – the former `ulama never had the manhaj of denying tawassul. Check Siyar al-Alam al-Nubala 12:469 for Imam al-Dhahabi narrating about wasilah through Imam al-Bukhari رضى الله عنه and 16:400, ed. Arna`ut for wasilah through the Messenger ﷺ .</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong><br />
<strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">This is purely clutching at straws and saving oneself after they have sunk neck deep. The unnamed detractor provides no Hadith based answer except another digressive point which is the usual tactic of Barelwis. What exactly does the narration under discussion and the scrutiny of its chain and narrators have to do with someone allegedly making tawassul through the grave of Imam al-Bukhari? Precisely, nothing. The  unnamed chap seems to forget the Imams of the Salaf who declared Rawhu weak while Shaykh Zubair Ali Za&#8217;i relayed this information. Honestly at times there is a serious level of disingenuous by Barelwis, who instead of presenting a direct answer, tend to skirt around digressive points. At this point the detractors is literally making things up to support his view. Nonetheless since he has presented this point lets scrutinise it briefly.</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">1. The unnamed detractor quotes a report from a book of biographies of Imam al-Dhahabi, claiming then that he believed in Tawassul is an outright lie since the task of a biographer is to quote incidences related to the entry. If this was the case, we have to attribute to Imam al-Dhahabi as a belief system everything he quotes in his 30 volume of the Siyar, and of course this is absurd but for sure a Barelwi would bring such a silly point to fool the readers.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span><span style="color: #000080;">The detractor surprisingly did manage to quote the correct reference for this report, namely Siyar al-A&#8217;lam an-Nabula, 12:469 (Beirut: ar-Risalah al-A&#8217;lamiah, 1438H/2017CE) and the chain Imam al-Dhahabi quotes it from through Abu Ali al-Ghassani who died in 498H (Siyar 19:150).</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Dhahabi died 748H and therefore there is a gap of 250 years in the chain. In conclusion this chain is disconnected and hence weak with all scholars of hadith, the early and later ones. It is therefore upon the unnamed Barelwi detractor to first bring the chain, then prove its connected and continuous chain and only then proceed to authenticate and use it as evidence. It is unsurprising to learn this since this is a hallmark of Barelwi Sufis who claim link and chain connections to knowledge but terribly bring chainless report to prove their Aqidah. Barelwism has no hope if this is the best they come with him as a reply as their Tanbih al-Ghafilin, it seems more appropriate for the detractor to apply this to himself due to his dire negligence of hadith and Aqidah sciences.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">As for this claim :</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Muḥammad ibn ʿAlawī al-Malikī quotes it in his book and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“There is a difference of opinion regarding one of the narrators, Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ, however Ibn Ḥibbān mentions him in his al-Thiqāt and al-Ḥākim said he was safe and trustworthy. So both of them, the two Ḥāfiẓs authenticated the ḥadīth. Likewise al-Haythamī followed up on this in (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid) and said Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is in the chain, Ibn Ḥibbān declared him to be trustworthy as did al-Ḥākim, however, he has some weakness and the remaining narrators are the narrator of the Ṣaḥīḥs.” (Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ (p.146), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1430H/2009)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamdūḥ does the same and claims the narration is Ḥasan. He also quotes the statements of the scholars as we have mentioned above. He says the scholars have differed over Rawhū, some have said he is weak and others have declared him trustworthy. (Rafʿ ul-Minārah Li-Takhrīj Aḥadīth al-Tawassul wal-Ziyārah (p.147-148), Cairo, Maktabah al-Azhariyyah Lit-Turāth, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʿIsā Himyarī jubilantly went on to assert the Ḥadīth is Ṣaḥīḥ ie authentic according to the conditions of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim and Ḥasan according to the conditions of others. (al-Tāʾmul Fī Ḥaqīqah al-Tawassul, p.214-215)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a little imaginative of Himyarī to say the ḥadīth is authentic according to the condition of both Imām Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">G.F. Ḥaddād has also attempted to authenticate this report while relying on the works of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ and Muḥammad bin ʿAlawī al-Malikī. He pushes the line of argument of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ that the criticism is undetailed which is laughable as we have shown in this discourse. The Sūfī Aḥmad Daḥlān has also attempted to authenticate this report as does al-Ḥabīb al-Jifrī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The central argument of the detractors is that Rawhū is differed over and that the criticism levied against him is not detailed but rather general and therefore we take the general praise and authentication of him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and accepted by the detractors themselves that Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim are both mutāsahil ie lenient with their gradings and authentication. It does not make sense for them to accept this and leave the criticism. They couple this argument with the fact the criticism and discrediting is undetailed and vague, therefore one retorts to the position of praise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This has been answered by Shaikh al-Albānī and the scholars before him wherein he mentions the reasons Rawhū is weak. The main reason being he would narrate rejected narrations and that his narrations were rejected themselves. At times he would be a lone reporter of narration without any support.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAmr bin ʿAbd al-Munʿim explains that Imāms al-Ṭabarānī, Abū Nuʿaym and Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythamī have all declared this to be a lone report of Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and none of the other students and companions of Sufyān narrates this from except Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and these other students of Sufyān were memorisers and trustworthy narrators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Imām Ibn Ḥibbān citing Rawhū in his al-Thiqat, it is not tantamount to trustworthiness as he is known to be lenient ie Mutasāhil. Whatever he mentions under his entry in his al-Thiqāt does not clarify the affair of Rawhū except that it is information as we have shown under his entry, which has preceded. Rather we find this entry alludes to all of his narrations being of the rejected type.”</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is responded to here:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Abu Nuaym chains contain Rawh ibn Salàh al-Hàkim asserted was trustworthy and highly dependable (thiqa ma’mun) –as mentioned by Ibn Hajar in Lisàn al-Mïzàn (2:465 #1876), Ibn Hibbàn included him in al-Thiqàt (8:244), and al-Fasawï considered him trustworthy (cf. Mamdoh, Raf‘ [p. 148]).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Al-Haythamï (9:257) said: “Al-Tabarànï narrated it in al-Kabïr and al-Awsat and its chain contains Rawh ibn Salàh whom Ibn Hibbàn and al-Hàkim declared trustworthy although there is some weakness in him, and the rest of its sub-narrators are the men of sound hadïth.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I was unable to find Abu Hàtim’s declaration of Rawh as trustworthy reported by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Alawï in his Mafàhïm (10th ed. p. 145 n. 1). Nor does Shaykh Mahmod Mamdoh in his discussion of this hadïth in Raf‘ al-Minàra (p. 147-155) mention such a grading on the part of Abu Hàtim although he considers Rawh “truthful” (sadaq) and not “weak” (da‘ïf), according to the rules of hadïth science when no reason is given with regard to a narrator’s purported discreditation (jarhmubham ghayr mufassar).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mamdoh (p. 149-150) noted that although Albànï in his Silsila Da‘ïfa (1:32-33) claims it is a case of explicated discreditation (jarh mufassar) yet he himself declares identically-formulated discreditation cases as unexplicated and therefore unacceptable in two different contexts! Ibn ‘Alawï adds that the hadïth is also narrated from Ibn ‘Abbàs by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr –without specifying where –and from Jàbir by Ibn Abï Shayba, but without the du‘à.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Imàm al-Kawtharï said of this hadïth in his Maqàlàt (p. 410): “It provides textual evidence whereby there is no difference between the living and the dead in the context of using a means (tawassul), and this is explicit tawassul through the Prophets, while the hadïth of the Prophet from Abu Sa‘ïd al-Khudrï ‘O Allàh, I ask You by the right of [the promise made to] those who ask You (bihaqqi al-sà’ilïna ‘alayk)’* constitutes tawassul through the generality of Muslims, both the living and the dead.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Furthermore, the hadith of Hadrat Fatima bint Asad رضى الله عنه is proving the istihbab or fadail of tawasul and daif ahadith are accepted in fada`il.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong><br />
<span><strong><span style="color: #000080;">There is no answer from the detractor except that I had already mentioned it on my article. We already know some scholars of hadith praised Rawhu but he was criticised by numerous others and the criticism takes precedence and the author even knows this yet the Barelwi sect will try anything to slip falsehood through. Interesting to Ibn Alawi used Abu Hatim when that does not even exist while our detractors is concerned with Tasahul. It does not matter how many other chains there are if they cannot be substantiated as the detractors acknowledges. al-Kawtharis statement is redundant as it it is another attempt to mix the issues up, in order to seek tawassul from the dead you need clear authentic evidences which you have not provided, and as Shaykh al-Albani has done in his book besides many others proved permissible tawassul from authentic texts.</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><strong><span style="color: #000080;">If the claim was Istihbab then the detractor and his Sufi Barelwi elders would not have had a problem with those who did not make tawassul with the dead, so its not a case of Istihbab with you. The unnamed guy then admits the narration could be weak and then changes his line of argument by saying weak narrations can be used in Fadhail? So, you admit the narration is weak? What the detractor should be more concerned with is, if Tawassul is matter of creed and not a matter of fiqh with them, they need to bring mutawatir ahadith and not Ahad ahadith for them to be taken in Aqidah, since this is the core principle of Sufi Barelwi Ash&#8217;arim. What is the point of responding if you don&#8217;t follow your own theological principles.</span></strong></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">QUESTION</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people claim it is permissible to make tabarruk ie seek blessings from the relics of the scholars and righteous people; they present evidence and say the companions sought blessings from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, so what is the ruling concerning this affair? Also in the form that is deemed permissible, is not a non-Prophet being compared to the Prophet of Allah ﷺ? Also is it permissible to seek blessing from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ after his demise? And is it permissible to seek wasilah ie intercession of the blessings of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ?</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is impermissible to seek blessing from the relics of anyone other than the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, for example the water remaining after wudu, his hair, his sweat or any other part of the body. All of these things are specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and this is because Allah had blessed his body and anything else that he touched. This is the reason why no companion sought blessing or virtue from each other during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ or after his death, even to the extent that blessings or tabarruk was not sought from the four rightly guided Khulafa Rashidun or from the other virtuous companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, such actions and the understanding of the companions is a clear and manifest evidence they understood tabarruk ie blessings to be specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ which was impermissible for anyone else. It is also impermissible for anyone who is not a Prophet because it leads to and is a means to Shirk with Allah which is also the false worship of others. Likewise, and similarly it is not correct to make wasilah of the essence or selfness of Prophet ie dhat, his attributes, his blessings, his station and status because it lacks evidence. This is also due to the fact that it is a means and also leads to Shirk with Allah, this is extremism as well as exaggeration in the status and station of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the reasons is is impermissible is because none of the companions adopted or practiced this type of wasilah. If this was something good, they would have surely preceded us.  Another reason why it is impermissible is because it opposes evidence s from the Shari’ah. Allah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Allah has the most beautiful names, so call him by them.” (al-A’raf:180)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Apart from Allah&#8217;s name, it is permissible to make wasilah through his attributes like Honour, mercy and speech which is established and proven from the authentic hadith, in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would seek refuge in Allah through his Speech, Honour, Mercy and Power. (Muslim no.2202, 2708).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also by having Iman in Allah and his Messenger, it is a means of loving both. Hence it is permissible to seek nearness or closeness to Allah via his righteous good deeds. This is exemplified in the incidence of the people of the cave, who sought shelter in a cave from rain when eventually a rock covered the entrance and blocked it. The people did not have the power to remove the rock, so they began to figure out a way in how to deal with the calamity, and so they agreed to supplicate to Allah by mentioning the good deeds they had done, and would use them as interecessors. So one used his good conducts with is parents as a means to seek nearness to Allah, so the rock moved a little. The second person used his deed of abstaining from fornication as a means to seeking closeness to Allah despite having the ability to do so, so the rocked moved a little more. The third person sought means of closeness by mentioning his good deeds of being honest and trustworthy, eventually the rocked moved from the entrance of the cave and they were eventually able to leave. This is an incident of the people or nations before, so It contains admonition and guidance for us all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This answer has been further expounded by Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim in their respective books. Allamah Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan has also addressed it in his <em>Fath al-Majid Sharh Kitab al-Tawhid.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the hadith of the blind man who sought intercession through the Prophet ﷺ which also mentions the Prophet ﷺ interceded on his behalf, so Allah restored his sight (Ahmad 4:134, Tirmidhi no.3579, Ibn Majah 1404, see also Shaikh al-Albani’s al-Tawassul wal-Wasilah p.75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we should know, this hadith did not mention his station or status as a means of closeness or intercession but rather it was due to the supplication of the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, his intercession, using his own wasitah and wasilah as the hadith clearly states. Furthermore, the people will go to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for this type of intercession on the Day of Judgement so that Allah makes Judgement on them quickly (Bukhari 7410, Muslim 193).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, and similarly the people of Jannah will come to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and ask him to intercede with Allah on their behalf for them to enter Jannah quickly (Muslim 196).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the aforementioned forms of Wasilah, whether they are related to when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was living or the afterlife, all in all of them are related to the Wasilah or du’a of intercession and not due to his selfness, ie Dhat or due to the right of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Tuhfatul Ikhwan Bajwibah Muhimmah Tataluq Biarkan al-Islam</em> (Question 5 p.29), see also <em>Majmu’a Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawah</em> (7:67)   </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the main aims of Salafi Research Institute is to uphold the views of Ahl al-Sunnah wa Ahl al-Ḥadīth with regards to the matters of creed and manhaj as established by the pious predecessors namely the Salaf us-Ṣāleḥ.  In serving this aim we within SRI continuously strive to rebut and clarify the doubts posed by deviant ideologies based on authentic clear and pristine teachings of the Qurʾān and Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In line with the above; we present to you the second part in a series answering the false arguments presented for the impermissible forms of Tawassul and Istighātha.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This and other research papers, we hope In-Shāʾ-Allāh, will aid the Sunnī Muslim to protect himself from the misinterpretations, distortions and alterations of the people of deviation and innovation. With the aid and assistance of Allāh, The Most Merciful; these articles and research papers will be released and shared on a periodic basis. May Allāh have Mercy on us and grant us the understanding of the correct ʿAqīdah of Ahl al-Sunnah waʾl Jamaʿah and the Salaf us-Ṣāleḥ.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sūfī’s, including the likes of the Barewlī’s and Deobandī sects use this ḥadīth of Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha as proof for making Tawassul through the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the Prophets. They claim the wording of the ḥadīth is proof for the permissibility of wasīlah through the Prophets. The proceeding discourse investigates this ḥadīth by looking at its authenticity and a brief overview of the text.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the end, we have touched on the ridiculously despicable claim made by some desperate abhorrent people, who tried to allege our beloved and beautiful Prophet, Muḥammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) committed necrophilia. When such people have no share of any academic discourse they always resort to such despicable lies and weak arguments to defame Islām. This then is an answer to the Ḥadīth of Fātimah bin Asad; The mother of ʿAlī RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnhumā</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Ḥadīth</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">عن أنس بن مالك قال‏:‏ لما ماتت فاطمة بنت أسد بن هاشم أم علي رضي الله عنهما دخل عليها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فجلس عند رأسها فقال‏:‏ ‏&#8221;‏رحمك الله يا أمي، كنت أمي بعد أمي، تجوعين وتشبعيني، وتعرين وتكسيني، وتمنعين نفسك طيباً وتطعميني، تريدين بذلك وجه الله والدار الآخرة‏&#8221;‏‏.‏ ثم أمر أن تغسل ثلاثاً فلما بلغ الماء الذي فيه الكافور سكبه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بيده، ثم خلع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قميصه فألبسها إياه، وكفنها ببرد فوقه، ثم دعا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أسامة بن زيد وأبا أيوب الأنصاري وعمر بن الخطاب وغلاماً أسود يحفرون، فحفروا قبرها، فلما بلغوا اللحد حفره رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بيده وأخرج ترابه بيده، فلما فرغ دخل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فاضطجع فيه فقال‏:‏ ‏&#8221;‏الله الذي يحيي ويميت، وهو حي لا يموت، اغفر لأمي فاطمة بنت أسد، ولقنها حجتها، ووسِّع عليها مدخلها بحق نبيك والأنبياء الذين من قبلي فإنك أرحم الراحمين‏&#8221;‏‏.‏ وكبر عليها أربعاً، وأدخلوها اللحد هو والعباس وأبو بكر الصديق رضي الله عنهم‏</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>It is narrated by Anas bin Mālik. He said: When the mother of ʿAlī bin Abū Ṭālib — Fātimah bint Asad bin Hāshim (RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnhumā— died, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) called on her and sat down by the head of the bed and said, “O dear mother, may Allāh have mercy on you. After my mother, you were the one I regarded as my mother. When I was hungry you fed me to the point of saturation while you yourself remained hungry. Then you helped me put on clothes and instead of eating yourself, you gave me nice things to eat. You did all this for Allāh’s pleasure and for a good reward in the Hereafter.” Then he (the Prophet) commanded to bathe her three times. When camphor water was brought, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) poured some water into his hands. Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) took off his shirt and clothed her with it and used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin. Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) sent for Ūsāmah bin Zayd, Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī and ʿUmar bin al-Khaṭṭāb and the Abyssinian slave to dig up the grave. So they dug her grave. When they reached near the laḥd, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) dug it up and drew the soil out with his own hands. When he finished, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) entered and lay down in (the grave), and said, “It is Allāh Who controls life and death, and He is Ever living and will never die. (O Allāh,) forgive my mother—Fātimah bint Asad— and help her answer properly at the time of questioning and through the mediation/right of Your Prophet (Muḥammad) and the former Prophets, Surely You are infinitely Merciful.” Then he repeated, “Allāh is Great” four times (i.e. led the funeral prayer). Then he, ʿAbbās and Abū Bakr as-Ṣiddīq lowered her into the grave.</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“No one has transmitted this Ḥadīth from ʿĀṣim al-Aḥwal except Sufyān and it’s the lone report of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ.”</em> (<em>Muʿajam al-Awsaṭ</em> (1:68), Cairo: Dar al-Ḥaramayn, 1415H/1995)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abū Nuʿaym al-Aṣfahānī said after transmitting the report,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is Gharīb from the Ḥadīth of ʿĀṣim and al-Thawrī and we do not write it except it being the lone report of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ.” </em>(<em>al-Ḥilyah ul-Awliyāʾ wa Ṭabaqāt al-Aṣfiyā</em> (3:121, under the entry of ʿĀṣim bin Suleimān al-Aḥwal no.226), Beirut: Maktabah Khanjī/Dār al-Fikr, 1416H/1996)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also transmits it with the same chain in <em>Maʿrifah al-Ṣahābah</em> and he cites the same chain as the Ḥilyah. (<em>Maʿrifah al-Sahābah</em> (6:3408, tarjamah no. 3970 no.7783), Riyadh, Dār al-Waṭan, 1419H/1998)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Nūr al-Dīn al-Haythamī said after transmitting it,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“No one narrates it from ʿĀṣim except Sufyān and it is a lone report of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ.”</em> (<em>Majmaʿa al-Baḥrayn</em> (6:362), Riyadh: Maktabah Ibn Rushd, 1413H/1992)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He, al-Haythamī also said after transmitting it in his <em>Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid</em> said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Transmitted by Ṭabarānī in al-Kabīr and in al-Awsaṭ and Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ is in the chain who was declared trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim, however he has weakness with him and the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ.”</em> (<em>Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid</em> (9:256-257), Cairo: Maktabah al-Quddūsī, 1414H:1994)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī narrates from Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ (<em>Kitāb al-Maʿrifah wal-Tārīkh</em> (3:513), Madīnah: Maktabah al-Dār, 1410H), <em>Mawḍeḥ al-Awhām al-Jamʿa waʿl Tafrīq</em> (2:96-97)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said he wrote narrations from 1,000 teachers and all of them were trustworthy as stated by Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr in his <em>Tahdhīb al-Tahdhīb</em> under the entry of Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān (<em>Tahdhīb al-Tahdhīb</em> 11:337 no.8138), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1415H/1994).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, this renders Rawhū to be trustworthy according to Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Aḥmad al-Ḥākim al-Kabīr brings his entry in his book of names and kunyahs, without any praise or criticism. (<em>Kitāb al-Asāmī wal-Kuna</em> (3:419 no.1637), Madīnah: Maktabah al-Ghurabāʿ al-Athariyyah, 1414H/1994)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy brings under Rawhū bin Ṣalāh’s entry says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Weak…. he does not have many ḥadīth narrated from (names of narrators) and some of them are rejected.” He also cites a few other reports under Rawhū’s biographical entry and says these two aḥadīth are unpreserved.”</em> (<em>al-Kāmil Fiʾl Duʿafaʾ al-Rijāl</em> (4:553-554 no.668), Riyādh: Maktabah al-Rushd, Edn. Māzin al-Sarsāwī)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy thus further indicates the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ by mentioning two unpreserved chains.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dāraquṭnī brings his entry in his book and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ bin Sayābah, he narrates from Ibn Lahiyyʿah and from al-Thawrī and others, he was weak in ḥadīth and he resided in Miṣr.”</em> (<em>al-Muʿtalif waʾl Mukhtalif </em>(3:1377), Beirut: Dār al-Gharb al-Islāmī, 1406H/1986)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Ḥāfiẓ al-Burqānī’s question to Imām al-Dāraquṭnī he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abuʾl Ḥasan (ie Imām Dāraquṭnī) said to me, I heard Abū Ṭālib say, the brother of Maymūn, his name was Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī, he was a resident of Miṣr, he said to me, “We are in agreement (ie the people of ḥadīth) that we do not write the ḥadīth of three people of Miṣr, (1) ʿAlī bin al-Ḥasan al-Sāmī (2) Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and (3) ʿAbd al-Munʿim bin Bashīr.”</em> (<em>Suwālāt Abī Bakr al-Burqānī lil-Dāraquṭnī Fī al-Jarḥ waʾl Taʿdīl</em> (p.56-57 no.18), Cairo: Maktabah al-Qurʿān, ?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Burqānī further said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“And then Abuʾl Ḥasan (ie Imām Dāraquṭnī) said to me, Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, he is also referred to as Rawhū bin Sayābah Miṣrī, likewise ʿAbd al-Munʿim Miṣrī and ʿAlī bin al-Ḥasan al-Sāmī Miṣrī.”</em> (<em>Suwālāt Abī Bakr al-Burqānī lil-Dāraquṭnī Fī al-Jarḥ waʾl Taʿdīl</em> (p.57)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people of a country know its people better, especially when it comes to praise and criticism and this is a general principle. Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī was given the title of al-Ḥāfiẓ and he was also a resident of Miṣr, the likes of Imām al-Ṭabarānī narrated from him. He died in the year 296H. (<em>Tārīkh Baghdād</em> (5:8).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is why Imām al-Dāraquṭnī specifically mentions Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī as a resident of Miṣr and he further emphasises this by mentioning the names of the three narrators and refers to them as al-Miṣrī. The affair of the other two narrators is very disparaging which gives us an indication of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ. (refer to the general books of Rijāl)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī brings his entry in his book on making distinctions between narrators without mentioning any praise or criticism and clarifies Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, is also Rawhū bin Sayābah al-Ḥarithī and then brings the statement of Imām al-Dāraquṭnī, where he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ bin Sayābah.”</em> (<em>Mawḍeḥ al-Awhām al-Jamʿa waʾl Tafrīq</em> (2:96-97) Beirut: Dār al-Fikr al-Islāmī, 1405H/1985)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Ḥibbān added his biographical note in his book of trustworthy narrators, he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, from the people of Miṣr, he narrates from Yaḥyā bin Ayūb and his countrymen and Muḥammad bin Ibrāhīm al-Bawshanjī narrates from him, he was from the people of Miṣr.”</em> (<em>Kitāb al-Thiqāt</em> (8:244), Hyderabād: Daʾirah al-Maʿārif al-Uthmāniyyah, 1393H/1973)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Sijzī asked Imām al-Ḥākim about him and he replied,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāh, trustworthy and safe, he was from the people of Shām.”</em> (<em>Suwālāt Masʿud bin ʿAlī al-Sijzī Maʿa Asilah al-Baghdadiyīn ʿAnn Aḥwāl al-Rūwāt Lil Ḥākim</em> (p.98 no.68), Beirut, Dār al-Gharb al-Islāmī, 1408H/1988)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Mākūlā after mentioning him says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ bin Sayābah, who narrates from Ibn Lahiyyʿah, al-Thawrī and others, he was declared weak in ḥadīth and was a resident of Miṣr.”</em> (<em>al-Ikmāl Fī Rafʿa al-Irtiyāb ʿAnn Muʿtalif Fī al-Asmā wal-Kunā waʾl-Ansāb</em> (5:15), Hyderabād: Daʾirah al-Maʿārif al-Uthmāniyyah, 1383H/1963)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The words of Imām Ibn Mākūlā, <em>“He was declared weak ie Ḍaʿfūhu.”</em> Indicates a number of scholars of Ḥadīth declared him to be weak and hence indicates a general agreement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-ʿAsqalānī said under his entry,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ibn ʿAdiyy weakened him, Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned him in his al-Thiqāt, al-Ḥākim said he was trustworthy and safe, Ibn Yūnus mentioned in Tārīkh al-Ghurabāʿ he was from the people of Moṣul and resided in Miṣr and they narrate from him, and narrations which are rejected have been transmitted from him (ie he would narrate rejected narrations). al-Dāraquṭnī said he was weak in ḥadīth. Ibn Mākūlā said they have declared him to be weak and Ibn ʿAdiyy said after transmitting two of his ḥadīth, he has many aḥadīth and some of them are rejected.”</em> (<em>Lisān al-Mizān</em> (2:539-540 no.3433), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1416H/1996)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We looked at the <em>Tārīkh al-Ghurabāʿ</em> of Ibn Yūnus and were unable to find his statement on Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, this does not indicate in any form that Ibn Ḥajr erred but rather that we were unable to find it, therefore, if anyone does find Ibn Yūnus’s statement please do inform us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī said in his biographical note on Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ibn ʿAdiyy weakened him, Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned him in his al-Thiqāt, al-Ḥākim said he was trustworthy and safe.”</em> (<em>Mizān al-ʿEitidāl</em> (3:87 no.2804), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1416H/1995)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In his reference work on the history of Islām, Imām al-Dhahabī includes an entry for him, after mentioning the people he narrated from as well as those who narrated from him, he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He has reprehensive (Manākīr-narrations), Ibn ʿAdiyy said he is weak, Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned him in his al-Thiqāt, he died in Ramaḍhān in Miṣr in (2)33H, he was from the last people who narrated from Musā, Yaḥyā and Saʿīd. al-Ḥākim said he was trustworthy and safe and a Shāmī.”</em> (<em>Tārīkh al-Islām wa Wafyāt al-Mashāhīr al-ʿAlām</em> (17:160-161 no.138), Beirut: Dār al-Kitāb al-ʿArabī, 1411H/1991)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr, Imām al-Dhahabī and others have taken al-Ḥākims view from al-Sijzī and mentioned it in their respective books. Likewise, it is possible that Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr also quoted the view of Ibn Yūnus from his <em>Tārīkh al-Ghurabāʿ.</em> The intent here is to show Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr in his <em>Lisān</em> takes the statement from the books of the earlier scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī further brings his entry in his book of weak and abandoned narrators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, he narrates from Ibn Lahiyyʿah, Ibn ʿAdiyy said he is weak.”</em> (<em>Diwān al-Ḍuʿafāʾ wal-Matrūkīn </em>(1:294 no.1427), Beirut: Dār al-Qalam, 1408H/1988)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also brings him in his other book on weak narrators, wherein he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ al-Miṣrī, he narrates from Ibn Lahiyyʿah, Ibn ʿAdiyy weakened him and he is also called Ibn Yasābah (this is a typo it should Sayābah).”</em> (<em>al-Mughnī Fiʾl Ḍuʿafāʾ</em> (1:356 no.2139), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1418H/1997), Edn.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn al-Jawzī has also classed him as a weak and abandoned narrator, he mentions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, or they say Rawhū bin Shibābah (it should be Sayābah), his kunyah is Abaʾl Ḥārith, he narrates from Ibn Lahiyyʿah, Ibn ʿAdiyy said he is weak.” </em>(<em>Kitāb al-Ḍuʿafāʾ wal-Matrūkīn </em>(1:287 no.1643), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah,?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Ḥāfiẓ Ibn al-Jawzī cites this report in his book of fabricated and weak narrations under the chapter of the virtues of Fātimah bint Asad, and then transmits it with his chain through to al-Ṭabarānī and thereafter says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>The author (ie referring to himself) says this is a lone report of Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ who is from the unknown narrators and furthermore, Ibn ʿAdiyy has declared him to be weak.”</em> (<em>al-ʿEllal al-Mutānahiyyah Fīʾl Aḥadīth al-Wahiyyah</em> (1:268-269 no.433), Faiṣalabād: Idārah ʿUlūm al-Atharīyyah, 1399H/1979), Cf.

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ṭabāranī transmits in in his al-Awsaṭ p.356-357 part of the Majmaʿa al-Baḥrayn and he said, “no one has transmitted this from ʿĀṣim except Sufyān and it’s the lone report of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and it is mentioned in Majmaʿa 9:257 that Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is in the chain, who was declared trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim, however he has weakness in him and the rest of the narrators are the narrator of the Ṣaḥīḥ and Abū Nuʿaym also transmitted it from the author in al-Ḥilyah 3:121.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>My Shaykh (ie Shaykh al-Albānī) has challenged the statement of Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythami in his Silsilah Āḥadith al-Ḍaʿīfahʾ no.23, where he says in Majmaʿa the rest of the narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ, that Aḥmad bin Ḥamād (bin Zughbah), who although is in himself trustworthy the authors of the Ṣaḥīḥs have not transmitted from him as only al-Nasāʿī transmits from him.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ḥamdi ʿAbd al-Majīd al-Salafī answers the authentication of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“As for Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who has been declared to be trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and Hakim, then it is well known about both of them that they are mutasāhil ie lenient. He was declared to be weak by Ibn ʿAdiyy and Ibn Yūnus said he would narrate rejected narrations. Darāquṭnī said he is weak in Ḥadīth and Ibn Mākūlā weakened him and Ibn ʿAdiyy said after transmitting two of this ḥadīth he has many āḥadīth and some of them are abandoned.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Thus, this is detailed criticism from the specialist critical analysts, furthermore, his narrations are rejected and this is the case with this narration and when he is alone in reporting such ḥadīth they are rejected and cannot be used as evidence therefore, the ḥadīth is is weak.” </em>(<em>Muʿajam al-Kabīr</em> (24:351-352), Cairo: Maktabah Ibn Taymiyyah, 1415H/1994)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The verifier of <em>Majmaʿa al-Baḥrayn Fi Zawāʿid al-Muʿajamayn</em>, ʿAbd al-Quddus bin Muḥammad Naẓīr also declared the chain to be weak as well as the narrator Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ. (<em>Majmaʿa al-Baḥrayn</em> (6:361)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAbd Allah bin Ṣiddīq al-Ghumārī also acknowledges that Rawhū has some weakness with him and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū, his weakness is light.”</em> (<em>Ittihāf al-Azkiyaʾ Bijawāj al-Tawassul bil-Anbiyāʾ waʾl Awliyāʾ (p.11)</em> (?: ʾAlī Raḥmī, p.11) and (p.20) cited from <em>Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ</em> (p.146)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albānī also categorically grades it to be weak. He quotes the references first and then the chain followed by the words of Imām al-Ṭabarānī and Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythamī and then proceeds to answer al-Haythamī’s claim. We have quoted the words of Shaikh al-Albānī via the words of Shaikh Ḥamdī ʿAbd al-Majīd al-Salafī that only al-Nasāʿī transmits from Aḥmad bin Ḥamād bin Zughbah. Shaikh al-Albānī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“and his statement “the rest of the narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ” is highly disputable as Zugbah is not from the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ’s, rather they did not transmit from him except al-Nasāʿī, I say we know from this that he is in of himself trustworthy. What therefore remains is the affair of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, and he is a lone reporter as al-Ṭabarānī said and also what al-Haythamī mentions the authentication of Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim but his weakening (by al-Ṭabarānī) has precedence over their statements due to two issues. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The First:</em></strong><em> He is criticised and criticism takes precedence over praise with conditions. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The Second:</em></strong><em> Ibn Ḥibbān is lenient in his authentication of narrators and he has authenticated many narrators who are unknown to the extent that at times he clarifies he does not know who they are nor their fathers as Ibn ʿAbd al-Hādī has mentioned in al-Ṣārim al-Munkī. </em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albānī adds a footnote at this point and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have mentioned some examples (of Imām Ibn Ḥibbāns leniency) in ‘al-Radd ʿAla al-Taʿqub al-Ḥathīth (p.18-21) and then in the introduction of my book, ‘Taysīr Intifāʿ al-Khalān Bikitāb Thiqāt Ibn Ḥibbān’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albāni continues and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The affair is the same with al-Ḥākim and his lapses which are not hidden from the one who is well acquainted with biographies and narrators. Therefore, their statements do not hold weight when there are contradictions even when there is undetailed criticism and the reasons for the criticism is not mentioned but then how about the affair with Ibn Ṣalāḥ when the details are mentioned…”</em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then Shaikh al-Albānī then mentions the criticism and disparaging remarks of the scholars of ḥadīth which have preceded. He continues and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“You have seen how the Imams of criticism (Aiʿmah al-Jarḥ) are in agreement in their words in the weakening of this narrator and they clarify the reason for his weakness due to him narrating rejected reports. The same applies to this report in which he is alone in reporting and thus he is rejected and not used as evidence and therefore, no one is deceived by this praise and authentication except the ignorant or the one with other agenda’s.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>After what has preceded it is apparent to a fair minded person that when Shaikh Zāhid al-Kawtharī spoke about this ḥadīth he was not just with the knowledge of this science. He attempts to strengthen this ḥadīth and he only mentioned the praise and authentication of Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and totally failed to mention the criticism and disaparaging remarks which were greater than those who authenticated him. (Refer to (p.379) Maqalāt al-Kawtharī)</em> (<em>Silsilah Āḥadīth al-Ḍaʿīfahʾ</em> (1:79-82 no.23), Riyadh, Maktabah al-Māʿrif, 1412H/1992)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albāni continues and shows the contradictions of al-Kawtharī and his principles and takes charge of the claims, showing his double standards on the authentications of Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim. He also answers the claim the reason for the criticism is not mentioned and proceeds to mention the reasons. Shaikh Mamḥūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ despite his valiant digressive efforts fails to answer the reason for the criticism as he gracefully glosses over it in his <em>Rafʿ al-Minārah</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It must be noted Shaikh Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ’s response to Shaikh al-Albānī’s answer to this report are significantly inadequate and falls short of being even remotely convincing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albānī further answered some of their retorts and replied directly back to them in his book on Tawassul and went onto to say some of their points were laughable, he said after quoting the text of the ḥadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;al-Haythamī said in Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid (9:257) &#8220;al-Ṭabarānī reports it in al-Kabīr and Awsaṭ and it contains Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who is declared reliable by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim, but is somewhat weak. Then the rest of its narrators are those of the Ṣaḥīḥs.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>I say: by the way of Ṭabarānī it is reported in Abū Nuʿaym in Ḥilyahtul Awliyāʾ (3:121) and their chain of narration is weak since Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who is one its narrators is alone in narrating it as Abū Nuʿaym himself said. Then Rawhū is declared to be weak by Ibn ʿAdiyy, and Ibn Yūnus said, &#8220;Weak and reprehensible things are reported from him.&#8221;al-Dāraquṭnī said, &#8220;He is Ḍaʿīf (weak) in ḥadīth.&#8221; Ibn Mākūlā said, &#8220;They declare him weak.&#8221; Ibn ʿAdiyy said after quoting two of his ḥadīth, &#8220;He reports many Āḥadith and some of them are reprehensible.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So they agree upon his weakness, so the ḥadīth is weak ie munkar since he is alone in reporting it. There are some people who try to strengthen this ḥadīth based upon the declaration of Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim that Rawhū is reliable. However, this will not benefit them due to what is known with regard to their leniency in declaration of reliability.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So this saying of theirs when opposed by sayings of other scholars does not carry any weight even if the declaration of weakness by the other scholars is not explained, so how about when the reason for weakness is made clear as is the case here? I have also fully explained the weakness of this Ḥadīth in al-Ḍaʿīfah no.23 and so I will not repeat that here.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The antagonists whom we have indicated quote that which can only cause laughter, saying, &#8220;Shaikh Nāṣir judged it to be weak, so we ask that he tell us who from the scholars of ḥadīth has declared this ḥadīth to be weak.&#8221; We quoted those who declare its narrator Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ to be weak, and he is alone in reporting it. This automatically means weakness of the ḥadīth unless someone is found to report it along with him, and Abū Nuʿaym had denied that there is anyone supporting this narration, unless another narration of it is found, and that is not the case!</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Then they say, &#8220;Even if we accept that it is weak, then it is only slightly weak which would not prevent action upon it, since it is a case of acting on a ḥadīth whose weakness is not severe in that which relates to mere encouragement and warnings, which is allowed by the scholars of Ḥadīth and Fiqh.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>I say: there is no encouragement in this ḥadīth, nor does it explain some excellent for an action which is already established as being practised in the sharīʿah. Rather it is speaking about something which may be permissible or may not be permissible, therefore it is being used to establish a sharīʿah ruling, if it were authentic. Furthermore, these people are quoting it as a proof for this form of Tawassul about which there is disagreement. So when you accept its weakness then it is not permissible to use it as proof. I do not think any intelligent person would agree that it pertains tore encouragement and warnings. Rather this is the way of those who flee away from submission to the truth, they say things which no intelligent person would say.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tawassul: It&#8217;s Types and Its Rulings</em> (p.101-102) Eng.

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>INTERESTING BENEFIT &#8211; Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is Weak According to the Principles of Shaikh Ẓafar Aḥmad Thānwī</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to the principle of Shaikh Ẓafar Aḥmad Thānwī any narrator not mentioned in The <em>Līsan al-Mizān</em> of Ḥāfiẓ and in the <em>Mizān al-ʿEitidāl</em> of Imām Dhahabī is considered to be trustworthy. Then we say the opposite must also be true by natural default according to Shaikh Ẓafar Aḥmad Thānwī, meaning that any narrator mentioned in the <em>Lisān</em> and <em>Mizān</em> is rendered to be untrustworthy. (<em>Iʿla al-Sunan</em> (7:256)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Understanding Hāfiz al-Haithami&#8217;s Words <em>Rijāluhu Rijāl al-Ṣaḥīḥ</em></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ie and <em>&#8220;the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ&#8221;</em> sometimes when the words of Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythamī are quoted like this after a ḥadīth has been mentioned, a reader’s natural inclination is that the remaining narrators are trustworthy and in turn the narration is authentic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafī scholar, Ḥāfiẓ Zaylaʿī has explained this is not the case and says in very clear words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;If a narrator has been utilised as evidence in the Ṣaḥīḥ, it does not necessitate that every ḥadīth he is in (as a narrator) will fulfil the conditions of an authentic ḥadīth.&#8221;</em> (<em>Naṣb al-Rāyah</em> (1:342)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr also said the same with almost identical words in <em>his al-Nukt ʿAla Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ</em> (1:275) as does Imām Ibn ʿAbd al-Hādī in his <em>Ṣārim al-Munkī</em> (p.256, 259)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Those Who Authenticated Rawhū in Ṣalāḥ and the Chain</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From those who have authenticated the chain are,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-Haythamī wherein he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>Narrated by al-Ṭabarānī with a good chain…”</em> (<em>Ḥāshiyyah al-ʿAllāmah Ibn Ḥajr al-Haythamī ʿAla Sharḥ al-Ayḍaḥ Fi Manāsik al-Ḥajj Lil Imām al-Nawawī</em> (p.500), Beirut: Dar al-Ḥadīth, ?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said the same in his <em>al-Jawhar al-Munaẓẓam Fī Ziyārah al-Qabr al-Sharīf al-Nabawī al-Mukarram</em> (p.110-111), Cairo: Maktabah Madbūlī, 2000)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An infamous writer Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed has alleged, <em>‘Imām al-Samhūdī in his Khulaṣatul Wafāʾ bi-Akhbār Dār al-Muṣtafā has apparently mentioned that this Ḥadīth has a Jayyid Sanad.’ </em>However, al-Samhūdī said the opposite, wherein he asserts and acknowledges weakness in the chain as is evident from his words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Samhūdī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Transmitted in al-Kabīr and Awsaṭ with a chain containing Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ who was declared trustworthy by Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim however he has weakness whereas the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Ṣaḥīḥ.”</em> (<em>Wafāʾ al-Wafā Biakhbār Dār al-Muṣtafā</em> (3:898-899), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1404H/1984), Cf. <em>Khulāṣah al-Wafā Biakhbār Dār al-Muṣtafā</em> (p.421), Madīnah: al-Maktabah al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1392H/1972), another edition (2:369), Dr. Muḥammad al-Āmīn)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">None of the earlier scholars authenticated the chain except the later ones as mentioned above and they were from the 8th-9th century. This authentication of the later scholars has to be scrutinised and investigated before it is taken as accepted. Even this in the current state only leaves the view of Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-Haythamī to be investigated as Ḥāfiẓ Samhūdī pointed to its weakness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Naturally al-Kawtharī cites the significant words of this report and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The narrators of this ḥadīth are trustworthy except Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and al-Ḥākim said he was trustworthy and safe and Ibn Ḥibbān brings his entry in his al-Thiqāt.” </em>(<em>Maḥqū al-Taqawwūl Fī Masalāḥ al-Tawassūl</em> (p.4), Cairo: al-Maktabah al-Azhariyyah lit-Turāth, 2006), also from <em>Maqalāt al-Kawtharī</em> (p.340), Cairo: Maktabah al-Tawfiqia, ?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, al-Kawtharī himself acknowledges the leniency of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim in the same book <em>al-Maqalāt</em> as mentioned by Imām al-Albānī in <em>Silsilah al-Ḍaʿīfahʾ</em> (1:81), yet here they take and accept the same leniency as evidence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad ibn ʿAlawī al-Malikī quotes it in his book and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is a difference of opinion regarding one of the narrators, Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ, however Ibn Ḥibbān mentions him in his al-Thiqāt and al-Ḥākim said he was safe and trustworthy. So both of them, the two Ḥāfiẓs authenticated the ḥadīth. Likewise al-Haythamī followed up on this in (Majmaʿa al-Zawāʿid) and said Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is in the chain, Ibn Ḥibbān declared him to be trustworthy as did al-Ḥākim, however, he has some weakness and the remaining narrators are the narrator of the Ṣaḥīḥs.”</em> (<em>Mafāhīm Yajib ʿAnn Tuṣaḥaḥ</em> (p.146), Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyyah, 1430H/2009)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamdūḥ does the same and claims the narration is Ḥasan. He also quotes the statements of the scholars as we have mentioned above. He says the scholars have differed over Rawhū, some have said he is weak and others have declared him trustworthy. (<em>Rafʿ ul-Minārah Li-Takhrīj Aḥadīth al-Tawassul wal-Ziyārah</em> (p.147-148), Cairo, Maktabah al-Azhariyyah Lit-Turāth, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʿIsā Himyarī jubilantly went on to assert the Ḥadīth is Ṣaḥīḥ ie authentic according to the conditions of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim and Ḥasan according to the conditions of others. (<em>al-Tāʾmul Fī Ḥaqīqah al-Tawassul</em>, p.214-215)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a little imaginative of Himyarī to say the ḥadīth is authentic according to the condition of both Imām Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">G.F. Ḥaddād has also attempted to authenticate this report while relying on the works of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ and Muḥammad bin ʿAlawī al-Malikī. He pushes the line of argument of Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ that the criticism is undetailed which is laughable as we have shown in this discourse. The Sūfī Aḥmad Daḥlān has also attempted to authenticate this report as does al-Ḥabīb al-Jifrī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The central argument of the detractors is that Rawhū is differed over and that the criticism levied against him is not detailed but rather general and therefore we take the general praise and authentication of him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and accepted by the detractors themselves that Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and Imām al-Ḥākim are both mutāsahil ie lenient with their gradings and authentication. It does not make sense for them to accept this and leave the criticism. They couple this argument with the fact the criticism and discrediting is undetailed and vague, therefore one retorts to the position of praise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This has been answered by Shaikh al-Albānī and the scholars before him wherein he mentions the reasons Rawhū is weak. The main reason being he would narrate rejected narrations and that his narrations were rejected themselves. At times he would be a lone reporter of narration without any support.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAmr bin ʿAbd al-Munʿim explains that Imāms al-Ṭabarānī, Abū Nuʿaym and Ḥāfiẓ al-Haythamī have all declared this to be a lone report of Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and none of the other students and companions of Sufyān narrates this from except Rawhū ibn Ṣalāḥ and these other students of Sufyān were memorisers and trustworthy narrators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Imām Ibn Ḥibbān citing Rawhū in his <em>al-Thiqat</em>, it is not tantamount to trustworthiness as he is known to be lenient ie Mutasāhil. Whatever he mentions under his entry in his <em>al-Thiqāt</em> does not clarify the affair of Rawhū except that it is information as we have shown under his entry, which has preceded. Rather we find this entry alludes to all of his narrations being of the rejected type.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is because Imām Ibn Ḥibbān in his entry states he narrates from the people of Misr and the people of Miṣr narrate from him, however in this report Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ narrates from Sufyān al-Thawrī, who was not from the people of Miṣr, therefore this alludes to it being strange and odd as Abū Nuʿaym has highlighted with his words when he said, <em>“It is Gharīb from the ḥadīth of ʿĀṣim and al-Thawrī and we do not write it except it being the lone report of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Ḥākim is even more lenient than Imām Ibn Ḥibbān, ie more mutasāhil, as al-Suyūṭī has quoted from Ḥāfiẓ al-ʿIrāqī who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Ḥākim is more lenient than him (ie Ibn Ḥibbān</em>)” (<em>al-Tadrīb al-Rāwī</em> (1:108)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAmr bin ʿAbd al-Munʿim goes into detail answering the authentication of Imām al-Ḥākim and answers Maḥmūd Saʿīd Mamduḥ’s discussion on the validity of al-Ḥākim’s statement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān’s authentication. This is also inaccurate and needs investigation, in fact such a point is rejected. Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr quotes the statement of Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī that he wrote narrations from 1,000 teachers from Ḥāfiẓ al-Mizzī’s <em>Tahdhīb al-Kamāl </em>(23:324).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Dhahabī rejects this assertion and claims and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I say he does not have that many teachers except roughly about 300, so where are the remainder? And the ones which are mentioned a group (of scholars) have weakened them.”</em> (<em>Siyar ʿAlām al-Nabulāʾ</em> (13:181)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Summarised from ʿAmr ʿAbd al-Munʿim Salīm’s, <em>Hadmul Minārah Liman Ṣaḥḥaḥa Āḥadīth al-Tawassul wal-Ziyārah</em> (p.126-134), Ṭanṭā: Dār ul-Dhiyāʿ, 1422H/2001)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Fawzān bin Sābiq bin Fawzān al-Fawzān (d.1373H) also weakened Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ and this report. (<em>al-Bayān waʾl Ishār Likashf Zaig al-Mulḥid al-Hāj Mukhtār</em> (p.363), Beirut, Dār al-Gharb al-Islāmī, 1422H/2001)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muqbil also alludes to Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ being weak in his checking of the narrators in <em>Sunan al-Dāraquṭnī</em>. (<em>Tarājim Rijāl al-Dāraquṭnī Fi Sunan</em> (1:225 no.550), Ṣanʿa, Dār al-Athār, 1420H/1999)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair ʿAlī Zaʾī graded the report to weak on account of the weakness of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ according to the scholars of Ḥadīth. He also argued, even if he was authentic the second problem is the tadlīs of Sufyān al-Thawrī. Shaikh Zubair said seven scholars of Ḥadīth classed Rawhū to be weak,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Ibn ʿAdiyy, (2) Ibn Yūnus, (3) al-Dāraquṭnī, (4) Ibn Mākūlā, (5) al-Dhahabī, (6) Ibn al-Jawzī, (7) Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Zakariyyah al-Baghdādī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān, al-Ḥākim authenticated him and Yaʿqūb bin Sufyān al-Fasawī narrated from him. These three authentications are rejected based on the criticism of the majority of the scholars of ḥadīth. (<em>al-Ḥadīth no.76, Ramaḍḥān 1431H/September 2010, p.9-12).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, rather it is argued there is only actually one scholar who praised him and that is Imām al-Ḥākim with two words of <em>Thiqah al-Māmūn</em> and therefore holding onto just the words of al-Ḥākim, whose authentication is known to be unreliable.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imām Ibn Ḥibbān&#8217;s Authentication of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The detractors rely on the alleged authentication of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān, that he entered Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ in his <em>al-Thiqāt</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Firstly:</strong> We have shown and mentioned from the words of the scholars it is generally well known that Imām Ibn Ḥibbān was lenient in his gradings, and even the detractors have admitted and accepted this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> Imām Ibn Ḥibbān renders this report to be weak on account of saying Rawhū only narrated from the people of Miṣr, where as in this narration he narrates from Sufyān, who was a Kūfan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> Imām Ibn Ḥibbān entering Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ in his <em>al-Thiqat</em> does not necessitate he did not have reprehensive weak and or rejected narrations. This is because Imām Ibn Ḥibbān includes other narrators who have reprehensible and rejected narrations in the same book. For example, he includes Muḥammad bin ʿAbd Allāh bin ʿAmr in his <em>al-Thiqāt</em> and says about him that some of his Āḥadīth are manākīr ie of the reprehensible rejected type. (<em>al-Thiqāt</em> (7:417)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Leniency &#8211; Tasāhul of Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The statement of Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭī quoting Ḥāfiẓ al-ʿIrāqī has preceded where both Imams Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim were declared to be lenient as quoted by Shaikh ʿAmr bin ʿAbd al-Munʿim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Dhahabī is also of the view that Imām al-Ḥākim was lenient. (<em>Zikr Man Yuʿtamad Qawlihi Fiʾl Jarḥ wat Taʿdīl</em> (p.159) Cf. <em>al-Muwaʿqizah</em> (p.83)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ al-Sakhawī also categorises Imām al-Hākim to be lenient. (<em>al-ʿAlān Bil-Tawbih Liman Zam al-Tārīkh</em> (p.168), <em>al-Mutakallimūn Fiʾl Rijāl</em> (p.137)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAbd al-Rahman Yahyā al-Muʿallamī al-Yamānī outlined the methodology of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān and his categorisation of trustworthy narrators and those who he includes in his book, amongst them are those who are unknown ie majhul, because they do not fit the other categories. (<em>al-Tankīl Bimā Fī Ṭanīb al-Kawtharī Min al-Abāṭīl</em> (1:437-438 no.199)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The detractors have again themselves admitted and clearly acknowledged in their various writings that both Imāms Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim are lenient and mutasāhil. For example, Muḥammad Zāhid al-Kawtharī has admitted this himself in his <em>Maqalāt </em>(p.185) as mentioned by Shaikh al-Albānī in his <em>Silsilah aḤadīth al-Ḍaʿīfahʾ</em> (1:81).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Regarding another ḥadīth and the narrator contained, Shaikh al-Albānī quotes Muḥammad Zāhid al-Kawtharī as saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Yes Imām Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned him in his al-Thiqāt however his method in al-Thiqāt is that he mentions narrators in it when he is unaware of any criticism against them but this does not take them out of the condition in being unknown according to the other scholars and thus Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr has refuted Imām Ibn Ḥibbān&#8217;s inconsistencies in his Lisān al-Mizān.”</em> (<em>Maqalāt</em> (p.309)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>I say: we find the madhab from the words of al-Kawtharī, which is, that he does not rely on the authentication of Ibn Ḥibbān and al-Ḥākim because both of them are lenient ie mutasāhil. Therefore, how is that he can declare the ḥadith under discussion to be authentic and he does this just on the basis of them authenticating Rawhū ibn Ṣalāh, especially since others who are more knowledgable than them in terms of narrators declare him weak.”</em> (<em>Silsilah Āḥadīth al-Daʿīfahʾ</em> (1:82)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ẓafar Aḥmad Uthmānī has also categorised Imām al-Ḥākim as being lenient in two of his works. (<em>Iʿla al-Sunan</em> (2:107), <em>Qawaʾid ʿUlūm al-Ḥadīth</em> (p.189)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So they apply the rule when it suits their needs and desires while rejecting and overlooking it when it does not serve their intent and purposes in promoting the incorrect type of Tawassul and Wasīlah. Shaikh al-Albānī has yet again highlighted their inconsistencies and discrepancies while they play non the wiser card.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muḥibullāh Shāh al-Rāshidī al-Sindhī has also indicated the leniency of Imām Ibn Ḥibbān <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/imam-ibn-hibban-was-he-strict-or-lenient-in-grading-narrators-shaikh-muhibullah-shah-rashidi-al-sindhi-1415h/"><strong>SEE HERE</strong></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muḥammad Bashīr Sehaswānī also discusses the narration and we conclude with his words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We find that Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ is in the chain who is weak. He was declared to be weak by Ibn ʿAdiyy and according to Sakhawī he was of the intermediate level of criticised narrators. There is no reliance on Ibn Ḥibbān mentioning him in his al-Thiqāt because he is well known to authenticate unknown narrators which we have already mentioned from Mizān al-ʿEitidāl. Likewise, al-Ḥākim’s lone authentication is also unworthy to be relied upon as he is from the lenient ones.”</em> (<em>Ṣiyānatul Insān ʿAnn Waswasah al-Shaikh Daḥlān </em>(p.132)</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> The Report has a Broken or Disconnected Chain ie inqitʿa.</strong></span></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ hearing this report from Sufyān al-Thawrī is suspect and questionable from two separate indicative factors, both of which allude to Rawhū not hearing or even meeting Sufyān al-Thawrī let alone reporting this narration.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Indicative Factor &#8211; Timeline</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The time difference between Sufyān’s death and Rawhū’s is contentious. Sufyān died according to most reports in 161H and Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ died in 233H (<em>Lisān al-Mizān</em> (2:540), <em>Mizān al-ʿEitidāl </em>(3:87), <em>Tārīkh al-Islām</em> (17:161 no.138)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, there is a difference of approximately 72-73 years between their deaths and if Rawhū heard this report from Sufyān, he would have least been 16-20 years old making his birth date approximately 141-145H, taking Rawhū’s age to the late 80’s and early 90’s. It would also lead to the idea of Rawhū hearing from Sufyān al-Thawri during his later life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This should also be coupled with the fact that Sufyān al-Thawrī was a Mudallis. It is known that Imām, ʿAmīr al-Muʿminin Fil-Ḥadīth, al-Hujjah, al-ʿAbid, Sufyān al-Thawrī was an Imām of Ahl al-Sunnah and a preserver of ḥadīth of the highest level yet still he was a mudallis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Sufyān would to tadlīs from weak narrators.”</em> (<em>Mizān ul-ʿEitidal</em> (2:169), <em>Siyar ʿAlām an-Nabulāʾ </em>(7:242, 7:274).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr also said he was a mudallis. (<em>Ṭabaqāt al-Mudallisīn</em> (p.32 no.51) and <em>Taqrīb ut-Tahdhīb</em> (no.2458 pg.394) in another ed. (p.197), <em>an-Nukt</em> (2/621), <em>Irshād al-Sārī</em> (1:286)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām ʿAbdullāh ibn al-Mubārak also said Sufyān al-Thawrī would do tadlīs. (<em>Tahdhīb ut-Tahdhīb</em> (4/102)</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Indicative Factor – Country</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rawhū could not have heard from Sufyān al-Thawrī because Rawhū only narrated from the people Miṣr and only they narrated from him, whereas Imām Sufyān was from Kūfah! Remember Imām Ibn Ḥibbān said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ, from the people of Miṣr, he narrates from Yaḥyā bin Ayūb and his countrymen and Muḥammad bin Ibrāhīm al-Bawshanjī narrates from him, he was from the people of Miṣr.”</em> (<em>al-Thiqāt</em> (8:244)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the other scholars have also alluded to Rawhū only narrating from the people of Miṣr, like Ibn Yūnus, Ibn Mākūlā and al-Dāraquṭnī. These two important factors further indicate the weakness of this report based on the chain and the narrator. Furthermore, Ḥāfiẓ al-Mizzī brings a detailed entry of Sufyān al-Thawrī and lists all the people who narrated from him without mentioning Rawhū as his student or from the people who narrated from Sufyān. (<em>Tahdhīb al-Kamāl Fī Asmāʿ al-Rijāl</em> (11:161-164 no.2407), Beirut, Muassisah al-Risālah, 1408H/1987)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It can be argued with regards to the first point, that the meeting between Rawhū and Sufyān is still possible, however based on general norms it seems highly unlikely, norms like lifespans, travelling to different lands, possible meetings etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If someone says the Imāms have mentioned Rawhū narrates from Sufyān, then we say they have mentioned this based on the chains of narration or transmission of reports where Rawhū reports on Sufyān’s authority, it does not however make this a reality or fact.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>BENEFIT &#8211; Revisiting Imām Ibn Ḥibbān’s Authentication</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is highly pertinent to mention according to Imām Ibn Ḥibbān’s own statement in his <em>al-Thiqāt,</em> he himself renders this report to be weak due to Rawhū narrating from Sufyān, who was from Kūfa, so how can they present his authentication.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Matters of belief are not accepted if they are lone reports according to the principles of the detractors. The Ḥanafī madhab, the Ashʿarī’s and Maturidī’s.</strong></span></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no other option but to accept that this report is a single lone narration of Rawhū bin Ṣalāḥ based on the clarifications and elucidations of the scholars of Ḥadīth from the likes of Imām al-Ṭabarānī, Ḥāfiẓ Abū Nuʿaym and Ḥāfiẓ Nūr al-Dīn al-Haythamī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The principle of the detractors whether Ḥanafī, Ashʿarī or Matūridī is that lone reports ie Khabar al-Ahād are not aceepted in matters of creed and Imān because for them matters of belief must be based on certainty and therefore issues that are in relation to belief and disbelief cannot be established by Aḥād or single lone reports. One can refer to <em>Usūl Sarkhasī</em> (p.116), <em>Fawātih al-Rahmūt</em> (2:136) and other general book on Ḥanafi ʿUsūl.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The antagonists present this report as an evidence for Tawassul and since it is related to matters of belief and Imān, it is imperative that it must be mutawatir and not Khabr al-Aḥād in order for them to accept it.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Other Chains for this report</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad ʿAlawī al-Malikī and others have mentioned other reports which differ in the wording, whilst some of them do not even mention the the words the detractors attempt to prove their belief system from. All of these other narrations are either weak, with weak and unknown narrators or the chains are unconnected and are mursal. G.F. Haddād has also admitted some of these reports do not contain the contentious words.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answering the Fallacious Claim of Necrophilia</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ignorant people of other faiths, in their emotionally filled rants and outbursts against Islām allege the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) slept with the body of Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha based on the wording of this ḥadīth. Such horrible claims are often regurgitated by people who follow and believe in Christianity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an outright lie and a desperate attempt to discredit Islām, such claims are often raised by people who have not read anything about Islām and rather just take some information from websites, who extend most of their efforts to concoct fallacious allegations against Islām.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treacherous claim rests on the words  فاضطجع  They claim the word means to sleep, lay down ie he lay down with Fātimah bint Asad to have sex with her and this Arabic word is often used to denote to lie down and sleep with someone. We seek refuge in Allāh from such lies and aspersions. Āmīn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Firstly:</strong>  we have shown this ḥadīth is weak in the preceding discourse, but let’s assume for arguments sake that it was authentic, then;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> The word اضطجع means to lie, lie down, recline, repose and sleep according to the well known Arabic dictionaries. It does not mean to sleep or to lay down for sex. This is also the word the Christians use in their Arabic translation of the Bible. Hence, they say وَدَخَلَ أَلِيشَعُ الْبَيْتَ وَإِذَا بِالصَّبِيِّ مَيْتٌ وَمُضْطَجعٌ عَلَى سَرِيرِهِ. [<em>And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed</em>. (2Kings 4:32) Kings James Version).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So one asks, does the word laid here also mean, ‘lay to have sex?’ Of course it does not! Then why is this meaning specified and restricted to the ḥadīth only.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> the wording of the ḥadīth clearly mentions the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) entered the grave after it was dug and the body of Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha had not been lowered into the grave. The Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) lay in the grave after it was dug by his companions. The grave had a Laḥd, which is a horizontal opening in the vertically dug grave. The Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) also dug the grave and the Laḥd after which he lay in it. Thereafter, he stood up and eventually the body was lowered into the grave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should therefore be noted; the body was lowered into the grave after he stood up &#8211; the body was not even in the grave when he was lying down in it! What kind of necrophilia was this? We presume the claimants can further shed some light on this matter, for the claimants are likely to know the reality and details of necrophilia the best, perhaps from experience in the modern Christian atheistic world, because surely one only accuses others of things they have experience, practice and knowledge about.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask again? How is the alleged incident even possible when the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) did not even lie next to the body, unless the detractors have developed other forms of sex!!! Again, this would not be surprising because this is what happens when you abandon your scriptures by distorting the divine message they contained.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The wording of the report further shows the great care and love the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) had for Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha, the alleged wording says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>When camphor water was brought, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) poured some water into his hands. Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) took off his shirt and clothed her with it and used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This showed the love and care the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) had for her due to her status. The detractors show more affection and care for animals and dogs and regularly bathe them, how about Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha, who was his paternal aunt and looked after him just like his mother! At what expense is the human mind and intelligence being carelessly wasted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fourthly:</strong> another indication which shows the futility of this repulsive allegation is the fact that the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) used his shirt and wrapped it around her and then used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin, the words are,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>“Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) took off his shirt and clothed her with it and used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again, a sane, upright and normal human being asks, why would a person use their own shirt to wrap the corpse of his paternal aunt &#8211; a mother like figure, then use his own sheets as her coffin, then dig her grave with his own hands, then lie in her grave and supplicate to the creator to forgive and have mercy on her (allegedly as the ḥadīth is weak), then to have her lowered in the grave, then unfasten the coffin sheets and shirt and then indulge in necrophilia? Absolutely preposterous!   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like to exercise our common sense by using our brains and minds, given to us by our creator and ask, what were the other companions doing during this incident of necrophilia? Why do this in the grave and not on the ground if they were looking?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people have no idea about the stature, uprightness and credibility of the illustrious companions, that they would allow someone to do such a heinous act in front of them. The companions were powerful, they were Ūsāmah bin Zayd, Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī, ʿUmar bin al-Khaṭṭāb and the Abyssinian companion, May Allāh be pleased with all of them. Who does not know the lofty credentials of ʿUmar bin al-Khaṭṭāb, that even satan was forced to change paths when he would see him due to his, principles, morals, standards, character and firm belief. That the likes of these companions just stood there and watched this evil incident to unfold.       </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fifthly:</strong> the detractors should know in Islām purification and cleanliness play a pivotal role in the daily life of Muslims. For example, Muslims are instructed to hold their private parts with their left hand because they have been instructed to eat with their right. They are instructed to sit down while relieving themselves, they are instructed to protect themselves and their clothes from urine and faeces, they are instructed to clean themselves with water, they are instructed to wash their hands everytime they relieve themselves, they are instructed to conceal their private parts from others and much more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muslims were given these instructions by the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam), whose words in the Religion are taken as divine texts, ie from the Prophetic Ḥadīth. This said, the rules, regulations and etiquettes for sexual intercourse between legally married partners in Islām require a greater level of purification and cleanliness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being, on another occasion the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) asked his companions to help lower a body into a grave, and he asked them if any of them were in a state of sexual impurity, ie if they had spent the night with their lawful wives. One of the companion who was in a state of sexual impurity was asked not to help in lowering the body (Bukhārī).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This honours the deceased, ie the people who help lower the deceaseds body are in a state of ritual purity and clean. So when a person is in a state of sexual impurity and he is not allowed to partake in lowering the deceased, then how about the act of sexual intercourse with a corpse! Let alone the rules and regulations Muslims have when it comes to intimacy and intercourse.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We mentioned examples of how Muslims uphold purification and cleanliness while relieving themselves and at the same token the clever people who regurgitate these treacherous lies about the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallm), are the same people who do not even wash their hands when they go to the toilet, they have cascades of urine droplets on their clothes and toilet seats. They are the same people who would not bathe for weeks, just less than 100 years and when they would bathe, the whole family would use the water, whereas our glorious Prophetic Divine teachings go back 1400 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is absolutely absurd and a despicable aspersion to even suggest this notion of necrophilia, which is an outright treacherous lie.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have shown this ḥadīth is weak and to use it to prove and argue impermissible tawassul is incorrect, contrary to the authentic evidences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By the two weak slaves of Allāh,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ḥibbān Malak</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many Sufi writers, whether they belong to the Ashari and maturidi theological rhetoric school of thought or whether they belong to the two sub continent sects of Deoband or Barelwi, all utilise and use the incident and the story of the people of the cave to either justify their impermissible tawassul and wasilah or they incorrectly deduce from the ayah in Surah Kahf the permissibility of buildings structures over graves and in turn this leading to shirk and grave worship and also relic worship. They further interpret this ayah and use it is a their most convincing argument to establish the permissibility of building domes over graves, relics and religious holy sites and thus arguing existence of the Green dome as well other mausoleums and shrines. These such shrines and tombs are widespread in the muslims lands and are commonly known as darbars or dargahs in the sub continent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These Sufi&#8217;s argue based on ayah 21 from Surah al-Kahf (18)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png"><img class=" wp-image-7473 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?resize=548%2C210" alt="18_21" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?resize=300%2C115 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?resize=768%2C294 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?resize=1024%2C392 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?w=1350 1350w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18_21.png?w=1236 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;And thus We made their case known (to the people), that they might know that the Promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour. (Remember) when they (the people of the city) disputed among themselves about their case, they said: &#8220;Construct a building over them; their Lord knows best about them;&#8221; (then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): &#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong><strong>Surah al-Kahf (18):21</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sufi Barelwi churchfather and the student of the students of Ahmad Raza Khan, Mufti Ahmad Yar Khan Naeemi (d.1391H) said in his acclaimed book amongst his sufi followers says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Construction of some buildings near or in the vicinity of the grave of the common muslims is no doubt forbidden, but it is allowed (jaiz) in the case of islamic scholars and expert theologians&#8230;.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">he goes onto say</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is Jaiz (permissible) to construct a building near or around the shrines of illustrious &#8216;Mashaikh,&#8217; Aulia and Islamic scholars. Its justification is found in the ayah of the Holy Quran, the deeds of the Sahabah and the common Muslims and the sayings of the scholars. The holy Quran, while describing the event of Ashab-e-Kahaf (and then mentions the ayah above)&#8230;&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then goes onto bring the explanation of Ismail Haqqi (1127H) a Sufi of the Naqshabandi order from his <em>Tafsir Ruh al-Bayan</em>, the avid reader can refer to it or from the works of Naeemi. Ahmad Yar Khan Naeemi goes onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Holy Quran has mentioned two things of these people: (1) to hold mutual consultation about building a shrine and making a dome around the As-hab-e-Kahaf. (2) constructing a masjid near them, denying nothing which shows that these two actions were lawful in the past and are also lawful even today as is proved by the book of principles.&#8221;</em> (Ja&#8217;a al-Haq (p.328-329 Eng Tran. p.279-280 Urdu)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we can see the Sufi Barelwis and their compatriots have misconstrued this ayah to establish the permissibility of making structures, shrines, tombs and even mosques/masjids over graves when the reality is far from this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first thing to understand in this regard is, and numerous Imams of the Salaf have mentioned this, the people of the time denied the hereafter and that they would be raised again. Ikrimah mentions some people from amongst them claimed only the souls will be raised again without the bodies. (<em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> 3:747, <em>Tafsir al-Tabari</em> 15:270-271, <em>Tarikh Tabari</em> 2:46)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Qurtubi mentions something similar, that there was a righteous ruler at the time and some people differed concerning the raising of the soul and body. Some people became doubtful and denied the raising of the body and claimed only the souls will be raised while the earth will consume the bodies. Others argued and said both the body and soul will be raised. This became a difficult matter for the King to answer, who later spent time pondering the answer until the incident of the people of the cave. (<em>Tafsir Qurtubi</em> 10:380, see also <em>Mukhtasar Tafsir al-Qurtubi</em> 2:313)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Meaning of Masjid in the Ayah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr clarifies the meaning of masjid in the ayah and brings the statement of the illustrious companion and explainer of the Quran, Abdullah ibn Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The people said honour your brothers, so the people after thinking and pondering  said we will make a masjid over them. Then they began praying over them, seeking forgiveness for them and supplicating for them.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tagliq al-ta&#8217;liq</em> 4:264)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So here, praying over them refers to praying their funeral prayer which is further evidenced by the fact that they supplicated for them and asked Allah for forgive them. There is no mention of erecting ornate structures, shrines, tombs, mausoleums, darbars etc and certainly making a masjid over their grave so that people continue to pray over them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the explanations of this ayah by the various explainers of the Quran who use the word masjid in this context is solely and mainly praying the funeral prayer of the people of the cave, seeking forgiveness and supplicating for them. The Sufis cite the words of Fakhar al-Din al-Razi who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Some people said that the door of the cave should be closed so that nobody can enter it and the affair of the People of the cave are hidden. Some said that It is better to build a masjid at the door, this saying proves that these people were righteous people of Allah who wanted to worship him and offer their prayers.&#8221; </em>(Tafsir al-Kabir 5:75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fakhr al-Din al-Razi also said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><b>&#8220;</b>And when Allah said <b>&#8220;</b>Those who prevailed over their affair<b>&#8220;</b> this refers to the leader of the Muslims or the friends of Ashab al-Kahf or the leaders of town. <b>&#8220;</b>We will surely build a masjid over them<b>&#8220;</b> so that we can worship Allah in it and preserve the affairs or affect of the people of the cave with the masjid.&#8221;</em> (Tafsir al-Kabir 5:475]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again this refers to the funeral prayer and also to make a masjid to preserve their &#8216;Athar&#8217; which can be understood as their affair or their affect meaning their worship of Allah and singling him out as one and his Tawhid. This is the message of the people of the cave, the Tawhid of Allah The Mighty and Majestic. This is what the leaders and the people wanted to preserve and even if this is understood as a masjid, they wanted to preserve their effect i.e. the worship of Allah. It is not how the sufi barelwis project in the building of structures riddled with shirk and bidah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti and al-Mahalli said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>&#8220;</strong>They were disputing<b>&#8220;</b> That is, the believers and the disbelievers, <b>&#8220;</b>among themselves their affair<b>&#8220;</b> i.e. the affair of the youths, with regard to building something around them; <b>&#8220;</b>so they<b>&#8220;</b>, the disbelievers, said, <b>&#8220;</b>Build over them<b>&#8220;</b> that is, around them, <b>&#8220;</b>a building&#8221; to cover them up; &#8220;their Lord knows them best.’ Those who prevailed regarding their affair&#8221; i.e. the affair of the youths, “i.e. the believers &#8221; &#8220;We will verily set up over them) around them &#8220;a Masjid&#8221; for prayers to be performed therein. And this indeed took place at the entrance of the cave.&#8221;</em> (Tafsir al Jalalyn 2:4)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti further said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Imam Ibn Abi Hatim narrates from Suddi, the kind go the country called the religious leaders of his nation and consulted them concerning the affair of the people of the cave. The King was known as Decius and the youth of the cave had gone missing during his era and he had written their names on a tablet on the city gates. (When the youth returned to buy something) they read the names and it was the same people. The king was happy as these people who he though had died were in actual fact alive and then it became well known among the people that Allah had raised the dead from the living. The King said he would make a place of worship near their graves and I will continue worshipping Allah in it until I die. Abdur Razzaq and Ibn Abi Hatim transmit that Qatdaah said, &#8220;<strong>those who won their point said..&#8221; </strong>this refers to their rulers and leaders. Ibn Abi Hatim transmits from Sa&#8217;id ibn Jubayr who said the King made a church over the graves and wrote Ibna al-Arakanah, Ibna al-Dahqin.&#8221;</em>  (<em>Tafsir Dar al-Manthur</em> 4:569-570)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows they never built anything on the cave or over the graves but rather a masjid at the entrance, therefore, using this as an evidence to make mosques over graves is incorrect and a wrong understanding.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Tabari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Mushrikeen said: We will build a building over it and worship Allah in it but the Muslims said: We have more right over them and we will surely build a mosque so that we can pray there and worship Allah.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tafsir at-Tabari</em> 15:149)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Qurtubi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The view of the majority is the height from which a grave it is to be lowered which is higher than a handspan. The height to keep is for it to be recognised and for it to be respected (as in not walked over as flat earth). This is the situation with the grave of our Prophet Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and both of his companions.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tafsir Qurtubi</em> 10:380)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also says something very similar and along the same lines in his book al-Tazkirrah (p.86)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Qurtubi further explains it was the reign of Decius in which the youth went missing, he had the names written down and in the later generations when they returned to buy something from the city, the ruler at the time was righteous and pious etc. Imam Qurtubi further mentions the ruler said we will build a structure to remember them by. The people on the religion of the youth said make a masjid and the unbelievers said we will makee our place of worship or a resting place over them. The Muslims objected and said we will make a masjid. When some of the people went to the cave they noticed the cave had closed and the people had vanished. According to a report of Abdullah ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) Allah concealed their affair from the people, hence the ruler suggested making a a structure to remember them by. (<em>Tafsir Qurtubi</em> 10:380, al-<em>Maharrar al-wajiz</em> 3:507)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then Imam Qurtubi goes on to cite many narrations in the prohibition of making masjids and places of worship over graves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Kathir and Imam Tabari mentions when one of them returned to the city to buy some food, things had change and so had his money. Once they find out things were not adding up they presented him to the ruler, the roman ruler, Decius. Then Decius and the people followed the person to the cave and he entered the cave himself first. (<em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> 3:747, <em>Tafsir al-Tabari</em> 15:271).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Kathir goes on to say it is not know how he entered the cave or what happened thereafter. Another view was, the ruler was Theodosius, who was a believer, who also entered the cave and embraced the people. They later left and the people of the cave went back to sleep and eventually died. (<em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> 3:747-748, <em>Tafsir al-Tabari</em> 15:277 and <em>Tarikh Tabari</em> 2:46)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Kathir further mentions the people were leaders and people of influence or suggested the idea of building a structure over or near their graves however the questions is, were they such and worthy to be followed. Therefore it is very questionable for them to be followed in this because the Messenger of Allah ﷺ cursed the jews and christians for making places of worship on the graves of their prophets. (<em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> 3:747-748)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are other similar sayings the other explainers of the Quran have mentioned, Nasafi in <em>Tartib al-Madarik</em> (3:18), Abu Hayyan in <em>Bahr al-Muhit</em> (7:158), Imam Ibn al-Jawzi cites the view Imam Ibn Qutaybah <em>Za&#8217;d ul-Masir</em> (5:124) as well his own view as Shaykh al-Albani brings (5:123) as we proceed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Clarification of Shaykh Muhammad Shinqiti</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He refutes those who use this ayah as evidence for making places of worship on graves and those who do not have knowledge say this is something encouraged from the Quran and Sunnah, whoever holds this view is from the most ignorant of creation. So are we to follow this group who say lets make a masjid over them? or were they disbelievers, who it is impermissible to follow? There is a difference if they were people of Fatrah or a group of disbelievers. If it is said they were disbelievers, then there is no problem because this is not evidence for us (<em>Tafsir Qurtubi</em> 10:379), He says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;If they claim they were Muslims, then we answer and say it is not hidden from the most deficient in intelligence that they were Muslims from a previous nation and that it this does not oppose the authentic clear text transmitted from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ except those whose intelligence is confused. This is because the Messenger of Allah ﷺ before he passed away cursed those who build places of worship over the graves. Therefore, it is clear whoever follows the ways of those who advocate building places of worship over graves have been cursed from the tongue of the most trustworthy and honest, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.&#8221;</em> (<em>Adwa al-Bayan</em> 3:159)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Statement of Imam Abdul Aziz Ibn Baz</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn Baz said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The answer to that is: that Allah has told us about the leaders and powerful people of that time, and that they said these words. That does not imply that He liked that or approved of them, rather He said that by way of blaming them and condemning their action. This is indicated by the fact that the Messenger sallalahu alayhi wasallam to whom this verse was revealed and who was the most knowledgeable of people as to how it should be interpreted, forbade his ummah to build mosques over graves, warned them against doing so, and cursed and condemned those who did that.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">If that had been permissible, then the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alayhi wasallam would not have discouraged it in such emphatic terms, and gone to the extent of cursing those who did it, and said that they are the most evil of mankind before Allah. This is sufficient to convince the seeker of truth. Even if we were to assume that building places of worship over graves was permitted to those who came before us, it is not permissible for us to follow their example in that, because our sharee’ah abrogates the laws that came before it, and our Messenger sallalahu alayhi wasallam is the Final Messenger whose Shari&#8217;ah is complete and universal. He has forbidden us to build mosques over graves, so it is not permissible for us to go against him. We must follow him, adhering to that which he brought and abstaining from anything from the ancient laws that goes against that or any custom that appeals to the one who does it but goes against that. For there is nothing more perfect than the laws of Allah and there is no guidance better than the guidance of the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alayhi wasallam</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Allah is the One Whom we ask to help us and all the Muslims to adhere firmly to His religion and to follow the shari’ah of His Messenger Muhammad sallalahu alayhi wasallam in all that we say and do, both outwardly and inwardly, in all our affairs, until we meet Allah, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Near. May Allah send blessings and peace upon His slave and Messenger Muhammad and his family and companions, and those who follow his guidance, until the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</em> (<i>Majmu Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawi’ah li Samahat al-Shaykh Ibn Baz </i>1:434)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani&#8217;s Answer</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani cites the doubt of the Sufi&#8217;s who say in regard to this ayah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This ayah evidences the permissibility of making masajid over graves and the point of deduction is that the people who said this were the followers of Isa Alayhis Salam i.e. christians as it has been mentioned in the books of Tafasir. Therefore, we find it was permissible to make a mosque over graves in their shari&#8217;ah as Allah mentions this without reprimanding it. Thus the principle is, if Allah mention a ruling of the previous nations without rejecting it then it is also shariah for us which means that it is permissible for us to do the same as mentioned in this ayah.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tahzir al-Sajid</em> p.48)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani answers this and says there are three answers to this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>First Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is established in the knowledge regarding the principles i.e. Ilm al-Usul that previous shariahs i.e. legislation before the advent of Islam is not shariah for us, there are numerous evidences for this which. As an example Imam Ibn Hazm brings approximately 50 or so evidences to prove the previous shariahs were not incumbent upon us. (<em>al-Ihkam Fi Usul al-Ahkam </em>5:16)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani adds a note and says these can referred to in larger volumes on Ilm al-Usul and specifically<em> al-Ihkam Fi Usul al-Ahkam</em> of Ibn Hazm and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani continues and says one such evidence for this is the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) that he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I have been given five things that no Prophet before was given, a Prophet was sent to his respective nation whereas i have been sent to the whole of mankind.&#8221; </em>(Bukhari Muslim and I have referenced it in al-Irwa ul-Ghalil no.285)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even if the aforementioned ayah alludes to making masjid over graves, it was in the previous shariahs which have been since abrogated and neither does it command us to act on this ayah and therefore it is not permissible for us to make mosques over graves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Second Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even if we were to accept their statement that the previous shariahs were incumbent upon us, then this still has another binding condition intertwined with it which is that there can be nothing that contradicts or opposes it from our shariah. This however this is not the case because this condition is missing because mutawatir (overwhelming number of) ahadith prohibit making masjids over graves. This is a clear evidence to indicate the previous shariah is not incumbent or binding upon us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Third Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not hold the aforementioned ayah alludes to the permissibility of making mosques over graves in the previous shariahs i.e. in the legislation of Isa Alayhis Salam because it only shows some people expressed an idea or thought to build a masjid on the people of the cave &#8211; Ashab al-Kahf. There is no clarification whether they were believers. Even if we accept they were believers there is no clarification if they were righteous and obedient to the shariah of Isa Alayhis Salam but rather some evidences show they were not following the shariah (of Isa Alayis Sallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The View of Hafiz Ibn Rajab (795H)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence Hafiz Ibn Rajab (795H) wrote in the explanation of the hadith, <em>&#8220;May the curse of Allah be upon the jews and christians who built places of worship over the graves of their Prophet.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This hadith which prohibits making places of worship over the graves of Prophets is also evidenced in the Quran where Allah says about the people of the Cave  &#8211; Ashab al-Kahf, <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong>This ayah shows making places of worship on graves were the actions of the people of power and leadership which shows this had no basis or ruling in their shariah but rather they just wanted to do this based on their wishes as being the leaders and people of power. This was not the action of the people of knowledge and virtue who were obedient and following the guidance revealed to their Prophets who were also the companions and helpers.&#8221;</em> (Fath al-Bari 65:280 from al-Kawakib al-Darari &#8211; manuscript from in Maktabah al-Zahiriyyah. TN. See also Fath al-Bari 2:397 of Ibn Rajab)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The View of Shaykh Ali bin Urwah and Hafiz Ibn Kathir</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ali bin Urwah concurs and supports Hafiz Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir, he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ibn Jarir has cited two statements on explanation of this ayah, the first being that, we will build a place of worship, they were believers and the second statement was that they were polytheists &#8211; mushriks, Allahs knows best. What is apparent is that they were people of power and influence but what they said was not the truth because the statement of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) is that he cursed the jews and christians for making places of worship on the graves of their Prophets. His intent was to warn his Ummah from this evil action. There is also a report Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) during his reign they found the grave of Prophet Danyal in Iraq with his scrolls. He quickly buried him with his book, concealing it from the people.&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar al-Kawakib 10:208:2, Tafsir Ibn Kathir 3:78)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani adds a notes to the statement of Imam Ibn Jarir that Imam Ibn al-Jawzi mentioned exactly the same in his Za&#8217;d al-Masir 5:123, Maktab al-Islami)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani continues and said, we find from these details, using this ayah to make places of worship over graves is totally incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The View of Allamah al-Muhaqqiq Alusi (1270H)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This ayah has been used to prove the permissibility of building shrines over the graves of the pious people. From the people who have put forward this deduction are Shihab Khafaji which he mentions in his notes to al-Baydawi, However this deduction is totally and absolutely incorrect, false and corrupt.&#8221;</em> (Ruh al-Ma&#8217;ani 5:31)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albnai says, then Allamah Alusi cites some ahadith in prohibition of this issue and supports it by citing a statement of Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Haithami, which I have presented on (p.22 -Tahzir al-Sajid)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Statement Shaykh al-Albani is referring to on (p.22) is where Hafiz al-Haithami said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Building places of worship/masjids over graves means to pray next or on top of them.&#8221;</em> (al-Zawajir 1:121)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani continues and says, &#8220;then, Allamah Alusi in his book, <em>&#8216;Sharh al-Minhaj&#8217;</em> also cites another statement of Hafiz Ibn Hajr Haithami, where he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;A group of scholars have issued an edict to demolish all the structures built over graves in Qarafah in Egypt, even the mausoleum of Imam Shafi&#8217;i which was build by a revering ruler. Every Muslim should, if no problems arise, demolish and ground every structure (built over graves) and if troubles and problems are likely to arise it becomes the responsibility of the leader and ruler. These points have been taken from Ibn al-Raf&#8221;ih&#8217;s book &#8216;Kitab al-Sulah'&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;then Allamah Alas goes onto say it can be argued (i.e. they argue) making places of worship over graves was permissible in the previous shariahs based on the ayah of Surah al-Kahf and presenting evidences from previous shariahs is something the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) would do. For example he said whoever sleeps or forgets to pray he should pray immediately when he remembers or wakes up (This hadith is authentic and referenced in the Sahihayn and it is not correct to say it has been narrated as it indicates weakness in the terminology of the scholars as i have clarified in Salah al-Tarawih (p.63-64), also i have referenced this hadith in Sahih Abi Dawud no.461, al-Irwa no.263), and he presented the ayah, &#8220;and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat) for My Remembrance.&#8221; (Surah Taha 20:14). whereas this command was given to Musa Alayhis Salam which was mentioned in the Quran as an incident. Likewise and similarly Imam Abu Yusuf when there is a need for Qisas between husband and wife, Imam Karkhi when there needs to be Qisas between a servant and master, Dhimmi and Muslim have used as evidence the ayah, <strong>&#8220;And We ordained therein for them: &#8220;Life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wounds equal for equal.&#8221; But if anyone remits the retaliation by way of charity, it shall be for him an expiation&#8230;&#8221; (Surah al-Ma&#8217;idah5:45)</strong> therefore we can also use the ayah from Surah al-Kahf as evidence.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">The answer to this doubt is that the previous shariahs have some bearing on us but this now absolute, complete and with restriction but rather it is restricted with conditions that Allah mentions a ruling or command without rejecting and remember rejecting what the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) says is also rejecting Allah. We have already read Allahs Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) has cursed those who make places of worship on graves. It must also be succinctly noted, if making places of worship over graves was something permissible and acceptable in the Shariahs before the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) would not have cursed them for doing this. furthermore, this ayah (18:21) is not like the other ayahs which have been mentioned from which the Imams made deductions or used as evidence compared to the other ayahs. This ayah merely mentions the idea of a group of them wanting to build a place of worship over their graves and it just shows their honour not that they should be followed. Therefore until it is not established that anyone from amongst them was infallible nothing can be considered to be part of our shariah. Another reason that this is overlooked is that they were leaders and people of power who were less obedient to their religion and more fervent in their leadership.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">We find that the first group were believers who were aware of the prohibition of making places of worship over graves and hence decided to make a closed entrance to the grave without any connection tot he people of the cave. The other group who were leaders, people of power and influence did not accept their view and decided to build a place of worship of their graves.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">If if someone wants to hold this later and second view of <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221;</strong> it did not mean the prohibited type of place of worship on their graves which is cursed but rather wanted to make a place of worship ear or next to the graves. Hence according to the narrations of Suddi and Wahb, they clearly state this type of building a place of worship which is not prohibited. At the very most it can be understood as Masjid al-Kahf just as Masjid al-Nabawi. (TN. This is incorrect as Masjid al-Nabwi is titled that because the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) built it not because it was next to the grave.)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">It can also be argued and presented the people wanted to make a place of worship on the mount where the cave was situated. There is a report in this regard from Mujahid, the ruler at the time left the people of the cave in there places and wanted to build a place of worship on the mountain in remembrance of them. This is what seems the closest to the apparent meaning of the ayah.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, this is only applicable if the assumption is made that the people of the cave woke up and died later and if they went to sleep again after waking up, i.e. they were still alive (as the ayat indicate) and did not die, then this whole discussion and using this ayah for this interpretation is null, void and has no bearing whatsoever.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani adds a note and says that Allamah Alusi further cited the statement of Hasan al-Basri who said a place of worship was built on the cave, ready for them when they would wake up. Alusi then said the basis of this statement, the people of the cave did not die when they returned to the cave but rather slept like they had done before. Some said they would remain asleep until the Mahdi comes, when they will wake up and help him. However all of these statements are without authenticity and are somewhat spurious. (Ruh al-Ma&#8217;ani 5:31)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Alusi contines and says whoever has any guidance and truth will not have the audacity to hold onto the generality of this ayah and a view opposing and contradicting the clear authentic ahadith and reports. Whoever uses this ayah to prove building places of worship over graves is extreme ignorance and misguidance and yet despite this scholars for names sake render the actions of these ignorant people to be permissible, from what they do to the graves of the pious people. This includes raising the heights of graves, making them rectangular and solid, hanging ornaments from them, praying towards the graves, kissing them, having festivals there etc and they all of this under this ayah of Surah al-Kahf and the incident of the people of the cave as well as other narrations. One such report being the ruler persevered the people of the cave with specific woodland would organise annuals birthday celebrations, however all of these issues are innovations and new things and have not an iota of importance in the opposition to what Allah and his Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) are as such in formulating a new religion which Allah gave them no permission.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In order to know and to seek the truth look at the actions and dealings of the companions with the best grave on the planet, the grave of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam)? What was their practise in visiting his grave and offering salutations? Then compare their actions and practises with these grave worshippers and how much of a stark and dire difference there really is? What did the comparisons do and what are these grave worshippers doing.&#8221; (Ruh al-Ma&#8217;ani 15:31-32) End of the words of Allamah Alusi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answering and Refuting the Reckless Speech of a Contemporary &#8211; &#8216;Abu </strong><b>Faiz Ahmad al-Siddiq al-Ghumari&#8217;</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: A contemporary whilst discussing this ayah of Surah al-Kahf instead of debating permissibility has gone to the extreme extent and claimed it is recommended. The points of deduction are somewhat new and different to those previously mentioned and details answers to them have preceded. This individual says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This ayah proves the permissibility of making masjid over graves because Allah mentioned their statement, <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them&#8221;</strong> without shunning, correcting or refuting it&#8230;&#8221;</em> (TN &#8211;<em>Ihya al-maqbur min adillati jawaz bina al-masajid ala qubur</em> p.21+, <em>I&#8217;lam al-rak&#8217;e al-Sajid Bi-Ittihazu al-Qubur Masajid</em> p,70)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All three Ghumaris, Ahmad, Abdullah and Abdul Aziz have authored books against Shaykh al-Albani but two of them in particular on this issue, the first by Ahmad Ghumar, &#8216;Ihya al-Maqbur Min Adillati Jawaz Bina al-Masajid Ala Qubur&#8217; and Abdullah Ghumari, <em>&#8216;I&#8217;lam al-rak&#8217;e al-sajid bi-ittihazu al-qubur masajid.&#8217;</em> The arguments in both books are similar without anything new and anything that was new Shaykh al-Albnai answered.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mu&#8217;allami mentions something similar in his book that they claim it is recommended, whereas others believe it is in fact obligatory to makes places of worship over graves. He calls them ignorant extremists. (al-Bana&#8217;u alal qubur p.55+)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Albani goes onto say, this analysis has two answers</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the refuting, correction or shunning is not mentioned, and holding this to be the correct view is within of itself incorrect except if it is proven the people who said <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong>are muslims and people who were also obedient and followed the respective shariah of their Prophet. However there is no such indication int he ayah and what seems closer to the truth and reality is they may not have even been Muslims  or at the very least were not practising or righteous muslims but rather were evil disbelievers, this has preceded from the statements of Ibn Rajab Hanbali and Ibn Kathir. In such circumstances mentioning their statements without refuting or shunning it is actual essence reprimanding it and this is because attributing a statement or action of the disbelievers of evil sinners and then mentioning it is sufficient as a censure and refutation of it by in of itself. Therefore, using the silence or the lack of reprimand as evidence from the aforementioned ayah under discussion  is incorrect and this is further supported by the second answer</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This deduction and the extraction of this point can be considered to be correct by the people before and the current day people by those who follow their whims and desires based on their ways and principles, who only consider the Quran to be the Din without have any respect, reverence and giving any importance whatsoever to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). However the belief and principles of Ahl al-Sunnah wal Jama&#8217;ah are that both the Quran and Sunnah is to have Iman and conviction in both of them. They believe in the following authentic well known hadith where the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Be attentive that I have been given the Quran and something similar to it. in another report it mentions he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, &#8220;Whatever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) makes unlawful then it just like Allah made it haram or unlawful.&#8221;</em> (Mishkat, Kitab al-Iman, Bab al-Ei&#8217;tisam no.163)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How can the contemporary say Allah never reprimanded or refuted the statement of these people when they said, <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong>whereas it has been refuted and rejected in mutawatir hadith. Allah cursed these people via the speech of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and therefore what can more clear and manifest in terms of a refutation than this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Using the ayah of Surah al-Kahf to establish the permissibility to build places of worship over graves of the Prophets in opposition and in contradiction to the mutawatir hadith is just like proving the permissibility of taking pictures and idol worship from the following statement of Allah with regard to the Jinns obeying the commands of Suleiman Alayhis Salam,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;They worked for him as he desired, (making) high rooms, images, basins as large as reservoirs, and (cooking) cauldrons fixed (in their places). &#8220;Work you, O family of Dawud (David), with thanks!&#8221; But few of My slaves are grateful.&#8221; (Surah al-Saba 34:13)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is done by overlooking all of the ahadith which prohibit making pictures and the prohibition of idol worship, however any muslim who have Iman in the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) will not have the audacity to do this. This concludes the answer to the deduction these people use from the ayah of  <strong>&#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; </strong>End of the words of Shaykh al-Albani from <em>Tahzir al-Sajid Min Ittihazu al-Qubur Masajid</em> p.48-58)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Former Mufti of Egypt</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The former mufti of Egypt, Ali Gomaa/Jumua also used this ayah to prove the permissibility of building places of worship over graves, he generally uses the same arguments when it comes to this ayah and its incorrect interpretation. He has been answered in a book over 300 pages titled, &#8216;<em>Isti&#8217;dhah bi al-Ghafur min bid&#8217;ah bina al-masajid wa-qibab ala al-qubur, wa-ma‘ahu ta‘aqqubat ala mughalatat fatwa al-duktur AlI Jum‘ah fī bina al-masajid ala al-qubur.&#8217; </em>by Abu Anas ibn Abdul Maqsud.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdur Rahman Mu&#8217;allami al-Yamani (1386H) has given a very detailed answer to the deductions and points drawn by these people from this ayah, He discusses it great length and in intricate detail which will be too lengthy to reproduce here, so let the avid reader refer to it. (Al-Bana&#8217;u al-alal qubur p.7+)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Making masjids over graves is not from the Din of the Muslims, rather it is prohibited it from established texts from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and according to the agreement of the Imams of the Din. In fact it is impermissible to make masjid over graves, whatever is practised in those masjids even with the intent of praying near them, and all of the Imams of the Din are unanimous in prohibiting this.&#8221;</em> (Majmu&#8217;a al-Fatawa 27:477)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Imams are agreed in not building masjid on graves.&#8221;</em> (Majmu&#8217;a Fatawa 22:145)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said another time,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Scholars have said it is impermissible to build masjid/places of worship over graves.&#8221;</em> (Majmu&#8217;a Fatawa 27:77)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s Ahmad Yar Khans points and deductions then they are irrelevant and poor without any substance to the because we have shown the meaning he extracts from the ayah are a dire exaggeration of his imagination because none of the points mention the making of shrines or tombs on graves and doing and saying it is permissible or recommended by the likes of Ahmad Yar Khan and Ahmad Siddiq Ghumari is a clear distortion of the ayat of the Quran.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point of Ahmad Siddiq Ghumari and Ahmad Yar Khan Naeemi are further refuted by the authentic hadith of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) which Ai&#8217;shah (RadhiAllahu Anha) narrates,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Um Salama told Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) about a church which she had seen in Ethiopia and which was called Mariya. She told him about the pictures which she had seen in it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) said, &#8220;If any righteous pious man dies amongst them, they would build a place of worship at his grave and make these pictures in it; they are the worst creatures in the sight of Allah.&#8221;</em> (Bukhari no.434, Muslim no.528)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">See also Bukhari no.1330, Muslim 529 for a hadith with a very similar meaning</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;These Masajid which have been built on the graves of the Prophets, the righteous, rulers and others, then it is a must to demolish them or by any other means, this is such an affair that I do not know of any difference of opinion between the well known scholars.&#8221;</em> (Iqtida Sirat al-Mustaqim 1:330)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To emphasise on the point of Shaykh al-Albani and his answer to Ahmad Siddiq Ghumari that whatever Allahs Messenger ﷺ declared to be unlawful is divine legislation i.e. shariah and thus we have a very explicit hadith from Jundub (RadhiAllahu Anhu), the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said 5 days before his death,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Beware, the people before you would places of worship on the graves of their Prophets and righteous people, beware attentively DO NOT make graves as places of worship for verily I forbid you from that.&#8221;</em> (Muslim no.532)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith is as explicit as it will get and if this does not suffice the individual of sound intellection and mindset, then we do not know what will. The readers can also refer to short but succinct treatise of Imam Shawkani, Sharh al-sudur fi thrill rafa al-qubur, where he discusses the issues in generally and brings numerous hadith to show the unlawfulness of building masjid or places of worship over graves. The later is also referenced and checked by Shaikh abdul Muhsin al-Abbad, wherein he also brings some points of benefit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find from the statements of the scholars, making graves as places or worship or masjid over graves is impermissible in our shariah due to the clear authentic texts. Furthermore, that we cannot use the ayah from Surah Kahf to justify its permissibility due to the answers which have preceded. In this article we have not cited the overwhelming number of hadith which clearly mention this prohibition because inshAllah they will be perhaps presented at a different time</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">by the two weak slaves of Allah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="storytitle">Narration of Malik al Dar, evidence for Tawassul by the living &amp; not by the Prophet after his death</h3>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><em>Bismillah, wal-hamdulillah was-salatu was-salamu ‘ala Rasulillah.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The incident mentioned in the narration of Malik al Dar happened during the Khilafah of Umar radiyallahu anhu, during the time of drought, and so did the incident of Umar bin al Khattab’s (radiyallahu anhu) tawassul through the Prophet’s (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) uncle, Al Abbas radiyallahu anhu.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">I have come across many discussions in regards to this narration, and all of them were concentrating on the “authenticity” of the narration, discussing its chain.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">But I have not come across any discussions on the text of the hadith itself, the story,<br />
except for some quotes here and there from some current shaikhs, sited in ahl alhadith forum, and those 2 or 3 points mentioned by those shaikhs led me to research the story of the hadith in classical books of past scholars, and I have found it very interesting and informative.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The things I discovered and read show a totally different understanding of the hadith, than what is understood by many Muslims today including some scholars, it only needs for one to go deep and see where the scholars of the past quoted the narration, in which chapter and what they said before quoting it to understand the real meaning of the hadith.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">I will go straight to the points that I have regarding the text and story of this narration of Malik al Dar. After that I will mention some logical arguments in reply to the ones who use this narration as evidence for tawasul that is “<strong>asking the Prophet</strong> <strong>(sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) to make duaa to Allah for us AFTER HIS DEATH</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>The text of the narration:</strong><strong><br />
</strong><br />
It is related from Malik al-Dar, `Umar’s treasurer, <em>that the people suffered a drought during the time of `Umar (his khilafah), whereupon a man came to the grave of the Prophet and said: “O Messenger of Allah, ask for rain for your Community, for verily they have but perished,” after which the Prophet appeared to him in a dream and told him: “Go to `Umar and give him my greeting, then tell him that they will be watered. Tell him: You must be clever, you must be clever!” The man went and told `Umar. The latter said: “O my Lord, I spare no effort except in what escapes my power!””</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Scholars’ understanding of this narration</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Hafidh <strong>Ibn Hajar al Asqalani</strong> –<em>rahimahu Allah</em>– in his books “<em>Fath al Bari</em>” (vol 3 pg. 441):</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">He sites it in chapter “<em>The people asking the Imam to do istisqa’ in times of drought</em>,” in the chapter heading section, in which he quotes ahadith that have relevance to the chapter heading, and that connect it with hadiths that come under that chapter.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Amongst those narrations he mentions the narration of Malik al Dar, and he only quotes part of the narration, he stops at “go to Umar”. He used this as evidence that people ask the imam to do istisqa (<em>ask for rain</em>) for them in times of drought.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">He didn’t mention the rest of the hadith because it has nothing to do with the chapter heading, he only quoted what he believed fits the chapters title, for he says at the end of the section, after mentioning this narration:</p>
<p>“<em>From all of this appears the relevance of the chapter heading to the origin of this story</em>“<br />
so, al Hafidh Ibn Hajar <em>rahimahu Allah</em> understood from this hadith that the Prophet <em>sallallahu alayhi wa sallam</em> was directing the man to go ask the Imam, during that time (Umar <em>radiyallahu anhu</em>), to do istisqa’ for them.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Hafidh <strong>Ibn Kathir</strong> –<em>rahimahu Allah</em>-:<br />
He sites it in his book “<em>al Bidayah wan Nihaya </em>” (vol7 pg.104 <em>), </em>in which he mentions some narrations, right before he mentions Malik ad Dar’s narration, which explain the meaning of the narration.<br />
The narrations before it are by Sayf Ibn Umar, and in them is the mentioning of Umar radiyallahu anhu, after hearing about the man’s dream (who is said to be Bilal al Harith), asking the people on the minbar if they have seen anything bad from him, and then he tells them about the dream that Bilal saw, so they told him:</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">“Bilal has spoken the truth, <strong>so make istiqatha (seek or ask for help) to Allah</strong>, then the Muslims”. So then Umar radiyallahu anhu does istisqa’ through al Abbas radiyallahu anhu.<br />
In the second narration, they said “he found you slow in doing istisqa’, so <strong>do istisqa’ for us</strong> “, so he did.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">(Note: these 2 narrations could be weak, but the point is that al Hafidh Ibn Kathir rahimahu Allah mentioned them right before the narration of Malik, showing what it is about, which shows what he understood it to mean, same as what Ibn Hajar (r A) understood from it).</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Ala’ ad Deen Ali al Mutaqi al Hindi al Burhan Furi</strong> (d. 975) in his book <em>“Kanz al Ummal“:<strong><br />
</strong></em>He sites it in chapter of (<strong>salat al Istisqa’ – prayer for rain</strong>),</p>
<div>
<p>and what the man did at the grave of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was asking for dua, not istisqa’ prayer, and salat al Istisqa’ was done by Umar radiyallahu anhu, when he made tawassul through Al Abbas radiyallahu anhu, thus both narrations are connected to each other, as shown in the previous points.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> That the story of Malik al Dar’s narration is connected to the hadith about Umar’s tawassul through al Abbas, all leading to doing istisqa’ through the living, and not through the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam after his death.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Narrations with an addition.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">There are narrations of the same story, with an addition, if they are authentic (the authenticiy is not known to me so far), they would give very strong support to the understanding of the above scholars.<br />
and it also shows what the scholars who sited the narrations believed the narration to mean.<em><br />
<strong><br />
</strong></em>Imam Ibn Abd al Bar al Maliki in his book “al Isti’ab fi ma’rifat al As-hab”:<em><strong><br />
</strong><br />
</em>The people suffered a drought during the time of ‘Umar (his khilafah), whereupon a man came to the grave of the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) and said:”O Messenger of Allah, ask for rain for your Community, for verily they have but perished,” after which the Prophet appeared to him in a dream and told him: “Go to ‘Umar <strong>and tell him to do istisqa’ (ask Allah for rain) for the people,</strong> and that they will be watered. And tell him: You must be clever, you must be clever!” So, the man went and told ‘Umar, and Umar cried and said “O my Lord, I spare no effort except in what escapes my power!” <em><br />
</em><br />
Ahmad Abdullah at Tabari (d. 694 ) in his book “ar Riyadh an Nadhirah fi Manaqib al Ashara”:Anas bin Malik narrated:<br />
The people suffered drought during Umar’s time, whereupon a man came to teh grave of the Prophet (Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam), and said: “O Messenger of Allah, ask for rain for your community, for verily they have but perished,”, he said so the Messenger of Allah came to him in a dream and told him “Go to ‘Umar <strong>then tell him to do istisqa’ (ask Allah for rain) for the people,</strong> and that they will be watered. And tell him: You must be clever, you must be clever!” So, the man went and told ‘Umar, and Umar cried and said “O my Lord, I spare no effort except in what escapes my power!”. narrated by al Baghawi in al fada’il and Abu Umar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Logical Arguments</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The ones who use this hadith for this type of tawassul say that Umar radiyallahu anhu did not rebuke the man who did istisqa’ at the grave.<br />
<strong>Reply</strong>: There is no clear evidence in the hadith indicating that the man told Umar of him going to the grave, but clearly he did tell him of the dream, telling him the message of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.<br />
so to say that he told him about his istisqa’ at the grave is an assumption, and we can’t use assumptions as evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>It didn’t rain until after Umar radiyallahu anhu made istisqa’ by al Abbas radiyallahu anhum</strong>.<br />
If the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was capable or had permission to do du’aa to Allah after his death, when asked by others, then it would have rained immediately after the man asked the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam at his grave, but it didn’t until after Umar’s istisqa’ through the duaa of Al Abbas radiyallahu anhu.<br />
This shows that the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was guiding the man to ask the Umar to do istisqa’ and not him, hinting to Umar by saying to him “<strong>be clever!</strong>“, and when Umar did istisqa’ by al Abbas (radiyallahu anhuma) it immediately rained..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If going to the grave of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to ask him to make duaa to Allah was permissable, Umar radiyallahu anhu would have done that when wanting to do istisqa’ instead of doing it through the uncle of the Messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, who was alive, and Umar’s (r.a) saying “<strong>we used to</strong> make tawassul through your Prophet’s duaa, and now we do tawassul through the uncle of your Prophet…”, indicates that they don’t make tawassul through the Prophet’s (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) duaa after his death, and only when he was alive, or else <strong>why would he say “we used to”</strong>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If what the man did (wether it was Bilal ibn al Harith radiyallahu anhu or someone else) was correct\permissable, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Why didn’t any of the scholars I quoted mention the narration in a chapter titled (tawassul by the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) or some title indicating that the narration is EVIDENCE for permissibility of that type of tawassul?<br />
Instead they title the chapter in which the narration is in (salat al istisqa’- the man didn’t do salat al Istisqa’ at the grave, only did duaa, while Umar rA did salat al istisqa) , (The people asking the Imam to do istisqa’ in times of drought),  wouldn’t it be more important to point out the permissibility of tawassul through the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam after his death, which is stronger than doing tawassul through the righteous and ahl al bayt?<br />
Instead they ignored that part , <strong>showing no importance to it at all</strong>.<br />
So if they believed that the narration indicates the permissibility of such a tawassul, why didn’t they at least <strong>hint</strong> to it by the chapter title or a comment like they did to show that it meant to do intercession through saliheen and ahl al bayt, and ask the imam to do istisqa?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">What was the point of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam telling Umar r.A “<strong>be clever</strong>“?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If the man told Umar that he went to the grave, and then told him about the dream, why would Umar do salat al istisqa’ when the man already asked the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to do istisqa’ and he told him that they will be watered?<br />
<strong>Isn’t the istisqa’ of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam sufficient?<br />
</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If the action of the man was correct (to ask the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to do istisqa), and the Prophet S.A.W answered his request, then why didn’t it rain immediately after the dream, and instead came down immediately after al Abbas’s (radiyallahu anhu) duaa?<br />
<strong>Who is higher in status, the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam or his uncle?</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
