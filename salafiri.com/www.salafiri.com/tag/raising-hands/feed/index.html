<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Issue of Raf al-Yadayn</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Salim Ibn Abdullah Ibn Umar two hadiths: and there are 3 narrations to him which are Ma’lul</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[59] From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Salim Ibn Abdullah from Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) used to raise his hands to the level of his shoulders when he began the prayer and when he went into ruku (bowing) and raised his head from the ruku (bowing) he raised his hands in the same way, saying, &#8220;Allah hears whoever praises him, our Rab and praise belongs to You.&#8221; He did not do the same (raise his hands to his shoulders) in the sujud (prostration). </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Salim Ibn Abdullah) in Bukhari (no.736)</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;">[REFERENCES]</span> – [BUKHARI]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Muwatta (Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani’s narration pg.89 hadith no.99) at-Tamhid (9/210) al-Istidhkar: (no.139) with the words of Yahya Ibn Yahya        </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note: This is narrated in the manuscript of Yahya Ibn Yahya in a summarised narration in which the raf ul yadayn before the ruku (bowing) is not mentioned. (al-Muwatta Yahya’s narration (1/75 hadith no.160, book 3, chapter 4, hadith 16</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.735) from the hadith of Malik. Narrated by Muslim (no.390) from the hadith of Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) The following noble companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) have narrated about raf al yadayn before ruku (bowing) and after it:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu), Malik Ibn Huwayrith (Radi Allahu Anhu) (Sahih Bukhari (no.737) and Sahih Muslim (no.391)), Wa’il Ibn Hujr (Radi Allahu Anhu) (Sahih Muslim (no.401)), Abu Humayd as-Sa’idi (Radi Allahu Anhu) (Sunan at-Tirmidhi (no.304) and he said “This hadith is Hasan Sahih” and Ibn Khuzaimah authenticated it (no.587), and Ibn Hibban, al-Ihsan (no.1864, and Ibn al-Jarud (no.192), and its chain is authentic), Abu Bakr as-Sidiq (Radi Allahu Anhu) (as-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi (2/73) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic), Ali Ibn Abi Talib (Radi Allahu Anhu) (Sunan at-Tirmidhi (no.3423) and he said “This hadith is Hasan Sahih” and Ibn Khuzaimah authenticated it (no.584) and its chain is [Hasan] good), Abu Musa al-Ash’ari (Radi Allahu Anhu) (Sunan ad-Daraqutni (1/292) hadith (no.1111) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic), Jabir Ibn Abdullah al-Ansari (Radi Allahu Anhu) (Musnad as-Siraj (pg.25) hadith (no.92) and its chain is [Hasan] good) and other noble companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) such as it is established from the hadith of Abu Humayd (Radi Allahu Anhu) therefore it has become established that doing rafyal yadayn before and after ruku (bowing) is mutawatir. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For more details of rafyal yadayn being mutawatir see Qutfal Azhar al-Mutanatharah (hadith (no.33)) Luqtal Lali al-Mutanatharah (hadith (no.62)), nadhmul mutanathar (hadith (no.67)) Fath ul-Bari (1/203) and at-Taqyid Wal Idhah of al-Iraqi (pg.270) etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) Rafyal yadayn (before and after ruku (bowing)) is established from the following noble companions:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) (Sahih Bukhari (no.739), and Juz Rafyal yadayn of Bukhari (no.80) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic and Abu Dawud authenticated it (no.741), Malik Ibn Huwayrith (Radi Allahu Anhu) (Sahih Bukhari (no.737) and Sahih Muslim (no.391)), Abu Musa al-Ash’ari (Radi Allahu Anhu) (Sunan ad-Daraqutni (1/292) hadith (no.1111) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic, Abu Bakr as-Sidiq (Radi Allahu Anhu) (as-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi (2/73) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic), Abdullah Ibn Zubayr (Radi Allahu Anhu) (as-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi (2/73) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic), Ibn Abas (Radi Allahu Anhu) (Musanaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (1/235) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic), Anas Ibn Malik (Radi Allahu Anhu) (Juz Rafyal Yadayn (no.20) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic), Jabir Ibn Abdullah al-Ansari (Musnad as-Siraj (no.92) and its chain is [Hasan] good), Abu Hurayrah (Radi Allahu Anhu) (Juz Rafyal Yadayn (no.22) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The greatly valued Tabi’i Sa’id Ibn Jubayr said, “The noble companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) used to perform Rafyal yadayn at the beginning of the prayer, at the time of (going into) ruku (bowing) and after raising their heads from ruku (bowing)” (as-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi (2/75) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is established (from this) that the evidence for the noble companions doing Rafyal yadayn is mutawatir. (Radi Allahu Anhum)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Rafyal yadayn is established from the following noble tabi’in:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ibn Sirin (Musanaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (1/235) hadith (no.2436) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic), Abu Qilabah al-Basri (Ibn Abi Shaybah hadith (no.2437) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic), Wahb Ibn Munabih (at-Tamhid (9/228) and Musanaf Abdurazaq (no.2524) and it is [Sahih] authentic), Salim Ibn Abdullah al-Madani (Juz Rafyal yadayn (no.62) and its chain is [Hasan] good), Qasim Ibn Muhammad al-Madani (Juz Rafyal yadayn (no.62) and its chain is [Hasan] good), Ata Ibn Abi Rabah (Juz Rafyal yadayn (no.62) and its chain is [Hasan] good), Makhul ash-Shami (Juz Rafyal yadayn (no.62) and its chain is [Hasan] good), Nu’man Ibn Abi Ayash (Juz Rafyal yadayn (no.59) and its chain is [Hasan] good), Tawus (as-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi (2/74) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic), Sa’id Ibn Jubayr (as-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi (2/75) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic), al-Hasan al-Basri (Musanaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (1/235) hadith (no.2435) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic) and other than them.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">It is established from this that the evidence for the tabi’in doing Rafyal yadayn is mutawatir.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) Rafyal yadayn is established from sayings and actions of the following noble Imams:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Malik Ibn Anas, author of al-Muwatta (Sunan at-Tirmidhi (no.255) and it is [Sahih] authentic), Shafi’i (Kitab al-Um (1/104)), Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (Masa’il Ahmad for Abu Dawud (pg.23)), Ishaq Ibn Rahaway (Juz Rafyal Yadayn (no.1), Ma’rifatu as-Sunan Wal Athar of al-Bayhaqi, written by me (vol.1 pg.225), Ibn al-Mubarak (Ta’wil Mukhtalif al-Hadith of Ibn Qutaybah (pg.66) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic), Yahya Ibn Ma’in (Juz Rafyal Yadayn (no.121), and Humaydi (Juz Rafyal Yadayn (no.1) and other than them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) It is established from the (above) mentioned proofs that saying Rafyal yadayn is mansukh (abrogated), matruk (abandoned) or ghayr ula (not first, not primary, not better) is false.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) Imam Bukhari has given a general declaration that it is not established from any companion that they didn’t perform Rafyal Yadayn. See Juz Rafyal Yadayn (hadith (no.40, no.76, no.1) al-Majmu Sharh ul-Mahdhab of an-Nawawi (3/405))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) For more details on the verification of this topic, study Imam Bukhari’s famous and established book Juz Rafyal Yadayn (with my grading) and the book written by me “Noor ul-Aynayn Fee Athbat Mas’alah Rafyal Yadayn”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) It is not established that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) abandoned Rafyal Yadayn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) The person who performs Rafyal Yadayn receives 1 reward for each finger meaning you receive 10 rewards for performing Rafyal Yadayn once. See al-Mu’jam al-Kabir of at-Tabarani ((17/297) hadith (no.819) and its chain is [Hasan] good, and Musnad al-Haythami in Majmu az-Zawaid (2/103), and Ma’rifatu as-Sunan Wal Athar of al-Bayahqi (written by me (1/225) from Ishaq Ibn Rahaway and its chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note: The third narration that Shaykh Abul Hasan al-Qabisi gave an indication to and declared it to be Ma’lul is probably the hadith in Sahih Bukhari (no.24) and Sahih Muslim (no.36) in which it is said, “Leave him, as Haya&#8217; (modesty) is a part of faith.” This hadith is present in Muwatta Imam Malik (Yahya’s narration (2/905) hadith (no.1744) and according to the most correct saying it is [Sahih] and not Ma’lul. Wal hamdullilah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10) Doing Rafyal Yadayn in (during) the Sajdahs (prostrations) is not established from any [Sahih] hadith. For more details see Nur ul-Aynayn (pg.189)</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him): Four Ahadith</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[22] From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Abu Salamah Ibn Abd ar-Rahman Ibn Awf that Abu Hurayrah used to lead them in prayer and would say &#8220;Allah is the Greatest&#8221; whenever he lowered himself and raised himself. When he would finish he would say, &#8220;By Allah, I am the person whose prayer most resembles the prayer of the Messenger of Allah, Sallalahu Alayhi wa sallam.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> <span style="color: #000000">– [SAHIH]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadIth from Abu Salamah Ibn Abd ar-Rahman) in Bukhari (no.803)</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/76 hadith no.163, book 3, chapter 4, hadith no.19) at-Tamhid (7/79), al-Istidhkar: (no.143)    </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.785) and Muslim (no.392) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) Jabir (RadhiAllahu Anhu) used to teach the people to say takbir (Allah is the greatest) during the prayer and used to command them to say the takbir (Allah is the Greatest) every time they lowered and raised themselves. (Muwatta Imam Malik (1/77) hadith (no.166), and its chain is authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) The meaning of raising (raised himself) is lifting your head up from prostration (sajdah), here it does not mean lifting your head up from bowing (ruku) because there is clear proof for this specific (act). ‘Allah hears one who praises Him’ will be said after the bowing (ruku) just as it is established from the detailed hadith of Abu Hurayrah (RadhiAllahu Anhu). (Sahih Bukhari:(no.803), and Sahih Muslim (28/392))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) The Imam will say these takbirs (Allah is the Greatest) loudly just as it is established from the Hasan Li dha-Tihi (Sahih) hadith in the Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi (2/18) and the congregation will say the takbirs (Allah is the Greatest) quietly just as it is established from the Ahadith in Sahih Bukhari (no.4534) and Sahih Muslim (no.539) and there is an ijma (consensus) on this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) Imam Zuhri used to say that if a person catches (joins the prayer with) the (Imam) in bowing (ruku) then one takbir is enough for him (with the condition that he makes the intention of takbir iftitah [opening takbir]). See Muwatta Imam Malik (1/77) hadith (no.167), and its chain is authentic) This is approximately the same position of Imam Ata Ibn Abi Rabah and Hakam Ibn Utaybah. (Mussanaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (1/242) hadith (no.2509) and its chain is authentic, (1/243) hadith (no.2514) and its chain is authentic) It is also allowed to say two takbirs, for the starting (of the prayer) and one for the bowing (ruku) just as it is established from the Khalifah Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz. (Mussanaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (1/243) hadith (no.2515) and its chain is [Hasan] good)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) Abu Hurayrah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) used to do Raful-Yadayn (raising his hands up to his ears or shoulders) before and after bowing (ruku). (Juz Raful Yadayn of Bukhari: (no.22) and its chain is authentic). </span><span style="color: #000000">Abu Hurayrah’s (RadhiAllahu Anhu)  hadith in Muwatta comes with a chain (of narration) that this was the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) up until he (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) left this world. (See Sahih Bukhari: (no.803) therefore it is become established the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) used to do Raful Yadayn until he died.</span></p>
