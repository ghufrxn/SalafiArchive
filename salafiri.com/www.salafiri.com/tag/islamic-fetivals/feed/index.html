				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people attribute the following to Imam Ibn Taymiyyah</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“This is Imam Ibn Taymiyya’s opinion about Mawlid from: “the Collected Fatwas,” (“Majma’ Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya,”) Vol. 23, p. 163: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“fa-t’adheem al-Mawlid wat-tikhaadhuhu mawsiman qad yaf’alahu ba’ad an-naasi wa yakunu lahu feehi ajra `adheem lihusni qasdihi t’adheemihi li-Rasulillahi, salla-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“To celebrate and to honor the birth of the Prophet (s) and to take it as an honored season, as some of the people are doing, is good and in it there is a great reward, because of their good intentions in honoring the Prophet (s).”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even the beginning ardent supporter of the Mawlid knows who Shaikh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah was and his firm positions on innovations and their destructive affects. They find literally one sentence from his magnitude of works and say he supported the Mawlid!!! Sometimes even shame is ashamed of the antics of these people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is known that Imam Ibn Taymiyyah vehemently repelled and subdued innovations and the innovators and his students like Imam al-Bazzar and Imam Ibn Abdul Hadi amongst others all testified to Imam Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s unparalleled efforts in refuting innovations. (<em>al-Uqud al-Durriyyah Min Manaqib Shaikh ul-Islam Ahmad ibn Taymiyyah</em> (p.2) <em>al-A&#8217;lam al-Aliyyah Fi Manaqib Ibn Taymiyyah</em> (p.33), <em>Kawakaib al-Duriyyah Fi Manaqib al-Mujtahid Ibn Taymiyyah</em> (p.52)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is contradictory for Imam Ibn Taymiyyah to say what the opponents allege because he defines innovations very clearly, he said they are things which are not prescribed in the Din of Allah. (<em>Majmu&#8217;a al-Fatawa</em> (31:36). Therefore how can there be a great reward for doing something that is a bid&#8217;ah i.e. not prescribed in the Din of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also very clearly mentions the views and positions of the scholars or leaders that occur in different places whether minority or a majority cannot be used whatsoever as evidence to justify innovations. This is also therefore an answer to the simple beguiled Muslims who sympathize with the Barelwi Sufi&#8217;s doctrine due to their cultural background and link with what they have been custom to without looking at the intrinsic arguments. (<em>Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim</em> (2:584)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah further expounds on the understanding of the Mawlid sympathisers and explains that most of the innovations which have been introduced and formulated by leaders and scholars, have been done so by the aforementioned categories of people thinking they are good and something beneficial. The Mawlid is therefore a classical example of something innovated to build and establish acts for community cohesion and for other reasons which range from socio-political reasons and for popular supports etc. (<em>Majmu&#8217;a al-Fatawa</em> (11:345), <em>Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim</em> (2:594)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We known from the previous Mawlid Paper 33 <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/?p=5763&amp;preview=true">SEE HERE</a></strong></span> Imam Ibn Taymiyyah classified the Mawlid as an innovation and when he said, &#8220;<em>they may be rewarded for this love and ijtihaad&#8221; (Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim </em>(2:619) he explains this and says a scholar will be excused if he erred by exercising independent ijtihad and he may even be rewarded for his efforts but this does not mean the people make taqlid of such a scholar because his ruling and reasoning may be flawed, incorrect and inaccurate. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When this is the case it cannot be argued that such innovations or practices are something praiseworthy or even carry any reward or a great reward for that matter because Imam Ibn Taymiyyah clearly said and argues himself that if any action is considered to be good there must be divine text in support of the action or practise. If there is a textual evidence for any action say for instance the Mawlid then it will be considered a permissible action according to the shari&#8217;ah and not a good innovation i.e. bid&#8217;ah hasanah as some of the proponents of the Mawlid claim regarding the mawlid. (<em>Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim</em> (2:584)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They claim and acknowledge the mawlid was never practiced in the first three generations and it is only the extreme ignorant ones who try to prove the mawlid by distorting the texts or using unrelated, non specific and general evidences such as the Barelwi Sufi&#8217;s spread across the Sufi Tariqahs. Thus, the intellectual prodigies amongst them argue the mawlid is therefore a good bid&#8217;ah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah also clarified that many scholars or individuals introduced innovations with the sole intention to corrupt and to taint the Shari&#8217;ah and when this is his understanding it would be contradictory for him to say there is a great reward for the one who practices the mawlid. (<em>al-Nabuwwah</em> (p.154)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people of innovation and the ardent proponents of Mawlid al-Nabi often mention in support of their view a statement of Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah which they firstly take out of context and secondly misquote by only citing the beginning of the statement. It is very strange and odd that these people quote and present the statement of Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah for the mawlid when they spend night and day declaring him to a heretic and an anthropomorphist. If they say they have only quoted Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah as an evidence against the Salafi&#8217;s and the Ahl al-Hadith, then this yet again is another serious contradiction and shows the people of innovation do not have sound intelligence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On one hand they call us la-madhahabiyyah or ghair muqallids and then at the same time they quote our scholars to us as evidence. Without digressing from the issue at hand, why would the statement of a scholar be a hujjah for the very same people you call ghair muqallids. This is nonsensical and a clear proof the people of shirk and bid&#8217;ah have the most incongruous of intellects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sufis have done the rounds with a statement of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah with a failed attempt to support the Mawlid. Mr Sufi himself; Hisham Kabbani pushed this statement around and his cohorts solidified it amongst their fellow sufi brethren. They refer to the statement of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah where he said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;This is Imam Ibn Taymiyya&#8217;s opinion about Mawlid from: &#8220;the Collected Fatwas,&#8221; (&#8220;Majma&#8217; Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya,&#8221;) Vol. 23, p. 163: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><i>&#8220;fa-t&#8217;adheem al-Mawlid wat-tikhaadhuhu mawsiman qad yaf&#8217;alahu ba&#8217;ad an-naasi wa yakunu lahu feehi ajra `adheem lihusni qasdihi t&#8217;adheemihi li-Rasulillahi, salla-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam&#8221; </i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;To celebrate and to honor the birth of the Prophet (s) and to take it as an honored season, as some of the people are doing, is good and in it there is a great reward, because of their good intentions in honoring the Prophet (s).&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some of them even reproduce the following from Imam Ibn Taymiyyah,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“<em>And similarly what some people innovate by analogy with the Christians who celebrate the birth of ‘Eesa (Jesus), or out of love for the Prophet (saw) and to exalt him, and may Allaah reward them for this love and effort, not on the fact that it is an innovation…</em>” (Majmu’a al-Fatawa, <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">Vol.23</span> p.163, Iqtida’ al-Sirat al-Mustaqim, p.294-295, Section entitled, &#8216;The innovated festivals of time and place.&#8217;)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, this is a false interpretation and representation of his words which is not surprising to say the least, as one would only be surprised if they were accurate and precise for once in quoting Ahl al-Sunnah. Imam Ibn Taymiyyah said in his monumental book, <em>Iqtidaa&#8217; al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim</em> &#8216;Following the Straight Path in Opposing the People of the Hell-Fire&#8217;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“And like that, what some people have innovated, be it out of analogy to the Christians in the birth of ‘Eesa or be it out of love for the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and honor for him and Allah, they may be rewarded for this love and ijtihaad, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">not for the innovation as an ‘Eid</span></strong></span>. Along with the difference between the people with regards to his birth, this (celebration) was not done by the early generations of pious scholars even though factors that would have necessitating [the Mawlid] were present and there was a lack of any factors that would prevent them from doing so if it had indeed been good.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>If this [the Mawlid] was genuinely good or the correct opinion then the pious scholars of the early generations (may Allaah be pleased with them) would have been more entitled to it than us. They had greater love for the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and were more honouring of him than us; they were more eager upon goodness.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>Indeed, from the perfection of loving and honouring him is in following him, being obedient to him, following his command, reviving his Sunnah both in secrecy and open, spreading that which he was sent with, striving regarding that with one’s heart, hand and tongue. For indeed this is the path of the first of the early generations [who accepted his message] from the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar, and those that followed them in goodness.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>Most of them who you find eager upon such innovations (Bid’ah) despite their good intention and striving – for these two things reward is hoped (i.e. their good intention and striving) – however you find them weak in following the command of the Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) in that which they were commanded to be energetic and enthusiastic. They are like a person who adorns the Mushaf (a copy of the Qur’an) yet does not read what is in it; or they are like somebody who reads [what is in the Qur’an] but never follows it; or somebody who adorns the Masjid yet does not pray in it or only prays a little in it; or like a person who takes extravagant prayer beads and mats. Such apparent adornments which have not been legislated and are accompanied with showing off, pride and being pre-occupied away from what is actually legislated – this all corrupts the state of the person who is like this.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>Know that from the actions are those that have some good in them, due to including types of legislated actions and also they include evil such as innovations and other than that. So this action would be good due to what it includes of good and [at the same time] evil due to what it contains of turning away from the religion in its entirety – such is the state of the hypocrites and disobedient people. This is what most of the Ummah has been afflicted by in the later times…&#8221; [Translated by Abul Abbaas Naveed Ayaaz]</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Iqtidaa&#8217; al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim (2:619-620) with the checking of Shaykh Nasir al-Aql, Maktabah al-Rushd 1417/1996,5th edn)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Various translations of the above have been reproduced by a number of brothers with their annotations and essentially it all leads to an undisputed point; that the mawlid is a clear innovation and Imam Ibn Taymiyyah declared it to be an unequivocal innovation. He clearly says as the scans show that the individual may be rewarded for his love and ijtihad. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a stark difference between what Imam Ibn Taymiyyah actually said and how the Sufi&#8217;s and Barelwis have presented this point. Let us also remind the reader the disastrous translations and the deliberate treacherous distortion of the crystal clear words of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah. The Sufi&#8217;s and Barelwis should at least know venerating and respecting the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam); the best of mankind is a fundamental and intricate part of the belief system of Ahl al-Sunnah.</span></p>
