				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">QUESTION</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people claim it is permissible to make tabarruk ie seek blessings from the relics of the scholars and righteous people; they present evidence and say the companions sought blessings from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, so what is the ruling concerning this affair? Also in the form that is deemed permissible, is not a non-Prophet being compared to the Prophet of Allah ﷺ? Also is it permissible to seek blessing from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ after his demise? And is it permissible to seek wasilah ie intercession of the blessings of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ?</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is impermissible to seek blessing from the relics of anyone other than the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, for example the water remaining after wudu, his hair, his sweat or any other part of the body. All of these things are specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and this is because Allah had blessed his body and anything else that he touched. This is the reason why no companion sought blessing or virtue from each other during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ or after his death, even to the extent that blessings or tabarruk was not sought from the four rightly guided Khulafa Rashidun or from the other virtuous companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, such actions and the understanding of the companions is a clear and manifest evidence they understood tabarruk ie blessings to be specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ which was impermissible for anyone else. It is also impermissible for anyone who is not a Prophet because it leads to and is a means to Shirk with Allah which is also the false worship of others. Likewise, and similarly it is not correct to make wasilah of the essence or selfness of Prophet ie dhat, his attributes, his blessings, his station and status because it lacks evidence. This is also due to the fact that it is a means and also leads to Shirk with Allah, this is extremism as well as exaggeration in the status and station of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the reasons is is impermissible is because none of the companions adopted or practiced this type of wasilah. If this was something good, they would have surely preceded us.  Another reason why it is impermissible is because it opposes evidence s from the Shari’ah. Allah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Allah has the most beautiful names, so call him by them.” (al-A’raf:180)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Apart from Allah&#8217;s name, it is permissible to make wasilah through his attributes like Honour, mercy and speech which is established and proven from the authentic hadith, in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would seek refuge in Allah through his Speech, Honour, Mercy and Power. (Muslim no.2202, 2708).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also by having Iman in Allah and his Messenger, it is a means of loving both. Hence it is permissible to seek nearness or closeness to Allah via his righteous good deeds. This is exemplified in the incidence of the people of the cave, who sought shelter in a cave from rain when eventually a rock covered the entrance and blocked it. The people did not have the power to remove the rock, so they began to figure out a way in how to deal with the calamity, and so they agreed to supplicate to Allah by mentioning the good deeds they had done, and would use them as interecessors. So one used his good conducts with is parents as a means to seek nearness to Allah, so the rock moved a little. The second person used his deed of abstaining from fornication as a means to seeking closeness to Allah despite having the ability to do so, so the rocked moved a little more. The third person sought means of closeness by mentioning his good deeds of being honest and trustworthy, eventually the rocked moved from the entrance of the cave and they were eventually able to leave. This is an incident of the people or nations before, so It contains admonition and guidance for us all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This answer has been further expounded by Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim in their respective books. Allamah Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan has also addressed it in his <em>Fath al-Majid Sharh Kitab al-Tawhid.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the hadith of the blind man who sought intercession through the Prophet ﷺ which also mentions the Prophet ﷺ interceded on his behalf, so Allah restored his sight (Ahmad 4:134, Tirmidhi no.3579, Ibn Majah 1404, see also Shaikh al-Albani’s al-Tawassul wal-Wasilah p.75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we should know, this hadith did not mention his station or status as a means of closeness or intercession but rather it was due to the supplication of the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, his intercession, using his own wasitah and wasilah as the hadith clearly states. Furthermore, the people will go to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for this type of intercession on the Day of Judgement so that Allah makes Judgement on them quickly (Bukhari 7410, Muslim 193).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, and similarly the people of Jannah will come to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and ask him to intercede with Allah on their behalf for them to enter Jannah quickly (Muslim 196).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the aforementioned forms of Wasilah, whether they are related to when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was living or the afterlife, all in all of them are related to the Wasilah or du’a of intercession and not due to his selfness, ie Dhat or due to the right of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Tuhfatul Ikhwan Bajwibah Muhimmah Tataluq Biarkan al-Islam</em> (Question 5 p.29), see also <em>Majmu’a Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawah</em> (7:67)   </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We begin by praising Allāh the Lord of the Almighty Throne and sending peace and blessings upon our noble and beloved Prophet Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and all those who follow him with goodness until the last day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To proceed:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have been asked by our brother Raza Hasan to write a short introduction in his defence of Shaikh ul Islām ibn Taymiyyah in an issue of creed, being a critique of the miskin Deobandi Yasir Hanafī Jahmi, Mātarudi Sūfi Asharī. May All reward our brother for his noble efforts and accept his work before him as a means of allowing him to enter Al-Jannah. Āmīn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed has been refuted and exposed for the fraudster that he really is on numerous occasions by us. He has clearly demonstrated his ignorance in every aspect of the sacred sciences and as such he should be warned against for his opposition to the manhaj and creed of the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This said, we also have refuted the likes of his ‘run-arounds’ Yasir Jahmi and the new kid on the block Ibn Nur al-Shanti disgracefully known as Usamah Muttakin, both of whom are on vacation undergoing hormone replace therapy in Deoband. These people are upon the methodology of the Mutakallimin and the Mu’tazilites.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Raza Hasan has comprehensively answered everything and his effort has left us not much to comment upon, nonetheless we would like to, very concisely outline a few points as to why the Deobandis and their madhab Hanafiyyah is nothing more than a cauldron of falsehood, misguidance and wretchedness at its very route. In order to mask their falsehood, the Deobandis have always attacked the scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah and the Salaf who have exposed and contradicted their deviant ways and beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu al-Muzaffar al-Sam’ani [409H] mentioned some incredible words concerning the Mutakallimin, the way of Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed, Yasir and Mutakin, he said that Allah sent his Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam to convey and propagate the Din and from the most essential and mandatory aspects of the Din that were commanded is the Aqidah of Tawhid. Tawhid is the foundation and the Din in itself. The Messenger of Allah Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam conveyed everything from the Usul and Qaw’aid without missing anything. You will not find in the whole Din that he called and propagated the call and the way of the Mutakallimin in deducing from Jawhar and Ard (ie atoms and particles) in fact a single letter is not established from the companions. Thus, we can surmise from this that the Mutakalimin are upon a path which totally contradicts and opposes the way of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallm and his companions. Further, the principles and opinions they adhere to while opposing the aforementioned path they have concocted themselves. What is further depraved is that they target and insult the Salaf after formulating this futile way; they accused the Salaf of lacking knowledge and labelled their way as Tashbih. We warn everyone from the way of the Mutakallimin and to stay away from them as they have nothing but pure opinion and they even contradict and oppose each other in their writings. [Fath al-Bari [13:504]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abul Abbas Ahmad bin Ali al-Maqrizi [845H] wrote in detail concerning way of the Mutakallimin and their shenanigans. He rocked the foundations of the Ashariyyah and Kullabiyyah, he says, <em>“All of the Arabs whether they were town people or bedouins heard the Sifat (of Allah) but they did not question the Prophet Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam about them just as they would question him about the prayer, zakah and hajj.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say, <em>“If any of the companions had asked the Prophet Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam about any of the Sifat of Allah then indeed they would have been transmitted to us as well as the answers just as they have in numerous other issues like the Ahkam, Halal and Haram etc&#8230;” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said, <em>“The person who has deep research into the Prophetic Hadith and the reports of the Salaf us-Salihin he will clearly know that it is not established from a single companions via an authentic or even a weak chain that they asked the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam about the meaning of Dhat of Allah with regards to his Sifat as mentioned in the Quran and Hadith&#8230;.. The reality is they understood the apparent Dhahir meaning of the Sifat, did not delve into Kalam and remained silent.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say, <em>“Not a single companion made Ta’wil of any of the Sifat of Allah and in fact they were all united on the belief (Aqidah) that the Sifat are to be left on their apparent ie Dhahir meaning just as they were transmitted.”</em> (Refer to al-Muwa’iz Wa’l Ei’tibar Bi-Zikr al-Khitat Wa’l Athar [2:356]    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ahl ul-Bidʿah throughout the ages have employed various means in order to attack and vilify Ahl us-Sunnah. If one was to consider the books written by the Salaf which deal with rudūd and naqd then it as clear that one of the greatest way to attack Ahl us-Sunnah is to attack, it’s scholars. In reality, the attack on the Ahl us-Sunnah scholars by Ahl ul-Bidʿah is to attack what they carry by way of knowledge from the book, Sunnah and Salaf.  Ahl ul-Bidʿah are fully aware that once the scholars honour is taken then the ignorant masses will have a seed of doubt put in their hearts</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, one should not be surprised that the Deobandi Jahmi speaks ill of Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah as they have spoken ill of those far more superior than Ibn Taymiyyah such as the companions of the noble Prophet Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam and indeed our Lord Allah himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An example,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abū Hanīfah said that the Imān of Iblīs and the Imān of Abu Bakr is one as Abu Bakr said ‘Yaa Rabb’ [Oh My Lord] and Iblīs also said ‘Yaa Rabb’”</em> [Tārīkh Baghdād [13:376]. It’s chain of narration is Sahīh].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We free the noble Imām from such a statement but ask where is the Deobandi Jahmi Yasirs and his sidekicks critique of this belief regardless of whether it is ascribed correctly to the Imām or not so? How can he critique this when he himself is a burnt Murji who believes Iman is that which is only found in the hearts whilst actions are not a part of Imān.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Those whose foundation is built upon speaking ill of the greatest scholar of this Ummah, Abu Bakr, whilst likening his Imān to Iblīs then what hope do the likes of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah have in being secure from such wretched tongues?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, the Deobandi Jahmi Yasir Hanafi saw fit to play on the words of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah accusing him of blaspheming Allah suggesting that the Prophet Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam will be seated next to him on his Throne then has he not seen the blasphemy being committed in his own home or does he just wish to remain blind? An example,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abū Hanīfa said that if one were to worship the shoe in order to get closer to Allāh then I see no issue with this.”</em> [Tārikh Baghdad [13/374], Kitāb al-Marifah Wat Tārīkh [2/784], Kitāb al-Majrūhīn [3/73].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So where is the Deobandi Jahmi Yasirs critique of this belief regardless of whether it is ascribed correctly to the Imām or not so? InshaAllah we give husn al-dhan to Imām Abu Hanīfah over such statements and hold him in high esteem but sufficient it is to say that the likes of Yasir Deobandi Murji have never refuted or explained such statements but yet lie on other scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, the books of the Hanafis are no better and have put the Ummah to trial and tribulation. You will see that the Hanafīs are only interested in preserving their madhab even if this means twisting meanings of the book and Sunnah as well as defaming the scholars. Some examples:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abul Hasan Karkhī states: <em>“Any verse which conflicts with the sayings of our companions [Hanafee scholars] then we will consider it as being abrogated or an issue of paramount consideration of evidence. It is better for an interpretation to be made so that the conflict can be resolved between the verse and the saying.”</em> [Usūl al-Karkhī [pg.18]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Anyone who refutes the saying of Abu Hanīfah may there be as much curse on him equating the grains of sand upon the earth”</em> [Haskafi, Durr al-Mukhtar [1/63].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When the Prophet Esa (Alayhis Salam) shall return to earth he shall give legal verdicts based upon the fiqh of Abu Hanīfah”</em> [Khaskafi, Durr al-Mukhtār [1/55]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Prophet said [of course he did not as this is a complete fabrication],There will be a man from my Ummah who will be called Abū Hanīfah and he will have between his shoulders a sign and All will give life to the Sunnah through him”</em> [Reported via Nadharī in Manāqib Abī Hanīfah [1/16].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Commenting on this Allamah Mu’allamī Said, <em>“It is not hidden that the mentioning here of the sign between the shoulders is a reference and similarity to the seal of prophet hood between the shoulders of the Prophet Sallalahui Alayhi Wasallam.” </em>[Mu’allamī, at-Tankīl [pg.216].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the dreams and mysticism of the elders of Deoband then by the honour of all if we were to write and continued writing many volumes would be produces showing the pathetic manhaj of the Deobandīs in trying to fool the Ummah and also blaspheming the prophet in the process. Just one example suffices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi and or Khalil Ahmed Saharanpuri write in their joint venture, al-Barahin al-Qatiya against their fellow Hanafi Sufi Barailwi [The real Mawlid Imam] Abdul Sami Rampuri about the superiority of the Madrasah (school) of Deoband:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“A noble person was blessed with a vision of the Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam), in which he saw Allah’s Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) speaking in Urdu. The noble person asked, ‘How do you know this language, while you are an Arab?’ He (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, ‘From the time I have been in contact with the scholars of the school of Deoband, I’ve known this language’.” Rasheed Ahmad Gungohi comments, “From this we understand the greatness of this Madrasah (school).&#8221;</em> [<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.ahya.org/tjonline/quotes/bqatia-30/bqatia-30.htm">al-Barāhīn al-Qātiya, Urdu Bazār, Karāchi, [pg.30</a>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So in order to propagate the prestige of a primary school the elders of Deoband claim to meet the Prophet just like there brother Tāhir Qādrī insists he invited and met the noble Prophet Sallalalhu alayhi Wasallam in Pakistan who was upset with the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Why does Yāsir Jahmī not free himself from the statements that we have mentioned? He can rest assured that by rebuking and freeing himself from such statements his hanafiyyah will remain intact if that is something that is worrying him. Or will he defy Allah and his Messenger seeking the pleasures of his cult rather than the face of Allāh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Well is there any point in quoting further? Inshāllah the above suffices for the one who wants to ponder and reflect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah then we suffice with the words from Allamah Uthaymīn concerning him and those like him who were put to trial by Ahl ul-Bidʿah due to their adherence to the book and Sunnah.  He commented,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘Allah has sent Muhammad Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam with guidance and the true religion. He sent him as a mercy to the world, as an example for the workers, and as a proof against all the servants. He (Muhammad) fulfilled the trust, conveyed the message, advised the Ummah, and he clarified for the people all of what they need regarding the foundations of their religion as well as its detailed matters. He left no good except that he clarified it and encouraged it, and he left no evil but that he warned the Ummah from it so much so that he left his Ummah upon a clear, white path </em><em>‐</em><em> its night as clear as its day. His companions traversed this path, shining and radiant. Afterwards, the best generations took it from them in the same state until oppression frowned upon them with the darkness of various innovations by which the innovators conspired against Islaam and its people. The people then wandered in confusion purposelessly, and they began building their Aqidah beliefs upon a spider’s web. However, the Lord upholds His religion with His close helpers upon whom He bestows Eemaan, knowledge, and wisdom by which they prevent these enemies. They repel their plot back against their own throats. So no one ever comes out with his innovation except that Allaah </em><em>‐</em><em> and for this deserves praise and thanks </em><em>‐</em><em> destines to send someone from Ahlus</em><em>‐</em><em>Sunnah who refutes and disproves his innovation and extinguishes it. There was from the foremost of those who stood up against these innovators  </em><em>‐</em><em>  Shaikh ul</em><em>‐</em><em>Islam Taqi ud Din Ahmad ibn  Abdul Halim ibn Abdus Salam ibn Taymiyyah al</em><em>‐</em><em>Harani, al</em><em>‐</em><em>Dimashqi. He was born in Haran (in Iraaq) on Monday, the 10th of Rabi al</em><em>‐</em><em>Awwal in the Hijrah year of 661 and he died whilst being imprisoned oppressively in the fortress of Damascus in Dhul</em><em>‐</em><em>Qa’dah in the Hijrah year 728 </em><em>‐</em><em> may Allah have mercy on him. He has many works on the clarification and explanation of the Sunnah, the reinforcement of its pillars, and the destruction of innovations.’</em> [al-Uthaymīn, Fathu Rabb al-Bariyyah bi‐Talkhis al-Hamawiyyah [pg.8].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What wise and profound words Imam Abu Muhammad al-Juwaini, the father of Imam al-Haramin said whilst advising the Ashariyyah and let the modern day Ashariyyah and Kullabiyyah ponder over this, <em>“The person who despite studying so much is still ignorant of the Jihah of his creator yet a sheep herding slave girl knows Allah more than him. Thus the heart of that individual (who has studied so much) will always remain in darkness and will never be blessed with Iman and Ma’rifah.”</em> [Majmu’ah al-Rasa’il al-Muniriyyah [1:185]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once again may Allah reward our brother for his defence of the pristine and clear Aqidah of Ahl us-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah and indeed we pray that Allah rewards him immenselyand to accept it from him. Thus, this epistle also serves as reference point when these ignorant and lost Asharis and Kullabites raise unfounded accusations against Ahl us-Sunnah and Imam Ibn Taymiyyah.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abul Hasan as per usual in his 10 pence remarks unable to answer any of the main points boasts that he alone writes his articles etc without any help. He alludes to our thanking of Abush-Shaikh, a brother from Birmingham who at our request picked up a book for us and from the bab of the one who does not thank others does not thank Allah, we mentioned his name. Abu Hasan Hussain Ahmed wants to praise himself and tried to highlight this as a point attempting to say we had help in writing our response to him!!!! Seriously when is this guy going to grow up , even after all these years he behaves like a immature teenager. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He fails to read our words in which we intended a recourse to his protege and the underling Yasir Jahmi who has since gone into hiding, and so he should due to his ignorance and obnpxious remarks which are unfit for any audience let alone the seekers of the truth. However this is unsurprising as these like minded digressional tacticians are peas in a pod. Abu Hasan Hussain Ahmed goes onto mention some other profanities which are not even worth responding to as he himself knows how immature and infantile they are. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To end, we have advised the like of Yāsir many times before about taqwa and seeking the truth and that his time would be far better spent in promoting the true Aqīdah and way of the Salaf whilst freeing himself from statements of his elders which can truly have no justification behind them. We also advise our brother the author of this treatise to spend his time more wisely in defending Ahl us-Sunnah rather than replying in every minute issue to every Bakr, Amr and Zaid who is possibly not worthy to be responded to.  May Allah guide us All.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ones in need of the pardon of Allāh the Almighty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Zakareeyah bin Ghulam Qadir</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Allaah Ta’ala gave proofs in His Noble Book concerning the excellence of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, and following their way, Allaah Ta’ala said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&lt;&lt;And the first to embrace Islaam of the <em>Muhajirun</em> and the <em>Ansar</em> and also those who followed them exactly. Allaah is well pleased with them, as they are well pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.&gt;&gt;   [Tawbah: 100]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From Ibn Mas’ood that the Prophet  said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘The best people are my generation then those who will come after them and then those after them.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, the Companions are the example and they are the ones to follow. It is obligatory upon every Muslim to follow them in what they understood from the evidences of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, because they were the most knowledgeable of the people and they had the most correct understanding of the <em>Sharia’</em> texts out of all the people.  Consequently, if a Muslim takes other than their understanding then he will deviate away from the straight path, since the Companions stood with insight, and they viewed everything with their perceptive knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abu Zayed al-Qayrawani said in his book ‘al-Jaama’ (117):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘Submission to the Sunnan (plural of Sunnah) cannot be opposed with opinion, nor is it repelled with Qiyas (analogy).  As for the interpretation of the Salaf as-Salihthen that is how we interpret, and what they acted upon is which we act upon, what they left off is what we leave.  It is sufficient to adhere to what they adhered to, and that we follow them in that what they clarified.  We take them as an example in what they extracted and viewed from the hadeeth. We do not rebel against the Salaf as-Salih in what they differed or what they interpreted, and everything that we have just mentioned is the stance of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah and the Imams of the people in Fiqh and hadeeth.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As-Sama’ani said in ‘Sown al-Mantiq’ (158):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘Indeed we have been ordered to follow and been encouraged to do so.  And we have been prohibited from innovating and we have been rebuked concerning Bida’. The flag/sign of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah is their following the Salaf as-Salih, and them leaving everything that is innovated and heresy.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The supporter of the <em>Sunnah</em> al-Asbhaani said in his book ‘al-Hujjah Fee Bayaan al-Muhajjah’ (2/437-440):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘Knowledge is not having lots of narrations; rather it is following and using those narrations. It is to take the Companions and the Ta’abieen (the Successors of the Companions) as exemplary, even if it means having a little knowledge.  Whoever opposes the Companions and the Ta’abieen then he is misguided, even if he has a lot of knowledge.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Asbhaani continues:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘And that is to clarify for the people the matter of their Deen, so it is upon us to follow the Companions because indeed the Deen came from Allaah Ta’ala and it did not come from the intellects and opinions of men, but rather the Messenger  clarified the Sunnahfor his Ummah. And he explained it to his Companions.  Therefore, whoever opposed the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  in anything from the Deen then he has become misguided.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Rajab said in the book ‘Fadl Ilm as-Salaf ‘ala Ilm al-Khalaf’ (72):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘The beneficial knowledge from these sciences, are all precisely connected to the texts with the Book and the Sunnah, the understanding of the meaning of these sciences and their restrictions are with what has been narrated from the Companions and the Successors and those who followed them, regarding the meanings of the Qur’aan and the hadeeth.  Likewise, what has been mentioned from them of what they said regarding issues of Halaal and Haraam, as well as Zuhd, softening of the heart and knowledge and other issues.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymeeyah said in ‘Kitab al-Eemaan’ (p.114):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘To understand this principle of al-Eemaan the Murjia’ turned away from the explanation of the Book and the Sunnah, and the statements of the Companions, and the Successors who followed them in goodness. The Murjia’ relied upon their own opinions and they interpreted this principle with their own understanding of Arabic language.  This is the way of the people of Bida’. This is why Imam Ahmad said: ‘The people mainly make mistakes regarding interpretation and analogy.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is why we find the Mu’tazilah[1], Murjia’[2], Rafidah[3] and other than them from the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> explain the Qur’aan with their own intellect, as well as what they interpreted with Arabic language.  This is why you find them not relying upon the Ahadeeth of the Prophet , the Companions, and the <em>Ta’abieen</em> and the Imams of the Muslims.  So the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> do not rely upon the Sunnah, or upon the consensus of the <em>Salaf</em> or their <em>Aathaar</em>, rather they rely upon the intellect and language, and we find that they do not rely upon the books of <em>Tafseer</em> based upon narrations, and upon hadeeth and <em>Aathaar</em> of the <em>Salaf</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Ibn Taymeeyah also said in ‘Majmoo Fatawa’ (10/362):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘So knowledge which has been legislated and the rituals of worship which have been legislated are taken from the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah , as for what came from those after them, then it is not befitting that we take that as a foundation even though they are excused for their mistakes, rather they will be rewarded for theirIjtihad (exertion in deriving a ruling) or due to Taqleed (blind acceptance).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, whoever establishes speech regarding the science of <em>Usool</em> (principles) and its branches upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Athaar</em> narrated from the previous generations then he has achieved the Prophetic way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, whoever establishes his purpose, worship, good deeds and an understanding connected to the principles of righteous actions and its branches of circumstances of the heart and physical actions upon <em>al-Eeman</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em>and the guidance, which Muhammad  and his Companions were upon, then he has achieved the Prophetic way. And this is the way of the Imams of guidance; you find that Imam Ahmad would say when the principles of the Sunnah were mentioned:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘The principles of the Sunnah are adhering to what the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  were upon and the books of <em>Tafseer</em> which have narrations from the Prophet  and the Companions and the successors. This is what is relied upon in its knowledge based principles and its branches………………..’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, regarding <em>Zuhd</em>, <em>Raqaaiq</em> (softening of the heart) and matters of the heart since its knowledge is relied upon the book of <em>Zuhd</em> which has narrations about the Prophets <em>-salawaatAllaah alaihim-</em> from Adam to Muhammad, then upon the way of the Companions and successors and those after them were not mentioned.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">[Taken from ‘Tawdeeh Usool al-Fiqh ‘ala Manhaj Ahl-ul-Hadeeth’ p.41]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</span></p>
