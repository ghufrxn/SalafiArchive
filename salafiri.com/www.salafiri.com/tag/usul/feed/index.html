				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>by</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Imām Abū Muḥammad al-Darimī (d.255H) transmits from ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb (d.23H) who said:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #333300;">A group of people will come and argue with you through the mutashabihat of the Qurʾān, so discuss with them using the Aḥadīth, for verily the people of the Sunnah are more knowledgeable of Allāh&#8217;s Book.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Some have graded this report weak due to ʿAbdullāh b. Ṣāleḥ being Matrūk. It is not known whether he transmitted the report from his book or from memory. At the most, it can be said that he is weak which is agreed upon. The criticism of the Imams is light. This report has other supporting narrations i.e. Shawāhid. The chain is from ʿAbdullāh b. Ṣāleḥ &#8211; Layth b. Ṣa’d &#8211; Yazīd b. Abī Ḥabīb &#8211; ʿAmr b. al-Ashaj &#8211; ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Al-Ajurri: </strong>He cites this twice in his <em>al-Sharīʿah</em> with the following chain: From Abū Muḥammad al-Ḥasan b. Alawiyyah al-Qaṭṭān &#8211; ʿAṣim b. ʿAlī &#8211; al-Layth b. Ṣa’d &#8211; Yazīd b Abī Ḥabīb &#8211; Bakir b. ʿAbdullāh b. al-Ashaj &#8211; ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> All of the narrators are thiqah, however there is inqiṭāʿ between Bākir and ʿUmar. Here Bākir is the grandson of al-Ashaj, the son of ʿAbdullāh. We find ʿAṣim b. ʿAlī replaces ʿAbdullāh b. Ṣāleḥ and thus removing the potential weakness. Al-ʿAjurrī cites the report two times,<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> this narration in terms of the narrators is identical to the previous report. The second of the two,<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> has the following chain: Al-ʿAjurrī &#8211; Abū Bakr b. Abī Dāwūd &#8211; ʿIsā b. Ḥammād &#8211; Layth b. Ṣaʿd &#8211; Yazīd b. Abī Ḥabīb &#8211; Bākir b. al-Ashaj. In this chain ʿAbdullāh b. Ṣāleḥ again is replaced by ʿIsā b. Ḥammād and thus alleviating the concerns with ʿAbdullāh. Also of interest, the narrator is Bākir b. al-Ashaj and not what was mentioned in the previous report.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Al-Lalikā’ī: </strong>He transmits two reports,<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> here the report is also from ʿIsā b. Ḥammād, so ʿIsā supports ʿAbdullāh b. Ṣāleḥ. Al-Lalikā’ī cites another report with identical words from ʿAlī with al-Lalikā’ī reporting from ʿUbaydullāh b. Aḥmad b. ʿAlī al-Muqrī – Muḥammad b. ʿAbdullāh b. Ibrāhīm – Muḥammad b. Khalf al-Marudhī &#8211; Mūsā b. Jaʿfar b. Muḥammad &#8211; ʿAlī (the exact same words as the report of ʿAlī)<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> However, this report is disconnected as two narrators are missing in the chain and thus Mūsā narrates Muʿadallan i.e. omits two narrators in the chain. Mūsā b. Jaʿfar is the great great grandson of ʿAlī and his lineage is Mūsā b. Jaʿfar b. Muḥammad b. ʿAlī b. al-Ḥuṣayn b. ʿAlī. All of the narrators of this chain are trustworthy as was Mūsā b. Jaʿfar. So, he perhaps narrated through this chain but there is no clarification. Nonetheless, the wording is supported.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>ʿUmar or ʿAmr al-Ashaj or al-Ashj’a: </strong>There is contention as to who the exact narrator is and the discussion is as follows. At times it is reported via al-Ashaj and at times through al-Ashj’a. Some have alleviated this issue and have put forward the view that the narrator is ʿAmr b. al-Aswad who was from the same tabaqah of ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb, and he was a Mukhdaram and from those who narrated from ʿUmar. Ibn al-Baṭṭah and Ibn ʿAbdul Barr also transmits it<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> who leaned towards its authenticity.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Zakareeyah bin Ghulam Qadir</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Allaah Ta’ala gave proofs in His Noble Book concerning the excellence of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, and following their way, Allaah Ta’ala said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&lt;&lt;And the first to embrace Islaam of the <em>Muhajirun</em> and the <em>Ansar</em> and also those who followed them exactly. Allaah is well pleased with them, as they are well pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.&gt;&gt;   [Tawbah: 100]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From Ibn Mas’ood that the Prophet  said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘The best people are my generation then those who will come after them and then those after them.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, the Companions are the example and they are the ones to follow. It is obligatory upon every Muslim to follow them in what they understood from the evidences of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, because they were the most knowledgeable of the people and they had the most correct understanding of the <em>Sharia’</em> texts out of all the people.  Consequently, if a Muslim takes other than their understanding then he will deviate away from the straight path, since the Companions stood with insight, and they viewed everything with their perceptive knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abu Zayed al-Qayrawani said in his book ‘al-Jaama’ (117):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘Submission to the Sunnan (plural of Sunnah) cannot be opposed with opinion, nor is it repelled with Qiyas (analogy).  As for the interpretation of the Salaf as-Salihthen that is how we interpret, and what they acted upon is which we act upon, what they left off is what we leave.  It is sufficient to adhere to what they adhered to, and that we follow them in that what they clarified.  We take them as an example in what they extracted and viewed from the hadeeth. We do not rebel against the Salaf as-Salih in what they differed or what they interpreted, and everything that we have just mentioned is the stance of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah and the Imams of the people in Fiqh and hadeeth.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As-Sama’ani said in ‘Sown al-Mantiq’ (158):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘Indeed we have been ordered to follow and been encouraged to do so.  And we have been prohibited from innovating and we have been rebuked concerning Bida’. The flag/sign of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah is their following the Salaf as-Salih, and them leaving everything that is innovated and heresy.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The supporter of the <em>Sunnah</em> al-Asbhaani said in his book ‘al-Hujjah Fee Bayaan al-Muhajjah’ (2/437-440):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘Knowledge is not having lots of narrations; rather it is following and using those narrations. It is to take the Companions and the Ta’abieen (the Successors of the Companions) as exemplary, even if it means having a little knowledge.  Whoever opposes the Companions and the Ta’abieen then he is misguided, even if he has a lot of knowledge.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Asbhaani continues:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘And that is to clarify for the people the matter of their Deen, so it is upon us to follow the Companions because indeed the Deen came from Allaah Ta’ala and it did not come from the intellects and opinions of men, but rather the Messenger  clarified the Sunnahfor his Ummah. And he explained it to his Companions.  Therefore, whoever opposed the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  in anything from the Deen then he has become misguided.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Rajab said in the book ‘Fadl Ilm as-Salaf ‘ala Ilm al-Khalaf’ (72):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘The beneficial knowledge from these sciences, are all precisely connected to the texts with the Book and the Sunnah, the understanding of the meaning of these sciences and their restrictions are with what has been narrated from the Companions and the Successors and those who followed them, regarding the meanings of the Qur’aan and the hadeeth.  Likewise, what has been mentioned from them of what they said regarding issues of Halaal and Haraam, as well as Zuhd, softening of the heart and knowledge and other issues.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymeeyah said in ‘Kitab al-Eemaan’ (p.114):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘To understand this principle of al-Eemaan the Murjia’ turned away from the explanation of the Book and the Sunnah, and the statements of the Companions, and the Successors who followed them in goodness. The Murjia’ relied upon their own opinions and they interpreted this principle with their own understanding of Arabic language.  This is the way of the people of Bida’. This is why Imam Ahmad said: ‘The people mainly make mistakes regarding interpretation and analogy.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is why we find the Mu’tazilah[1], Murjia’[2], Rafidah[3] and other than them from the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> explain the Qur’aan with their own intellect, as well as what they interpreted with Arabic language.  This is why you find them not relying upon the Ahadeeth of the Prophet , the Companions, and the <em>Ta’abieen</em> and the Imams of the Muslims.  So the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> do not rely upon the Sunnah, or upon the consensus of the <em>Salaf</em> or their <em>Aathaar</em>, rather they rely upon the intellect and language, and we find that they do not rely upon the books of <em>Tafseer</em> based upon narrations, and upon hadeeth and <em>Aathaar</em> of the <em>Salaf</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Ibn Taymeeyah also said in ‘Majmoo Fatawa’ (10/362):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">‘So knowledge which has been legislated and the rituals of worship which have been legislated are taken from the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah , as for what came from those after them, then it is not befitting that we take that as a foundation even though they are excused for their mistakes, rather they will be rewarded for theirIjtihad (exertion in deriving a ruling) or due to Taqleed (blind acceptance).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, whoever establishes speech regarding the science of <em>Usool</em> (principles) and its branches upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Athaar</em> narrated from the previous generations then he has achieved the Prophetic way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, whoever establishes his purpose, worship, good deeds and an understanding connected to the principles of righteous actions and its branches of circumstances of the heart and physical actions upon <em>al-Eeman</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em>and the guidance, which Muhammad  and his Companions were upon, then he has achieved the Prophetic way. And this is the way of the Imams of guidance; you find that Imam Ahmad would say when the principles of the Sunnah were mentioned:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘The principles of the Sunnah are adhering to what the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  were upon and the books of <em>Tafseer</em> which have narrations from the Prophet  and the Companions and the successors. This is what is relied upon in its knowledge based principles and its branches………………..’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, regarding <em>Zuhd</em>, <em>Raqaaiq</em> (softening of the heart) and matters of the heart since its knowledge is relied upon the book of <em>Zuhd</em> which has narrations about the Prophets <em>-salawaatAllaah alaihim-</em> from Adam to Muhammad, then upon the way of the Companions and successors and those after them were not mentioned.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">[Taken from ‘Tawdeeh Usool al-Fiqh ‘ala Manhaj Ahl-ul-Hadeeth’ p.41]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Difference Between The Salafi’s and The Ashari’s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Herein lies the difference, the usool of the salafee is that “ we read the ahadeeth so that our intellects, opinions, desires and other than that are to be in conformity with the hadeeth leaving off everything and accepting the hadeeth” whereas the asharee says “we read the hadeeth so that it can be in conformity with our intellects and our madhab and if it does not then we either make taweel of the hadeeth to make it agreeable with our madhab, and if this is not possible then we leave the hadeeth” A great calamity indeed!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Hayaat Sindhee in Iqaz al-Humam (pg.81) whilst he was discussing the methodology of the Hanafee Ahlur  Rai said that they were engrossed in giving precedence to opinion over the text of the prophetic traditions.  This matter would be incomplete if we did not therefore mention here that the above innovated principles and other than it are not something that the modern day Asharees have established but they borrowed this from their forefathers the Hanafee, maturidee Jahmees, that is,  the current day Deobandee and Barelwis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus we find from the classical hanafee books of Usool and jurisprudence such as Talweeh’ pg.17 and ‘Usool Bazdawee’ pg.34, Usool Karkhee pg.12 stating that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“any ayat or hadeeth which is contradiction to our Madhab then we will either make taweel of it and if we cannot make taweel of it to fall within our madhab then we shall leave it”    </em>and,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“any ayah of the quran which is against our madhab then we shall either say it is abrogated or give precedence to our madhab, but it is better that we make taweel of the ayah to make it in accordance with the saying of the madhab”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Icing on the cake is that which has been said by the grandfather of the Barelwis Muftee Ahmed Yar Khan Naeemi (Jaa al Haqq, Chapter on blind following) says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“we accept the Quran and hadeeth if it is accordance with our Imaam and leave it if it contradicts the saying of our Imaam, even if it is an authentic hadeeth. To take the Quran and hadeeth upon its apparent meaning is the root of Kufr”.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So to take the attributes on their apparent meanings as accepted by the Ijmaa of the salaf is Kufr!  So here we see the deep rooted relationship between the Ashaaiarah and Hanafee Madhab, a dangerous cocktail indeed!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, if one looks carefully at the Qur’an one can clearly see that especially in relation to all of the aspects of Islaam and the aqeedah one must have just as much reliance on the Qur’an as one has on the Sunnah and one cannot suffice without the other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So concerning the Ashaa’irah, how is it that they can say that the Qur’an is to be relied upon because the ahadeeth which talk about the Names and Attributes of Allah and which clearly state that the Attributes are to be taken literally are in contradiction with various ayaat of the Qur’an. We say to them have they not read in the Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Do you not ponder over the Qur’an? And if it had been from any other than Allah then in it you would have found much conflict and difficulties.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous tabi’ee and explainer of the Qur’an Imaam Ibn Jareer at-Tabari said concerning this verse of the Qur’an,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“No doubt the revelation which would come to the Prophet of Allah would come in a clear way so that the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam could explain its meanings and tell the people about the obligations from it. Had these orders or had these revelations to the Prophet been from any other than Allah then the orders that were given by the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam in his sunnah would have differed, the meanings would have differed and the whole religion would be in conflict, but this is not the case.”(</em>Tafseer Tabaree vol.5 pg.189)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> So one can clearly see from this that had any of the sunnah been in conflict with the Qur’an then the whole religion would be something which would be unrecognisable and full of conflicts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Shafi’ee Rahimahullah said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It should be known that there is no difference to what Allah has revealed in the Qur’an and the obligations that the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam has told us about from his Sunnah, they have both come in the same manner.” (</em>ar-Risaalah ash-Shafi’ee pg.183)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Allaamah Ibn Hazm Rahimahullah says in his tremendous book ‘al-Ihkaam’:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We have clearly substantiated that there is not a single ayah of the Qur’an which is in opposition to the authentic hadeeth and no authentic hadeeth which is in opposition to any ayah of the Qur’an, there is no separation or conflict. Whoever says that there is a conflict between an authentic hadeeth and an ayah of the Qur’an then his saying is rejected and based upon falsehood.” (1/112)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Qayyim Rahimahullah said in his book A’laam ul-Muwaqqi’een:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“From the principles of the Sharee’ah it is not possible to say that any ayah of the Qur’an differs or has a conflict with a hadeeth of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam or an obligation emanating from it. In fact the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam has forbid people to claim there to be such a distinction, what is upon us is to affirm and accept that which has been revealed, for all of this is proven from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam and the revelation that Allah has sent upon him. Anyone who says other than this is upon clear misguidance and mistaken”. (</em>A&#8217;laam ul Muwaqqi&#8217;een vol.2 pg.38)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning the verse of the Quraan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And those people who have bought faith upon that which the messengers have bought and make no distinctions between them&#8230;.” (</strong>Soorah an-Nisa 4:152)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa&#8217;dee said in his tremendous Tafseer Tayseer al Kareem,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“This verse of the Qur’an clearly shows that Allah </em><em>Subhanahu wata’ala is informing us that which he has told us about concerning himself and those narrations which have been brought by the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam by way of obligations then it is mandatory for us to have belief upon it all!” (</em>Tayseer al-Kareem ar-Rahmaan Fee Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan vol.2 pg.210 with the checking of Muhammad Zuhree an-Najjar)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>In Sooratul Nahl ayah 44 it says,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“With clear signs and Books (We sent the Messengers). And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the reminder and the advice (the Quran), that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought”.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Imaam Shafi’ee said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allah Subhanahu wata’ala in His Book and religion has given the status to the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam which has been mentioned in the Qur’an itself. Therefore it is obligatory upon mankind that they accept the revelation which has been revealed to the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam by way of the Qur’an and that which has also been revealed to him by the way of the hadeeth with which he speaks. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam when he spoke he made no contradictions with the Qur’an and in fact it is just an explanation of that which Allah had already revealed upon him by way of the Qur’an.” (</em>Jaami ul-Ilm pg.118)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore it is clear that there is no hadeeth whether it is concerning the Names of Allah or his Attributes , calling upon Allah alone, worshipping only Allah or any other Ahkaam concerning the Aqeedah or other than it in contradiction to the Qur’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah has said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The sunnah was revealed upon the Prophet just as the Qur’an was also revealed upon him.” (</em>Majmoo’a al-Fataawa of Ibn Taymiyyah vol.13 pg.364)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Shawkaani says whilst explaining the hadeeth ‘I have been given the Quran and something similar to it’:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This means he has been given the Qur’an and similarly the sunnah has also been given to him by way of revelation, and this is revelation {hadeeth} which has not been mentioned in the Qur’an.” (</em>Irshaad Al Fuhul of Shawkaani pg.33)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This clearly shows that it is a fallacy for any deviant sect including those such as the ashaa’irah to claim that ‘where in the Qur’an does it say that the Hand of Allah is to be taken literally or Allah has two Eyes or that Allah has a foot which is to be taken literally having a meaning?’. In essence, the Ashaairah ask the Salafees for evidence of the existence of the principles concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah as upheld by the salaf from within the Qur’an only and this shows that they have left the way of the Ahlul Ilm and the way of the salaf in this matter also. We reply,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah Subhanahu wata’ala says in the Qur’an <strong>An Nisaa 59,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger ), if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination”.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Imaam Shaatibee says </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This ayah clearly shows that there is no conflict in the sharee’ah because Allah Subhanahu wata’ala has told those that are in conflict to refer to the sharee’ah i.e. the Qur’an and the sunnah in order to finish the conflict. So it is clear that conflict will only seize once one can refer to that which can make the conflict end. Thus, if that which is commanded to refer back to {quran and sunnah} were to have in itself conflicts then there is no point in referring to it and those who say this are upon a way which is misguided”. (</em>Al-Muwafaqaat of Shaatibee vol.4 pg.119 and Al-I’tisaam of Shaatibee vol.2 pg.309-310)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a tremendous saying of Imaam Shaatibee and more or less sums up what is to be said. How can the ashaa’irah reject certain ahadeeth because it does not fit in with their minds or they say it opposes the Quran? Not all principles concerning aqeedah are found solely in the Quran but we look also to the hadeeth with the understanding of the salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Qayyim says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If the Book of Allah and the authentic sunnah of the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam did not have the quality of resolving conflicts then Allah Subhanahu wata’ala would not have told people who are in conflict to refer to them both. For verily he would not tell the people to refer to the Book and the sunnah of the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam had there been a conflict between them two in the first place”. (</em>I&#8217;laam ul Muwaqqi&#8217;een vol.1 pg.49)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Asharis for hundreds of years have not understood what the Sahaaba and tabi’een understood thousands of years ago. For example, concerning the conflicts that the people talk about between the authentic hadeeth and the Qur’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Imaam Maymoon bin Mehraan who was born in the year 40A.H. and passed away in the year d.118A.H having met many companions said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“To refer back to Allah Subhanahu wata’ala is to refer to his Book and when the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam was alive then the people would refer to him in person and now that he has passed away then one must refer to his blessed sunnah.” (</em>Tafseer Tabari vol.5 pg.96, Mushkilul Athaar of Tahawi vol.1 pg.484, al-Faqeeyah of Imaam Khateeb al-Baghdadi vol.1 pg.144 with a hasan isnaad.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Shawkaani says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Verily there is a consensus of all of the muslims from the salaf and those after them in the present times from the companions and other than them that in the affairs of the religion where there is a conflict between the sayings of the scholars then it is obligatory for the person to refer back to the Book of Allah and the sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad sallalahu alaihi wasallam and this has been mentioned in the Qur’an in Soorah Nisa ayah 59:</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>‘O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.’</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And this is to refer to Allah Subhanahu wata’ala meaning to refer to His Book and to refer to the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam means to refer to the Sunnah after his death. There is no one that has differed concerning this, from amongst the muslims.”</em> (Sharh as-Sudoor pg.1)</span></p>
