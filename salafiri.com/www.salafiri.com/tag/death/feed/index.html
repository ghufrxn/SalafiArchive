<p><span style="color: #000000;">Saqib &#8216;Shami&#8217; delivered a talk a few years back, parts of which were uploaded on to youtube titled as, &#8220;<em>Death of Ibn Taymiyyah What Really Happened? Did (BIDDAH &amp; SHIRK) Take Place?&#8221;</em> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Saqib is based at this centre</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Apart from the disastrous distortions and misconstrued interpolations to serve the innocent listeners in the gathering, most of the points do not extend beyond comical digressions and hyped hellenistic delusions. One of the outright lies uttered by Saqib was that Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah wore a Ta&#8217;wiz or talisman (which he cleverly terms as a Dauri &#8211; a subcontinent term for a thick string attached to a type of tawiz) and hence he died with that around his neck etc, the viewers can watch the comical presentation themselves from 5:50 onwards in the video below</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='618' height='378' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JCPp8Pq4AYM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first deliberate distortion and deceptive lie Saqib utters is that he says the student of Ibn Taymiyyah, Hafiz Ibn Kathir is saying this &#8211; the reason we say a deliberate deceptive because Saqib clearly says he is reading the text and translating it directly. Hence the deliberate lie and an attempt to present such beliefs on Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and Hafiz Ibn Kathir is appalling. If we look at the text of al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah Hafiz Ibn Kathir clearly says</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (18:295+)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ed.Dr. Abdullah bin Abdul Muhsin al-Turki,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Markaz al-Buhuth Wad-Dirasat al-Arabiyyah al-Islamiyyah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">(Riyadh: Dar al-Hajr, 1419/1998) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That Shaykh Alam ud Din al-Birzali said his his Tarikh&#8230;.and then Hafiz Ibn Kathir relays the whole incident and events surrounding the death of Imam Ibn Tayniyyah from al-Birzali! Why did Saqib deliberately omit this very important detail and attempt to present Hafiz Ibn Kathir said all of this. This is surely treacherous and at the very basic level negligent in misquoting peoples names is beguiled narratives, especially when the ardent bigoted individual has animosity for the great Shaykh in question.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Saqib then proceeds to quote allegedly Hafiz Ibn Kathir, that when Shaykh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah died they recovered a &#8216;Dauri&#8217; i.e. a thick string attached to a type of Tawiz. He then offers his 10 pence worth of refutation regarding the matter. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fact of the matter is, anyone who has read the glorious history and life struggles of Shaykh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, his trials and inquisitions will know that he was imprisoned for sticking firmly to the Quran and Sunnah, something his adversaries and the likes of Saqib will have no clue about. Jail is not the most hygienic of places with little access to water and cleansing facilities, one can only but imagine the state of the prisons in those eras and the treatment of those who oppose the creed of the state. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being Imam Ibn Taymiyyah had head lice / nits and the treatment for head lice during that era was to use a string or thread around the neck soaked in mercury or quick silver. This was very common in that era and many people would often wear such strings or threads. There was no Dauri or tawiz as Saqib would like you to believe or deliberately lie to the people. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A person oft quoted by these Sufi&#8217;s Barelwi&#8217;s is their Ibn Batutta, he mentions whilst crossing the Sahara that people in the area would wear strings/threads around their necks due to the area having a lot of lice and the string would have mercury in it which would kill the lice. (Halsall P. (ed.), <em>“Ibn Battuta prepares to cross the Sahara”</em> in <em>Internet Medieval Source Book: Ibn Battuta: Travels in Asia and Africa 1325-1354</em>, (Fordham University Center for Medieval Studies: New York, 2000)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another one of their boys, Ibn Sina (Avicenna) also advocated the use of mercury to kill head lice, others extracted this and used it in a form of a string around the necks. (Carraher C.E., Jr. and C.U.Pittman C.U., Jr., Chapter 1, <em>Organometallic Compounds in Biomedical Applications</em>, Vol.3 page.3 <em>Biomedical Applications,</em> A.S.Abd-El-Aziz (ed.), John Wiley &amp; Sons: Inc. 2004)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No one says wearing, an oxygen mask, inhaler, ECG pads, wires, drips etc are tawiz because everyone is old enough and intelligent to say these are forms of medical treatments. As they were such medical treatments in the times before, furthermore, no one claims or says all the people who used such strings to treat head lice were Tawiz. Dear readers by now you would have realised how far fetched and how appaling this notion was to defame and discredit Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and the Salafi&#8217;s whereas the reality is crystal clear. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the other reports and incidences that are mentioned they have no bearing on Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah as this was done by the general people. On one hand they say we had no followers or Imam Ibn Taymiyyah had no followers except a few fringe people and at the same time they say all of these people were with Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, it is perhaps about time these Sufi Barelwis made their minds up before falling prey to their wobbling sadistic movements. The only difference is that the general Muslims had great love and reverence for Imam Ibn Taymiyyah due to this closeness to Allah via the Quran and Sunnah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the actions of the people are a litmus test, then know for sure, none of Ibn Taymiyyahs followers especially the men, wore bells on their feet and danced like women on graves (as happens in England) or exploited the sexuality of vulnerable women at the Darbars and your holy places and the list is endless if you would like us to continue, e.g. women impregnated under the guise of holy miracles at shrines, filthy naked despicable men sitting around and lets not forget the overwhelming level of Sujud to graves and the living Pirs&#8230;.. I&#8217;m sure you get the point&#8230;.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the very least they have admitted Imam Ibn Kathir was with Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and not a Sufi as some of these people claim. Furthermore, as we have mentioned Hafiz Ibn Kathir quoting al-Birzali does not use any word at all whatsoever which can be even remotely used to denote Tawiz, here are his words,</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (18:297)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As you can see dear readers, Birzali says the thread that was used had mercury in it, i.e. al-Zi&#8217;baqu. So we ask 1. why did Mr Saqib deliberately and deceptively leave this very important piece of information out, i.e. that according to you Imam Ibn Taymiyyah was wearing a taw with MERCURY in it, as you can see if he had mentioned this it would have made him look stupid and thus he would have been unable to deceive and lie to the people. Secondly we ask, if you claims this was a Tawiz, show us from your own people A SINLGE PERSON who wears a tawiz with mercury in it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Last but not least we leave you with this fantastic mind boggler which will perhaps go down very well with the Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s because they seem to be very astute at such intellectual marvels and that is if Mr Saqib claims that Imam Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah wore a Tawiz, for head lice, then show us just ONE PERSON from amongst your Sufi Barelwis who uses a Tawiz for head lice, REMEMBER JUST ONE PERSON, we will be waiting very patiently!!! It means the people do not use a tawiz for head lice and thus Imam Ibn Taymiyyah did not use a tawiz at all, let alone for head lice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers this is just one basic reply to such deceptions and disastrous distortions of these people, which they continuously utter to serve their self delusions and misguidance and misguiding others from the true facts.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> &#8211; [AGREED UPON]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (1/222 hadith no.521, book 16, chapter 1, hadith no.2), at-Tamhid (1/371) al-Istidhkar (no.482) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">And transmitted by al-Bukhari (no.1253) and Muslim (38/939) from the hadith of Malik </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) There is a difference of opinion on what one should do if anything comes out from the two private parts of the deceased individual after washing them. Some say that the deceased individual should be washed again and some say that only doing istinja and wudhu on the deceased individual is sufficient. From the two sayings the first one is better and more correct and Allah knows best. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) The deceased indivudal should first be given istinja, then the wudhu which is done for the normal Salah then a Ghusl. One should start with the right side when carrying out the wudhu and Ghusl. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) One should use a cloth when carrying out the isinja on the deceased person. See at-Tamhid (1/376)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) Using the lotus leaves whilst washing the deceased individual is the best method. Doing Qiyas on this point it is allowed to use modern day soaps etc. and Allah knows best. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) Women will wash females and men will wash males and it is also allowed for a man to wash his wife and a woman to wash her husband just as it is established from other narrations. See at-Tamhid (1/380) and Musnad Ahmad (6/367 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Hasan]</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) It is highly recommended to wash the deceased an odd number of times i.e. 3, 5, 7 etc. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="storytitle">Narration of Malik al Dar, evidence for Tawassul by the living &amp; not by the Prophet after his death</h3>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><em>Bismillah, wal-hamdulillah was-salatu was-salamu ‘ala Rasulillah.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The incident mentioned in the narration of Malik al Dar happened during the Khilafah of Umar radiyallahu anhu, during the time of drought, and so did the incident of Umar bin al Khattab’s (radiyallahu anhu) tawassul through the Prophet’s (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) uncle, Al Abbas radiyallahu anhu.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">I have come across many discussions in regards to this narration, and all of them were concentrating on the “authenticity” of the narration, discussing its chain.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">But I have not come across any discussions on the text of the hadith itself, the story,<br />
except for some quotes here and there from some current shaikhs, sited in ahl alhadith forum, and those 2 or 3 points mentioned by those shaikhs led me to research the story of the hadith in classical books of past scholars, and I have found it very interesting and informative.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The things I discovered and read show a totally different understanding of the hadith, than what is understood by many Muslims today including some scholars, it only needs for one to go deep and see where the scholars of the past quoted the narration, in which chapter and what they said before quoting it to understand the real meaning of the hadith.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">I will go straight to the points that I have regarding the text and story of this narration of Malik al Dar. After that I will mention some logical arguments in reply to the ones who use this narration as evidence for tawasul that is “<strong>asking the Prophet</strong> <strong>(sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) to make duaa to Allah for us AFTER HIS DEATH</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>The text of the narration:</strong><strong><br />
</strong><br />
It is related from Malik al-Dar, `Umar’s treasurer, <em>that the people suffered a drought during the time of `Umar (his khilafah), whereupon a man came to the grave of the Prophet and said: “O Messenger of Allah, ask for rain for your Community, for verily they have but perished,” after which the Prophet appeared to him in a dream and told him: “Go to `Umar and give him my greeting, then tell him that they will be watered. Tell him: You must be clever, you must be clever!” The man went and told `Umar. The latter said: “O my Lord, I spare no effort except in what escapes my power!””</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Scholars’ understanding of this narration</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Hafidh <strong>Ibn Hajar al Asqalani</strong> –<em>rahimahu Allah</em>– in his books “<em>Fath al Bari</em>” (vol 3 pg. 441):</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">He sites it in chapter “<em>The people asking the Imam to do istisqa’ in times of drought</em>,” in the chapter heading section, in which he quotes ahadith that have relevance to the chapter heading, and that connect it with hadiths that come under that chapter.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Amongst those narrations he mentions the narration of Malik al Dar, and he only quotes part of the narration, he stops at “go to Umar”. He used this as evidence that people ask the imam to do istisqa (<em>ask for rain</em>) for them in times of drought.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">He didn’t mention the rest of the hadith because it has nothing to do with the chapter heading, he only quoted what he believed fits the chapters title, for he says at the end of the section, after mentioning this narration:</p>
<p>“<em>From all of this appears the relevance of the chapter heading to the origin of this story</em>“<br />
so, al Hafidh Ibn Hajar <em>rahimahu Allah</em> understood from this hadith that the Prophet <em>sallallahu alayhi wa sallam</em> was directing the man to go ask the Imam, during that time (Umar <em>radiyallahu anhu</em>), to do istisqa’ for them.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Hafidh <strong>Ibn Kathir</strong> –<em>rahimahu Allah</em>-:<br />
He sites it in his book “<em>al Bidayah wan Nihaya </em>” (vol7 pg.104 <em>), </em>in which he mentions some narrations, right before he mentions Malik ad Dar’s narration, which explain the meaning of the narration.<br />
The narrations before it are by Sayf Ibn Umar, and in them is the mentioning of Umar radiyallahu anhu, after hearing about the man’s dream (who is said to be Bilal al Harith), asking the people on the minbar if they have seen anything bad from him, and then he tells them about the dream that Bilal saw, so they told him:</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">“Bilal has spoken the truth, <strong>so make istiqatha (seek or ask for help) to Allah</strong>, then the Muslims”. So then Umar radiyallahu anhu does istisqa’ through al Abbas radiyallahu anhu.<br />
In the second narration, they said “he found you slow in doing istisqa’, so <strong>do istisqa’ for us</strong> “, so he did.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">(Note: these 2 narrations could be weak, but the point is that al Hafidh Ibn Kathir rahimahu Allah mentioned them right before the narration of Malik, showing what it is about, which shows what he understood it to mean, same as what Ibn Hajar (r A) understood from it).</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Ala’ ad Deen Ali al Mutaqi al Hindi al Burhan Furi</strong> (d. 975) in his book <em>“Kanz al Ummal“:<strong><br />
</strong></em>He sites it in chapter of (<strong>salat al Istisqa’ – prayer for rain</strong>),</p>
<div>
<p>and what the man did at the grave of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was asking for dua, not istisqa’ prayer, and salat al Istisqa’ was done by Umar radiyallahu anhu, when he made tawassul through Al Abbas radiyallahu anhu, thus both narrations are connected to each other, as shown in the previous points.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> That the story of Malik al Dar’s narration is connected to the hadith about Umar’s tawassul through al Abbas, all leading to doing istisqa’ through the living, and not through the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam after his death.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Narrations with an addition.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">There are narrations of the same story, with an addition, if they are authentic (the authenticiy is not known to me so far), they would give very strong support to the understanding of the above scholars.<br />
and it also shows what the scholars who sited the narrations believed the narration to mean.<em><br />
<strong><br />
</strong></em>Imam Ibn Abd al Bar al Maliki in his book “al Isti’ab fi ma’rifat al As-hab”:<em><strong><br />
</strong><br />
</em>The people suffered a drought during the time of ‘Umar (his khilafah), whereupon a man came to the grave of the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) and said:”O Messenger of Allah, ask for rain for your Community, for verily they have but perished,” after which the Prophet appeared to him in a dream and told him: “Go to ‘Umar <strong>and tell him to do istisqa’ (ask Allah for rain) for the people,</strong> and that they will be watered. And tell him: You must be clever, you must be clever!” So, the man went and told ‘Umar, and Umar cried and said “O my Lord, I spare no effort except in what escapes my power!” <em><br />
</em><br />
Ahmad Abdullah at Tabari (d. 694 ) in his book “ar Riyadh an Nadhirah fi Manaqib al Ashara”:Anas bin Malik narrated:<br />
The people suffered drought during Umar’s time, whereupon a man came to teh grave of the Prophet (Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam), and said: “O Messenger of Allah, ask for rain for your community, for verily they have but perished,”, he said so the Messenger of Allah came to him in a dream and told him “Go to ‘Umar <strong>then tell him to do istisqa’ (ask Allah for rain) for the people,</strong> and that they will be watered. And tell him: You must be clever, you must be clever!” So, the man went and told ‘Umar, and Umar cried and said “O my Lord, I spare no effort except in what escapes my power!”. narrated by al Baghawi in al fada’il and Abu Umar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Logical Arguments</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The ones who use this hadith for this type of tawassul say that Umar radiyallahu anhu did not rebuke the man who did istisqa’ at the grave.<br />
<strong>Reply</strong>: There is no clear evidence in the hadith indicating that the man told Umar of him going to the grave, but clearly he did tell him of the dream, telling him the message of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.<br />
so to say that he told him about his istisqa’ at the grave is an assumption, and we can’t use assumptions as evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>It didn’t rain until after Umar radiyallahu anhu made istisqa’ by al Abbas radiyallahu anhum</strong>.<br />
If the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was capable or had permission to do du’aa to Allah after his death, when asked by others, then it would have rained immediately after the man asked the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam at his grave, but it didn’t until after Umar’s istisqa’ through the duaa of Al Abbas radiyallahu anhu.<br />
This shows that the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was guiding the man to ask the Umar to do istisqa’ and not him, hinting to Umar by saying to him “<strong>be clever!</strong>“, and when Umar did istisqa’ by al Abbas (radiyallahu anhuma) it immediately rained..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If going to the grave of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to ask him to make duaa to Allah was permissable, Umar radiyallahu anhu would have done that when wanting to do istisqa’ instead of doing it through the uncle of the Messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, who was alive, and Umar’s (r.a) saying “<strong>we used to</strong> make tawassul through your Prophet’s duaa, and now we do tawassul through the uncle of your Prophet…”, indicates that they don’t make tawassul through the Prophet’s (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) duaa after his death, and only when he was alive, or else <strong>why would he say “we used to”</strong>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If what the man did (wether it was Bilal ibn al Harith radiyallahu anhu or someone else) was correct\permissable, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Why didn’t any of the scholars I quoted mention the narration in a chapter titled (tawassul by the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) or some title indicating that the narration is EVIDENCE for permissibility of that type of tawassul?<br />
Instead they title the chapter in which the narration is in (salat al istisqa’- the man didn’t do salat al Istisqa’ at the grave, only did duaa, while Umar rA did salat al istisqa) , (The people asking the Imam to do istisqa’ in times of drought),  wouldn’t it be more important to point out the permissibility of tawassul through the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam after his death, which is stronger than doing tawassul through the righteous and ahl al bayt?<br />
Instead they ignored that part , <strong>showing no importance to it at all</strong>.<br />
So if they believed that the narration indicates the permissibility of such a tawassul, why didn’t they at least <strong>hint</strong> to it by the chapter title or a comment like they did to show that it meant to do intercession through saliheen and ahl al bayt, and ask the imam to do istisqa?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">What was the point of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam telling Umar r.A “<strong>be clever</strong>“?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If the man told Umar that he went to the grave, and then told him about the dream, why would Umar do salat al istisqa’ when the man already asked the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to do istisqa’ and he told him that they will be watered?<br />
<strong>Isn’t the istisqa’ of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam sufficient?<br />
</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If the action of the man was correct (to ask the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to do istisqa), and the Prophet S.A.W answered his request, then why didn’t it rain immediately after the dream, and instead came down immediately after al Abbas’s (radiyallahu anhu) duaa?<br />
<strong>Who is higher in status, the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam or his uncle?</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<span style="color: #000000">1) The dunya is not a cosy and relaxing place for the Mu&#8217;min, rather it is a prison and death is the news of happiness and comfort. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) The dunya is the house of difficulties and suffering. The cure for it is the belief in Allah, the Messengers (Alayhimusalam) and the hereafter.
