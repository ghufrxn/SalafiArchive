<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Alhamdullilahi Rabbil A’lamīn, Waṣalatu Wasalam Ala Rasūlillahil Karīm,  Wa, Ba’d</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a very brief response to the video of Muḥammad Yāsir Ḥanafī Deobandī Ashʿarī Maturidī Jahmī. His sidekick, Ibn Nūr al-Shantī and some say he is this ‘Usamah Mutakkin,’ who is currently under hormone therapy as is his Shaikh Yāsir, claimed why did we chose another piece to respond to and why not this issue of where Allāh is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So in order to show the readers more examples of their intellectual Jahmite fraud, we decided to compile this short piece. It was compiled in late October and early November 2015 but due to other commitments it is being released now.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We pray this benefits the readers and also shows the avid and sincere reader the true and actual reality of these youtube and intellectual jahmite fraudsters. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These immature individuals spend most of their time causing mischief on the internet under numerous pseudonyms, guising themselves as ‘Salafis.’ This is indeed deception and immaturity from these individuals. Oh Ahl as-Sunnah beware of these people who pretend and take on the garb of Salafiyyah with the intent of causing chaos and corruption and diluting the truth in order to take you away from the worship of Allāh and the correct Islamic Creed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We pray for their guidance and May the Mighty and Majestic, who is above the Seven heavens and rises over his Throne, Guide them, Amīn.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The lies and deception of Shaikh&#8217; Yāsir Ḥanafī Deobandī Ashʿarī Maturudī Jahmī in his video &#8216;Imām Abū Ḥanīfah on Where Is Allāh&#8217;? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ashʿarī Deobandī Jaḥmī ‘shake’ Yāsir Ḥanafī has a short you tube video clip where he discusses a saying of Abū Hanīfah about where Allah is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The saying in question is that which is reported from Muṭʿe al-Balkhī that Abū Ḥanīfah is essence said that the one who does not know if the throne of Allah is in the heavens or the earth is a disbeliever.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The neo neo Ashʿarī has throughout his video clip attempted to deceive the listener by interchanging the words of Allāh being &#8216;above&#8217; with &#8216;sitting&#8217; on his throne. By doing this he has denied the &#8216;highness&#8217; and &#8216;aboveness&#8217; of Allāh upon his throne and instead justified his stance by saying that to say Allāh is High or above necessitates that he is like his creation or is in a direction and in a place thus becoming a body/jism.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In reality all he has tried to do is to persuade the listener that Allāh is not &#8216;above&#8217; his throne as this in his neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī twisted mind would necessitate that we are making Allāh like his creation and confining him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In doing this he has opposed the Salaf and instead resembled his Ashʿarī and Jahmī forefathers and contemporary Deobandīs with there belief of Wahdah tul-Wajūd. Below is a very brief critique of his words and a detailed book on this topic in response to his misguidance is being authored as we write this. Allah&#8217;s aid is sought.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī analyses this saying and by doing so make its apparent that he rejects Allah being above his throne, upon it&#8217;s apparent meaning, as was held by the Salaf. It is this erroneous belief that we critique alongside his &#8216;Sharḥ&#8217; of his Imams saying.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He says at 5:58 onwards in his recording that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;In Al Wasiyyah, Imam Abū Ḥanīfah says Allah is free from place and direction&#8221;. Then If Allah is sitting on the arsh then where was he before creating the Arsh?&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even if it were authentic it is a support against you rather than for you as detailed below from Ṭaḥāwīs words.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is clear that Yāsirs intended meaning by utilising this quote as evidence is to negate Allah being &#8216;high and above&#8217; his throne because this according to him would confine Allah to a &#8216;direction&#8217; of being high and he is saying, as all directions are created, we are therefore saying Allah is surrounded by his creation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to him it would also confine Allāh to a &#8216;place&#8217; and places are also all created. Therefore, we would be making Allah a part of the creation and resembling him to created matter [i,e, the direction and place of above/high] when we say &#8216;ALLAH IS<em> ABOVE </em>THE THRONE&#8217;. This is a futile claim and analogy by the neo neo Ashʿarī.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, no doubt such thinking and philosophy is erroneous according to the ʿAqīdah of the Salaf of this Ummah and also by way of sound aql. In fact, it is in opposition to what his own Imam Ṭaḥāwī has discussed, see below. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note, the saying of Shaykh Abdul-Qādir al-Jīlānī (d. 561H) who said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will abide forever.&#8221; (Ar-Rahman 55:26-27). <em>And He is in the direction of above (al-ʿUluww), ascended over His Throne, </em>possessing the dominion, His knowledge encompassing [all] the things. &#8220;To Him ascends the goodly word and the righteous action raises it (the goodly word).&#8221; [Fāṭir 35:10]. &#8220;He arranges (every) affair from the heavens to the earth, then it (affair) will go up to Him, in one Day, the space whereof is a thousand years of your reckoning.&#8221; [Sajdah 32:5]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Fact, Shaykh al-Jīlānī went onto mention that from amongst the distinguishing signs of the astray <em>Jahmīyyah</em> sect is that they say</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;Allāh does not have an ʿArsh (Throne) and nor a Kursī and [that] He is not above the Throne.&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A note of caution we do not ourselves use terms such as &#8216;direction&#8217; for Allah as this was not used by the Salaf in the first generations and is from generalised wording. Those that have used it in earlier times mostly did so to counter the warped understanding of the mutakalimūn who invented new terms in relation to the Ṣifāt of Allah and this is how it should be understood.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī to ponder on the words of Imām Ṭaḥāwī so maybe then he will understand how Allah being &#8216;above&#8217; his throne is not meaning that he is in a created direction or encompassed by his creation.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Saying of at-Ṭaḥāwī Concerning the use of &#8216;direction&#8217; there occurs in ʿAqīdah al-Ṭaḥāwīyyah, the saying of Imām at-Ṭaḥāwī (rahimahullaah): </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;The six directions do not enclose, contain, encompass, surround Him as [is the case with] all of the created things&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And we have used a number of English equivalents (underlined) for the verb &#8220;hawa, yahwi&#8221; (in the statement, &#8220;tahwihi&#8221;) so that the meaning is clear. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This statement has been used by the Ash&#8217;aris in order to impute their Jahmī belief, that Allāh is &#8220;neither within the creation nor outside of it&#8221; to Imām at- Ṭaḥāwī (Rahimahullāh) &#8211; free is he of them and they of him. And this creed of theirs, they learned it and acquired it from the Philosophers such as Ibn Sina (d. 429H) and the Jahmīyyah and the Muʿtazilah who are the true and real authors of this statement and creed. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for at- Ṭaḥāwī, then he was a Sunni and a follower of the Salaf, and this statement of the Imām &#8211; which is the subject of this article, along with his statements regarding the Arsh (Throne) are a decisive refutation of these Jahmites Walillahil-ḥamd. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we say: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>POINT 1: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>BEWARE OF THE TRANSLATIONS THAT SUPPORT THE DĪN OF THE JAHMITES! </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The above statement of Imām at- Ṭaḥāwī has been translated by some in a manner that allows the Jahmites to justify their falsehood that Allāh is not above all of creation, above His Throne (as is confirmed by at- Ṭaḥāwī elsewhere in his own words &#8211; see further below). So from these translations: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;The six directions do not contain Him &#8211; these are attributed to all created things&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first half is correct, but the second half is incorrect and it is a lie upon Imām at-Ṭaḥāwī to claim that this meaning of the second half, which is provided in English in such a way, is the very same meaning as that intended and contained in at-Ṭaḥāwī original. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather, the meaning of the statement of at-Ṭaḥāwī is accurately represented in English &#8211; if we just paraphrase our translation above a little: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The six directions do not enclose, encompass, contain, surround Him, as they enclose, encompass, contain, surround all of the created things &#8211; meaning that nothing encloses, encompasses, surrounds or contains Him at all. However, the Jahmī-inducing translation is: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;The six directions do not contain Him &#8211; these are attributed to all created things&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And there is a difference between saying: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Something is &#8220;surrounded, enclosed, encompassed&#8221; by the six directions (collectively) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And between saying: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;The six directions are attributed to all created things (which can leave open the meaning that six directions collectively or individually are attributed only to created things)&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The particular translation allows them to negate what Allāh has affirmed in the Book and in the Prophetic Sunnah and upon the tongues of the Companions, the Tābiʿīn and the entirety of the early Salaf, upon Ijmaʿ, that Allāh Himself s above the Heaven, above the Throne &#8211; because this equals the attribution of a direction (from amongst the directions) to them, the Mutakallimūn &#8211; and direction necessitates makān (place) and place necessitates jismīyyah. So beware, and beware again of translations that come from the Jahmites or translations that come from those who are heedless of the snares of the Jahmites! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>POINT 2: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE SAYING OF AT-TAHAAWI IS A REFUTATION OF THE JAHMITES AND DENIERS OF AL-ULUWW SO PAY HEED O YĀSIR AL-JAHMĪ! </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this is made apparently and abundantly clear by the following four points: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[A] THE UNIVERSE IS FINITE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You cannot escape from affirming that this universe is finite, meaning that it must stop somewhere and have an outer limit or boundary, otherwise it is pure atheism to claim the universe is infinite, and anyone saying such a thing has spoken with plain manifest kufr. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[B] THE NOTION OF SIX DIRECTIONS EXISTS ONLY WITHIN THE CREATION: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As the above cannot be denied then the notion of the six directions only applies to what is within the boundaries of the said universe, and the six directions are all relative to each other as it relates to whatever is within the boundaries of the universe. <em>And if anyone claims that the notion of six directions exists outside of the universe as it exists within the universe, then he has claimed that the universe is actually infinite and does not stop at any point, and he has spoken with plain manifest kufr</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this is true upon the basis of the language of the Mutakallimīn themselves, because to them &#8220;direction (jiḥah) necessitate place (makān) and place necessitates something being a body (jismiyyah)&#8221; &#8211; so if the Mutakallimūn claim the notion of six directions exists outside of the universe, they have spoken with an infinite universe.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is because if the notion of six directions exists outside the boundaries of the universe, then those six directions can only be considered directions if they are in turn surrounded by six directions and so on &#8211; and so you have to go to infinity to maintain that claim, and this is pure atheism. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is impossible for you to affirm that the creation is finite and at the same time claim the six directions that exist within it and which are relative to each other, also exist outside of the creation. <em>So either you affirm the creation is finite or you affirm it is infinite.</em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[C] ALLĀH HAS A TRUE AND REAL EXISTENCE OUTSIDE OF THE MIND, OUTSIDE OF THE CREATION: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Following on from the above you cannot escape from affirming that Allāh exists outside of the mind, outside of this universe with a true and real existence and this true and real existence is signified by an essence (Dhaat) that has a ḥaqīqah (a true existing reality that is unknown and unfathomable to us), and that this essence is established by itself (al-qā&#8217;imu bi nafsīhi) and described with attributes (Ṣifāt). If you do not affirm this, you have not affirmed a true and real existence for Allāh, and this again is kufr. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[D] ALLĀH IS ABOVE HIS CREATION BY TEXTUAL EVIDENCE AND UNANIMOUS CONSENSUS OF THE SALAF: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And once we have established the above three points &#8211; the game is already over and the fraud is demolished &#8211; that&#8217;s it. Because this leads us to the fourth point which is that in light of the above, this essence is not contained by the six directions as that is impossible, as has preceded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And by the textual ruling of the Book and the Sunnah, the relationship between the creator and the created is that Allāh is above His creation, and this establishes that there are only two true and real directions in reality, above (fawq) and below (taht) &#8211; as at-Ṭaḥāwī confirms a little later. And the sound intellect agrees with the authentic text, so all of what has been mentioned above reconciles with and agrees with and conforms to what has come in the revealed texts. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Note</strong><strong>:</strong> Direction is not an existing thing in and of itself, it simply defines the relationship between two existing entities, and Allāh in His Book has stated both explicitly and implicitly in over 1000 places in His Book, that He is above His creation &#8211; and what the Kalāmists, Aristotelian Meta physicists, and Philosophers speak of regarding &#8220;direction&#8221; (jiḥah) and &#8220;place&#8221; (makān) and the metaphysical necessities they impose through them, as it relates to what is within the bounds of the universe, cannot and does not apply to Allāh. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, Allāh sent Books and Messengers to guide us how to believe in Him and He did not leave it to the disposal of the language and terminology of the atheist and those who thought they could argue for Allāh&#8217;s existence through it, such as Jahm bin Ṣafwān [ex. 128H] and the Jahmīyyah, Abū al-Hudhayl al-Allāf [d. 235] and the Mu&#8217;tazilah, and Abū Bakr al-Baqillāni [d. 403H] and the Ashʿarīyyah.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we say to the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī that when he says, <em>&#8220;Allāh does not exist in a place&#8221; &#8220;Allāh exists without place&#8221;, </em>&#8220;<em>Allāh is not encompassed by directions&#8221;</em> and so on, all of that is just meaningless sophistry &#8211; it actually has no meaning to it at all. It is empty, fruitless, meaningless speech and it is not even applicable, because we have already established that the notion of six directions does not exist outside of the creation &#8211; upon the language of the Mutakallimīn themselves &#8211; otherwise they must affirm the universe is infinite which is kufr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They can&#8217;t do that. As we have established that it is impossible for Allāh to be encompassed by the six directions as all created things are, when they make these statements &#8220;Allāh is not in a location&#8221; and so on, its talk which has no real meaning.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In reality your words show that your real goal is to deny there is a Lord above the heaven and a deity above the Throne. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So it is clear that you are upon a path which is intended to reject the clear explicit texts in the Book and the Sunnah and the ijmāʿ of the Salaf that &#8220;Allāh is above His Throne&#8221;, but you can&#8217;t do that directly, otherwise all people will come to know of your falsehood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this is why you cannot quote from any of the Salaf prior to 300H who denied that Allāh Himself, is above the Throne, rather you can only quote the latecomers, many of whom, whilst no doubt Scholars in their own right, were affected and influenced by the language of the Mutakallimīn<em>. </em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus each of the above [four] points are undeniable. They cannot be opposed, denied, rejected, refuted. You can&#8217;t run. And you can&#8217;t make excuses O Yāsir Jahmī Ashʿarī Deobandī. Try it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask this neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī to establish the following if he is truthful in his claims: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1]</strong> That the universe is infinite. It can&#8217;t be done. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2]</strong> That six directions do exist outside of the universe as they exist within it. It can&#8217;t be done with your metaphysical language &#8211; otherwise you&#8217;ve spoken with an infinite universe. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[3]</strong> That Allāh has no true and real existence outside of the mind, outside of the universe. It can&#8217;t be done. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[4]</strong> That if Allāh exists outside of the mind and outside of the universe He must be contained by six directions. It can&#8217;t be done unless you can argue in favor of the points that have preceded. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[5]</strong> That the texts of the Book and the Sunnah as well as the innate instinct (fitrah) of people, all combined, do not amount to the saying that &#8220;Allāh is above His creation&#8221;. It can&#8217;t be done either. Even al-Juwaīnī [d. 478H] did not dispute that, rather this is what led him to bewilderment and confusion at the end of his life. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[6]</strong> Or that there are any Scholars from the Salaf from before 300H (or even 400H if we are generous) who held Allāh is not above the Throne, or who held that Allāh is &#8220;neither within the universe nor outside of it&#8221; which was given currency by kāfirs like Ibn Sina [d. 429H]. It can&#8217;t be done. The only people you are going to find are the Jahmīyyah and Muʿtazilah! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> In light of the above, the saying of at-Ṭaḥāwī (rahimahullaah): </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;The six directions do not enclose, contain, encompass, surround Him as [is the case with] all of the created things&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is a decisive, definitive proof for Allāh&#8217;s Uluww, since it establishes He is not contained by the creation (as the notion of six directions only exists within the creation and it is all relative), and this establishes that He is unequivocally outside the creation, separate and distinct from it, outside of the confines of created bodies that are encompassed by the six directions on account of them being from within the creation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>POINT 3: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ALLAHS CREATION IS INCAPABLE OF ENCOMPASSING HIM. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, at-Ṭaḥāwī also said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And He has rendered incapable His creation of encompassing Him </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning it is impossible for His creation to encompass Him in this life or the next. And this means that they cannot encompass Him in knowledge in this life, for they only know of Him what He has revealed to them. And they cannot encompass Him with their vision in the Hereafter (when the Believers will see Him), because they will see Him but cannot encompass Him with their seeing. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in this saying of at-Ṭaḥāwī is also an indication that the six directions cannot encompass Him either, as has preceded earlier on, as the six directions are notions within the universe, and as this is the case, then Allāh is above His Throne, above His creation, free of need of them, and they are in need of Him, and it is impossible for the creation to encompass Him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whether that is in the sense of knowledge or in the sense of what the Mutakallimīn speak of in terms of &#8220;jiḥah (direction)&#8221; and &#8220;makān (place)&#8221;, because all of that is below Him, and He is above all things, as at-Ṭaḥāwī said &#8211; and there are only two true and real directions, as it relates to Allāh and His creation, above and below.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Considering the words of Ṭaḥāwī and the deductions thereof we say to the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī who tried to hide behind Imam Abū Ḥanīfahs words in al-Waṣīyyah that <em>even if authentic they are are an evidence against you rather than for you </em>as to say he is free from place and direction must be understood with the contextual background of Allāh being outside of his creation and the six directions not existing outside the universe, thus not having the capability of encompassing him. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">At 7:38 he quotes a report in Bukhārī that &#8220;Allah was and there was nothing other than him&#8221;. He then says &#8216;so where was Allah when there was no throne?&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say to this ignorant one that, it amazes us how his Ashʿarī Jahmee forefathers and even Deobandīs in modern days [including the like of the sūfīs GF Haddād, Hamza Yūsuf, al-Kawtharī, Ghumārī etc] called it a vile innovation and in some places kufr to ask &#8216;where is Allāh&#8217;? in order to refute the Salafīs and Ḥadīth of the Slave girl. Yet, he asks a question such as this? This is no doubt a hypocritical stance.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We also say that, we as Muslims all believe Allah is al-Awwal, before everything, and that his throne is part of his glorious creation. We do not delve into analogy and reasoning with our weak minds in explaining this. To ask such a question as this neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī has done then this is what eventually led some of the earlier philosophers such as Ibn Sina to apostate as they eventually ended questioning the being and existence of Allah, Na’ūzubillāh.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So in answer to your question we say, the Salaf clearly understood by Allah&#8217;s names al-Awwal, al-Ākhir, adh-Dhāhir, al-Bāṭin that they showed he was before everything and is closest to everything with his knowledge whilst he is above his Throne.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Baihaqī narrates with his isnād from Muqātil bin Hayyān, [that] he said:  It has reached us &#8211; and Allāh knows best &#8211; regarding His, the Most High&#8217;s saying, &#8220;He is al-Awwal and al-Ākhir&#8230;&#8221;, that He is the first, before every thing and He is the Last, after everything, and adh-Dhāhir, above everything, and al-Bāṭin, closest to everything, and his closeness (qurb) is with His knowledge and<em> He is above </em>the Throne. This Muqātil is &#8220;Thiqah (trustworthy)&#8221;, and an Imām, a contemporary of al-Awzā’ī, and he is not &#8220;Ibn Sulaymān&#8221; for that one is a &#8220;mubdati&#8217; (innovator)&#8221; and he is not trustworthy.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī via his speech has alluded that in order for Allah to be &#8216;high/above&#8217; he must have a throne and this leads him to the conclusion that when there was no throne he [Allah] cannot have been high/above. We will not give a hukm about whether this kalām is Kufr, Bidʿah etc we will leave you to decide this for yourself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sufficient it is to say that you have through your speech made Allah&#8217;s attribute of him being high and above dependent upon his creation, that is is his throne being present!! In fact, even after his throne was created you still seek to deny that he was above it.  Aū’zubillāh.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We remind you to read the speech of Allah, The Quran, where Allah says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;And whoever strives only strives for [the benefit of] himself. Indeed, Allah is free from need of the worlds.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><strong>[4]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So know O Jahmī that you should know that Allah&#8217;s attributes are not in need of anything as you suggest.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Instead what you have uttered is just pure ignorance and you use logic to explain away the texts of the book and sunnah. This is the way of the philosophers and true anthropomorphist’s who used there intellect and reasoning’s to eventually lead to the conclusion that Allah is above nothing thus rejecting his being above the throne. The neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī is traversing a path like his forefathers from amongst the Jahmīs and Ashʿarīs some of which eventually ended up describing Allah with &#8216;nothingness&#8217; hence rejecting him.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We also ask you to consider the saying of Ibn Abbās (RaḍhiAllāhu ʿAnhu) wherein he said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Ḥasan bin Uthmān informed us, saying: ʿAlī bin Muḥammad bin az-Zubayr informed us, saying: Ibrāhīm bin Abil-Anbas narrated to us, saying: Yaʿla bin Ubayd narrated to us from Sufyān from Abū Hāshim from Mujāhid, who said: It was said to Ibn ʿAbbās, &#8220;There are some people who speak with [the rejection] of al-Qadr!&#8221;. So he said: &#8220;They reject the Book. If I was to grab the hair of one of them, I would cut it off. Indeed Allāh the Mighty and <em>Majestic was above His Throne before He created anything, then He created the creation</em>. So He wrote whatever would happen until the Day of Judgement and indeed the people proceed upon an affair that has already been concluded.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So you can see how Ibn Abbas did not delve into ridiculous philosophy concerning Allah and rather just continued to affirm that he was above his throne without using his own logic or asking how.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, know that it is from the essence of Tawhīd to believe in Allah being above the throne and not to believe so invalidates a mans belief in Allah.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī reports in al-Sīyar,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʿAmr bin Tamīm al-Makkī said: I heard Muḥammad bin Ismāʿīl al-Tirmidhī [who] said: I heard al-Muzanī saying, &#8220;The Tawhīd of any [person] is not valid, sound until he knows that Allāh the Exalted is over His Throne, with His attributes.&#8221; I said to him, &#8220;Like what?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Hearing, seeing, knowing.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ABŪ ḤANĪFAH </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī then mentions the saying in question of Abū Ḥanīfah about the one who does not know if Allah is in the heavens or earth is a disbeliever and comments that Dhahabī mentions this saying of Abū Ḥanīfah in his al-ʿUluww and al-ʿArsh with it also being mentioned in Fiqh ul-Absaṭ of Abū Ḥanīfah from Abū Muṭʿe al-Balkhī </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">10:45 onwards he says that, &#8216;Balkhī was a murjī, innovator and jahmī from muhadithīn as in meezan ul Ei’tidal of Dhahhabi&#8217;.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">lets not forget he was also a Ḥanafī of your Madhab.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafī Deobandīs in relation to al-Balkhī pick and choose when they wish to use his narrations when it suits them, seems like a pick and mix ʿAqīdah just as we have advocated in the past, Ashʿarism and Maturidism and Allāh knows best what else. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">13:00 onwards he says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> &#8220;this narration gives impression Abū Ḥanīfah was anthrpomorphist, and also was a mujjasim, he was a person who attributed human qualities to Allāh&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The true aim of this neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī finally comes to light, that is to believe Allah is above is to liken Allah to creation.  Remember, this narration ascribed to Abū Hanīfah by his own follower al-Balkhī [let the Deobandīs sort out whether he is reliable or not as he is one of there own! We cannot be held to blame for mentioning something he himself mentions from his Imam whilst being a follower of his madhab] indicates that Allah is high above his throne and the neo Ashʿarī Deobandī has a big problem with this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In reality by negating Allah being high this neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī is saying Allah is above nothing and this was not the way of the Salaf.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note the following saying: Under the heading of Saʿīd bin ʿĀmir ad-Dabʿī, the Scholar of al-Baṣrah [d. 208H]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdur-Rahmān bin Abī Ḥātim said: My father narrated to me, saying: It was narrated to me about Saʿīd bin Āmir ad-Dabʿī, that he mentioned the Jahmīyyah and said, &#8220;Their speech is more evil than that of the Jews and Christians, for the Jews and the Christians, and the people of (other) religions, have agreed with the Muslims that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, is above the Throne. [But] they said, <em>&#8220;He is not above anything.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><strong>[7]</strong></a></em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">14:00 onwards &#8220;the correct claim from Abū Ḥanīfah is what Shaikh imam Abdus Salaam mentioned in his book Hal ur Ramuz also transmitted by Mulla Ali al-Qārī in his Sharh Fiqh al-Akbar that &#8220;Whoever says I do not know if Allah is in the heavens or earth has done KUFR&#8221;, why because this statement gives an impression that Allah has a place, and whoever believes Allah has a place is a anthropomorphist mushabih and that&#8217;s why he has done Kufr.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The huge irony is that there is very little difference between what the neo Ashʿarī denied being the saying of Abū Ḥanīfah via al-Balkhī and what he now seeks to report and explain away via Mulla ʿAli al-Qārī. This is the way of people of innovation they cannot be clear and precise in there stance or wordings, as we can see here.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once again the neo Ashʿarī Deobandī is trying to say that Allah is above &#8216;nothing&#8217; because if we believe he is &#8216;above&#8217; his throne we are giving the impression that he has a &#8216;place&#8217; and this is kufr. Auzubillāh. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We remind him once again of the sayings of the Salaf as it is clear that this neo neo Ashʿarī is saying that we are confining Allah to a place by saying he is above the throne.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In reality by describing him without his attribute of being high this neo Ashʿarī is describing him by saying that there is nothing above the heavens as who other than Allah can be above the heavens and above his throne?    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I heard Wahb bin Jarīr saying: &#8220;Beware of the opinion of Jahm, for they are trying (to say) that there is nothing above the Heaven, and this is nothing but the inspiration of Iblīs, it is nothing but kufr.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Abul-Qāsim Sulaymān bin Ahmad at-Ṭabarānī brings in ‘Kitāb us-Sunnah,’ as does al-Dhahabī in ‘Mukhtaṣar al-Uluww’ from al-ʿAbbās bin Fudayl al-Asfātī from Sulaymān bin Ḥarb who said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of Ḥammād bin Zayd [b.98H, d.179H] who said: I heard Ayūb as-Sakhtiyānī [d. 131H] when the Muʿtazilah were mentioned, he said: &#8220;The central axis of the Muʿtazilah is that they want to say there is nothing above the heaven.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And al-Dhahabi, in his ‘Mukhtaṣar al-ʿUluww’ commented on this saying, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;This isnaad is like the sun in its clarity and like a pillar in its affirmation from the head and scholar of the people of Basrah (i.e. Hammaad bin Zayd).”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These sayings of the Salaf clearly show that there is something above the heavens and that is only Allah. Yet, the Jahmīs deny this and say there is nothing above the heavens. So we ask if Allah is not &#8216;above&#8217; his throne then who other than him is the Qurān and Sunnah talking of when they say the Almighty rose over the throne? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">15:59 Ahl us-Sunnah Wal Jamaʿah we all believe in the Quranic ayat he <em>rose</em> above his throne [hand gesture of rising which is kufr according to him and from mushabih so he must repent]  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By saying this according to your own standards you have become a mujassimah, anthropomorphist. Your creed is based upon nothing but generality, confusion of speech and logic which is truly illogical as we have shown via the speech of Ṭaḥāwī above.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE CRUX OF ALL HIS SPEECH AND WHY HE NEGATES SAYING OF ABŪ ḤANĪFAH </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">At 16:38 onwards he says,  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;we believe this [istiwaa] but to interpret it that Allah is on his Arsh meaning with his being DHAAT [essence] none of the scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah have said this.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a lie upon Ahl as-Sunnah. Generally, the word &#8216;Dhāt&#8217; was used as a reaction to the philosophy of the Muʿtazilites and Ashʿarīs. Hence, terms such as this and those like &#8216;distinct from his creation&#8217; and so on were used to specify the actual ʿAqīdah of the Salaf. Nonetheless, to say as the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī has claimed we reiterate is just a pure lie upon Ahl as-Sunnah.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Below are a few sayings about the use of the word DHĀT from the salaf. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ibrāhīm Ismāʿīl bin Yaḥya bin Ismāʿīl bin ʿAmr bin Muslim al-Muzanī al-Miṣrī and he is the student of Imām al-Shāfʿī. He was born in 175H and died in 264H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This creed of al-Muzanī is taken from the printed edition of his risālah ‘Sharḥ us-Sunnah’ with Jamāl ʿĀzūn verification.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ibrāhīm Ismāʿīl bin Yaḥya bin Ismāʿīl bin ʿAmr bin Muslim al-Muzanī al-Miṣrī said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;High, over His Throne [in His Majesty, <em>with His Essence],</em> and He is close to His creation with His knowledge. His knowledge has encompassed (all) the affairs, and the preceding decree (maqdūr) has He enforced. [And He is the Generous, the Forgiving], [and] &#8220;He knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal.&#8221; [Ghāfir 40:19] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Fact, Dhahabī mentions at numerous places that the scholars of the past used the word Dhāt. He mentions: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Naṣr as-Sijzī al-Hanafī [d. 444H] said in “al-Ibānah”, “Our Imāms such as Sufyān al-Thawrī, Mālik, Ḥammād bin Salamah, Ḥammād bin Zayd, ʿAbdullāh bin al-Mubārak, al-Fuḍail bin Aʿyyāḍ, Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal, and Ishāq bin Rahawaihah, are upon agreement that Allah –Subhanahu wa Ta`ala is by His Essence (bi-ḍhatihi) above the Throne, and His Knowledge is everywhere.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also al-Ḥārith al-Muhāsibī, said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;As for His saying, &#8220;He ascended over the Throne&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;He is alQahir, above His servants&#8230;&#8221;, and &#8220;Do you feel secure that He who is over the heaven&#8230;&#8221;, and &#8220;&#8230;then they would certainly have sought out a way to the Lord of the Throne&#8230;&#8221; then these and other verses like, &#8220;To him does the goodly word ascend&#8230;&#8221;, and His saying, &#8220;Then it (the affair) will go up (yarʿuju) to Him&#8230;&#8221;, then this <em>is definitive, it necessitates that He is above the Throne, above all things, purified and absolved of entering into His creation, there is nothing from His creation hidden to Him at all. [This is] because He explained in these verses that His essence (dhātahu), with His self (bi nafsihī) is above His servants</em>, because He said, &#8220;Do you feel secure that He, Who is over (fī) the heaven, will not cause the earth to sink with you&#8230;&#8221;, meaning, [He who is] above the Throne, and the Throne is over the heaven, because whoever is above something, over the heaven, then he is [said to be] &#8220;fis-samā&#8221;, [meaning] over the heaven&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī quotes from Ibn Abī Zayd al-Qayrawānī al-Mālikī,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;And that He, the Exalted is above His Glorious Throne, with His essence (bi Dhātihi) and that He is in every place with His knowledge.&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And then comments upon this: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;And the likes of this phrase has preceded from Abū Jaʿfar Ibn Abī Shaybah and Uthmān bin Saʿīd ad-Dārimī, and likewise Yahyā bin ʿAmmār, the preacher of Sijistān, used it in his Risālah, and also the Ḥāfiẓ, Abu Nasr al-Wā&#8217;ilī al-Sijzī in his book al-Ibānah1342, for he said, &#8221; Our Imāms like Sufyān ath-Thawrī (d. 157H), Mālik (d. 179H), Ḥammād bin Salamah (d. 167H), Hammād bin Zayd (d. 179H), Sufyān bin Uyainah (d. 197H), al-Fudayl (bin ʿAyyāḍ (d. 187H), Ibn al-Mubārak (d. 181H), Ahmad (d. 241H), and Ishāq (d. 238H) are agreed that Allāh is above the Throne bi dhātihi (with His essence) and His knowledge is in every place.&#8221; And likewise Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr as will follow, and likewise the phrase of Shaikh al-Islām Abū Ismāʿīl al-Ansārī who said, &#8220;And in many diverse reports [there occurs] that Allāh is above the seventh heaven, above the Throne with His self (bi nafsihī)&#8221;. And likewise al-Hasan al-Kurjī ash-Shāfʿī who said in this poem, &#8220;Their belief is that Allāh is over the Throne with His Essence (bi dhātihī), with His knowledge of [all] the unseen&#8221;. And upon this poem is written, in the handwriting of al-Allāmah Taqī ad-Dīn bin al-Salāh, &#8220;This is the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wal Jamāʿah.&#8221; And likewise this phrase was used by Ahmad bin Thābit at-Turkī, the Ḥāfiẓ. And Shaykh Abdul Qādir al-Jīlānī, and the Muftī ʿAbd al-Azīz al-Qahītī and a group (of scholars)&#8230; And what Ibn Abī Zayd and the others meant (by this) was to distinguish between His being with us and His Being above the Throne. So He , as He said, is with us in knowledge, and that He is over the Throne, as he informed us when He said, &#8220;The Most-Merciful ascended (Istawā&#8217;) over the Throne.&#8221; And a group of the People of Knowledge spoke the aforementioned word (bi-dhatihi), as has preceded, but without doubt, to leave superfluous speech is from the better part of Islām.&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the intent of al-Dhahabī is that as the revealed texts are so apparent, manifest and clear in their meaning, that it is Allāh himself who is above the Throne, above the heavens, and this being immediately understood to anyone who understands the language of the Qurʾān and of the Arabs, without their being any doubt whatsoever in this, then the use of the phrase bi-dhātihī is superfluous and not needed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the Jahmīyyah already know the position of al-Dhahabī in that he affirms that Allāh is above the Throne, above the heavens, for he would not have compiled the book ‘al-ʿUluww’ if he did not hold this as his belief.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Dhahabī also comments upon the statement of Yaḥya bin ʿAmmār [d. 422H] who also used the phrase bi-dhātihī: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;We do not say as the Jahmiyyah say that Allāh is inside places and is merged with everything and that we do not know where He is. Rather, we say: He is, with His essence (bi dhātihī) above the Throne, and His knowledge encompasses everything.&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With the following remark, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;I say: Your saying bi dhātihī is from your kays (subtlety, intelligence), and it has a good interpretation (mahmal hasan), but there is no requirement for it because the one who interprets istawā&#8217; says that He subdued (qahara) with His essence (bi dhātihī) and that He conquered (istatwlā bi dhātihī) without any aider or assistance.&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence, it is clear Dhahabī also did not like to use the words &#8216;bi-ḍhatihi&#8217; he acknowledged this was what many of the Salaf had mentioned. He also clearly mentioned as we have said above. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We truly hope the neo Ashʿarī is paying attention to the word Ḍhāat and the Salafs use of it and can take his claim back. Or will he say that the numerous Ḥanafīs we have quoted amongst those who used this word are not Ahl as-Sunnah? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">18:58 onwards he says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dhahabī said &#8220;to Say Allah is above his throne BI-ḌHATIHI with his being there is no need to say these words [with his being] because this word with his being [ḍhāt] causes &#8220;fitnah, disturbance and trouble within people&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Here he is once again misleading the listener as he quotes from Dhahabīs Sīyar but does not give any kind of reference background about whom and why these words were said by Dhahabī. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We refer the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī to Dhahabī’s ‘Mukhtaṣar al-ʿUluww’ wherein Dhahabī explains in effect why he disapproved of the words &#8216;bi dhatihi&#8217; [with his essence] and this was because it was said by the likes of Imām Ibn Abī Zayd where he intended to refute the innovators who denied Allah being above the throne<em>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><strong>[16]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, Dhahabī said there was no need to say Bi-<u>D</u>hatihi as event they the innovators who make ta’wil of Allah being above the throne accept &#8216;he is above, meaning he conquered, bi-dhatihi with his essence&#8217;. hence, there remained no need to use the same language as them. Dhahabī says,  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;Ibn Abī Zayd and others intended to distinguish between Allāh, the Exalted being with us, and between His, the Exalted, being above the Throne. And so it just as he said, that Allāh is with us in knowledge, and that He is above the Throne where He says, &#8220;The Most Merciful ascended over the Throne&#8221; (20:5).&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the intent of al-Dhahabī is that had Ibn Abī Zayd not used this expression, he would not have been subject to hostility.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another place, al-Dhahabī says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;We have mentioned that there is no need for the phrase bi dhātihī (with His essence) and it disturbs the souls, to leave it is more befitting and Allāh knows best.&#8217;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is clear that al-Dhahabī considers it is better to leave off using this word, not because the underlying meaning intended by this phrase is false and rejected [that is Allah is above his throne] as has been imagined by the Jahmīyyah and the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask the neo Ashʿarī has he even read the books of Dhahabī and his ʿAqīdah on Allah being above his throne or is he just content in picking up a line and the showing it completely out of context? This is treachery with the Salaf and the words of Dhahabī also.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">19.20 onwards he comments on Dhahabī words by saying &#8220;and its true if I say Allah is ABOVE Sitting on his throne like this [and he shows himself sitting in his lecture chair] whats the first IMAGE that comes in your mind that nauzubillāh that Allah is SITTING on his throne like this and is sitting on his throne like this [and he touches his chair whilst sitting in his lecture chair to show the sitting].  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">we ask, why must the Ashʿarī Deobandī use his own limited knowledge and intellect in assuming that by describing Allah with being above his throne it must mean we are limiting him and likening him to creation? It is rather he who has the fikr and thought of the anthropomorphic and jumps to incorrect conclusions about Allah using his own intellect. Does the belief that Allah is above the throne lead to Tashbīh or anthropomorphisms? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we have shown throughout this response that the Salaf in the first three hundred years at least did not believe any such notion. In reality, those from the earlier generations of the Ashʿarīs and others opposed the belief of what this neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī is upon.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The views of al-Ash&#8217;ari himself regarding al-ʿUluww and al-Istiwā are also narrated from al-Ashʿarī by the likes of Ibn Fawrak and Ibn Asākir and such quotes are also collected by al-Dhahabī in ‘Mukhtaṣar al-ʿUluww.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE SAYING OF AL-ASH&#8217;ARI IN &#8220;AL-IBAANAH&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Dhahabī wrote in ‘Mukhtaṣar al-ʿUluww’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;And al-Ashʿarī said in the book of his ‘al-Ibānah Fi Usūl al-Diyānah’ in the chapter of ‘al-Istiwaa’: And if one says: What do you say regarding al-Istiwā? It is said to him: <em>&#8216;We say that Allāh is ascended over His Throne, just as He said, &#8220;ar-Rahman has ascended the Throne&#8221;, and He said, &#8220;The goodly word ascends up to Him&#8221;, and He said, &#8220;Nay, He raised him (Isā) up to Himself&#8221;, and He said, quoting from Fir&#8217;awn, &#8220;And Fir&#8217;awn said: O Haman! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways, The ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the Ilah (God) of Musa but verily, I think him to be a liar.&#8221; So he (Fir&#8217;awn) disbelieved Moses in his saying, &#8220;Indeed Allāh is above the heavens&#8221;. And He, the Mighty and Majestic said, &#8220;Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven, will not cause the earth to sink with you, then behold it shakes (as in an earthquake)? Thus, the Throne is above the heavens, and when the Throne is above the heavens, and everything that is elevated is (called) &#8220;samaa&#8221; &#8211; He did not mean when He said, &#8220;Do you feel secure that He, who is above the heaven&#8221;, all the heavens, but He intended the Throne which is the highest of the heavens. Do you not see that He mentioned the heavens, and then said, &#8220;And He placed the moon therein as a light&#8221;, and He did not intend that it (the moon) fills all of the (heavens), and that it is in all of the heavens.</em>&#8216; He [al-Ashʿarī] said: &#8216;<em>And we see all of the Muslims raising their hands &#8211; when they supplicate &#8211; towards the heaven because Allāh is ascended above the Throne which is above the heavens, and if Allāh had not been upon the Throne, they would not have raised their hands towards the Throne.</em> And [some] say amongst the Muʿtazilah, Jahmīyyah and Harūrīyyah have said: The meaning of Istawā (ascended) is Istawlā (conquered), and owned and subdued, and that He, the Exalted, is in every place, and <em>they rejected that He is above His Throne as the people of truth have </em>said. And they have tended (to the view) regarding al-Istiwā that it means &#8220;al-Qudrah&#8221; (power), and if it had been as they have said, there would have been no difference between the Throne and between the seven heavens, because He is powerful (Qādir) over everything, and the earth is a thing, so Allāh is powerful over it, and also over all the hushūsh (places where people relieve themselves) and so on, and if He was over the Throne with the meaning of &#8220;Istīlā&#8221; (conquering, subduing), then it would be permissible for it to be said: Indeed Allāh is ascended over the hushūsh and akhlīyah (places where people relieve themselves). Hence, that al-Istiwā [over the Throne] should be &#8220;al-Istīlā&#8221; is invalidated.&#8217; And he mentioned evidences from the Book and the Sunnah, and intellect besides that [which is already mentioned] And the book &#8220;al-Ibānah&#8221; is from the most famous of the [works] of authorship of Abu al-Hasan, al-Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Asākir made it well known and he relied upon it, and the Imām, Muḥyi ud-Dīn an-Nawawī made a manuscript of it with his own handwriting.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>HIS OPEN MISINTERPRETATION OF DHAHABĪS WORDS  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">20:15 He [Dhahabī] himself is saying don&#8217;t say he is above his throne with his essence dhāt why becuase saying this gives the impression that Allāh has a body, that Allah is like his makhlūq [creation], a person will fall into fitnah, it creates trouble, it creates disturbance&#8221;.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>COMMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">See what we have written above about this quote as Dhahabī is not negating Allah being above his throne but discusses the use of the words dhāt and there being no need for it as the opposers themselves affirm it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nor did Dhahabī say that such belief &#8216;gives the impression Allah has a body, Allah is like his makhlūq.&#8217; From where the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī ahs got this he must show us from the words of Dhahabī these words.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the entire Ummah knows Dhahabī stance via his books al- ʿUluww and Kitāb al-ʿArsh where he goes into great detail to confirm that Allah is above his throne. This short treatise shows throughout what Dhahabī and others have recorded from the Salaf.  Some of what Dhahabī has recorded in his ‘Mukhtaṣar al-ʿUluww’ is as follows: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū ʿUmar at-Talamankī [d. 429H] in his book al-Wuṣūl Ilā Maʿrifah al-Usūl, in two volumes: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;The Muslims from Ahl as-Sunnah are unanimously agreed that the meaning of His statement, &#8220;He is with you wherever you may be&#8221; and what is similar to that from the Qur&#8217;an is that it [refers to] His knowledge, and that Allāh, the Most High, is above the heavens with His Essence (bi dhātihi), ascended (mustawin) over His Throne however He wills&#8217;. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Ibn Abī Zayd al-Qayrawānī [d. 389H] said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;And He, the Exalted, is above His Glorious Throne, with His Essence (bi dhātihi) and He is in every place with His knowledge&#8217;. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Ibn ʿAbdul-Barr [d. 463H] after discussing the Ḥadīth of Nuzūl: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;This is an authentic Ḥadīth, none of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth have differed over its authenticity, and it contains an evidence that Allāh, the Exalted, is above the heaven, over the Throne, above the seven heavens, as has been said by the Jamaʿah and it is their proof against the Muʿtazilah, and this is more famous to the general and specific (folk) and more well-known for it to require frequent quotation &#8230;&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also From Ibn Abī Zayd al-Qayrawānī,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;&#8230;And He, the Exalted, is above His Glorious Throne, with His Essence (bi dhaatihi) and He is in every place with His knowledge&#8230;&#8217; <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And from Ibn ʿAbdul-Barr</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;&#8230; and within this (the Ḥadīth of Nuzūl) is evidence that Allāh, the Exalted, is above the heaven, over the Throne, above the seven Heavens, as has been said by the Jamaʿah, and it is their proof against the Muʿtazilah and the Jahmīyyah in their saying that Allāh is in every place and is not above the Throne&#8230;&#8217; <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this is exactly what the Salaf, past and present held, in opposition to the Jahmīyyah, Muʿtazilah, the Theologians and the Jahmite Ashʿarīs of later times, who claim that declaring Allāh to be &#8220;above the Throne&#8221; necessitates confinement and Tajsīm. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, in fact Dhahabī had great concern to establish Allah being above the throne. which raises the questions did he believe that to have the ʿAqīdah Allāh is above his throne will necessitate that he has  a body, or is confined in a direction or space thus causing fitnah? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In reply, In his last remarks in his al-ʿUluww Dhahabī states:  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, this is what the deniers of the ʿUluww (highness) of the Lord, Mighty and Majestic, have depended upon. And they turned away from the requirement of the Book, the Sunnah, the sayings of the Salaf and the innate dispositions of the whole of creation. What they claim to be necessitated (from affirming Allāh&#8217;s highness) is only applicable to created bodies. Yet there is nothing like Allāh and the necessities arising from the clear and evident texts (of the Book and the Sunnah) are also true. However, we do not make use of any expression except one that comes through a narration. In addition to this we say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not accept that the Creator&#8217;s being upon His Throne and above the heavens, necessitates that He is confined (in space) and in a direction, since whatever is below the Throne is said to be confined (in space) and in direction. However, what is above the Throne is not like that. And Allāh is above the Throne as the very first generation are unanimously agreed upon and as the Imāms after them have quoted from them. They said this in refutation of the Jahmiyyah, those who said that He is in every place seeking as a proof His saying, &#8216;And He is with you&#8230;&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So these are the two sayings which were present in the time of the Tābiʿīn and their successors who came after them. And they are the two sayings that can be understood in the statement.  As for the third saying which arose later which is that &#8220;Allāh the Most High is not in any of the places, nor outside of them, nor above His Throne, not attached (merged) with His creation, nor separate from it, nor is His essence (Dhāt) confined in space, nor is He separate and distinct from His creation, nor is He in any of the directions, nor is He exempt from of any of the directions, and nor this and nor that.&#8221; then this is something that cannot be comprehended nor understood, along with the fact that within it is opposition to the verses (of the Book) and the narrations (from the Salaf). Therefore flee with your religion and beware of the opinions of the Mutakallimūn (Theologians).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Believe in Allāh and what has come from Him upon the desired intent of Allāh, then submit your affair to Him and there is no power nor movement except by Allāh. The book is completed and all praise is to Allāh alone.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Subhānallāh. It is as if Dhahabī was answering the deviant claims of the forefathers of this neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī. How he can now hide behind the cloak of Dhahabī is beyond us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, is the way of Ahl al-Bidʿah exposed, they are not able to establish their doctrines through revealed texts upon the understanding of the Righteous Salaf or of the Imāms of the Muslims in the first four centuries after hijrah (before 400H), and have to resort to twisting the sayings of the Scholars, lying upon them and trying to deceive the people at large. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our final words to the neo neo Ashʿarī Deobandī is to repent to Allah for his incorrect ʿAqīdah and stop corrupting the ʿAqīdah of the Muslims for verily a day will be upon us when we shall all be before our Lord answering for our actions. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Last Month, Yusuf Engineer asked the Dajjal Kazzab, Zulfiker Memon to respond to some false and absurd allegations of Muḥammad Yāsir al-Ḥanafī. These allegations were nothing but profanities, wishful thinking and an awful attempt to confuse the people with regards to the pristine and overwhelming history of the Salafīs and the Ahlul Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Dajjal Kazzab Zulfiker Memon was too busy with other “extra curriulcum activites”, he asked Yusuf Engineer to refer the matter to Abū Ḥibbān and Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī which led to the 2 part answer on the website. <strong>[edited]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Low and behold, another new and totally unknown Ḥanafī apologist going by the alias Ibn Nūr al-Shantī, desperately scampered in the defence of Muḥammad Yāsir al-Ḥanafī who was no where to be found except that he may have flapped it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What follows is a brief and quick response to the vivid imagination, deficient knowledge, distortions and total ignorance of the understanding of the scholars of their own madhab, of none other than the miskīn Ibn Nūr al-Shantī and the one who was nowhere to seen, Muḥammad Yāsir al-Ḥanafī by the brothers, Abū Ḥibbān and Abū Khuzaimah Ansārī.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Birmingham, England.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>In the name of Allah The Most Beneficent and The Most Merciful. Praise and salutations be upon His final messenger, his noble companions and his pure family.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>RED</strong> = Ibn Nūr al-Shantī’s words</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>BLACK</strong> = Our response</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A dear friend, Shaykh Mohammad Yasir al-Hanafi recently shared a few of his many thoughts regarding the Salafi sect of the modern era on social media. In this post, he commented upon the false claims of this sect and demonstrated that although they attach themselves to the noble salaf in name, they are in no real terms attached to them. Rather, we say as we have been saying for some time now, that they should rightly be named pseudo-salafis. Within his post Shaykh Mohammad Yasir al-Hanafi made a point that the so called salafis of this age, who claim to be the saved sect known as Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah, are in actual fact a modern reformist movement which cannot trace its origins beyond a hundred years. It was upon this point that two crass, insults to Islamic scholarship by the names, Abu Hibban and Abu Khuzaimah whose real names are Kamran Malik and Imran Masoom, began spewing putrid lies and confusions in reply to my noble friend. These two dimwits are well known to us. A simple internet search shows that they have already been the sorry victims of a Shaykh known as Dr. Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed (hafizahullah) numerous times.2  In an attempt to defend their sect, they twisted and misrepresented many statements of the scholars of the past as well as presenting red-herrings to prove that their ilk existed at least more than a hundred years ago. They took the statements of the Imams regarding the pious salaf and those who adhered to their methodology, only to distort them to further their claims. Although they are not worthy of being responded to, for the sake of saving the general masses from the confusions they have presented, below I have clarified some issues and demonstrated; their lack of intellectual capacity, their misrepresentations, contradictions and even an example of them tampering with the words of the scholars of the past!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Well well well, it first must be said it seems like Muḥammad Yāsir al-Ḥanafī has flapped his wings all the way back to deoband and sent another new unknown “intellectually” capable representative and “noble friend” who is another new kid on the block, Ibn Nūr al-Shantī who is not only new but also has very friendly personality. We will look at his demonstrations and his intellectual capacity. Furthermore, using derogatory language will not really change the course of the discussion or the true reality, historical facts and digressive tactics. So this type of speech is nothing but a clear example of their desperation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The response is so poor which again is not surprising as the reader can gauge from the amateur title and this alone essentially seals the credibility this poor and desperate attempt to conjure up an answer, weak and feeble as it is. As such we have devised an equal and appropriate title in order for him to have a reality check.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Nūr al-Shantī being another one of the numerous deceptive alias they use and the people know all the previous alias they have been using, whereas we have always responded in the same way for years, constantly changing their names and alias which is yet another prime example and elucidation of their weakness and their inability to stand their ground, utterly shameful and embarrassing to say the least.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Also a big JazākAllāh Khair for the first time admitting their association with the deobandi scholars and their abhorrent ‘Aqīdah, more on this to follow.         </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Just a brief recap with added benefit about whether the Ahlul Ḥadīth/Salafīs are no more than a 100 years old.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Firstly, there is no basis amongst the scholars past and present to say that the Ahlul Ḥadīth or Salafīs are new movement which cannot be traced more than a hundred years back. Over a thousand years back Aḥmad Ibn Ḥanbal has said <em>“According to us the people of ḥadīth are those who act upon ḥadīth”</em> [Khatīb, al-Jām’e]. (do you want to even give you references for these well known quotes)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Over 700 years back Imām Ibn Taymīyyah has further expanded on this saying <em>“Ahlul Ḥadīth are not merely those who narrated, recorded and reported ḥadīth but also those who learnt, understood and acted upon ḥadīth”</em> [al-Majmū’]. In later times, Imām Suyūtī acknowledged that <em>“There is no greater status for the Ahlul Ḥadīth seeing that they have no other Imām save Muḥammad(</em><em>ﷺ</em><em>)” </em>[ar-Radd A’la Min Akhlad].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, a revered Imam of the deobandīs Idrīs Khandhelwī said <em>“All the Ṣahāba were Ahlul Ḥadīth” </em>[Ijtihād wat Taqlīd]. So was he mistaken when he wrote this? Why did he not say they were all deobandī or Ḥanafī? Were the Ṣahāba or the Tabi’īn Ḥanafī and if not what were they in ‘Aqīdah and furu?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of the above the Ahlul Ḥadīth have been around for over 100 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Secondly, the pillars of the dīn are built upon ikhlās. Indeed no action is accepted without sincerity as is evidenced by all the past and present books of the muhadithīn. bearing this in mind, we advise our brothers to stop hurling insults and abuse as if they are truly seeking the truth their abuse and sinning will act as a barrier.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thirdly, As for calling us dimwits etc then we can call you far worse but this would not benefit anyone, especially those who are following your attempted response to us and our response thereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, if you would like to hear from us the &#8216;deception&#8217; the ḥanafī and Deobandī scholars have committed in the dīn and it&#8217;s texts then please let us know we will write a short treatise on it especially for Oh young brothers??</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You apply mention the refutation of the “Shaikh,” seriously is there any shame left brothers, just because the “Shaikh” does not post under this pseudonym there is no denial these same individuals go around posting under all sorts of names and and now aptly praise each other, very shameful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Oh by the way are you referring to this “shaikh,” the self styled shaikh and his brothers go around posting under pseudonyms and praise him!!!! What class and men.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you so called “shaikh” had any decent knowledge he would have by now refuted, <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.asharis.com">www.asharis.com</a> and <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.maturidis.com">www.maturidis.com</a>, is it the case that his “shaikh” becomes “shakiness”. A lack thereof clearly demonstrates his true reality and depth of knowledge.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part One</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">[Their feeble “refutation” was posted as two parts on their website]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They began by making a personal, uncouth remark regarding us, saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“The perpetrator of these remarks were carried out by neonate, new kids on the block with new found levels of testosterone, namely Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Strange it is that men in their late thirties should feel threatened by youngsters, even more so that they worry their own diminishing testosterone levels are struggling to keep up. Perhaps by the end of this rebuttal they will be booking in for hormone replacement therapy in order to conjure a reply to us. By virtue of such an introduction one can already assert that their “refutation” will not carry much substance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They then advise the brethren of their ilk not to engage with us as they also fear their incompetence in keeping up with us, a compliment we will accept graciously:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alhamdullilāh, since you have accepted you are &#8216;youngsters&#8217; then know your position and manzilah in the circles of ilm. The reality is that you are youngsters in more ways than one not least that your manzilah in ilm is extremely weak and your statements very generalised, loose and weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Everyone knows what new kid on the block refers too and it has nothing to do with age, if we must mention it for clarification, mundane as it seems – it refers to new people on the scene which also fits Ibn Nūr al-Shantī. Also we will see how you apply your own words oh young one, <span style="color: #ff0000;">“Perhaps by the end of this rebuttal they will be booking in for hormone replacement therapy in order to conjure a reply to us.”</span> Or did you mean Muḥammad Yāsir al-Ḥanafī has already gone and undergoing his treatment!!! In Deoband!!! Tut tut dreadful, anyhow was he incapable of responding? This feeble response is a testimony of his lack of knowledge and the need for you to run to his aid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Inshallāh we will show this further on. So Oh young ones!! know your station and security will be for you if you remain silent for &#8216;the one who remains silent has indeed reached salvation&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thumma Alhamdullilah we have never feared in keeping up with you and anyone who seeks with justice shall see that we have refuted and responded to your elders for around 20 years and have had very little by way of worthy response, if at all and that which has been authored by your “shaikh” and Amīr is disgraceful and a travesty on the sacred sciences as you shall come to know inshaAllāh. Once again please speak to your elders before you open the hornets nest with us as your elders know us well by what we have written in the past, wa lillah hil hamd.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“The brothers should understand that attempting a refutation against the aforementioned individuals, the Deobandis and Hanafis will result in a subsequent response from them which may be difficult for those brothers to rebut and thereby causing embarrassment on behalf of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah. It is indeed easy quoting what Ashraf Ali Thanvi said etc but when accusations are levied against us these brothers are nowhere to be seen.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Besides portraying the ahnaf as villains and falsely proclaiming to be adherents of Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah, they admit that their clan members are good for nothing other than hurling taunts and misquoting the noble elders of Deoband when they themselves live in glasshouses. What a shame it is that they did not take their own advice, a lesson they are about to learn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">OUTRIGHT LIE! we have never admitted that <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;clan members are good for nothing other than hurling taunts and misquoting the noble elders of Deoband&#8221;</span>. please show us where you have taken this as our quote from us? If you cannot show us this you have either lied upon us, misquoted us or at the least are not capable of writing anything worthy of note from the bāb of ‘ilm, let alone to refute us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">we wait for your repentance for this lie.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A quote is then given of a Sheikh Muhammad Fakhir attempting to refute Ash’ari’s. This quote is then fallaciously utilised in order to support the claim that the salafi sect was around two-hundred and seventy-two years ago. There is no mention of salafi in the quote, not even as a word never mind in reference to an entire sect of people. Abu Hibban and Abu Khuzaimah simply claim that this man was a “bona fide salafi” and by that expect a person to believe that the salafi sect is over 100 years old. They then link a bogus document compiled by them claiming that the founding ulama of Deoband were supporters of the East India Company. This document is not worth the pixels it is presented upon, simply by the fact that the struggles of the ulama of Deoband, for the liberation of India against the British are well known. Perhaps they should address why the founding father of the pseudo-salafi movement in the Indian Subcontinent, Nawab Siddiq Hassan Khan of Bohpal was under employment by the British.3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed, this is dodging the main points and glossing over a pivotal point, Ibn Nūr al-Shantī statement is riddled with oceans of confusion when he attempts to say the quote is fallacious, not only did he fail to understand the point but goes on another wild goose chase and making some horrific claims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Firstly, he should have bothered to check the biography of Shaikh Muḥammad Fākhir (1164H) and he would have learnt that he was a bona fide Salafī and now we have to show these young scholars and Ḥanafī apologists the basic of the basics just because they are so intellectually capable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That’s some homework for you and let us see your actual levels of scholarship that you so desperately wanted to demonstrate but yet failed miserably.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">as-Salafī !!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">as-Salafī !!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">as-Salafī !!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">last time we checked, Mawlāna Abdul Haȳ al-Ḥasanī was a Ḥanafī and he very clearly said that Shaikh Muḥammad Fākhir was a SALAFĪ,  ok one more time, just in case you missed it,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture3.png"><img class=" wp-image-1902 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture3.png?resize=391%2C244" alt="Picture3" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture3.png?resize=300%2C187 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture3.png?resize=100%2C62 100w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture3.png?w=706 706w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is even more astonishing and another outstanding example of Ibn Nūr al-Shantī’s scholarship is that, the author of Nuzhatul Khawāṭir, Mawlāna Abdul Haȳ al-Ḥasanī died in 1341H / 1923ce which is just under 100 years and thus he must have authored Nuzhatul Khawāṭir prior to that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This leads to the point that let alone the Salafīs and Ahlul Ḥadīth being 100 hundred years old, an author who died almost a hundred years old mentions an Imām of the Salafīs, namely Shaikh Muḥammad Fākhir who was born in 1120H and died in 1164H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask the young new kid on the block, Ibn Nūr al-Shantī, when are you going to join your comrade, Muḥammad Yasīr al-Ḥanafī for hormone replacement therapy, surely you remember what you said, <span style="color: #ff0000;">“Perhaps by the end of this rebuttal they will be booking in for hormone replacement therapy in order to conjure a reply to us.”</span>  Let us know we will pay for the therapy!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This said, the statement of this great Salafī Imām in his book on ‘Aqīdah is a refutation of the Ashā’irah and at the same instance shows the existence of the Salafīs and Ahlul Ḥadīth two hundred and seventy-two (272) years ago, which again proves our initial point. We pray this is has quenched your search for ilm Mr. Ibn Nūr al-Shantī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Two quotes are given of Allamah Sam’ani and Allamah Ibn al-Athir stating that people held the titles of salafi by way of attributing themselves to the salaf. This still does not prove the claim that this sect as a collective movement and the things that they teach is more than a hundred years old.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They then say;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Rather Allamah Safarini has explained that the later scholars who adopted the way of the companions, Tabieen and Taba Tabieen are known as the Salaf (Lawameh al-Anwar (1120).”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">First of all, it seems Abu Hibban and his chum have no idea how to reference; either that or they took the above quote from a secondary source because it is so poorly cited.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nonetheless, the quote was located and we found that this is a complete distortion of what Allamah Safarini said! What he actually said was;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“What is intended by the term “madhab of the salaf” is what the noble sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were upon, as well as the tabi’een, those who followed them and the Imams of the deen who witnessed them and recognised their greatness and virtue in the religion and from whom people took speech before them [those who came after the Imams] from.” Scan below</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Further on they say;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Imam Ibn Taimiyyah (728H) and Hafidh ibn Rajab (795H) have included Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal (241H), Imam Shafi’ee (204H), Ishaq Ibn Rahawaihah (221H) and Imam Abu Ubaid (224H) to be from amongst the Salaf.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Here they very clearly acknowledged that the first 3 generations of people were referred to as the salaf and then further on they gave references to Lawam’i of Allamah Saffarini! If Allamah Saffarini was stating here that those from the first 3 generations were regarded as the salaf then what of their claim earlier that Allamah Saffarini said that those who follow the 3 generations are the salaf? Correct your alteration of Allamah Saffarini’s text and you’ll correct your contradiction. Bear in mind that earlier they used somebody refuting the Ash’aris as evidence for the age of this Salafi sect, further on we’ll demonstrate what Imam Saffarini said regarding the Ash’aris.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A list of books is then given in which Abu Hibban and his stooge Abu Khuzaimah claim that they and their co-cultists have taken their religion from.  Claiming to be an adherent of the way of Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (rahimahullah), this can be enumerated in many directions and insha’Allah will be done so by many more writers soon. Simply claiming to adhere to a set of books from the salaf does not then prove that his sect originated from that time, this is a red-herring that the swindler has put forward.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">An attack is then placed upon Shaykh Mohammad Yasir al-Hanafi on why he. as well as the elders of Deoband, adhered to the methodology of Imam Abu Hanifah in fiqh yet follow Imam Abul Hasan al-Ashari (rahimahullah) and Imam Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (rahimahullah) in aqidah. He questions;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“&#8230;we ask you, what is wrong with the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">May Allah help these poor men; they don’t even have that much understanding. Luckily for them Shaykh Mohammad Yasir al-Hanafi has already clarified this long before we were aware of this feeble attempt at a refutation:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Most of you will probably have heard the pseudo-salafis saying to you: &#8220;Akhī! Why don&#8217;t you follow Imām Abu Hanīfah (rahimahullah) in Aqīdah? You only follow him in Fiqh. In Aqīdah you are Ashā&#8217;irah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This sort of rhetoric, I&#8217;ve heard several times and to be honest, it&#8217;s getting rather boring.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In my series, &#8220;Is Allāh above the Throne?&#8221;, I&#8217;ve proven that Asha&#8217;irah/Māturidiyyah were the people who protected the Aqīdah of the Ahl Al-Sunnah, including the Creed of Imām Abu Hanifah, Imām Abu Yusuf and Imām Muhammad (rahimahumallah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There was a typo in the reference it should have been (1/20), exactly the same way your disastrous spelling of Salafī Research Institute (see later), neither is there any distortion yet since you have nothing academic to say but to refer to typo errors, which shows your actual level of scholarly research and your apology skills, just a joke to be quite frank but what can one expect from such “scholars.” Furthermore, explain to us from where are you obtaining the creed of Abū Ḥanīfah and which books? This is so that we can respond to you fully when you question whether Allah is above the Throne or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Just like Allāh had taken the work of the Qurrā in Qira&#8217;āt, e.g Imām &#8216;Asim Al-kūfi etc, and we attribute ourselves to them in Qira&#8217;āt, in hadith Allāh has taken the work of the Muhaddithūn. Similarly in creed, Allāh has used these noble people to protect the aqidah of Ahl al-Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Please evidence with asanīd your claim by establishing that the Ash’arī creed and interpretation of it was exactly like Abū Ḥanīfahs? We await your scholarly research on this Oh young One.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">There is NO CONTRADICTION between the creed of Imām Abu Hanifah (rahimahullah) and the Ashā&#8217;irah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sorry but that is just a blatant lie. According to Mawlāna Anwar Shāh Kashmirī Deobandī this is certainly not the case, see below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If Ash’arī &#8216;interpreted&#8217; the creed then how can you be certain there is &#8216;no contradiction&#8217; as we assume you did not have an &#8216;interpretation&#8217; from Imām Abū Ḥanīfah himself in the first place? Or Did Imām Abū Ḥanīfah have his own interpretation in which case what was the need for Ash’arīs interpretation?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The reason we attribute ourselves to Ashā&#8217;irah is because, compared to the deviated sects that occurred in the time of Imām Abu&#8217;l Hasan Al-Ash&#8217;arī (who came AFTER Imām Abu Hanifah), we take his interpretations, which is the interpretation of Ahl Al-Sunnah. It doesn&#8217;t mean our creed is now contrary to Imām Abu Hanifah&#8217;s! It is merely because Imām Al-Ash&#8217;arī did that work which was needed at his time, just as Imām Abu Hanifah compiled Fiqh, which was the need in his time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hence, in creed ALL FOUR schools are the same, they are all Ahl al-Sunnah, whether they are Ashā&#8217;irah, Maturidiyyah or true Athariyya.”4</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You are hiding behind the generality of the term of Ahlus Sunnah and in actuality have no substance to your claim. Please be specific. Maybe you are ignorant of the differences in creed between these three sects?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We mentioned earlier that we would show what Imam Saffarini’s views were upon the Ash’ari and Maturidi schools. Let us present to you exactly what he said from the very book, Lawami al-Anwar, that the two amateurs quoted (or misquoted) above. One may then wonder whether they’ve actually even read this book:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah are three groups: The Athariyya (textualists) and their Imam is Ahmad bin Hanbal (may Allah be pleased with him), the Ash’aris and their Imam is Abul Hasan al-Ash’ari (Allah have mercy upon him), the Maturidis and their Imam is Abu Mansur al-Maturidi.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Please tell us who are the Atharīyyah that Saffarini is mentioning? Your own quote shows that the Salafī/Atharī/Ahlul Ḥadīth were all around well over a years ago? Or do you now dispute with that which you have quoted?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They make an attack on the ulama of Deoband and their affiliations to the Sufi tariqahs, he says;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Also can you explain which book of the Salaf or their teaching did the Deobandi’s acquire the Sufi tariqah, Chistiyyah or the Naqshbandiyyah from?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is not a matter that needs to be proven from the salaf,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, it does. Is it not part of the Sharia’h and are the turuq not seen as part of the deen? why is it that your elders from deoband have claimed that the turuqs can be traced back to the 4 rightly guided Khulāfa yet you claim they need not proving from the Salaf? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> the turuq are methodologies of tasawwuf which were developed later and used as a means to the science of tasawwuf, the both of them should read volumes 10-11 of Ibn Taymiyyah’s Majmu al-Fatawa where he has discussed this issue and others like it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You are misleading in your quote. Does Imām Ibn Taymīyyah say that the turuq are based on Sunnah? Or has he in fact not authored works against the Ṣūfīyyah and their turuq let alone being from one himself as you allege?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This issue will be discussed in detail in Shaykh Mohammad Yasir’s series on tasawwuf which is due to be released on the Hanafi Fiqh Channel. Nonetheless, since you’ve asked where the ulama of Deoband took these tariqahs from, please ask the following Imams also:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Muwaffaq Ibn Qudamah – a follower of the Qadiri Tariqah5</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abd’al Ghani al-Maqdisi – a follower of the Qadiri Tariqah6</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah – a follower of the Qadiri Tariqah and others7</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Dhahabi – a follower of the Suhrawardi Tariqah8</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Shawkani – a follower of the Naqshbandi Tariqah9</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once again you have done a very good cut and paste job and this is not part of scholarly research. You have mentioned these scholars and have not quoted any chain or transmission report to show the basis of the claim. As an example, it is very widely known that Imam Ibn Taymiyyah explained the Ṣūfī being the Ṣiddīq one who strived to excel in Zuhd and worship as discussed in his Majmū’ al-Fatāwa wherein he discussed the Ahlus Ṣuffa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Unfortunately, new wannabe scholars on the block like yourself misused used his words and have attempted to attach him to a Ṣūfī Tarīqah. You can refer to his numerous Fatāwa and Rasā’il about tasawwuf, Ṣūfism and his Kalām on the likes of Mansūr al-Halāj to see where he placed Ṣūfism that was around in his era.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> You have failed to mention evidence of what you rely on to say he was a Qadrī but the likes of yourself usually rely on the points that have been made by the likes of George Makdisi as recorded in the American Journal Of Arabic Studies [for some reason you did not reference this properly, why?] that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyahs teachers are traced back to Mūwafaq ud-Dīn Ibn al-Qūdāmah who was a student of Abdul Qādir Jilānī and that Imām Ibn Taymīyyah praised Abdul Qādir Jilānī and benefitted from his works. Surely even you can agree that this does not of itself make Imām Ibn Taymīyyah a follower of the Qādrī Tarīqah? Please provide direct evidence with sanad to show that Imām Ibn Taymāyyah said that he was a Qādrī and then we can investigate this issue further. This example just shows the level of your scholarly research.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah was very clear on the Ṣūfīs and George Makdisi himself writes about him quoting from Imām Ibn Taymīyyah&#8217;s al-Fatāwa, Kitab ‘Ilm al-Sulūk, that he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“That corruption in beliefs and actions that befell these people (the Sufis) necessitated that many groups totally rejected the original path of the Sufis until those who erred were of two types: one type that affirms its being right and also wrong and another type that negates its being right and wrong, positions on which there are the people of theology and fiqh. The only correct position is affirming that which is, in this matter and others, in agreement with the Book and the Sunnah, and rejecting that which is, in this matter and others, contrary to the Book and the Sunnah.” </em>[translation taken from deobandī website]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is abundantly clear for Imām Ibn Taymīyyah&#8217;s benchmark was that which was in agreement with the book and Sunnah and he criticised the later Ṣūfīs and their innovations.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan al-Qinnawji (Bhopali) [founder of the ahle-hadith/salafi sect of the Indian Subcontinent] – a follower of the Naqshbandi Tariqah. He himself states that he and his forefathers were all Naqshbandi sufis as well as having authorisations in other tariqahs also. In the same passage, he too attests to the fact that Imam al-Shawkani was a Naqshbandi sufi (he had great admiration for him).10 Scan below:</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Many more examples can be given but for the sake of brevity we end it here. Please give us your verdicts on these a’immah for following the sufi tariqahs, especially the founder of your sect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Then in response to Shaykh Mohammad Yasir al-Hanafi stating that the salafiyya do not have any proper madaris in the UK except for a few crash courses, he says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“The Salafis and Ahlul Hadith have been teaching in their respective madrassahs for years well before Bury and Dewsbury appeared on the scene. Madrassah’s were and are well established throughout the United Kingdom with names like Madrassah Salafiyyah. We would surely know as we studied in them in the early 80’s and the teaching was regular and consistent from the mid 70’s&#8230;The level and methods of teaching were evident and widespread where students would deliver lectures and sermons as training in the annual conferences.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We found no official records of any established madrasah by the name “Madrassah Salafiyyah” and what classes they have been running since the 70’s. We looked for your “YouTube videos” that you spoke of and found nothing except Green Lane Masjids usual suspects. Where can we find the evidences that these are official and regular lessons? Even more so where is the proof that these classes have been running since the 70’s? Send us a nice prospectus if you get the chance. These lectures and sermons you speak of seem to be very much the “crash course halaqas” that Shaykh Mohammad Yasir mentioned. Your Friday khutba’s and evening maktab classes don’t count as official madaris on par with the various Darul Ulooms up and down the country. You claim there are well established Salafi madrassahs throughout the UK yet you only named one which is not even on record. The Darul Ulooms up and down the UK teach their students the sahih sitta with the chains of narration all the way back to the Imams. What is the proof that this Madrassah Salafiyya taught the sahih sitta. We challenge you to come forward and provide your chains just as Shaykh Mohammad Yasir and his fellow Deobandi graduates have.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And where were you hoping to find these &#8216;official records&#8217;? Are you sure you did not pop down to your local council house and check instead the register of births and marriages? This of course would not surprise us at the least seeing the level of your scholarly research.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We Alhamdullilāh can collect lists of names and witnesses of people who attended Madrasah Salafīyyah since the 70&#8217;s but simply do not have the &#8216;spare time&#8217; like you to waste on trying to establish this point for you. It&#8217;s not a matter from the pillars of the dīn or fiqh so you can carry on &#8216;researching &#8216; it and then produce your findings which we can then look at.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, since when has this even been an issue, but when nothing ilmi is found an ignorant point such as this is presented. How will you having more madāris make any difference. Little do you remember or realize even if such as the case as you argue then how come a very small few number of us that have no ilm according to you, that you have yet to answer us till this day and our dawah is getting stronger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A vast number of Deobandīs are becoming Salafīs everyday and you know it when the reverse is far and few, if that!!!! So we wonder what affect your madāris are having</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The two salafi stooges, Abu Hibban and Abu Khuzaimah begin their nonsensical tirade with the following words:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“In response to our dedication and efforts the hanafis deobandis of Bury and Dewsbury decided to setup Tablighi organisations against the Salafi Dawah.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">No tablighi organisation was set up solely as a response to the salafi dawah. The efforts of tabligh have been present in the UK as early as the 70’s and that is documented unlike their earlier claim!11 </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They then make a very strange claim without any evidence, they say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“It is a historical fact that the people of truth are always less in number”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What you say is a very strange claim is actually very well documented, Aare there not a vast number ḥadīth in the ṣihā and other than them which talk of the 73 sects and one being the saved one? Are there not many āyahs which state that the majority do not remember, understand and believe? Were the companions not a minority in nearly all their struggles including the battle of Badr? In reality it is you who has decided to be blinded and take our words out of context.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, Abdullāh Ibn Mas’ūd (may Allaah be pleased with him) said to ‘Amr ibn Maymūn:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “The Jamā’h is that which is in accordance with the truth, even if you are on your own.”</em> [Narrated by Ibn ‘Asākir 2/322/13, Sharḥ Usūl al-‘Eitiqād Ahlus Sunnah of Imām al-Lālikā’ī no:160]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By quoting the above we do not mean that the masses are innovators or upon kufr. Rather what is intended is that those upon the truth in any given time are always attached to the book, Sunnah and Salaf of the ummah, regardless of there number. Then this is what Imām Ibn Taymīyyah was referring to in the quote you have given of him below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is another fallacious claim that the pseudo-salafis like to present in order to justify and explain away to their followers as to why they are always few in number in every place. They make this claim that the people of truth are few just to satisfy themselves. However there are various ahadith to prove that the people of truth, the victorious group are always in the majority. Let the pseudo-salafis of this age ponder over the following statement of their hallmark of haq, Ibn Taymiyyah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“The saved-sect is described as being Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah. They are the overwhelming multitude and the great majority (al-jumhur al-akbar wa’l sawad al-a’zam). The remaining sects are followers of aberrant opinions, schism, innovations and [deviant] desires. None even comes near to the number of the saved sect, let alone its calibre. Rather, each such sect is extremely small (bal qad takunu’l firqatu minha fi ghayati’l-qillah)” [Majmu al-Fatawa, 3/345-346]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If by your quote you mean that Imām Ibn Taymīyyah is saying, for example, that out of a hundred men from various sects of Islām one claims that Allah is above the throne and 99 claim he somewhere other then that and by default the 99 are the Sawād al-A&#8217;zam [the great majority and saved sect] then this is misguided and a lie upon Imām ibn Taymīyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Please refer to numerous writings of Imām Ibn Taymīyyah not least including his Iqtiḍa, al-Qā’idatul Jalīlah and that which has been mentioned in his Fatāwa. What Imām Ibn Taymīyyah is clearly NOT DOING, but which you are trying to establish through him is that the vast majority of the UMMAH regardless of creed and belief are the saved sect or Ahlus Sunnah Wal jamā’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Scans below:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Furthering on with their nonsense, they say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“In light of this one may ponder how the Salafi Dawah is gaining strength if they lack the Madaris as Mr Yasir claims. A further point to note is to ponder how is it that Hanafis are embracing the Salafi Dawah and not the reverse?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The salafi dawah is gaining strength due to the lies and propaganda that you spread! Distorting issues and presenting them to the lay people to beguile them and capture them into your web of lies. You dupe them by asking questions such as “Are you Muhammadi or Hanafi?” and their likes. Many pseudo-salafis are now returning back to the traditional methods of Islam after the nakedness of the lies the pseudo-salafis tell has been exposed, the inconsistencies in their methodologies and the twisted beliefs that they hold. In fact, it must be the authors in question to whom this is in reply to who are shivering in their “cotton khuffs” at the major turnaround that is taking place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They then pick up on Shaykh Mohammad Yasir’s comment that they have no link to the salaf. This is brushed aside by them claiming that this has already been dealt with. In reality they have not addressed what Shaykh Mohammad Yasir said and resort to their usual use of red-herrings to escape. Shaykh Mohammad Yasir was indicating towards their lack of asaneed back to the salaf. How can one claim to be upon the methodology of the salaf yet not have any physical connection to them? What is the guarantee that what these pseudo-salafis claim to be upon, has been conveyed to them authentically? Simply claiming to adhere to a set of books does not ensure that they are understood correctly and it certainly does not ensure any real connection to the authors, a very devious way of avoiding a very strong challenge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once again you have misunderstood what was being said and are so blinkered in your own madhab that you have forgotten your own principals. You talk of &#8216;lack of asanīd&#8217; so we ask that the bulk of your so called fatāwa in your fiqh books ascribed to Imām Abū Ḥanīfah do you have an isnād for them? The answer is no, so you have fallen on your own sword. As for our methodology having no isnād back to the salaf then you have just made this assertion and not provided evidence for this baseless claim. Please provide evidence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A claim is then made;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Meanwhile we the Salafis can bring forward our proofs which emphasises that our Manhaj and Aqidah has not been diluted but rather it is a mirror reflection of the Companions, Tabieens and Taba-Tabieens.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We’ll take you up on that and we question you, why out of all of the issues that we have put forth in our videos starting from the “True Creed of The Salaf” series where it has been shown that Ibn Taymiyyah held anthropomorphic beliefs such as saying Allah is seated upon His Throne,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Do you mean the oft quoted report from Taqī al-Ḥiesnī from Alī Ḥasan &#8230;&#8230;.? If so even you will know that this is a major fabrication on Imām Ibn Taymīyyah.  Clarify your allegation against Imām Ibn Taymīyyah so we can respond accordingly. Scholarly research and writing should not be done in such haste as you have done throughout without any referencing. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, Imām Ibn Taymīyyah in discussing the saying of Imām Mujāhid about the sitting on the Throne states:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Like the Ḥadīth which mentions the Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) sitting upon the Throne. This has been narrated and ascribed to the Prophet by some people with many different chains of narration however they are all fabricated. This has only been authentically relayed from Mujāhid and others from the scholars of the past.”</em> [Daru at-Ta’āruḍi al-‘Aql Wan-Naql [5/237] of Imām Ibn Taymīyyah, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, checking Dr, Muḥammad Rashād Sālīm, 1991ce / 1411H, Jām’e al-Imām Muḥammad Ibn Sa’ūd, Rīyādh, KSA)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah continues,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture6.png"><img class=" wp-image-1905 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture6.png?resize=394%2C642" alt="Picture6" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture6.png?resize=184%2C300 184w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture6.png?resize=627%2C1024 627w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture6.png?resize=61%2C100 61w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Picture6.png?zoom=2&amp;resize=394%2C642 788w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is incumbent to differentiate between what has authentically been reported from the words of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and what has been authentically relayed from other than him…” </em>[Daru at-Ta’āruḍi al-‘Aql Wan-Naql [5/238]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then what is stated above is what Imām Ibn Taymīyyah believed. As for the sitting then Imām Ibn Taymīyyah and the creed of the Salaf is clear that we take Allāhs attributes and actions without making any similarity or explaining its kayfīyyah. So why are you assuming sitting here is like the sitting of creation? In actual fact it is you who has the anthropomorphic mentality and not Imām Ibn Taymīyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">that Allah moves etc, the taymiyyun (which the pseudo-salafis of today are) claiming that Allah’s attributes are to be taken literally;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafī scholar Shaikh Mullā Alī Qārī clearly says the one who denies the Istiwa of Allāh Haqīqatan is a Mu’ṭail ie a Jahmī one who denies the Ṣifāt of Allāh and then goes on to mention this is in full agreement and conforms exactly to what Imām Abū Ḥanīfah said (see scan below)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“in summary, the essence [of the matter] is that the descent (nuzūl) of the Creator to the lowest heaven is a true and real nuzūl (haqīqah), that is to be carried upon its dhāhir (apparentness), and [the knowledge of] its tafsīl and takyīf is to be relegated to the Creator, lofty be His manifest evidence, and this is the madhab of the four Imāms and the Righteous Salaf as has been quoted by al-Hāfidh [Ibn Hajr] in Fatḥ al-Bārī.”</em> [al-‘Urf ash-Shadhī Sharḥ Sunan at-Tirmidhī [1/414-417] of Mawlāna Anwar Shāh Kashmīrī, Edn. 1<sup>st</sup>, 1425H / 2004H, verification Shaikh Maḥmūd Shākir, Dār Iḥyā at-Turāth al-Arabī, Beirūt, Lebanon]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you now say Mawlāna Anwar Shāh Kashmīrī was an anthropomorphic and that he is like the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> &#8220;the taymiyyun (which the pseudo-salafis of today are) claiming that Allah’s attributes are to be taken literally, that allah moves etc&#8221;;</span> He also says the nuzūl is Haqīqī totally contrary to what these new kids are claiming. One advice would be to at least get your positions in order or is it a case that your totally confused as per usual and misleading and beguiling the general Ḥanafī brethren!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Please respond to this point.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also critiques the ASH’ARĪ creed in relation to Ṣifāt and announces that ibn Taymiyyah was upon the correct way. What will you respond to him</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As a side point, note well, Ibn Nūr al-Shantī’s “shaikh” Abul Ḥasan Ḥussain Aḥmed’s paternal grandfathers brother, Shaikh Assadar Alī [d.2005ce] who he learnt from and gained an ijāzah from, took ijāzah and fawā’id from Mawlāna Anwār Shāh Kashmīrī. Thus Abul Ḥasan Ḥussain Aḥmed has a strong connection with Mawlāna Anwar Shāh Kashmīrī yet here find things quite the opposite. Ibn Nūr al-Shantī hope you noted that well!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people are filled with so much hatred and animosity for the Salafīs and Ahlul Ḥadīth that they can not even add the name Muḥammad to Shaikh al-Albānī’s name and they always do this deliberately and they do not even have the common decency to add the word Shaikh to his name. The readers will note, disrespecting and using derogatory terms are the norm for these people and Alhamdulillāh we will always refer to their grandfather as Shaikh Assadar Alī and May Allāh have mercy upon him, Amīn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">regarding which 50 quotes from the salaf and khalaf were given to prove the contrary, all the way down to a “scholar” of the ahle-hadith sect by the name of Inayatullah al-Athari claiming that Isa (alayhisalaam) was born with a father (nauzubillah)!12  Also their chief scholar, Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan praising Ibn Arabi and quoting him saying that Rasulullah (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) hugged Ibn Hazm and became united into one entity with him, then later claiming that this is nothing strange!13  Or how about him innovating a type of salah known as “salah kun faya kun”?14  Bear in mind that he has claimed in his introduction that all the practices in his book are proven from the Qur’an and sunnah, please do defend your Imam and show us how this is so.There is much for you to answer, let us concede for arguments sake that the salafi sect is older than 100 years, why pick on this minute issue and not address the more pressing issues which we have already challenged you upon?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What an ignorant statement, this has been addressed by the publishers in the introduction and thus the reason for the response. We do not need to answer anything of yours because it well known on the internet world that you people are arch liars and you demonstrate this yourselves but constantly changing your pseudonyms and to this today you are not men enough to write anything thing with your kunyahs attributed to your real name, this is the men that you are.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of your stuff has been answered in the aforementioned websites Asharis.com and Maturidis.com, we wait for your answer to them or even better let see if you run to your “shaikh’ who has till day not answered the most vehement refutation on the 2 sects mentioned above. In fact we know that he will never have the guts to answer anything fro the 2 websites above as he is scared.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We the Salafīs have no madāris and we have not been taught but at the same time you can not answer or detailed arguments to you, this is very shameful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Would you like us to mention the hundreds of statements of the deobandī ḥanafī scholars and their abhorrent ‘Aqīdah filled with shirk and kufr for example,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlāna Aḥsan Ghilānī writes, <em>“We do not deny or reject seeking help from the souls of the Auliyā, hence so if a believer inflicted with troubles seeks help from good souls then what verse of the Qurān or Hadīth refutes this.”</em> (Hāshīyah Suwāneh Qāsimī 1/332)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and Mawlāna Gangohī said, <em>&#8220;With regards to Sayyid Sahib, Allāh was incarnate in him (i.e. he was in annihilation with Allāh).!!!&#8221;</em> (Arwah at-Thalātha (pg.185) and Sayyīd Sāhib is non other than the infamous Shaikh Imdādullāh Muhājir Makkī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and the statement a student of Mawlāna Rashīd Aḥmad Gangohī said, <em>&#8220;I saw in a dream the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) took me to the bridge of Ṣirāṭ and I saw the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) was falling over the bridge so I saved him.&#8221; </em>(Balāgahtul Khairan pg.15) of Mawlāna Ḥussain Alī of Bicharan from the district of Mianwali, Punjāb Pākistān)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And here is more just in case you have time on our hands which we think you do because your vivid imagination and wishful thinking, read the following, <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-aqidah-of-the-deobandis-shaikh-talib-ur-rehman/">http://www.salafiri.com/the-aqidah-of-the-deobandis-shaikh-talib-ur-rehman/</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And how about the following, what your deobandī scholar Mawlāna Muḥammad Amīn Safdar Okārwi said, the Qaḍi’s that were violent against Imām Aḥmad ie ordered his lashes were Mu’tazilī in ‘Aqīdah and Ḥanafī in furu. See scan</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Tajallīyāt Safdar [2/68], Edn ? arranged by Mawlāna N’aīm Aḥmad, Maktabah Imdādīyyah, Multān, Pākistān]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So what are you on about, you have Mu’tazilī’s in your chains who were mulḥids and heretics infact Kāfirs!!! You are definitely going to need 2 doses of hormone replacement therapy now!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Take a look now at this interesting trap that they threw themselves into. In a desperate attempt to attack the ulama of Deoband via our adherence to the Hanafi fiqh, they attack an individual who is found in certain chains of transmitting legal rulings, they say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;Only one needs to read the books of rijal and history to understand the Salaf within the deobandis and hanafis. For instance we can study the example of Abu Mute’a al-Balkhi and his beliefs (Refer to Lisan ul-Mizan Vol. 2, Mizan ul-E’tidaal Vol. 1 and Kitab al-Kunna Vol. 2 of ad-Daulabi).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;Yes Abu Mutee al- Balkhi is a questionable individual but the dim-witted salafis fail to realise that this individual is present in the chain of a narration they like to utilise to further their twisted aqidah; the alleged statement of Imam Abu Hanifah in which he apparently subscribes to the view that Allah is literally above His Throne! They use this in their lessons and attacks on those who do not hold the same twisted beliefs that they do and they print this on their propaganda leaflets. Shaykh Mohammad Yasir al-Hanafi has already clarified this issue and demonstrated that the self-taught muhaddith Nasir al-Din al-Albani, among his many contradictions, has classified Abu Mutee al-Balkhi weak in one place when it suited him but then has authenticated him in another place when it suited him!15 Point fingers at the ahnaf for utilising his narrations in fiqh but can you explain why you accept him in aqidah? We look forward to your answer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not accept Balkhī as a narrator but the fact remains that you are trying your utmost to run away from him and his quote in relation to Abū Ḥanīfah making hukm of kufr on the one who does not say Allah is above the Throne. It is amazing that you have abandoned not only Balkhī but also Fiqh al-Akbar which until recently was hailed as one of Abū Ḥanīfahs ‘Aqīdah works and you can refer to your “shaikhs” work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You have even opposed your own major scholars of ḥadīth. Please explain why your Mawlāna Anwar Shāh Kashmirī states in his explanation of Tirmidhī that the ‘Aqīdah of is found in Fiqh al-Akbar and that Abū Muṭ’i al-Balkhī according to him is truthful. SubhanAllāh it is thus established that Mawlāna Anwar Shāh Kashmīrī held this saying of Allāh being above his Throne. We disagree with some of the language and the usage of his terminology in his explanation of this ḥadīth but this quote is sufficient to break your back and abandon your founding fathers inshaAllāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is so baffling that Ibn Nūr al-Shantī from his scholarship and research has great difficulty in understanding basic points, is not Abū Muṭ’i al-Balkhī trustworthy and truthful according to you, if not then please mention your clear position on him and no vague terms like questionable. Secondly he was cited as an evidence against you and lastly as mentioned above Abū Muṭ’i al-Balkhī was declared truthful according to your Ḥanafī Mawlāna Anwar Shāh Kashmīrī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is more, the Imām of the Ḥanafīs in ‘Aqīdah, Abū Mansūr al-Māturīdī clearly says that Fiqh al-Akbar is authentically attributed to Imām Abū Ḥanīfah which subsequently contains the famous statement, whoever says I do not if Allāh is above the Heavens or on the Earth he is a Kāfir. Thus, this is authentically established from Imām Abū Ḥanīfah as per the Imām of ‘Aqīdah of the Hanafīs, Abū Mansūr al-Māturīdī. See scan below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is indeed a sufficient reason for these new kids on the block to know their manzilah and it also abrogates everything this young one because it seems he has no idea what he is talking about. Now the onus lies with you, make your bayan on this issue.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, this constant foul mouthed language and calling us dimwits etcetra will not change the facts and reality but if it makes the young ones feel more mature, masculine and macho then all we can say is to join your comrade for hormone replacement therapy, we are sure he must be feeling lonely and tired after flapping his wings all the way back to deoband.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Not only can we respond appropriately but we know how to deal with the likes of these unknown new kids on the block, Ibn Nūr al-Shantī, who besides being totally unknown has nothing to show his worth and if he wants to know ours then let him ask his “shaikh” about his discussions with us spanning years back.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have inshaAllāh responded to the points without digressing however at times even the ignorant ones warrant some sort of response and stern words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">After much further specious statements with no validity or reality, they come onto a closing remark that I would like to pick up on;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“This is the very deoband which was established in a Hindu city where their respective goddess would be worshipped and venerated. It is also the very deoband which was formed through the donations of Hindus and the British East India Company.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If Deoband is to be criticised due to it formerly being a Hindu city where idol worship took place, shouldn’t Makkah al-Mukarramah also be criticised by them since no less than 360 idols were worshipped there during the days of ignorance? No evidence is provided to prove that Deoband was a Hindu city but even if it was, it is a matter of pride that our forefathers were capable of taking it from a Hindu city of idol worship into a bastion and fortress of Islamic practice and teaching. I sense some strong scents of jealousy from the envious ones that I write in response to. As for the claim that Deoband was funded by Hindus and the East India Company, once again no evidence is provided yet there is evidence which I have provided above that their sect was indeed funded by the very East India Company that they speak of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No point refuting your scholarly research and qiyās above. Is this the same Deoband where it is claimed the Prophet regularly visits? Let us know if you would like the evidence for this statement?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also what an ignorant point which shows that when you have anger and animosity you forget the basics. If you remember the basics of Islām you will remember that Ādam Alayhis Salām built the house of Allāh first and then subsequent Prophets, when there was no idol worship which is a stark contrast to deoband and furthermore, there are still hindus living in Deoband so what bastion and fortress!!!! How ignorant are you oh young one?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You are probably so engrossed in your misguidance that the very same article your scathingly referenced as not worth the pixels, then if you had bothered to read that you would have found evidence. As for the state of Bhopal the real historians with an open and insightful mind would know the real state of affairs. For example let us give you one example and that is the referring and reporting of the Wahābi activities of Nawāb Ṣiddīq Ḥasan Khān to the British government, which is well documented, even in English.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now, if you are ignorant and your scholarly research is extremely deficient and poor then it is better for you to retire before you get ahead of yourself because nothing comes to mind except sheer shoddiness. If you are ignorant then do not speak and if this is your best research, the deobandī ḥanafīs need to refute you for tainting them with your hilarious, hysterical and comical research.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">First tell us if you are ignorant of the facts and realities and that you do not know what you are talking about, once you have admitted this we shall be more than happy to provide you with ample proofs. As it stands we will not be wasting our time with the basics of the basics.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A closing advice to Abu Hibban and his stooge Abu Khuzaimah before they tuck their tails between their legs and run all the way back to their cells; spend more time researching and providing evidences for your baseless claims rather than exhausting the only 3 brain cells that you have between the two of you in order to mould your childish wisecracks. You call yourselves “Salafi Rsearch Intitute”, thank you for demonstrating the true extent of the “research” that you can do, we found it very amusing. We may be the “new kids on the block” but for a pair of men in their late thirties, you certainly sound like a pair of delinquent teens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reality is you have lied and twisted throughout your scholarly research and should refrain from doing so. We are being very amicable in our approach to you as we have hope that you will turn to the truth and leave the path you are upon of falsehood and innovation. Should we be harsh and tough in our response and just overwhelm you with evidences then we fear this will go above your head and not benefit you in the slightest. Hence, we have kept our response very short and simple.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At least spell Research and Institute correctly and remember when you were attempting to refute us that we did not how to reference, we bet you feel real clever now right?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask Allah to guide us and keep us upon the creed of the salaf. Amīn.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Difference Between The Salafi’s and The Ashari’s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated, Compiled and Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So know dear reader that when an Asharee who attempts to use his intellect over the authentic sunnah and attempts to say that an authentic hadeeth which confirms a particular Attribute, name or action of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala is not accepted because it is in contradiction with the Qur’an, then know that he is upon misguidance and away from all of the Muslims in his creed and the consensus of the blessed companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great imam al-A’ajuree d.360H spoke concerning those people who leave off the Sunnah from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam because they think that there is a contradiction with the Qur’an and instead they follow their own intellects, he has said that they are Mulhids (heretics), please refer to his book ash-Sharee’ah. (Ash shariyyah lil-Ajuree pg 350-351)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From amongst another deception of the Ashaairah is that they say <em>‘even if the hadeeth is authentic concerning the Attribute of Allah then many of them we cannot take as they are khabarul Ahad which are not like the Qur’an or have not come in mutawaatir form. In essence, this means that there is a doubt on the khabarul ahad hadeeth (which is a narration reported by less than the mutawaatir form and therefore for them that does not give the benefit of certain knowledge). The belief in the Attributes of Allah is based upon certain knowledge and not upon knowledge which has doubt within it’</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The asharis of past and present have used a particular narration which is very famous amongst them in order to substantiate this weak principle and that is a hadeeth which is mentioned in current modern times by the likes of Kawtharee and in earlier times by the likes of Imaam Baihaqee.  The hadeeth is from Abdullah bin Urwah Bin Zubair al-Awaam that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Verily Zubair bin al-Awaam </em><em>Radiallahu ‘anhu heard a man narrate a hadeeth from the Messenger of Allah </em><em>sallahu alaihi wasallam, so Zubair began to listen very attentively up until the man completed the narration. Thereupon, Zubair said to the man ‘did you hear this narration from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam?’. The man replied, ‘yes’. Zubair said, ‘We have heard similar to this from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam and because of this we refrain from mentioning hadeeth from the Messenger. By Allah I was present when the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam informed us about this narration and when he started to inform us of this narration he said in the beginning that he is narrating this to us from a man from the previous times who was from the ahlul kitaab (the people of the book) and on that day you came late and did not hear the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam mention that this narration was from the people of the book and therefore you took the words of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam as being an authentic narration from the Prophet  yet it was from the previous times of the people of the book and not from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam”. (</em>Kitabul asma wa sifaat of Baihaqee pg.258, Kawtharees footnotes to Baihaqee’s Asma was- Sifaat pg.358)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After mentioning this narration, Baihaqee said, <em>“And this narration is one of the reasons why our scholars of our madhab have said that to take the akhbaarul ahaad concerning the Attributes of Allah and to base belief upon this, is abandoned, due to this being a single narration and not like the Book of Allah or consensus. And due to this our scholars became engrossed in making figurative interpretation and ta’weel concerning the Attributes.”</em> (Baihaqee asma wa sifaat pg.450)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So it is clear from this that some of the ashaa’irah try to substantiate their aqeedah and at the most they try to take it back to the likes of Imaam Baihaqee by saying that, Baihaqee himself says that the scholars from the mutaqallimeen and the ashaa’irah at that time did not take the authentic narrations as khabrul ahad concerning the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala. However, this is incorrect for many reasons:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The narration which Bahaiqee himself relies upon from Zubair bin al-Awaam is unsubstantiated and rejected and there are 3 reasons for this.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">In the chain is a man known as Abu Ja’far A’raabee or al-Azaa’mee he is unknown as was mentioned by Shaykh Abdur Rahman bin Yahyaa al-Muallamee al-Yamaanee who said, <em>“I do not know of him.” (</em>al-Anwar ul Kaashifah pg.60)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Another narrator within the chain is Abul Abbas as-Sabaghee Muhammed bin Ishaaq bin Ayub. There is no tawtheeq for him. In fact his more established and trustworthy brother Imaam Abu Bakr Ahmad bin Ishaaq as-Sabaghee an-Nisapooree would make disparaging remarks about him for being a lewd man and a vagabond, he would stop people from narrating or listening to ahadeeth from him. (Haafiz Dhahabee’s Siyaar A&#8217;alaam An-Nubalaa vol.15 pg.489)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">This narration is not from Urwah bin Zubair but it is from his son Abdullah bin Urwah bin az-Zubair (Al-Anwar ul-Kashifah of Imaam Yamaani pg.60). This is important because Abdullah bin Urwah Rahimahullah was born in the year 45A.H. (Taqreeb at-Tahdhib no.3485) and the companion Zubair bin al-Awaam was martyred on his return from the battle of Jamal in the year 36A.H (Taqreeb at-Tahdhb of Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaani no.2003) .Therefore this narration is disconnected (Munqati’) and the disconnected (Munqati’) narration is known to be weak and unacceptable. In summary, Abdullah the son of Urwah was born after his grandfather’s {Zubair bin Awaam} death so he could not have narrated this from him.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, there are various other authentic narrations which are akhabarul ahad which have been accepted by consensus of the salaf which substantiate the Attributes of Allah. For example, the Attribute of a Foot for Allah is in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (Kitaab at-Tawheed hadeeth no.7384, Saheeh Muslim: the chapter of paradise and it’s attributes and blessings for those who are in it no. 2848, Sunan Tirmidhee no. 2558 who said this hadeeth was Hasan Saheeh, Saheeh Abee Awaanah no.344, al-Mukhtaar of Dhiyaa al-Maqdisee no.2486, Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan al-Ehsaan no. 268).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And just as a benefit to those readers who want even more confirmation concerning this Attribute, then know that Imaam Ishaaq bin Masoor al-Koosaj asked Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal about the narrations concerning the Foot of Allah and other Attributes, Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal replied, <em>“All of this is substantiated from authentic narrations”</em> and Imaam Ishaaq bin Rahawaihah said, <em>“This narration concerning the foot is authentic and those who have weak intellect and are from Ahlul Bid’ah are the ones who make distortions and negation concerning it.</em> (Ash-Shariyy’ah of al-Ajuree vol. 3 pg.1128 and he said the chain is saheeh)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Mandah said concerning the Foot of Allah, <em>“And this narration is accepted by consensus.” (</em>Radd Alal Jahmiyyah vol.1 pg.19)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore it is clear that from amongst the Khairul Quroon (that is approximately up to the year 300H) there is not a single scholar or companion or a mujtahid who rejected the authentic akhbaar ul ahaad concerning the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Instead, all the companions, the tabi’een, the taba tabi’een and the scholars of hadeeth accepted the Attributes as they came whether it was from an ahad narration, the Qur’an or mutawaatir form from various ahadeeth and this was part of their faith. It is therefore clear that the ashaa’irah of past and present have no basis for creating yet another obstacle for rejecting the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala in the way that they have come and to accept them literally, without taweel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we have seen that the ashaa’irah in the past and more so in the present have fallen into the grave sin of rejecting and making figurative interpretations of the Names and the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala, especially where they created their own principles in order to promote their madhab. At times the ashaairah let their intellects overcome the text of the hadeeth to be taken upon its literal meaning, at times they rejected the saheeh hadeeth because it went against their madhab and therefore they made interpretations of it, at times they rejected the Attributes of Allah because they said that the ahadeeth which have come are in contradiction with the Qur’an and other than that which we have mentioned above.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the result of this is that the ashaa’irah continue to propagate various narrations in order to support their false beliefs. Concerning this we are going to mention a few narrations here which are a result of the innovated principles of the ashaa’irah regarding the Attributes of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the narrations which the ashaa’irah maturidiyyah and other than them from the deviated sects have brought based upon their weak intellect, they said that Allah Subhanahu wata’ala said about Himself,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I was a hidden treasure, nobody knew me, then I wanted for the people to get to know me, so I created the people, the creation and gave it my ma’rifah (ability to understand) then after this they got to know me.” (</em>This hadeeth has been given a particular paramount importance by the modern day ashari deobandis. Haji Imdaadullah Muhaajar Makkee in his book Shamaaim Imdaadiyyah pg.39 wherein he attempts to explain the correct way of the ashaa’irah and the murji’ah mu’tazilah concerning the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala based upon this fabricated narration!)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, we can see that this narration is nothing more than a fabricated narration which has been falsified by the deviant sects to prop up their own Madhab aswell as the Jahmiyyah.  We will not go into pages of evidence of who has called this fabricated, but it is sufficient to say that Hafiz Ibn Taymiyyah has said that this is fabricated (Tanziyah us-Sharriyyah of Kitaanee vol.1 pg.48).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Similarly Imaam Suyootee in his book (Dhail al-Lai’ee of Suyootee pg.203) has said that this verdict concerning the narration being fabricated is accurate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This narration has also been mentioned as a fabricated narration in (Mawdho’aatul Fitna pg. 11).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Sakhawee has also said that this narration is fabricated (al-Maqaasid al-Husna pg.153).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And furthermore the likes of Zarkhashee has also said that this narration has no basis and is fabricated (Tameez ut-Tayyib Minal Khabeeth pg.122).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Mulla Alee Qaaree has also said that this narration is fabricated (al-mawdhooaat lil fitna pg.54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So one can see the attempts by the ashaa’irah and the maturidiyyah who have tried to fabricate narrations in order to prove their creed by saying that how can we say Allah has a hand and Eyes and a Foot and Leg and various other Attributes if He Himself said about Himself that he was  unknown and then later on He became known to the people so the asl of Allah is that He is unknown and no one knows of Him except Allah Himself and through this the ashaa’irah and the muffawwidah who perform tawfeedh try to substantiate that Allah is unknown therefore His Attributes are meaningless and are not known. What a lie they made against Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and left the madhab of the salaf in order to substantiate that which was falsehood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith which the ashaa’irah, mu’tazilah, jahmiyyah bring in order to substantiate their false and rejected beliefs is,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The heart of a believer is the Throne of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“The heart of a believer is the house of Allah.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> So these narrations are brought so that they could say that the sifaat (Attributes) of Allah and Allah being above the throne have been explained by way of interpretation ta’weel by the Prophet himself!.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Read, This is fabricated. Sakhaawi said: <em>“It has no basis from the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam”</em> (al-Maqaasid al-Husna pg.144)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and likewise it is written in Tameez at-Tayyib minal Khabeeth (pg.114)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and likewise Ibn Taymiyyah said, “It is fabricated” (Tanzih ash-Shariyyah pg.148).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is similarly mentioned to be fabricated by Mulla Ali al-Qaari (al-Mawdhooaat pg.51). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Imaam Suyooti said that this is mawdoo (Dhail al-Lai’ee pg.203)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we can clearly see that the ashaa’irah and various other heretical sects including the jahmiyyah, maturidiyyah and others have traditionally in the past and continue in the present day to use various obstacles to go against the way of the salaf. But we say that salvation is only in the way of the salaf as-Saliheen and the correct aqeedah concerning the Attributes is as they have understood it and have mentioned in their books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah Subhanahu wata’ala forgive us for our sins and keep us upon the aqeedah and manhaj of the salaf us-Saliheen in making the aqeedah and manhaj clear from the doubts of the ahl ul ahwaa wal bidah. Ameen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The slaves of Allah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Difference Between The Salafi’s and The Ashari’s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Herein lies the difference, the usool of the salafee is that “ we read the ahadeeth so that our intellects, opinions, desires and other than that are to be in conformity with the hadeeth leaving off everything and accepting the hadeeth” whereas the asharee says “we read the hadeeth so that it can be in conformity with our intellects and our madhab and if it does not then we either make taweel of the hadeeth to make it agreeable with our madhab, and if this is not possible then we leave the hadeeth” A great calamity indeed!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Hayaat Sindhee in Iqaz al-Humam (pg.81) whilst he was discussing the methodology of the Hanafee Ahlur  Rai said that they were engrossed in giving precedence to opinion over the text of the prophetic traditions.  This matter would be incomplete if we did not therefore mention here that the above innovated principles and other than it are not something that the modern day Asharees have established but they borrowed this from their forefathers the Hanafee, maturidee Jahmees, that is,  the current day Deobandee and Barelwis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus we find from the classical hanafee books of Usool and jurisprudence such as Talweeh’ pg.17 and ‘Usool Bazdawee’ pg.34, Usool Karkhee pg.12 stating that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“any ayat or hadeeth which is contradiction to our Madhab then we will either make taweel of it and if we cannot make taweel of it to fall within our madhab then we shall leave it”    </em>and,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“any ayah of the quran which is against our madhab then we shall either say it is abrogated or give precedence to our madhab, but it is better that we make taweel of the ayah to make it in accordance with the saying of the madhab”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Icing on the cake is that which has been said by the grandfather of the Barelwis Muftee Ahmed Yar Khan Naeemi (Jaa al Haqq, Chapter on blind following) says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“we accept the Quran and hadeeth if it is accordance with our Imaam and leave it if it contradicts the saying of our Imaam, even if it is an authentic hadeeth. To take the Quran and hadeeth upon its apparent meaning is the root of Kufr”.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So to take the attributes on their apparent meanings as accepted by the Ijmaa of the salaf is Kufr!  So here we see the deep rooted relationship between the Ashaaiarah and Hanafee Madhab, a dangerous cocktail indeed!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, if one looks carefully at the Qur’an one can clearly see that especially in relation to all of the aspects of Islaam and the aqeedah one must have just as much reliance on the Qur’an as one has on the Sunnah and one cannot suffice without the other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So concerning the Ashaa’irah, how is it that they can say that the Qur’an is to be relied upon because the ahadeeth which talk about the Names and Attributes of Allah and which clearly state that the Attributes are to be taken literally are in contradiction with various ayaat of the Qur’an. We say to them have they not read in the Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Do you not ponder over the Qur’an? And if it had been from any other than Allah then in it you would have found much conflict and difficulties.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous tabi’ee and explainer of the Qur’an Imaam Ibn Jareer at-Tabari said concerning this verse of the Qur’an,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“No doubt the revelation which would come to the Prophet of Allah would come in a clear way so that the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam could explain its meanings and tell the people about the obligations from it. Had these orders or had these revelations to the Prophet been from any other than Allah then the orders that were given by the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam in his sunnah would have differed, the meanings would have differed and the whole religion would be in conflict, but this is not the case.”(</em>Tafseer Tabaree vol.5 pg.189)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> So one can clearly see from this that had any of the sunnah been in conflict with the Qur’an then the whole religion would be something which would be unrecognisable and full of conflicts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Shafi’ee Rahimahullah said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It should be known that there is no difference to what Allah has revealed in the Qur’an and the obligations that the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam has told us about from his Sunnah, they have both come in the same manner.” (</em>ar-Risaalah ash-Shafi’ee pg.183)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Allaamah Ibn Hazm Rahimahullah says in his tremendous book ‘al-Ihkaam’:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We have clearly substantiated that there is not a single ayah of the Qur’an which is in opposition to the authentic hadeeth and no authentic hadeeth which is in opposition to any ayah of the Qur’an, there is no separation or conflict. Whoever says that there is a conflict between an authentic hadeeth and an ayah of the Qur’an then his saying is rejected and based upon falsehood.” (1/112)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Qayyim Rahimahullah said in his book A’laam ul-Muwaqqi’een:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“From the principles of the Sharee’ah it is not possible to say that any ayah of the Qur’an differs or has a conflict with a hadeeth of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam or an obligation emanating from it. In fact the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam has forbid people to claim there to be such a distinction, what is upon us is to affirm and accept that which has been revealed, for all of this is proven from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam and the revelation that Allah has sent upon him. Anyone who says other than this is upon clear misguidance and mistaken”. (</em>A&#8217;laam ul Muwaqqi&#8217;een vol.2 pg.38)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning the verse of the Quraan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And those people who have bought faith upon that which the messengers have bought and make no distinctions between them&#8230;.” (</strong>Soorah an-Nisa 4:152)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa&#8217;dee said in his tremendous Tafseer Tayseer al Kareem,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“This verse of the Qur’an clearly shows that Allah </em><em>Subhanahu wata’ala is informing us that which he has told us about concerning himself and those narrations which have been brought by the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam by way of obligations then it is mandatory for us to have belief upon it all!” (</em>Tayseer al-Kareem ar-Rahmaan Fee Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan vol.2 pg.210 with the checking of Muhammad Zuhree an-Najjar)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>In Sooratul Nahl ayah 44 it says,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“With clear signs and Books (We sent the Messengers). And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the reminder and the advice (the Quran), that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought”.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Imaam Shafi’ee said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allah Subhanahu wata’ala in His Book and religion has given the status to the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam which has been mentioned in the Qur’an itself. Therefore it is obligatory upon mankind that they accept the revelation which has been revealed to the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam by way of the Qur’an and that which has also been revealed to him by the way of the hadeeth with which he speaks. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam when he spoke he made no contradictions with the Qur’an and in fact it is just an explanation of that which Allah had already revealed upon him by way of the Qur’an.” (</em>Jaami ul-Ilm pg.118)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore it is clear that there is no hadeeth whether it is concerning the Names of Allah or his Attributes , calling upon Allah alone, worshipping only Allah or any other Ahkaam concerning the Aqeedah or other than it in contradiction to the Qur’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah has said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The sunnah was revealed upon the Prophet just as the Qur’an was also revealed upon him.” (</em>Majmoo’a al-Fataawa of Ibn Taymiyyah vol.13 pg.364)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Shawkaani says whilst explaining the hadeeth ‘I have been given the Quran and something similar to it’:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This means he has been given the Qur’an and similarly the sunnah has also been given to him by way of revelation, and this is revelation {hadeeth} which has not been mentioned in the Qur’an.” (</em>Irshaad Al Fuhul of Shawkaani pg.33)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This clearly shows that it is a fallacy for any deviant sect including those such as the ashaa’irah to claim that ‘where in the Qur’an does it say that the Hand of Allah is to be taken literally or Allah has two Eyes or that Allah has a foot which is to be taken literally having a meaning?’. In essence, the Ashaairah ask the Salafees for evidence of the existence of the principles concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah as upheld by the salaf from within the Qur’an only and this shows that they have left the way of the Ahlul Ilm and the way of the salaf in this matter also. We reply,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah Subhanahu wata’ala says in the Qur’an <strong>An Nisaa 59,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger ), if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination”.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Imaam Shaatibee says </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This ayah clearly shows that there is no conflict in the sharee’ah because Allah Subhanahu wata’ala has told those that are in conflict to refer to the sharee’ah i.e. the Qur’an and the sunnah in order to finish the conflict. So it is clear that conflict will only seize once one can refer to that which can make the conflict end. Thus, if that which is commanded to refer back to {quran and sunnah} were to have in itself conflicts then there is no point in referring to it and those who say this are upon a way which is misguided”. (</em>Al-Muwafaqaat of Shaatibee vol.4 pg.119 and Al-I’tisaam of Shaatibee vol.2 pg.309-310)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a tremendous saying of Imaam Shaatibee and more or less sums up what is to be said. How can the ashaa’irah reject certain ahadeeth because it does not fit in with their minds or they say it opposes the Quran? Not all principles concerning aqeedah are found solely in the Quran but we look also to the hadeeth with the understanding of the salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Qayyim says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If the Book of Allah and the authentic sunnah of the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam did not have the quality of resolving conflicts then Allah Subhanahu wata’ala would not have told people who are in conflict to refer to them both. For verily he would not tell the people to refer to the Book and the sunnah of the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam had there been a conflict between them two in the first place”. (</em>I&#8217;laam ul Muwaqqi&#8217;een vol.1 pg.49)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Asharis for hundreds of years have not understood what the Sahaaba and tabi’een understood thousands of years ago. For example, concerning the conflicts that the people talk about between the authentic hadeeth and the Qur’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Imaam Maymoon bin Mehraan who was born in the year 40A.H. and passed away in the year d.118A.H having met many companions said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“To refer back to Allah Subhanahu wata’ala is to refer to his Book and when the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam was alive then the people would refer to him in person and now that he has passed away then one must refer to his blessed sunnah.” (</em>Tafseer Tabari vol.5 pg.96, Mushkilul Athaar of Tahawi vol.1 pg.484, al-Faqeeyah of Imaam Khateeb al-Baghdadi vol.1 pg.144 with a hasan isnaad.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Shawkaani says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Verily there is a consensus of all of the muslims from the salaf and those after them in the present times from the companions and other than them that in the affairs of the religion where there is a conflict between the sayings of the scholars then it is obligatory for the person to refer back to the Book of Allah and the sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad sallalahu alaihi wasallam and this has been mentioned in the Qur’an in Soorah Nisa ayah 59:</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>‘O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.’</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And this is to refer to Allah Subhanahu wata’ala meaning to refer to His Book and to refer to the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam means to refer to the Sunnah after his death. There is no one that has differed concerning this, from amongst the muslims.”</em> (Sharh as-Sudoor pg.1)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">First compiled and Published 1998</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ‘Bukhaari of the West’, the Imaam, the Hafidh, ibn Abdul Barr (d.423H), the Imaam of the Sunnah of his time said in his work at-Tamheed under the commentary of the 8<sup>th</sup> hadeeth:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>From Abu Hurayra that the Prophet </em><em>ﷺ</em> <em>said, ‘Our Lord descends every night to the lowest heaven when the last third of the night remains and says:” who is there calling upon Me that I may answer? Who is there asking of Me that I may give him?’”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“This hadeeth is established from the point of view of transmission having an authentic chain, the Ahlul Hadeeth do not differ as to its authenticity…</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">…and in this is evidence that Allaah is over (fee) the heaven, over (alaa) Throne, above (Fawqa) the seven heavens, as is said by the Jama’ah, and this is their proof against the Mu’tazila and Jahmiyyah in their saying that Allaah is in every place, not over His Throne. And the evidence for what the people of truth say on that is His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘<strong>The Most Merciful rose above the Throne’ (20:5), `then He rose over the Throne…’(32:4), `then they would surely have sought out a way to (ilaa) the Lord of the Throne’ (17:42), `To Him ascends all goodly words…’(35:10), `Do you feel secure that He who is over (fee) the heavens will not cause the earth to sink on you?’ (67:16), `Glorify the name of your Lord Most High’ (87:1)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this is from Uluww and likewise His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">`<strong>The Most High, The Most Great’</strong> (2:55), <strong>`The Most Great, The Most High’</strong> (13:9), <strong>`Owner of High ranks, owner of the Throne’</strong> (40:15), <strong>`They fear their Lord from above them’</strong> (16:50)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the jahmi says He is lower (then them), <strong>`He arranges every affair from the heaven and the earth, then it (affair) will go up to Him.’ (32:5),</strong> `O Jesus!  I will take you and raise you to Myself’ (3:55), <strong>`Rather Allaah raised him to Himself.’ (4:158), `From Allaah, the Lords of ways of ascent. The Angels and the Spirits ascend to Him.’(70:2-3)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for His saying, `do you feel secure that he who is “fee” the heaven’, then the meaning is `who is over (`alaa) the <strong>heaven</strong>’ .i.e. over the Throne. And the fee is being used with the meaning `alaa. Do you not see His saying, `<strong>so travel freely fee the land</strong>’ (9:2) meaning `upon (`alaa) the land’, and His saying, `<strong>and I will surely crucify you on (fee) the trucks of the palm trees</strong>’ (20:71) and all of this (i.e. interpretation of fee) is supported by His saying, `the Angels and spirits ascend to Him’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And what we have recited and the like of it from the verse to do with this topic are clear in their denial of the saying of the Mu’tazila (i.e. Allaah is everywhere). And as for their taking Istawaa metaphorically, and in it ta’wil to mean istawlaa (conquering) then this is not a meaning of it because it is not clear (ghayru dhaahir) in the language. And the meaning of istawlaa in the language is conquering/overcoming, and Allaah the Exalted does not (need to) overcome or overwhelm anyone. And He is the One, the External.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And from the right of the Words (of Allaah) is that they be taken upon their literal meanings (‘alaa haqeeqatihi), until the ummah is agreed that what is meant is the metaphorical meaning, when there is no way to follow what is revealed to us from our Lord except in that way. And the speech of Allaah is directed towards its most famous and obvious meaning if that (i.e. taking it upon its most famous meanings) is not stopped by something we have to submit to. And if all the claims of metaphors were allowed for every claimant then nothing would established from the actions of worship. And it befits Allaah that He speaks only with that which the Arab understands according to the constraints of the speech (i.e. everyday language) from what is the correctly understood by the listener. And istawaa is known in the language and understood to be: Highness (Uluww) and the rising above something and establishing (at-tamkinu) and settling in it (istiqraar feehee).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Ubaid said about His saying, `the Most Merciful Istawaa upon the Throne’ &#8211; `Above (‘alaa)…’ And others said, Istawaa meaning istaqarra (settling) and they seek support in His saying, <strong>`and when attained his full strength and was perfect (Istawaa)’</strong> (28:14) i.e. completed his youth and grew settled and there was not any increase in his youth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abdul Barr said, and istawaa is Istiqraar in highness (Uluww) [i.e. He has settled in being high], and this is what Allaah has informs us, <strong>`In order that you may mount firmly (tastu) on their backs, and then may remember the favour of your Lord when you mount (istawaytum) thereon…’</strong> (43:13), and Allaah said, `<strong>and it rested (wastawat) on mount Judi’</strong> (11:44) and He the Exalted said, <strong>`so when you embark (istawayta) and those with you on the ship’ </strong>(23:28). [i.e. all the examples show istiwaa to mean coming to rest in a elevated position]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">….and as for them using as a proof the narration of Ibn Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhu) about the saying of Allaah, <strong>`The Most Merciful istawaa upon the Throne’</strong> &#8211; `<strong>He conquered/overcame (istawlaa) all His opponents and His is everywhere</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then the answer is that this hadeeth is munkar to Ibn Abbaas (radhi Allaahu Anhu) and is transmitted by unknown and weak narrators….(takhreej omitted….and they (i.e. mu’tazila who narrated this hadeeth) do not accept the individually narrated traditions so how can they permit depending upon the likes of this hadeeth, if they had sense and were just? As for what they hear Allaah say, <strong>`And Pharaoh said, “O Haman! Build for me a tower that I may arrive at ways – the ways of heavens, and I may look upon the God of Moses but verily I think of him being a liar.”</strong>’(40:36-37) then this lends evidence to the fact that Moses (Alayhis Salam) used to say that verily my God is above the heavens and Pharaoh thought he was a liar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And also from the proofs that Allaah is over His throne, above the seven heavens is that the Believers in Tawheed (Muwahhideen), all of them Arabs and non-Arabs, when a matter concerns them, or a difficulty befalls them, they raise their faces to the heaven, and direct their raised hands to the heaven, seeking succour from Allaah, their Lord. And this is common amongst the general masses as well as the elite (khaasa)….And the Prophet (<em>ﷺ)</em> said to the slave girl whose master who wished to free her if she was a believer, so the Messenger (<em>ﷺ)</em> tested her asking her, `where is Allaah?’ So she pointed to the heaven. Then he asked, `who am I?’ So she said `you are the Messenger of Allaah’. So he said’ `set her free for she is a believer.’ So it sufficed the Messenger of Allaah (<em>ﷺ)</em> from her, her raising her face to the heaven and was content with that, not requiring anything else.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And as for their seeking support in the saying of Allaah, `there is no secret discourse of three except that he is the fourth’ then this is not the proof for them according to the literal sense of this verse. Because the scholars from the companions and taabi’een from whom the explanation of the Qur’aan is taken from, said in this explanation of this verse: He is over the Throne, and His knowledge is in every place, and no one amongst them, whose saying is depended on, differed on this. Ad-Dahhaak said about His saying, <strong>`there is no secret discourse of the three except that He is the fourth…’</strong> &#8211; <strong>`He is over His throne, and His knowledge is with them, where so ever they may be.’</strong> And it has reached me that Sufyaan ath-Thauri said something similar. Ibn Mas’ud (RadhiAllahu Anhu) said, `Allaah is over His Throne, and nothing is hidden from of your actions;” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Tamheed 7:103-105)</span></p>
