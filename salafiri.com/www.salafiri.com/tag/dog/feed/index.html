<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[379] Narrated Salim Ibn Abdullah bin `Umar (Radi Allahu Anhuma)<br />
I heard the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) saying, &#8220;He who kept a dog other than one meant for hunting or for the protection of the herd would lose two qirat of his deeds every day.&#8221; Salim said: Abu Huraira (Radi Allahu Anhu) used to say: Or the dog meant for watching the field, and he was the owner of the land.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bukhari, Book of Slaughtering and Hunting, Chapter: whoever keeps a dog that is neither for hunting nor for guarding livestock (i.e. As a pet) [no.3324]</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. Dogs are impure animals. It is not allowed to keep them in the house as a hobby (or pet) as it becomes the means of gaining less mercy since the Angels don&#8217;t enter the houses which have dogs in. Additionally, it is not allowed to eat from a bowl where a dog has put its mouth in unless it has been cleaned 7 times as well as cleaning it once with mud so that the dirt (bacteria) has been cleaned thoroughly because it&#8217;s bacteria is deadly. However if the purpose of keeping a dog is to protect yourself from burglars (i.e. Guard dog), looking after herds, farming etc then it is allowed to keep them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) Keeping a dog as a pet is not allowed and each day it is kept two qirat (When the companions enquired to the exact measure of the qirat, the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) equated the qirat to be the measure of gold as huge as a mountain) of reward will be lost.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) The Angels of mercy don&#8217;t come into houses that keep dogs</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) There are a lot of deadly bacteria in the mouth&#8217;s of dogs</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) It is allowed to keep dogs for protecting yourself from burglars (i.e. Guard dog), looking after herds, farming and hunting</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[377] </strong><strong>Narrated Abu Tha`laba Al-Khushani (Radiullahu Anhu):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>I came to the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! We are living in a land ruled by the people of the Scripture (i.e. Jews and Christians); Can we take our meals in their utensils? In that land there is plenty of game and I hunt the game with my bow and with my hound (dog) that is not trained and with my trained hound (dog). Then what is lawful for me to eat?&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for what you have mentioned about the people of the Scripture, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat out of theirs, but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash their utensils and eat out of it. If you hunt an animal with your bow after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it. and if you hunt something with your trained hound after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it, and if you hunt something with your untrained hound (and get it before it dies) and slaughter it, eat of it.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;">[REFERENCES]</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bukhari, Book of Slaughtering and Hunting, Chapter: About hunting with a bow [no.5478]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Muslim, Book of The Book of Hunting, Slaughter, and what may be Eaten, Chapter: Hunting with trained dogs and arrows [no.1930]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1)  During hunting if you shoot your arrow and say Bismillah Allahu Akbar and the game (animal) has fallen and died then its meat is halal </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2) If the hunting dog catches the game (animal) and brings it back to you then its meat is halal on the condition that when you released the hunting dog to carry out the hunt you said Bismillah Allahu akbar. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3) If you release an untrained hunting dog to carry out a hunt and it catches the game meat alive then you sacrifice it in a halal manner it is allowed to eat it. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4) This hadith clearly shows the virtue and superiority of the one who has knowledge compared to the one who is ignorant i.e. the trained (knowledgeable) dog compared to the untrained (ignorant of hunting skills) dog. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) It is allowed to use the kufars utensils and clothes on the condition that you can’t get hold of other utensils and clothes. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Before using these type of utensils or clothes they should be washed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) It is necessary to clean used utensils or clothes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) It is allowed to hunt with a trained (hunting) dog and bow and arrow (in this era it’s equivalence such as a gun).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) The takbir should be said at the time of hunting when shooting the arrow, firing the bullet or letting the hunting dog loose. The wording for the takbir is Bismillah Allahu Akbar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) It is allowed to have game meat that has been hunted by a non trained (hunting) dog on the condition that it brings the game back alive and you slaughter it in a halal manner. If the game animal is brought back dead then it is not allowed to eat it.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>The Earnings of a Prostitute, Price of Dogs and Earnings of a Fortune Teller is Prohibited</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[57] From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Abu Bakr Ibn Abd ar-Rahman Ibn al-Harith Ibn Hisham from Abu Mas’ud al-Ansari that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) forbade the sale price of a dog, the earnings of a prostitute and the earnings of a fortune teller.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Abu Bakr Ibn Abdurahman Ibn al-Harith Ibn Hisham) in Humaydi (with my verification: (no.451))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 2/656 hadith no.1400, book 31, chapter 29, hadith no.68) at-Tamhid (8/397) al-Istidhkar: (no.1321)  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.2237) and Muslim (no.1567) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) This hadith is an excellent refutation against those people who say that the selling of a dog is allowed!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2) There is a consensus that the earnings of a prostitute and earnings of a fortune teller are prohibited. (at-Tamhid (8/398))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">3) The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, “The price of a dog is evil, the earning of a prostitute is evil and the earning of a cupper is evil.” (Sahih Muslim: (41/1568)[no.4012]) The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, “The price paid for a dog is not lawful” (Sunan Abu Dawud: (no.3484) and its chain is [Hasan] good) It has come in a hadith that if someone comes to take the earnings for a dog then his hands should be filled with mud (soil). (Sunan Abu Dawud: (no.3484) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">4) The narrations in which it has been declared that selling some dogs is allowed are all [Daif] weak and rejected. For example:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1. “From Jabir that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) forbade the price of cats and dogs, except hunting dogs.” (Sunan an-Nasa’i (7/191) hadith (no.4300) and he said: it is not [Sahih] authentic, (7/309) hadith (no.4672) and he said: this is [Munkar] rejected) This narration is [Daif] weak because of the [An] of Abu Zubayr Muhammad Ibn Mutris. Abu Zubayr was a famous mudallis. (al-Fath ul-Mubin fi Tahqiq Tabaqat al-Mudalisin (pg.61, 62) number (101/3))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2. “From Abu Hurayrah that (the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam)) forbade from the earnings of a prostitute, stallions, cats and dogs except hunting dogs.” (as-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi (6/6)) This narration is weak because of two reasons: 1) the reliability of Muhammad Ibn Yahya Ibn Malik adh-Dhabi is not known. 2) Hamad Ibn Salamah and Qays Ibn Sa’d are both reliable however the narrations of Hamad from Qays are [Daif] weak. Al-Bayhaqi said, “And there is inspection (further examination, looking into, investigation, scrutinizing) (needed) in the narrations of Hamad from Qays” (also (6/6)) This narration which contains Hamad Ibn Salamah from Qays (in the chain) is present in Sahih Ibn Hiban however it does not contain the permission to sell a dog, rather it is written that, “</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">(al-Ihsan (7/217) hadith (no.4920)) Jabir Ibn Abdullah al-Ansari (Radi Allahu Anhu) was asked about the charging (buying and selling) of dogs and cats he said, “The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) has severely prohibited it.”(Sahih Muslim: (42/1569)[no.4015])</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">It is known from this that even Jabir (Radi Allahu Anhu) understood that the charging (buying and selling) of dogs and cats is not allowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">5) In Sunan Daraqutni there are some narrations ((3/72, 73) hadith (no.3045, no.3046, no.3047) whereby the permissibility of selling some dogs is known however all these narrations are [Daif] weak and rejected and Imam Daraqutni has himself declared some of the narrators to be [Daif] weak. The grading and verification of the additional narrations that the people of blind following present are below:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">“Abu Hanifa from al-Haytham from Ikrimah from Ibn Abaas he said that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) permitted in the sale price of the hunting dog” (Musnad Abu Hanifa al-Haskafi’s narration (pg.169), urdu translation (pg.319), Jami’ul Masanid of al-Khwarizmi (2/10,11)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">One of Musnad al-Haskafi’s (died 650 hijri) previous narrator was Abu Muhammad Abdullah Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ya’qub al-Harithi (urdu translation (pg.24) Musnad al-Haskafi (pg.27))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">According to the noble muhadithin, Abdullah Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ya’qub al-Harithi is severely criticised. Abu Zur’ah Ahmad Ibn al-Husayn ar-Raazi said, “[Daif] weak” (Su’alat Hamzah Ibn Yusuf as-Sahmi (no.318))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abu Ahmad al-Hafidh and Haakim Nayshapuri said, “He was a teacher, he used to make hadith (up)” (Kitab al-Qira’at Khalful Imam of al-Bayhaqi (pg.178) hadith (no.388))</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Meaning this person was a complete teacher (talented) in fabricating hadith. Khatib Baghdadi, Khalili, Ibn Jawzi, Hafidh Dhahabi etc. have criticised him. (Tarikh Baghdad (10/126) (check what taa means) (no.5262), al-Irshad of al-Khalili, (3/972) taa (no.899), kitab adh-Dhu’afa Wal Matrukin of Ibn al-Jawzi (2/141), Diwan adh-Dhu’afa of adh-Dhahabi (2/63) taa (no.2297))</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Also see Mizan al-I’tidal (2/496) and Lisan al-Mizan (3/348, 349) </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">His reliability is not established from any credible muhadith. </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">An overview of the chains of narration from Jam’ul Masanid of al-Khwarizmi is below:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1. Khwarizmi himself is not trustworthy and has an unknown reliability.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">2. Abu Muhammad al-Bukhari al-Harithi is a liar. As mentioned previously.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">3. Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Sa’id Urf Ibn Aqdah according to the majority of the muhadithin is a criticised narrator. Despite Imam Daraqutni praising him he said that he was a corrupt person meaning a rafidhi. (Tarikh Baghdad (5/22) taa (no.2365) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic) and said he used to say (spread) many [Munkar] rejected narrations. (Also and its chain is [Sahih] authentic) Abu Umar Muhammad Ibn al-Abas Ibn Muhammad Ibn Zakariya al-Baghdadi said that this person listed (wrote) criticisms about the noble companions meaning Abu Bakr and Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) in Jami’ Baratha therefore (because of this) I have abandoned his hadith. (Su’alat Hamzah as-Sahmi: (no.166) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">He (Ibn Uqdah) was also a robber, he stole books from Uthman Ibn Sa’id al-Muris son’s house. (al-Kamil fee adh-Dhu’afa of Ibn A’di (1/209) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic, Muhammad Ibn al-Husayn Ibn Mukram al-Baghdadi is reliable and Daraqutni declared him to be reliable etc.)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">It is known from this that Ibn Uqdah was a robber, unrighteous and a rafidhi.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">4. Ahmad Ibn Abdullah Ibn Muhammad al-Kindi al-Jilaj spread [Munkar] rejected hadiths on behalf of Imam Abu Hanifa. (al-Kamil of Ibn Adi (1/197)) </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Imam Abu Hanifa is not in need of these type of [Munkar] rejected hadiths. Wal Hamdullilah.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Hafidh Abdul Haq Ishbili declared this narration of Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi about the dog, to be a false hadith. (al-Ahkam al-Wasiti (3/249,248) Lisan al-Mizan (1/199))</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">5. The Imam of Asma ar-Rijal Yahya Ibn Ma’in said about Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan Ibn Farqad ash-Shaybani, “He is nothing” (Tarikh Ibn Ma’in: (no.1770))</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Imam Ibn Ma’in also said, “Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani is a jahmi liar.” (Kitab adh-Dhu’afa of al-Uqayli (4/52) and its chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">In the second chain both Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani are criticised and al-Hasan Ibn al-Husayn al-Intaki is unknown. In the third chain there is Ibn Uqdah the robber, Abdullah Ibn Muhammad al-Bukhari the liar and both Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani who have been criticised. In the fourth chain there is Husayn Ibn Muhammad Ibn Khusro al-Bakhli, al-Husayn Ibn al-Husayn Intaki the unknown, Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani who have been criticised. In the fifth chain there is Ibn Khusro, Husayn Ibn Husyan, Ahmad Ibn Abdullah al-Kindi and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan. In the sixth and last chain there is Ibn Khusro the Mu’tazali who is criticised. See Lizan al-Mizan (2/312) and Sir A’lam an-Nubala (19/592) Qadhi Abu Nasr Ibn Ishkab and Abdullah Ibn Tahir are unknown, and Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybani is criticised. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Summarised verification: This narration is false and rejected and it is not established from Imam Abu Hanifa. It is known from this that the narrations which show the permissibility for selling some types of dogs are all [Daif] weak and rejected. </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Some people have said that selling a dog is allowed in contrast to a dog’s price being prohibited and evil. See al-Hidayah of al-Mirghinani (2/101, and the words for it, (3/79)) al-Quduri ((pg.74) before chapter as-Sarf) Fath ul-Qadir of Ibn Hamam (6/345) Bida’i as-Sana’i (5/142) Kanzud Daqa’iq (pg.257) al-Bahr ur-Ra’iq (6/172) ad-Durul Mukhtar with Kashf ul-Astar (2/50) Radul Mukhtar al-Ma’ruf with Fatawa Shami (4/238, 239) Hashiyah (marginal notes) of Tahtawi ‘Ala (on) ad-Durul Mukhtar (3/127) Kitabul Fiqh ‘Ala al-Madhahib al-‘Arba’a (2/232) and al-Fiqh al-Islami Wa adilatah (4/446) etc., Rather some people have written that it is allowed to slaughter a dog and sell its meat. See Fatawa Alamghiri (3/115)!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">All these sayings are rejected because they are against the authentic ahadith.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Mulla Marghinani wrote, “Apart from (the meat of) humans and pigs, the meat and skin of those things which are not eaten become pure from slaughtering it.” (al-Hidayah (2/441) other manuscript (4/69)) </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">This fatwa is rejected because of it having no proof.</span></p>
