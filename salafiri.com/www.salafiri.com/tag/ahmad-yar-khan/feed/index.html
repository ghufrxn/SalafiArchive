<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Difference Between The Salafi’s and The Ashari’s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Herein lies the difference, the usool of the salafee is that “ we read the ahadeeth so that our intellects, opinions, desires and other than that are to be in conformity with the hadeeth leaving off everything and accepting the hadeeth” whereas the asharee says “we read the hadeeth so that it can be in conformity with our intellects and our madhab and if it does not then we either make taweel of the hadeeth to make it agreeable with our madhab, and if this is not possible then we leave the hadeeth” A great calamity indeed!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Hayaat Sindhee in Iqaz al-Humam (pg.81) whilst he was discussing the methodology of the Hanafee Ahlur  Rai said that they were engrossed in giving precedence to opinion over the text of the prophetic traditions.  This matter would be incomplete if we did not therefore mention here that the above innovated principles and other than it are not something that the modern day Asharees have established but they borrowed this from their forefathers the Hanafee, maturidee Jahmees, that is,  the current day Deobandee and Barelwis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus we find from the classical hanafee books of Usool and jurisprudence such as Talweeh’ pg.17 and ‘Usool Bazdawee’ pg.34, Usool Karkhee pg.12 stating that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“any ayat or hadeeth which is contradiction to our Madhab then we will either make taweel of it and if we cannot make taweel of it to fall within our madhab then we shall leave it”    </em>and,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“any ayah of the quran which is against our madhab then we shall either say it is abrogated or give precedence to our madhab, but it is better that we make taweel of the ayah to make it in accordance with the saying of the madhab”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Icing on the cake is that which has been said by the grandfather of the Barelwis Muftee Ahmed Yar Khan Naeemi (Jaa al Haqq, Chapter on blind following) says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“we accept the Quran and hadeeth if it is accordance with our Imaam and leave it if it contradicts the saying of our Imaam, even if it is an authentic hadeeth. To take the Quran and hadeeth upon its apparent meaning is the root of Kufr”.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So to take the attributes on their apparent meanings as accepted by the Ijmaa of the salaf is Kufr!  So here we see the deep rooted relationship between the Ashaaiarah and Hanafee Madhab, a dangerous cocktail indeed!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, if one looks carefully at the Qur’an one can clearly see that especially in relation to all of the aspects of Islaam and the aqeedah one must have just as much reliance on the Qur’an as one has on the Sunnah and one cannot suffice without the other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So concerning the Ashaa’irah, how is it that they can say that the Qur’an is to be relied upon because the ahadeeth which talk about the Names and Attributes of Allah and which clearly state that the Attributes are to be taken literally are in contradiction with various ayaat of the Qur’an. We say to them have they not read in the Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Do you not ponder over the Qur’an? And if it had been from any other than Allah then in it you would have found much conflict and difficulties.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous tabi’ee and explainer of the Qur’an Imaam Ibn Jareer at-Tabari said concerning this verse of the Qur’an,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“No doubt the revelation which would come to the Prophet of Allah would come in a clear way so that the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam could explain its meanings and tell the people about the obligations from it. Had these orders or had these revelations to the Prophet been from any other than Allah then the orders that were given by the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam in his sunnah would have differed, the meanings would have differed and the whole religion would be in conflict, but this is not the case.”(</em>Tafseer Tabaree vol.5 pg.189)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> So one can clearly see from this that had any of the sunnah been in conflict with the Qur’an then the whole religion would be something which would be unrecognisable and full of conflicts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Shafi’ee Rahimahullah said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It should be known that there is no difference to what Allah has revealed in the Qur’an and the obligations that the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam has told us about from his Sunnah, they have both come in the same manner.” (</em>ar-Risaalah ash-Shafi’ee pg.183)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Allaamah Ibn Hazm Rahimahullah says in his tremendous book ‘al-Ihkaam’:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We have clearly substantiated that there is not a single ayah of the Qur’an which is in opposition to the authentic hadeeth and no authentic hadeeth which is in opposition to any ayah of the Qur’an, there is no separation or conflict. Whoever says that there is a conflict between an authentic hadeeth and an ayah of the Qur’an then his saying is rejected and based upon falsehood.” (1/112)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Qayyim Rahimahullah said in his book A’laam ul-Muwaqqi’een:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“From the principles of the Sharee’ah it is not possible to say that any ayah of the Qur’an differs or has a conflict with a hadeeth of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam or an obligation emanating from it. In fact the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam has forbid people to claim there to be such a distinction, what is upon us is to affirm and accept that which has been revealed, for all of this is proven from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam and the revelation that Allah has sent upon him. Anyone who says other than this is upon clear misguidance and mistaken”. (</em>A&#8217;laam ul Muwaqqi&#8217;een vol.2 pg.38)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning the verse of the Quraan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And those people who have bought faith upon that which the messengers have bought and make no distinctions between them&#8230;.” (</strong>Soorah an-Nisa 4:152)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa&#8217;dee said in his tremendous Tafseer Tayseer al Kareem,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“This verse of the Qur’an clearly shows that Allah </em><em>Subhanahu wata’ala is informing us that which he has told us about concerning himself and those narrations which have been brought by the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam by way of obligations then it is mandatory for us to have belief upon it all!” (</em>Tayseer al-Kareem ar-Rahmaan Fee Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan vol.2 pg.210 with the checking of Muhammad Zuhree an-Najjar)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>In Sooratul Nahl ayah 44 it says,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“With clear signs and Books (We sent the Messengers). And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the reminder and the advice (the Quran), that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought”.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Imaam Shafi’ee said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allah Subhanahu wata’ala in His Book and religion has given the status to the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam which has been mentioned in the Qur’an itself. Therefore it is obligatory upon mankind that they accept the revelation which has been revealed to the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam by way of the Qur’an and that which has also been revealed to him by the way of the hadeeth with which he speaks. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam when he spoke he made no contradictions with the Qur’an and in fact it is just an explanation of that which Allah had already revealed upon him by way of the Qur’an.” (</em>Jaami ul-Ilm pg.118)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore it is clear that there is no hadeeth whether it is concerning the Names of Allah or his Attributes , calling upon Allah alone, worshipping only Allah or any other Ahkaam concerning the Aqeedah or other than it in contradiction to the Qur’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah has said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The sunnah was revealed upon the Prophet just as the Qur’an was also revealed upon him.” (</em>Majmoo’a al-Fataawa of Ibn Taymiyyah vol.13 pg.364)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Shawkaani says whilst explaining the hadeeth ‘I have been given the Quran and something similar to it’:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This means he has been given the Qur’an and similarly the sunnah has also been given to him by way of revelation, and this is revelation {hadeeth} which has not been mentioned in the Qur’an.” (</em>Irshaad Al Fuhul of Shawkaani pg.33)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This clearly shows that it is a fallacy for any deviant sect including those such as the ashaa’irah to claim that ‘where in the Qur’an does it say that the Hand of Allah is to be taken literally or Allah has two Eyes or that Allah has a foot which is to be taken literally having a meaning?’. In essence, the Ashaairah ask the Salafees for evidence of the existence of the principles concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah as upheld by the salaf from within the Qur’an only and this shows that they have left the way of the Ahlul Ilm and the way of the salaf in this matter also. We reply,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah Subhanahu wata’ala says in the Qur’an <strong>An Nisaa 59,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger ), if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination”.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Imaam Shaatibee says </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This ayah clearly shows that there is no conflict in the sharee’ah because Allah Subhanahu wata’ala has told those that are in conflict to refer to the sharee’ah i.e. the Qur’an and the sunnah in order to finish the conflict. So it is clear that conflict will only seize once one can refer to that which can make the conflict end. Thus, if that which is commanded to refer back to {quran and sunnah} were to have in itself conflicts then there is no point in referring to it and those who say this are upon a way which is misguided”. (</em>Al-Muwafaqaat of Shaatibee vol.4 pg.119 and Al-I’tisaam of Shaatibee vol.2 pg.309-310)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a tremendous saying of Imaam Shaatibee and more or less sums up what is to be said. How can the ashaa’irah reject certain ahadeeth because it does not fit in with their minds or they say it opposes the Quran? Not all principles concerning aqeedah are found solely in the Quran but we look also to the hadeeth with the understanding of the salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Qayyim says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If the Book of Allah and the authentic sunnah of the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam did not have the quality of resolving conflicts then Allah Subhanahu wata’ala would not have told people who are in conflict to refer to them both. For verily he would not tell the people to refer to the Book and the sunnah of the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam had there been a conflict between them two in the first place”. (</em>I&#8217;laam ul Muwaqqi&#8217;een vol.1 pg.49)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Asharis for hundreds of years have not understood what the Sahaaba and tabi’een understood thousands of years ago. For example, concerning the conflicts that the people talk about between the authentic hadeeth and the Qur’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Imaam Maymoon bin Mehraan who was born in the year 40A.H. and passed away in the year d.118A.H having met many companions said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“To refer back to Allah Subhanahu wata’ala is to refer to his Book and when the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam was alive then the people would refer to him in person and now that he has passed away then one must refer to his blessed sunnah.” (</em>Tafseer Tabari vol.5 pg.96, Mushkilul Athaar of Tahawi vol.1 pg.484, al-Faqeeyah of Imaam Khateeb al-Baghdadi vol.1 pg.144 with a hasan isnaad.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Shawkaani says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Verily there is a consensus of all of the muslims from the salaf and those after them in the present times from the companions and other than them that in the affairs of the religion where there is a conflict between the sayings of the scholars then it is obligatory for the person to refer back to the Book of Allah and the sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad sallalahu alaihi wasallam and this has been mentioned in the Qur’an in Soorah Nisa ayah 59:</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>‘O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.’</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And this is to refer to Allah Subhanahu wata’ala meaning to refer to His Book and to refer to the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam means to refer to the Sunnah after his death. There is no one that has differed concerning this, from amongst the muslims.”</em> (Sharh as-Sudoor pg.1)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is not a single example from the Prophet life that by passed the Muslim Ummah. The act of worship such as the Adhaan is done five times a day which was legislated 10 years after Hijraa and it was done In front of the prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) in Madeenah, and in the books of ahadeeth we have its history and the Mu-adhdhin. But it is not in a single narration that one should kiss his thumbs on hearing the Adhaan, if we do want to kiss something then we might as well as kiss the Muadhdhin lips who utters the A’dhaan five times a day. This action of kissing the thumbs on hearing the Adhaan was never practiced during the time of the pious predecessors.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Their Evidences</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> The narration is that which is attributed to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (Radhiallaahu Anhu) that when he heard the Mu-adhdhin say “Ashhaadu anna muhammadur rasoolullah” he would kiss his thumbs and fingers (Index) and then touch his eyes and the prophet saw said whoever does this like my beloved has done then my intercession will be compulsory for him.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has been narrated in Musnad Firdaus by Daylamee Tadhkirrah al-Mawdhoo’aat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.36</span>, al-Mawdhoo’aat Kabeer <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.75</span>, Ahmad Yaar khaan Bareilwee in Jaa ul-Haq pg 378 from Maqaasid Hasanah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.384</span>, Mukhtasar al-Maqaasid <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.174</span>, Muhammad Umar Bareliwee in Maqyaas Khaafiyat pg. 603, also al-Lulu Wal-Marsoo’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.505</span>, at-Tamayyiz <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.154</span>, al-Khisf 2/269-270, al-Asraar al-Marfoo’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.306</span>, al-Masnoo’ah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.168-169</span>, al-Fawaa’id <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.19</span>, Asnee al-Mataalib <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.276</span> and Nukhbah al- Baheeyyah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.112</span>)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Muhammad Taahir writes </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Wa Laa Yasaheeh” not Saheeh (Tadhkirrah al-Mawdhoo’aat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.36</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mulla Alee Qaaree from Allaamah Sakhawee that this narration is not Saheeh (al-Mawdhoo’aat Kabeer <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.75</span>) Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Tarbulusee Hanafee (d.1305) said, “Sakahwee has rejected it and said this is not authentic.” (al-Lulul al-Marsoo’ah Feemaa al-Asal Lahu WaBaa Asli Mawdhoo <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.505</span> <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.168</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the hadeeth is not Saheeh then how can you act upon it. Ahmad Yaar khan Bareilwee quotes Sakhawi that he said “wa lam yasaheeh” and translates it as “its level of authenticity does not reach a high level”. What Muhammad Umar did was even more strange, he mentions the hadeeth from Tadhkirrah al-Mawdhoo’aat and al-Mawdhoo’aat Kabeer and does not mention “la yasaheeh” deliberately.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to this, it opposes the established Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) where he informed us to repeat the words of the A’dhaan when the mu’adhin says the a’dhaan and then send salutations upon me and Allaah will shower 10 blessing upon him. (Saheeh Muslim 1/166, Abu Dawood 1/77), in another hadeeth he said, ‘Whoever says these words (of the A’dhaan) with sincerity then he enter Paradise.” Saheeh Muslim 1/167, Abu Dawood 1/78).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Answering the A’dhaan has been narrated by a number of companions, Abu Hurairah, Abee Raaf’e, Umm Habeebah, Abdullaah bin Rabee’a, A’ishah, Mu’adh, Mu’awiyyah and others (Radhiallaahu Anhuma). (refer to Tirmidhee with Tuhfah 1/183, Talkhees al-Habeer 1/211, Tamheed 10/134, Irwaa ul-Ghaleel 1/258, Baihaqee 1/409)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Mistake of Ahmad Yaar Khaan Na’eemee Bareliwee.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He writes </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Not reaching the level of Saheeh does not necessarily mean that it is Da’eef because the rating of Hasan is after Saheeh, and if this is Hasan then it is enough” (Jaa ul-Haq <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.382</span>). But he should know that when the Muhaditheen say “la yasaheeh” mutlaq (absolutely) it means nothing else except that it is Da’eef. If it was Hasan they would have explained and said Ya laisa bissaheeh bil hasanun,</span></em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Removing a Doubt.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mulla Alee Qaree says </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If this hadeeth is Saheeh up to Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) then it is enough to act upon it because the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) said “my Sunnah and the Sunnah of my rightly guided Khulapha is obligatory upon you” (al-Mawdhoo’aat al-Kabeer <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.65</span>]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Yar khaan (Jaa ul-Haq <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.382</span>) and Muhammad Umar (Maqyaas Khaafiyat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.602</span>) also use the same reasoning. But this is Mulla Alee Qaaree’s conscious because if this hadeeth was Mauqoof up to Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) then it would have been a Hujjah but the narration that is attributed to Abu Bakr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) is Marfoo and its Sanad is not Saheeh all the way so then to say that the Marfoo hadeeth is not Saheeh and the mauqoof is Saheeh then how is it enough to say that this is sufficient.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Ruling On Acting Upon Weak Ahadeeth</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Yaar Khaan writes </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“That if it is accepted that this hadeeth is Da’eef, then in virtuous actions Daeef hadeeth are enough.” (Jaa ul-Haq <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.383</span>]. </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is also his incorrect understanding, that every Da’eef ahadeeth is accepted in actions of virtue, this is totally wrong.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Qadhee ibn al-Arabi al-Maliki (d.543H) and others have said regarding Da’eef ahadeeth</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “{La ya’mal bihi mutlaqan), it is Absolutely incorrect to act upon them.” (al-Qawl al-Badee’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.165</span>]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Those who act upon them have conditions so Imaam ibn Daqeeq al-Eed (d.702h) writes </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Acting on Da’eef ahadeeth has conditions.” (Imaam 2/171)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What are those conditions, Imaam Sakhawi (d.902h) writes by quoting his Shaykh Haafidh ibn Hajr, “Acting upon Da’eef ahadeeth has three conditions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1.That all the Muhaditheen agree that the hadeeth is not extremely Daeef ie the hadeeth in which the narrators are not kadhaabs, who may be suspected or accused kadhaabs, or any such narrator who is munfarid (alone), who made a lot of mistakes then his Daeef hadeeth will not be a normal Daeef ahadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. That the Hadeeth is not present under baseless principles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. While acting one has the belief that the hadeeth is not proven from the</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Prophet (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) so that something is not attributed to him that he did not say. (al-Qawl al-Badee’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.195</span>, Tadreeb ur-Raawee 1/298-299, Fath al-Mugeeth 1/268)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find that if anyone of the criteria above are missing, then in any circumstances the hadeeth does not need to be acted upon. Especially the 3rd condition because the that which is not proven from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) and if one tries to attribute it to him and then to accept it as proven from him is a major crime indeed because it totally opposes the Mutawatir Narration of “He who intentionally attributes a lie to me, then let him take his seat in the Fire of Hell”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maulana Abdul Hayy Lucknowee writes </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The claim that acting upon Da’eef ahadeeth in the issue of virtue without difference is Baatil, Yes this is the opinion of the majority but the condition is that the Hadeeth is not severely Da’eef otherwise it will also not be accepted in the issues of virtues actions” (al-Aathaar al-Marfoo’aah Fee al-Akhbaar al-Mawdhoo’aah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.310</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It’s a pity the innovators put heels on end to prove such Ahadeeth. What beautiful words said a Bareilwee (Which is extremely rare) who said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“To accept Ahadeeth and attributing it to the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was- Sallam) needs proof, an attribution without proof is not permissible. (Arfaan Sharee’at 3/27)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As A result acting on Da’eef Ahadeeth pertaining to virtues actions must comply with the 3 conditions and acting upon them is Mustahab on the condition that it is not Mawdoo. If the narration is Mawdoo then there is no action upon it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Daqeeq writes </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If the Hadeeth is Da’eef on the condition that it is not Mawdoo, then acting upon it is permissible. But if by it a new custom arises or is born in the Deen as a result then it also forbade from.” (Ahkaam al-Ahkaam 1/51)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So here another point has been resolved and that is that the Da’eef ahadeeth is only acted upon when it is not Mawdoo (Fabricated) or forged bearing in mind that any Da’eef hadeeth which leads to a custom in the Deen, will be stopped. The people of innovation try to make such actions as the Sunnah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Sakhawee writes, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“That it is permissible and Mustahab to act upon Da’eef Ahadeeth which Command virtues actions and encouragement, but the condition is that the Ahadeeth are not fabricated or forged.” (al-Qawl al-Badee’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.195</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“However The Mawdoo Hadeeth, Then it is not permissible to act upon them in any circumstances.” (al-Qawl al-Badee’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.196</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The summary is that it permissible to act upon Da’eef Ahadeeth in actions of virtue and this has some conditions set by the Muhadditheen and the Ahadeeth which are Mawdoo or forged then there is no action upon them neither in the issue of virtues or encouragement. Not only are the Ahadeeth concerning the kissing of the thumbs Da’eef but infact it is mawdoo ie fabricated and forged.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Jalaal ud Deen Suyootee writes, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Those ahadeeth which mention the kissing of the fingers and then placing them on the eyes when the Mu’adhdhin mentions the name of the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was- Sallam), all of them are fabricated.” (Tayseer al-Maqaal Lil Suyootee from E’emaad ud-Deen <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.123</span>]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is another narration from Khidr (Alayhee Wassalaatu Wasalaam) which mentions the thumbs in Tadhkirrah al-Mawdhoo’aat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.36</span>, al- Mawdhoo’aat al-Kabeer <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.75</span>, Ahmad Yaar khaan Bareilwee in Jaa ul-Haq <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.378</span> from Maqaasid al-Hasanah, Muhammad Umar in Maqyaas Khaafiyat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.601</span>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Muhammad Taahir and Mulla Alee Qaaree write, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“There are a lot of Majhool (Unknown) Narrators in the chain and it is also Manqat’a (Disconnected).” (Tadhkirrah al-Mawdhoo’aat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.36</span>, al-Mawdhoo’aat al-Kabeer <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.75</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then how can we insert this narration in the Deen, Imaam Baihaqee writes in one place, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“That in this chain there are a number of unknown narrators, and Allaah has not made us responsible that we take our Deen from unknown narrators.” (Kitaab al-Qir’ah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.127</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Muhammad Naasir ud Deen al-Albaanee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“This hadeeth is not Saheeh and has been attributed to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeque (Marfooan) by Daylamee in Musnad al-Firdaus. But ibn Taahir says in at-Tadhkirrah that it is not Saheeh and Imaam Shawkaani also says the same in al- Hadeeth al-Mawdhoo’aah (pg.9) and Sakhawee has also said that it is not Saheeh in al-Maqaasid.” (Silsilah Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah Wal-Mawdhoo’ah <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.73</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Imaam al-Allaamah al-Faadhil Muhammad Nazeer Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawee was asked about this and other similar ahadeeth that mention the wiping of the eyes upon hearing the A’dhaan, he replied, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“All of the ahadeeth in this regard are not authentic not a single one nor is a single one established nor can they be found in any reliable book. The investigators and criticisers of hadeeth spoke about all these ahadeeth and concluded they and not authentic and are infact fabricated.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Shams ud deen Abul-Khair Muhammad Wajeeh ud deen Abdur- Rahmaan as-Sakhawee in Maqaasid al-Hasanah, shaikh ul-Islaam the translator of Bukhaari, Hasan bin Alee Hindee, Ibn Rabee’a ash-Shaafi’ee, Zarqaanee Maalikee and Muhammad Taahir Fitnee Hanafee all said said about this hadeeth, “Laa Ya-Sahah.” and La Ya-Sahah means the hadeeth is not established.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Muhammad Taahir Patnee wrote in his Tadhkirrah, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Our words La Ya-Sahah are used when something is not established.”  Shaikh ul-Islaam wrote in his translation of Bukhaari, “After mentioning the hadeeth for wiping the eyes after hearing the words of the A’dhaan) These ahadeeth are established at all.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hasan bin Alee Hindee, the author of Sabeel al-Janaan wrote in his notes (Ta’leeqaat) to Mishkaat al-Masabeeh,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “That which has been narrated about wiping the eyes when hearing the words of the A’dhaan, then they are not established.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mahmood Ahmad Aynee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“It is obligatory upon everyone who hears the A’dhaan to stop anything they are doing and to answer the A’dhaan.” and he goes onto further explain. Muhammad Ya’qoob Nabnaanee mentioned in Khair al-Jaaree Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari the statement of Aynee and said, “From those things that are prohibited are the wiping of the eyes when hearing the words of the A’dhaan.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah Abu Ishaaq bin Abdul-Jabbaar Kaabulee wrote in Sharh Risaalah Abdus-Salaam Lahooree, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The ahadeeth mentioing the wiping of the eyes when hearing the words of the A’dhaan are not established and they are weak narrations and this is why the scholars of hadeeth have clearly said all such ahadeeth are fabricated.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Abul-Hasan Abdul-Ghaafir Faarsee, the author of Mufham Sharh Saheeh Muslim and Majma’a al-Gharaa’ib, has written in Kitaab Aqwaal al- Aakazeeb after mentioing the hadeeth from Daylaamee’s Musnad al- Firdaus, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“There are many narrations mentioning the kissing of the thumbs when hearing the words of the A’dhaan, but they have no basis, nor with a weak chain and Haafidh Abu Nu’aym Asfahaanee said all that which has been narrated in this regard, then all of them are fabricated.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Suyootee wrote in Kitaab Tayseer al-Maqaal, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Those ahadeeth which mention the kissing of the fingers and then placing them on the eyes when the Mu’adhdhin mentions the name of the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam), then all of them are fabricated.” The Imaam has also mentioned this in his book ad-Durar al-Muntathirah Fee Ahadeeth al- Muntashirah.” (and much more refer to Fataawa Nazeeriyyah 1/248-251)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Allaamah Muhammad Abdul-Jaleel Saamroodee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Issue: the issue of wiping the eyes with the thumbs when hearing the A’dhaan, Shaamee <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.413</span> mentions from Jarhee who said nothing of this is established from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam). Allaamah Lucknowee writes in Sa’ayah 2/46, “The haqq is is that there is no hadeeth or report (authentic) from the Prophet concerning the wiping of the eyes when hearing the A’dhaan.” So whoever says this is correct is indeed a big liar and this is a despicable innovation, which has no basis in the books of Sharee’ah and whoever does bring any evidences, then it is just for argumentation. Allaamah Muhammad Taahir Fitnee said in Majma’a Bahaar al-Anwaar <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.511</span>, “The hadeeth that mentions the kissing of the thumbs is not authentic.” Similarly that which has been narrated from Khidr (Alayhis-Salaam),Shaah Abdul-Azeez said in his Fataawa this action is not mentioned in any reliable hadeeth nor has it been reported from the rightly guided khulafa, nor is this Sunnah or something recommended rather it is an innovation and one should refrain from doing this and that which has been mentioned in the books of jurists is not reliable and so on…” (Zahrah Riyaadh al-Abraar Maa Ya’anee an-Naas Ann Hamal al-Asfaar <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.76-77</span>)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the following scholars held this narration to be fabricated</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Taahir in Tadhkirrah al-Mawdhoo’aat <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.36</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Khaleel Tarbulusee in al-Lulu Wal-Marsoo’a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.505</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and finally we conclude with the position of the leader and Imaam of the bareilwee soofee sect, the Imaam of Gibril Haddad and others,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khaan Bareilwee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“When hearing the name of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) and then kissing the thumbs and rubbing them on the eyes is not established from any marfoo hadeeth and that which is narrated concerning this is not free from any speech, so whoever considers such an evidence (ie one that has speech concerning it) or considers (the action) to be practiced or considers the abandoning of this practice to be worthy of censure, then indeed he is upon error.” (Abar al-Maqaal Fee Qiblatil Ajlaal <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.12</span>)</span></em></p>
