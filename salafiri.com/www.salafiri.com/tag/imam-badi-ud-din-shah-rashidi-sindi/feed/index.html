<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>AYĀT FROM THE QURĀN ON THE CREED OF THE SALAF. </strong></span></h4>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Indeed your Lord is Allāh, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty).</strong><strong>[Al-Arāf:54]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Surely, your Lord is Allāh Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty), disposing the affair of all things. </strong><strong>[Yūnas:2]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Allāh is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then, He rose above (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty). [Ar-Rʿad:2]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawa) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty) </strong><strong>[Taha:5]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six Days. Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). The Most Gracious (Allāh)! Ask Him as He is Al-Khabîr (The All-Knower of everything i.e. Allāh). </strong><strong>[Al-Furqān 59]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Allāh it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six Days. Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Walî (protector or helper) or an intercessor. Will you not then remember (or receive admonition)? </strong><strong>[As-Sajdah:4]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, and what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. And Allāh is the All-Seer of what you do. </strong><strong>[Al-Hadīd:4]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ISTIWĀ’ WITH THE MEANING OF ‘IRTIFĀ’ TO BE HIGH AND ABOVE.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is recorded in the Sahīh of Al-Bukhārī in the book of Tawhīd, chapter of ‘His Throne Was Above The Water<em>’</em> from <em>Abū Ālīyah that, “His saying “He rose above the heavens” meaning ‘Irtifā’ [he rose].” Mujāhid said it means “He rose high/above’ his Throne” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Ḥajr says <em>“Abū ʿĀlīyahs report has been cited by Ibn Jarīr in mawsūl via the route of ʿAbdullāh bin Jʿafar’s from his father from Abū ʿĀlīyah and Mujāhids report has been transmitted by al-Faryābī in his Tafsīr in mawsūl via the route of Warqā from Ibn Abī Najīh from Mujāhid.”</em> [Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī [22/427] and Fath al-Bārī of Ibn Ḥajr [17/176]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Imām Ishāq Ibn Rahawaihah states that he he heard from numerous specialist explainers of the Qurān that the meaning of <strong>“</strong><strong>The Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawā) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)”</strong> <em>“is that ‘Irtifā’ he rose/above.”</em>  [Jalāl ud-Dīn al-Qāsmī, Tafsīr Maḥāsin ut-Tā’wīl [7/2703]</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>TO SAY ‘ISTAWĀ’ [HE ROSE ABOVE] MEANS ‘ISTĪLĀ’ [HE CONQUERED] IS TOTALLY INCORRECT. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ismāʿīl al-Harawī narrates in his book <em>‘al-Fārūq’</em> with a chain of transmission from Dawūd bin Khalf that he was with Muḥammad bin Ziyād al-Lughawī when a man asked him about the ayah <strong>“</strong><strong>The</strong><strong> Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawā) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)</strong><strong> [Ta-ḥa 4].” </strong><em>He replied, “We accept it as he has informed us. The man said it means “he overcame and conquered [Istawlā].” al-Harawī replied, “Istawlā would only be correct if head any competitor or challenger to overcome so this cannot be correct.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad bin Aḥmad bin Naḍr al-Azdī transmits that he heard from Muḥammad bin Ziyād Al-Lughawī who said that <em>“Aḥmad Bin Dawūd enquired of me whether I could investigate whether the word “Istawā’ [he rose] has ever been recorded in the Arabic language as “Istawlā [He conquered]? I replied, “I swear by Allāh that I searched for this and could not find it in any place.”</em> [Fath al-Bārī of Ibn Ḥajr [17/177]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, the Hāfiẓ Ibn Qayyīm has recorded in his monumental work <em>‘As-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah’</em> over 42 replies to rebut the fact that ‘Istiwā’ in this verse does not mean ‘He conquered or overcame’. From amongst these are:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The third response is that al-Khattābī mentions in his book ‘Shiʿār ud-Dīn’ that, “Some have considered that Istiwā here means he overpowered basing this on some lines of poetry and these are not such that they can be used an evidential basis. If it meant as they say that he overpowered/conquered then this would render the verse confusing as Allāh’s knowledge and power is all encompassing then why would he need to ‘conquer’ his Throne whilst this is the case? The word ‘istawlā’ he overpowered would only be used for one who was stopped from something and then through struggle he achieved success by overpowering. So what is it that they say was ‘stopping or restricting’ Allāh? So these are the words of Al-Khattābī who was from amongst those who were known as a linguist.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,<em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The fifth response is that to say as they say falls under the forbidden action of explain the Qurān based on one’s own intellect. No Companion OF Muhammad, a successor of theirs or any scholar of the Muslims [mufassirs] have explained as they have. Let them know that Muhammad the prophet said that ‘let him take a seat in the fire of hell who explains the Qurān with his own opinion.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The tenth response is that the words ‘istawā’ and ‘istīlā’ have not been considered interchangeable in use by the scholars of the Arabic language and this is due to the reason that they both have distinct and separate features and meanings. Those who claim other than this are lying. Research the Qurān, Sunnah and Arabic language and syntax and you will never find that the word ‘istawā’ has come in the meaning of or interchangeable with ‘istīlā”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The fifteenth response is that Imam Abūl Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī has recorded a consensus that to take ‘istawā’ with the meaning of ‘istīlā’ is wholly incorrect.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The twenty seventh response is that the one amongst the creation who knows most about his lord is prophet Muhammad who has described in numerous traditions that Allāh is high and above and these traditions are an evidence of the explanation of such ayat”</em> [Mukhtaṣar as-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah, Muhammad al-Mawṣalī [2/321-326]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some have figuratively attempted to explain (Tāwīl) the fourth ayah and said that ʿAla is the action (Fʿil) and ar-Rahman is the one who does the act (Faʿil) and the Faʿil of Istawa is the ʿArsh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zarkashī refutes this (Tāwīl) and says, <em>“This is refuted from two angles the first is that the mu’awil (the one who did the tāwīl) made the attribute into an action and all of the scripts of the Qurān in Shām, ʿIrāq and Ḥijāz have ʿAla as a harf and if this was Fʿil (ie action) it would have been written with a Lām and ālif like for example at another instance it says, “Walʿalā Baḍuhum ʿala Bʿaḍ. The second reasons is the mu’awil rendered ʿArsh as marfū whereas none of the reciters ie Qura recite it like this.” </em>[Zarkashī, al-Burhān Fī ʿUlūm al-Qurān [2/81]  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the third reason is that it will contradict the other ayahs.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THOSE AYAT WHICH MENTION ALLĀH BEING ‘ISTAWĀ’ ABOVE THE HEAVENS. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything. </strong><strong>[Al-Baqarah:29]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2] </strong><strong>Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: &#8220;Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.&#8221; They both said: &#8220;We come, willingly.” [Fuṣilat:11]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already recorded the narration from <em>Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī</em> from Abu ʿĀlīyah that ‘istawā means he rose high above.’ In fact Ibn Qayyīm quotes an Ijmāʿ consensus that <em>“The meaning here is he rose high above.”</em> [Mukhtaṣar as-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah [2/320]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Baghawī explains the above ayat in his <em>‘Tafsīr Muʿālim ut-Tanzīl’</em> notes on Khāzin’ states, <em>“Many explainers of the Qurān from the Salaf and Ibn ʿAbbās explain this ayat to mean he rose above.”</em> [Tafsīr Muʿālim ut-Tanzīl [1/37]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Jarīr whilst explaining the above ayāt in his Tafsīr states in his Tafsīr <em>‘Jāmʿe ul-Bayān’</em> that, <em>‘The true meaning of the verse <strong>‘</strong></em><strong><em>He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything </em></strong><strong><em>[Al-Baqarah 29]</em></strong><em>’ is that he went high and rose above. Allāh showed his wisdom in creating the heavens and the earths. It is very strange that those who oppose this go against what is understood by the language of the Arabs, that is, he rose and was high. They prefer such meanings as they themselves give thinking that they will escape giving the verse a meaning which is not befitting to Allāh according to their own intellects. In fact, if he were to consider carefully his own explanation then in it he will find that which he was trying to avoid, for example, if he says istawā means he ‘turned towards/observed’ the heavens then we reply, was he ‘not observing/turned away’ from the heavens that you say he had to then ‘turn towards’ them? And if he replies, yes to this then we ask what is it that you base this on? In reality, his explanation causes more conflict and confusion and this is the very thing that he aimed to avoid in the first place. Praise be to Allāh I this way we reply to all those who oppose the truth and deviate from the true understanding of the Qurān. Abū Jʿafar said, that if someone were to ask us whether Allāh’s istiwā towards the heavens was before the heavens were created or after? Then we reply, it was after the heavens were created but Allāh said before he created the seven heavens that ‘</em><strong><em>Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: &#8220;Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.&#8221; They both said: &#8220;We come, willingly.’</em></strong><em> [Fussilāt 11]. </em><em>So the istiwā was after the creation of the smoke but before the formation of them into seven heavens. </em><em> </em><em>In regards to the word in the verse ‘Fasawwahunna’ i.e., [he made them] then this means that he created and originated them. He made them as he willed with perfection and suitability.  In Arabic ‘taswiyah’ means to make something correct and suitable, as it is said in the language ‘so and so made such a thing suitable’. So Allāh created the heavens in a most suitable way as he willed and planned and when they close he opens them as per his will.”</em> [Tafsīr at-Ṭabarī [1/192]</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE MENTION OF THE ‘GREAT THRONE’ OF ALLĀH. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] But if they turn away, say (O Muhammad): &#8220;Allāh is sufficient for me. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), in Him I put my trust and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne. </strong><strong>[At-Tawbah:129] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2] </strong><strong>And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. [Hūd:7]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[3] Had there been therein (in the heavens and the earth) âlihah (gods) besides Allāh, then verily both would have been ruined. Glorified is Allāh, the Lord of the Throne, (High is He) above all that they attribute to Him! [Al-Anbiyā:21]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[4]   </strong> <strong>Say: &#8220;Who is (the) Lord of the seven heavens, and (the) Lord of the Great Throne?&#8221; (86) They will say: &#8220;Allāh.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Will you not then fear Allāh (believe in His Oneness, obey Him, believe in the Resurrection and Recompense for every good or bad deed)?&#8221; </strong><strong>[Al-Muminūn:86-87]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[5] So Exalted is Allāh, the True King, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne! [Al-Muminūn:116]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[6] </strong><strong>Allāh, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne! [An-Naml:26] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[7] (He is Allāh) Owner of High Ranks and Degrees, the Owner of the Throne. [Al-Ghāfir:15] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[8] </strong><strong> Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted is He from all that they ascribe (to Him). [Az-Zukhruf:82]</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[9] </strong><strong>Owner of the Throne, the Glorious. </strong><strong>[AL-Burūj:16] </strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE MEANING OF ARSH [THRONE]. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the meaning itself of Throne is the indication of Allāh being high and above as is found in the verses and narrations. Then it should be known that Allāh being above his Throne shows he is above it and ‘bāin ʿanil Khalq’ separate and distinct from his creation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Bakr al-Ājurī said in his book <em>‘ash-Sharīʿah’</em> that, <em>“It is the madhab of the scholars that Allāh is above his Throne above the heavens. His knowledge encompasses all. He knows that which is in the heavens, earth and that which is beneath it. He knows that which is open and hidden. He knows that which is concealed in the chests and the deceitful eyes. He knows the affairs of the hearts and every beat it takes before it occurs. There is not a particle in the heavens or earth except that he is aware of it. He is above his Throne. He raises the deeds of the people up towards himself and he is aware of their deeds even more so than those angels whose duty it is to record such deeds.” </em>[Imām Abū Bakr al-Ājurī, ash-Sharīʿah [pg.288]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the first ayah above, <em>“It shows he is the originator and owner and this is why he is the owner of the great Throne. His Throne is a ceiling for all of creation including all of the heavens, earth and all that is what is between them. His knowledge is encompassing everything. His decree is upon everything and he is the creator of all.” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [2/404]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Tafsīr <em>‘Madārik ut-Tanzīl’</em> of Nasafī’ considers the ayah <em>“The Lord of the mighty Throne’ that the greatest of the creation was his Throne, which is a place of where duʿā is directed by those in the heavens.”</em> [Tafsīr Nasafī [2/152]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the second ayah above, <em>“Ibn Abbās (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhuma) said that the Throne was given this title as it is something which is high/above. Ismāʿīl bin Abī Khālid said he heard Sʿād Ṭā’ī say that the Throne is red/ruby in colour. Muḥammad bin Ishāq said concerning the verse <strong>‘And</strong></em><strong><em> He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds’, </em></strong><em>that, it is as he has described. There is nothing but water, upon this is the great Throne and above this is Allāh, the owner of all majesty and great, the wisest, the ablest and the one who is most merciful, wise all bountiful. He does as he wills and wishes.”</em> [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [2/437]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Nasafī states concerning the second verse, <em>“Meaning that his Throne was above the water, that is, before the creation of the heavens and the earth there was nothing but water beneath his Throne.”</em> [Tafsīr Nasafī [2/13]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is stated in <em>‘Tafsīr al-Futūhat al-Ilāhīyah lil Jamal’</em> that, <em>“He was where he is now, that is, above the seven heavens and the water was where it is now, that is, below his Throne.” </em>[Tafsīr al-Futūhat al-Ilāhīyah lil Jamal [2/382]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the fourth ayah above, <em>“He is the lord of the mighty Throne which is a ceiling for his creation. It is mentioned in the narration transmitted by Abū Dawūd that the prophet said ‘Your Lords status is the greatest and his Throne is above the heavens’. [after recording a few more narrations] Ḍihāk narrates from Ibn Abbās (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) that ‘it is called ʿArsh [Throne] due to it being lofty/high’. Aʿmash narrates from Kʿab al-Ahbār that the heavens and earth in relation to the Throne are as if a small lamp is lit hanging in between the heaven and the earth. Mujāhid states that ‘the heavens and earth in relation to the Throne are like a small ring which are left in a vast plain.” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [3/253]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the fifth ayah above, <em>“The Throne is a ceiling for the entire creation. It is called ‘ʿArshul Karīm’ [supreme Throne] as it is the most beautiful to look at greatest presence.  As Allāh has said ‘</em><em>And We send down water (rain) from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind to grow therein.’ [Luqmān:9]” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [3/259]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Nasafī states, <em>“It is called supreme Throne as all mercy from Allāh descends from there or that the closest most supreme angels surround it.” </em>[Tafsīr Nasafī [3/130]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Khāzin records that, <em>“Karīm, that is beautiful. Others have said it means high. It is recorded as such by Baghawī in his footnotes on Khāzin.”</em> [Tafsīr al-Khāzin [5/38]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shawkāni states in his <em>‘Tafsīr Fath al-Qadīr’ </em>that, <em>“It is called the supreme Throne because Allāh descends his mercy to his creation from it or it is supreme due to the fact that the one who is above it [the Throne] is the most supreme as it is said by the Arabs ‘the noble house’, meaning that the one who resides in it is noble.” </em>[Fath al-Qadīr [3/485]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the ninth ayah above, <em>“Glorious Throne, that is, he is the owner of the great Throne which is above all of creation.”</em> [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [4/496]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nasafī states, <em>“Glorious, that is, the creator of the Throne is the most glorious and greatest. Glorious here also refers to his Throne as well as himself. Meaning, that the one who is the owner of the Throne is even more Glorious than it.” </em>[Nasafī [4/346]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in Jalālayn it says, <em>“Glorious, that is, the owner and creator of the Throne is the most glorious. Glorious, meaning that the one who is completely deserving of the attribute of being highest and it is like this in ‘Jamal’ and ‘Maḥāsin at-Tā’wīl.”</em>  [Jalalayn [12/422], Jamal [4/515] and Maḥāsin at-Tā’wīl [18/6118]  </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Publishers Foreword</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Alhamdullilahi Rabbil A’lamīn, Waṣalatu Wasalam Ala Rasūlillahil Karīm,  Wa, Ba’d</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is a long awaited translation of Allāmah Badīʿ ud-Dīn Shāh ar-Rashīdī as-Sindis [1416H] ‘Tawhīd Khāliṣ’, The Pure Tawhīd. In it the Shaikh answers two questions about where is Allāh and whether we can ask Allāh through intermediaries with his answer spanning over 625 pages!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The book was first published around 1398H/1977ce and then in 1415H /1994ce during Shaikh Badʿī ud Dīn’s lifetime and in recent times a new edition has also been published. The brothers Abū Ḥibbān and Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī first began translating this book in late 1995ce.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Over the years the translation continued sporadically and most times portion or excerpts would be given to brothers who were confused on this issue in around the city of Birmingham, England, contrary to the common desperate lies of those who claimed issues of fiqh were always discussed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We urge all those who are serious students of knowledge to study this book with great detail as in it are evidences, rebuttals, refutations and principles which the Shaikh has explained in magnificent detail. We promise those who advocate shirk and bidʿah and the so called evidences are fully answered in this book as the Shaikh leaves no stone unturned with the help and will of Allāh</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To our limited knowledge there has never been a book written in the sub continent with such detail and exposure on these topics as the one before you. May Allah accept it from these two poor servants of Allāh whose aid is sought.]</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>S</strong><strong>alafi</strong> <strong>R</strong><strong>esearch</strong> <strong>I</strong><strong>nstitute</strong> <strong>2015</strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Praise be to Allāh, we seek His help and His forgiveness. We seek refuge with Allāh from the evil of our own souls and from our bad deeds. Whomsoever Allāh guides will never be led astray, and whomsoever Allāh leaves astray, no one can guide. I bear witness that there is no god but Allāh, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islam (as Muslims) with complete submission to Allāh.’<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person, and from him He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women, and fear Allāh through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship) Surely, Allāh is Ever an All-Watcher over you.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a>’ </em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>“O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allāh and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><strong>[3]</strong></a> <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><strong>[4]</strong></a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>To proceed,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You have asked concerning two questions of fundamental importance to a Muslims creed so beginning in the name of Allāh and we ask him for guidance and we will answer both questions in great detail and clarify both issues with textual and intellectual overwhelming evidences. We supplicate to Allāh that he guides all the Muslims to tread upon the straight path and preserve us from the evilness and effect of Shayṭān. Amīn Oh creator of everything that exists.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>Question</em></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Amongst the Muslims today there are five different beliefs concerning the Tawhīd of Allāh.  [First Type] A group of scholars explains Tawhīd to mean that everything that exists is Allāhs creation and that he is separate from his creation and who is in his self and his Dhāt ie essence rises over his Throne.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Second Type] Mawlāna Rūmī who was a scholar of the Qurān and a mufassir, whose statements of poetry are often uttered by the people for years, says in his Mathnawī that it is Allāh himself in the creation and everything prostrates to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Third Type] Another Sūfī elder and an expert in poetry in the Multānī language, Khāwaja Ghulām Farīd represents another specific group in the following couplets that, He has all the right and might the one who is Ahmad, he also said, there is no difference between Aḥad (one and Aḥmad as they are one in Dhāt and Ṣifāt and he says, Aḥad is he and Aḥmad is he without any difference.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Fourth Type] The fourth type of Tawḥīd was explained a famous elder and luminary Ḥājī Imdādullāh Muhājir Makkī, who is the Pīr and Murshid ie the spiritual guide and leader of the deobandīs. He is considered to have a lofty and high status among the Sūfīs. Likewise, and similarly he is revered and venerated to be a holy elder by the Barelvīs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says in his book, ‘Shamaim Imdādīyyah’,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Man before his existence was a hidden god himself and God appears to be a human being.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><strong>[5]</strong></a>     </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fifth type of understanding of Tawḥīd is that which most of the people of Waḥdatul Wajūd often explain in their speech which was vocalised by Khawāja Ghulām Farīd who is an established representative for them, he said, “Wherever there is an image then every image is in reality his” and his saying, “See every number as one as many are lost he is in every image as their no one other than him.” Etc</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So all of the aforementioned types that have been mentioned can be summarised as follows,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1]   Allāh is above the seven heavens, above his Throne, separate from his creation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2]   Allāh breathed into Adam and became part of him and in him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3]   Allāh came to earth in the form of Muhammad,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4]   Allāh is incarnate in all humans and he is in their form</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5] Allāh is incarnate as part of his entire creation and is thus everywhere.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At one hand it is said that all of the creation is separate and in need of his sustenance as his is the creator and provider. Whereas on the other hand it is said there is no existence except for Allāhs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Would please clarify this issue because up until a Muslim does not have the correct and acceptable pure Tawḥīd based on the Qurān and Ḥadīth his Imān ie faith will not be accepted and nor will any of his actions, so would you clarify.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Creed of the Salaf of this Ummah </strong><strong>Concerning Tawḥīd.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Know may Allāh have mercy on you that the belief we should have about Tawḥīd is as you have said in one above and this was the creed of all of the Salaf of the ummah and they were all unanimously agreed upon it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad Ibn Kathīr al-Maṣiṣi narrates that he heard Imam Awzāʿī say:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;It is my creed and that of the Tabiʿūn that Allāh is above his Throne and we believe in all his attributes as has been stated in the Sunnah&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><strong>[6]</strong></a> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ismāīl Al-Anṣārī mentions in his &#8216;Dham ul-Kalām Wa Ahlihi&#8217; that ʿAbdur Rahmān Ibn Abī Hātim narrated that, I asked my father and Abū Zurʿah about the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah and all the scholars at the time. They replied,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;We have met the scholars from afar and all places. The scholars of the Ḥijāz, ʿIrāq, Egypt, Shām and Yemen all explained that there creed was that Allah was above his throne separate from his creation as he has explained himself without any similitude and his knowledge is all encompassing.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><strong>[7]</strong></a>’ </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū ʿAbdullāh Ibn Baṭṭah states in his book &#8216;Al-Ibānah&#8217; that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;The Sahabah and their successors, the Tabiʿūn along with all the people of knowledge from amongst the Muslims all had the creed that Allāh is above his throne, above the heavens separate from his creation&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><strong>[8]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abū Naṣr As-Sizjī mentions in his book &#8216;Al-Ibānah&#8217; that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;Our Imāms like (Sufyān) ath-Thawrī, Mālik, </em><em>(</em><em>Sufyān bin) Uyainah, Ḥammād bin Zayd, al-Fudayl (bin ʿIyād), Ibn al-Mubārak, Aḥmad, and Ishāq are agreed</em> <em>that Allāh is above the Throne bi Dhātihi (with His essence) and His</em> <em>knowledge is in every place&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><strong>[9]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Imam Abūl Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī has reported a ijmāʿ consensus on this creed as in Al-Ibānah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, Abū Umar Talmankī states in his book &#8216;Al-Wasūl Ila Mʿarifah al-Ūsūl that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;The Ahl us-Sunnah are agreed upon the creed that Allah is above the Throne haqiqatan [in reality] and not majazan [metophorically]&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Abū Nuʿaym, the author of Ḥilyah ul-Āwlīya says in his &#8216;Kitāb ul-Eʿtiqād&#8217; that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;Our creed and that of the Salaf who followed the Quran, Sunnah and Ijmaʿ consensus is that those narrations which mention the rising of Allāh above his throne be accepted, without enquiring how, without making any similitude and to say that he is separate from his creation and they from him. He is not within his creation. He has not made halūl [within] them and nor is he mixed within them. He is above the heavens above his throne and not on the earth [creation]&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><strong>[11]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further states from Hāfiẓ Abū Bakr Ismaʿīl who said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;It is the creed of the Ahl ul-Ḥadīth Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamāʿh is to believe in Allāh, his angels and books and Messengers. To accept that which has come in the book of Allāh and the authentic Sunnah established from the messenger without any distortion. They also believed that Allāh is to be called upon with his beautiful names and he is as he has described himself and as described by his messenger. He created Adam with his hands and his hands are open without asking how and he is above his Throne without delving into how&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><strong>[12]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū ʿAbdullāh al-Ḥākim says in his ‘Mʿarifah Ulūm ul-Ḥadīth’ that Imām Abū Bakr Muḥammad Ibn Ishāq Ibn Khuzaimah said that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“One who does not affirm that Allāh is above the Throne above the seven heavens is a disbeliever before his lord. He must be made to repent and if not so then punished and left to rot at some sewer so that the Muslims and those under there dhimmah do not even smell his stench.
