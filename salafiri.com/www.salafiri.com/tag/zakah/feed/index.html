<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Abu Khuzaimah </strong></span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Answer</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All success lies with Allah. It is permissible to give Zakah to a masjid; no textual evidence has been transmitted which prohibits this. One of the eight (8) categories mentioned in the Quran who we can give Zakah too is, Fi Sabil Allah ie in the way or path of Allah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>Zakah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect [zakah] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the [stranded] traveler &#8211; an obligation [imposed] by Allah. And Allah is Knowing and Wise.” (Surah Tawbah:60)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These are inclusive and complete words which thus include all aspects and actions which are done in the path of Allah and they are not restricted to popular struggle. Other Ayahs mention,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.” (Surah al-Baqarah:261)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah and then do not follow up what they have spent with reminders [of it] or [other] injury will have their reward with their Lord, and there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.” (Surah al-Baqarah:262)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And spend in the way of Allah and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction [by refraining]. And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good.” (Surah al-Baqarah:195)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people of knowledge include all aspects that are considered to be good and virtuous in the path of Allah without limiting and restricting them to popular struggle. Similarly, the people of knowledge collect money for their madaris-institutes of learning. They do not have any other specific evidence except that they also use this understanding, ie in the path of Allah-Fi Sabil Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal also uses this ayah to deduce the permissibility of helping and supporting a person on Hajj with Zakah and asserts Hajj is also included in the understanding of Fi Sabil Allah. (Ibn Kathir said in his Tafsir (2:366), according to al-Imam Ahmad, al-Hasan (al-Basri) and Ishaq (Ibn Rahawaih)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Imam Bukhari also understands Hajj to be from Fi Sabil Allah in his <em>Sahih</em> and goes on further to cite a report from Ibn Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) and a marfu hadith in note form (Ta’liqan)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In conclusion, Fi Sabil Allah is not only restricted or limited to popular struggle but rather and in fact all righteous and good deeds are inclusive of this. The Prophets mosque itself was extended with money from the Bayt al-Mal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Sa’d transmits during the era of Umar ibn al-Khattab (RadhiAllahu Anhu) the Muslim population increased and the Prophet’s (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) mosque was unable to accommodate them, he purchased all of the surrounding houses except the house of Abbas and Ai’shah (RadhiAllahu Anhuma). Later Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) said to Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhu), </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Oh Abu Fadl (ie the kunyah of Abbas) the masjid has become small for the Muslims and thus I have purchased all of the surrounding houses except yours and Ai’shah’s (RadhiAllahu Anha) apartment. We can financially reimburse you for the price of your house from the Bayt al-Mal so that we can extend the mosque.” Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhu) said, “If this is the case I’ll give my house in Sadaqah for the Muslims but if the reason is contrary to this then I will not sell.” The narrator mentions Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) marked his house to separate it from the others and paid for it by using money from the Bayt al-Mal”</em> (Tabaqat al-Kubra (4:21), Daraqutni weakened him and Ibn Hibban said it is not permitted to narrate from except in matters pertaining to property from Yazid bin Harun)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is apparent these affairs occurred during the time of the companions and no one form them opposed this and thus the jurists refer to this as ijma of the companions. So during the time of the rightly guided Khulafa, the companions were agreed on the permissibility of building mosques by using money from Zakah. When such is the case is there any further doubt on this matter?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the jurists are also of the view of its permissibility,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Razi said it is not necessary to understand the meaning of Fi Sabil Allah ie in the path or way of Allah to only mean and be restricted to war expeditions. Imam Qaffal has cited from some jurists in his Tafsir the permissibility of spending money from sadaqah on all righteous actions, for example money for burying the deceased, making a castle for the Muslims and for building a masjid. This is because all of these actions and affairs fall under the understanding of Fi Sabil Allah.” </em>(Cited from Tafsir Mahasin al-Tawil of Jamal al-Din Qasimi (8:318)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [IT’S CHAIN IS SAHIH]</strong> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihaab az-Zuhree clarified hearing (this hadeeth from Mahmood Ibn Rabee’ al-Ansari (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)) in Bukharee (no.425)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [BUKHARI]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/244, 245 hadith no.579, book 17, chapter 1, hadith no.2), at-Tamhid (13/113), al-Istidhkar: (no.533)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.1459) from the hadith of Malik</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, &#8220;There is no Ushar on a crops (measure, food, grain etc.) or dates except when they reach a quantity of five wasaq and there is no zakah on silver except when it reaches a quantity of two hundred dirhams.&#8221; (Sharh Ma&#8217;ani al-Athar of at-Tahawi 2/35 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Hasan]</em> good) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Abdul Bar has said that this is a prestigious sunnah and is regarded as being accepted by everyone. (at-Tamhid 20/136) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) 1 wasaq is equivalent to 7 sa&#8217;a and 1 hijazi sa&#8217;a is equivalent to 5.3 pounds which equals 2kg 99g 520mg. See Mawlana Faruq Asgar Sarim&#8217;s book &#8220;Islami Awzan (The Islamic weight measurements)&#8221; (pg. 59) there is a difference of opinion on the correct weight of a sa&#8217;a from the scholars of the truth therefore it is better to round it up to 2.5kg when giving the charity so you are free from doubts and Allah knows best. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) There are fourty dirhams in 1 uqiya which is equivalent to 472g to 1220g. See Islami Awzan pg. 21</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) Zakah becomes obligatory after 1 full year</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) From the 2nd point above it is established that it is not necessary to give the ushur if the amount of crops (measure) is below 750kg or according to another opinion 630 kg. Ushur becomes obligatory after reaching the mentioned limits. Also see hadith no.402</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Essential Q &amp; A’s regarding Zakaat Al-Fitr</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Rulings &amp; Wisdoms</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is incumbent upon every Muslim to seek knowledge and learn, more so before a particular act of worship is obligated upon him. Below is a concise summary of the basic rulings of Zakaat Al-Fitr.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What is Zakaat Al-Fitr?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Zakaat al-Fitr is an obligatory charity during Fitr i.e. when the fasting of Ramadhan is broken with Eid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What is the wisdom behind Zakaat Al-Fitr?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) beautifully explained the wisdom for the obligation of Zakaat Al-Fitr, he said:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is purification for a fasting person, from idle talk and false speech, and also to feed the poor.”</em> [1]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">i.e. despite a fasting person trying his best to stay away from false speech during fasting, however sometimes he may fall short. Therefore, Zakaat Al-Fitr is a purification from this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is also a way of us showing our gratitude to our Lord, who bestowed upon us Ramadhan and allowed us to live till Eid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Who needs to pay Zakaat Al-Fitr?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) obligated Zakaat Al-Fitr</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>…on the Muslims, free or a slave, male or female, young or old.”</em> [2]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is an obligation upon every Muslim, however the responsibility falls on the head of the household such as the father or husband, to donate it on behalf of his dependants. This is assuming they have enough food for themselves.</span></p>
<p>It is not obligated to pay Zakaah Al-Fitr on behalf of a foetus, however it is recommended and desired.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What should be donated?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa salaam obligated Zakaat al-Fitr to be given</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“a Saa’ of dates, a Saa’ of barley…”</em> [3]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree narrates that the companions</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“would give Zakaat al-Fitr on behalf of every young and adult, the free and enslaved in the era of the Messenger of Allah one Saa’ of staple foodstuff…”</em> [4]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The above &#8211; and other narrations &#8211; show us that Zakaat Al-Fitr should be donated in the form of the staple food of one’s locality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How much should be donated?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The measure used at the time of the Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) was a Saa’. [5]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In modern measurements this relates to:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rice: 2.3kgs Raisins: 1.64kgs</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dates: 1.8kgs Wheat: 2.04kgs</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Lentils 2.1kgs Flour: 2.06kgs</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Couscous 1.8kgs [6]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From the above measurements we can see that Zakaat Al-Fitr ranges from 1.5kgs to 2.5kgs approximately depending on the type of food. For this reason, the scholars have recommended for 3kgs of food to be given as a matter of caution. [7]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How is it given and to whom?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Zakaat al-Fitr is given to any poor person who cannot afford his daily food for himself and his family. There are three possibilities for Zakaat Al-Fitr:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The correct measure of food should be given to poor people in your locality. This is the Sunnah and it fulfils the objective of community cohesion.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">If poor people are not found in one’s community, then the correct measure of food can be transferred to a different community or country, especially if the poor are relatives.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, if none of the above are possible, then a person should give the monetary value of food, this is not from the Sunnah however it is done for a particular need or benefit. [8]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How should it be given?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From the above it is clear that the best practice is to give it directly to the poor in one’s locality. A person should include his wife and children in every step of the donation – buying the food, each child measuring their own quantity, packaging it and finally donating it to the poor.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, we should also be sensitive to the poor who are receiving the Zakaat, that they are not to be made to feel belittled, therefore where appropriate anonymity can be maintained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Why is it given to the poor specifically?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Eid is a day of happiness and festivities, and nobody should feel left out on such a day. For this reason, essential food items are distributed to the poor without them asking. It is also encouraged for Muslims to give gifts and honour the poor in other appropriate ways.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>When should it be given?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The best time to donate the Zakaat Al-Fitr is before the Eid prayer, however it can be given earlier by a day or two especially if it is felt that it may not reach the poor in time. If it is delayed until after the Eid Prayer, it is no longer considered as Zakaah, but mere charity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whoever donates the Zakaah before the Eid Prayer then it is an accepted form of Zakaah, and whoever gives it after the Prayer it is a Sadaqah.”</em> [9]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Allaah knows best; May peace and blessings be upon our beloved Prophet, his family and companions.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">[5] A Saa’ is a measure of volume which was used in the Prophetic era, it is ‘four double handfuls of food’ measured by an average man.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">[6] This was calculated by a number of students in the presence of Shaykh Ferkous of Algeria. Ref: <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?howtopic=131485">www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?howtopic=131485</a></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">[8] Ibn Taymiyyah said: <em>“As for donating Zakaat Al-Fitr in monetary value (ie as opposed to actual food) then there is a difference of opinion. Is it permitted unrestrictedly? Is it forbidden unrestrictedly? Is it permitted in some instances to do a need or a benefit?There are three opinions [as above] in the Madhhab of Imaam Ahmad and others. [The last opinion] is the most just and fair.” </em>[Majmoo’ Al-Fataawa 25/79]</span></p>
