<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Translated And Compiled By </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Abu Ubaydah</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: center"> <span style="color: #000080">Some Of The Companions Who Conquered The Indian Subcontinent (Hind / Sindh)</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The conquering of Hind i.e. Sindh and Makran (modern day Balochistan in Pakistan and Iran) was during the caliphate of Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) before the famous Muhamad Bin Qasim. The Companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) already reached Hind / Sindh as mentioned by Ibn Kathir in his al-bidiyah wan nihiyah vol no.9 pg no.88. The companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) who entered Sindh were well known for having knowledge of hadith and the Islamic Sciences. Some of them are mentioned below:</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Uthman ibn Abil &#8216;As Thaqafi (Radi Allahu Anhu) </strong></span></em></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">He was the paternal uncle of Uthman Ibn Affan (Radi Allahu Anhu). Ibn Hazm wrote that he was a highly righteous companion, the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) made him the Amir of Ta&#8217;if. He carried out one expedition in Faris (Persia) and three in Hind. (Jamharatun Ansab ul-Arab pg no.266)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Abdul Bar mentioned that the people of Madinah and the people of Basrah narrated hadith from him. Imam Ahmad narrated a saying about him from Hasan Basri who said that I have never seen anyone more in virtue than Uthman Ibn Abul &#8216;As (Radi Allahu Anhu). We used to go to his house to narrate hadith from him. (Isti&#8217;ab bidhayl Asabah vol no.3 pg no.92)</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Hakam ibn Abil &#8216;As Thaqafi (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The first expedition he did here was at Baruch (Gujarat) which was based on the command of his brother Uthman ibn Abil &#8216;As Thaqafi (Radi Allahu Anhu). (Futuh ul-Buldan pg no.430). The second time was in 23 Hijri where Makran was conquered (Tarikh ul-Islam vol no.2 pg no.48 and al-bidiyah wan nihiyah vol no.7 pg no.141). Imam Bukhari, Ibn Abdul Bar and Ibn Hibban counted him amongst the scholars of Basrah and Muhadithin. (at-Tarikh ul-Kabir vol no.1 pg no.229, Isti&#8217;ab vol no.1 pg no.306, Kitab ath-Thiqat vol no.1 pg no.39)</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Rabi&#8217; ibn Ziyad al-Harithi (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Amir of Basrah Abu Musa al-Ash&#8217;ari (Radi Allahu Anhu) sent him to lead an expedition at Makran and Kerman (modern day south east Iran) (Chach Nama pg no.73).</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Hakam ibn Amr Tha&#8217;labi (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In the 23 of Hijri he was part of the conquest of Makran (Tarikh at-Tabari vol no.4 pg no.181, Isabah vol no.1 pg no.246). One of his narrations is present in Sahih Bukhari and he also has narrations present in other books of hadith.</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Sihar ibn Abbas Abdi (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He was with Hakam Ibn Amr Tha&#8217;labi (Radi Allahu Anhu) in the conquest of Makran and through him Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) received the good news of the conquest and spoils of war. He narrated two or three ahadith from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). He was counted amongst the scholars of Basrah.</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abdullah ibn Umayr ash-Ja&#8217;i (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In the 23 of Hijri he was part of the expeditions of Faris and Makran. During this era he provided excellent assistance towards conquering Sijistan (part of modern day eastern Iran, southern Afghanistan and western Pakistan) and some connecting areas of Sindh.</span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Ubaydullah ibn Ma&#8217;mar Taymi Qurashi (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Uthman (Radi Allahu Anhu) sent him on an expedition to Makran in the 29th of Hijri. Urwah Ibn Zubair and Ibn Sirin narrated from him. </span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Mushaji&#8217; Ibn Mas&#8217;ud Sulami (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In the 31 of Hijri he was part of the conquest of Qufs (modern day south Afghanistan and Balochistan) and Kerman. His narrations are present in the Sahihayn. </span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abdurahman Ibn Samurah Qurashi Abshami (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He was part of conquering Khurasan, Sijistan, Zabulistan (modern day south Afghanistan) and Kabul etc. During these expeditions he was also part of conquering some areas of Sindh and Makran. He narrated from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and many of the Kibar Tabi&#8217;in narrated from him such as Sa&#8217;id Ibn Musayib, Muhamad Ibn Sirin and Hasan Basri etc. </span></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Sinan Ibn Salamah Ibn Muhbiq Huthali (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong></span></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He entered Sindh in 42 Hijri for the first time and carried out expeditions. The second time he entered it he came back as a leader of the expedition and conquered a lot of areas.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In addition to the above, Suhail Ibn Adi Ansari, Asim Ibn Amr Tamimi, Abdullah Ibn Abdullah Ibn Utban Ansari, Mugirah Ibn Abul &#8216;As Thaqafi, Mundhar Ibn Jarud Abdi, Uthman Ibn Sa&#8217;d and other than them (Radi Allahu Anhum) were part of the conquests of Sindh and Makran. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">All of these companions found blessings and success in Sindh. In the year 62 Hijri Sindh was blessed with the burial of Mundhar Ibn Jarud Abdi (Radi Allahu Anhu) who passed away here. According to some researchers he is the only companion buried in this land.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Arrival Of The Tabi&#8217;in And Taba Tabi&#8217;in In Sindh</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">During the beginning of the conquest of Sindh there were many scholars of the Tabi&#8217;in and Taba Tabi&#8217;in who were part of the expeditions. Some of them are below:</span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Hakim Ibn Jablah Abdi</strong></em></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">He was alive during the time of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) but sadly did not meet him. Khalifah Ibn Khiyat mentions that he was a judge in Sindh during the era of Uthman (Radi Allahu Anhu). (Tarikh Khalifah Ibn Khiyat). He was the first Islamic judge of Sindh. </span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Hasan Basri </strong></em></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">He stayed in Sijistan, Makran and the surrounding areas in Sindh for at least two and a half years during the era of the rightly guided caliphs. He carried out expeditions as well as spreading knowledge. In the year 30 Hijri he was the scribe and administrator of Rabi&#8217; Ibn Ziyad Harithi (Radi Allahu Anhu). He would fight for Islam and give Islamic verdicts. Ibn Sa&#8217;d has mentioned that in the era in which Hasan Basri was busy carrying out expeditions, Jabir Ibn Yazid would give Islamic verdicts in his place, and when Hasan Basri would return he would give Islamic verdicts. (Tabaqat Ibn Sa&#8217;d vol no.7 pg no.180). </span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Jabir Ibn Yazid Ju&#8217;fi Kufi </strong></em></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><span style="color: #000000">In the year 30 Hijri he was with Hasan Basri in the expeditions around Sindh. He also gave Islamic verdicts here. </span></span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Sa&#8217;d Ibn Hisham Ansari  </strong></em></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><span style="color: #000000">He was the paternal cousin of the famous companion Anas Ibn Malik (Radi Allahu Anhu). Imam Bukhari and Ibn Sa&#8217;d have mentioned that he was martyed during the expeditions at Makran. (at-Tarikh al-Kabir vol no.2 pg no.67, Tabaqat Ibn Sa&#8217;d vol no.7 pg no.209). His narrations are mentioned in the six books of hadith. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">From the above we can see how great scholars were around in the Sindh area and they spread their knowledge whilst being there. On one occasion the conqueror of Makran Ubaydullah Ma&#8217;mar Taymi (Radi Allahu Anhu) wrote to Abdullah Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) whilst being in Sindh and said, we have obtained peace and serenity here, we have no fear of enemies, we have lived in this area for seven years and we have become parents&#8230;(Isabah vol no.2 pg no.432)  </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #000080">The First Markaz For Spreading Hadith In Sindh Was In Debal (Part Of Modern Day Karachi)</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Debal was the first city in Sindh to establish a hadith Markaz. The most famous scholar who taught in this area was Abdurahim Ibn Hamad Debali. Yaqut al-Hamawi said, &#8220;There is a group of Muhadithin who are attributed to this city.&#8221; (Mu&#8217;jam al-Buldan vol no.4 pg no.118). Ibn Jazari mentioned, &#8220;Debal is a coastal city in Sindh where a group of many scholars are attributed to it.&#8221; Khatib Baghdadi mentions the saying of the narrator Ahmad Ibn Imran that, &#8220;&#8230;My friend Khalf Ibn Muhamad ad-Debali al-Mawazini narrated to me that we heard from Ali Ibn Musa Debali at Debal&#8230;.&#8221;(Tarikh Baghdad vol no.8 pg no.333). Afterwards these Debali scholars went to Baghdad and narrated the hadith as mentioned by Sam&#8217;ani, &#8220;Khalf Ibn Muhamad al-Muwazini ad-Debali narrated the hadith of Ali Ibn Musa Debali at Baghdad.&#8221; (Ansab Sam&#8217;ani mentioning Debal). Additionally, Abul Qasim Ibn Muhamad Debali narrated hadith from Abdurahim Ibn Yahya Debali in the city of Debal. Abu Nu&#8217;aym mentions the saying of his Shaykh Muhamad Ibn Ja&#8217;far Ibn Yusuf in Tarikh Isfahan that,&#8221;We heard from Abul Qasim Shu&#8217;ayb Ibn Muhamad Ibn Ahmad Ibn Shu&#8217;ayb ad-Debali said that we heard from Abdurahim Ibn Yahya ad-Debali. (Tarikh Isfahan vol no.1 pg no.345). I will mention other famous Sindhi scholars alongside him below: </span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Abdurahim Ibn Hamad Debali </strong></em></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><span style="color: #000000">His lineage goes back to the tribe of Thaqif who entered Debal with the expedition of Muhamad Ibn Qasim. He travelled from Debal to Basrah and that is where he became known for his knowledge and virtue. The grandfather of Imam Uqayli mentioned that a big scholar from Sindh came to Basrah who narrates hadith from A&#8217;mash and Amr Ibn Ubayd. (Lisan ul-Mizan vol no.4 pg no.410). Khatib al-Bagdadi mentions that he was from the well known pious scholars of his time and was similar to the likes of scholars such as Harith Mahasibi, Hatim Asam and Shafiq Balkhi etc. (Tarikh Bagdad vol no.8 pg no.9251)      </span><em><strong><span style="color: #000000"> </span> </strong></em></span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Qays Ibn Yasar Sindi</strong></em></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><span style="color: #000000">He is mentioned by Ibn Makula in al-Kamil that Jubayl heard hadith from Qays Ibn Yasar. (al-Kamil vol no.1 pg no.272) In another part of al-Kamil Ibn Makula mentioned that Jubayl&#8217;s name is Muhamad Ibn Azaz Ibn Aws and he was killed in Sindh. (al-Kamil vol no.1 pg no.565). Both the student and teacher were present in Sindh at the same time. </span></span></p>
<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Muhamd Ibn Azaz Ibn Aws known as Jubayl </strong></em></span></h5>

<h5><span style="color: #000080"><em><strong>Sindi Ibn Shimas Basri   </strong></em></span></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><span style="color: #000000">Most of the historians mention that he was from the captives of war from Kabul. However Ibn Hibban clarifies in Kitab ath-Thiqat that he was a Sindhi from the captives of war from Kabul. Another muhadith Ibn A&#8217;isha mentions that he was a Sindhi and did not speak clean Arabic. He was the slave of a lady from the tribe of Hudhayl. Overall he was a captive from one of the expeditions of Sijistan, Kabul or the surrounding Sindh area etc. (Rijal us-Sindh wal Hind pg no.137)   </span></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong><i style="color: #000080">Abdurahman Ibn Amr Awza&#8217;i Dimishqi       </i></strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><span style="color: #000000">Most of the historians mention that he was from the tribe of Awza&#8217; however Dhahabi mentions that his original lineage goes back to the captives from Sindh (Tadhkiratul Huffadh) and that his origin and roots are from Sindh (Tarikh ul-Islam). Also the author who summarised Tahdhib ul-Kamal mentioned the same thing from Abu Zur&#8217;ah. The historians who attribute him to the tribe of Awza&#8217; at the same time clarify that he was not from this tribe rather he used to live amongst them and that&#8217;s why he was attributed to them. (Tadhkiratul Huffadh vol no.1 pg no.168 and Rijal us-Sindh pg no.164)   </span></span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #333399">Other Famous Scholars Who Had Sindhi Ancestry</span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000">After the conquest of Qayqan (an area in modern day Balochistan) a number of the local people became Muslim. In particular a tribe called Muqsim Qayqan. A person named Ibrahim was from this tribe and he would regularly go to Basrah to carry out trade and business. He ended up marrying a lady from Basrah who was from the tribe of Bani Shayban. Her name was called Ulayah Bint Hasan and from this marriage came many famous scholars and Muhadithin. Some of their names are as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5><strong><span style="color: #333399"><em>Abu Bishr Isma&#8217;il Ibn Ibrahim Ibn Muqsim who was famously attributed to his mother and known with the kunyah Ibn Ulayah</em></span></strong></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><strong><span style="color: #333399"><em>Rib&#8217;i Ibn Ibrahim Ibn Muqsim</em></span></strong></h5>

<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #333399">Students From Sindh Who Travelled To Seek Knowledge </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The famous Imam Abul Abas al-Asm (Died 346 Hijri) used to teach in Baghdad. He had students of knowledge from around the entire world who would come and study from him. Imam Abu Abdullah Hakim said that I have not seen any study class in any city of the world of Islam which has students of knowledge from the East and West than the class of Imam Abul Abas al-Asm. It is also mentioned that a group of students of knowledge came from Mansura (Which is near modern day Shahdadpur in Pakistan), Multan and Sijistan etc. to his classes. (Ansab of Sam&#8217;ani vol no.1 pg no.9291). </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Mansura Was Another City In Sindh Which Had Muhadithin </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Mansura became a great Muslim city that thrived with knowledge as mentioned by Maqdisi Bashari that, &#8220;There is a lot of nobility and Islamic virtue and values there. There are plenty of scholars and knowledgeable people. Business is also thriving there and the people are very intelligent.&#8221; (Ahsanul Taqasim). He also goes on to say that, &#8220;Most of the scholars of Mansura are Ahlul Hadith. I saw Qadhi Abu Muhamad Mansuri who was an Imam of the Dawud Dhahiri madhab. He conducts lessons and authors books. He has written many good books.&#8221; (Tabaqatul Fuqaha Shayrazi)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Lahore, Qanuj And Qasdar </span></h4>
<p>In Sindh, Lahore and Qanuj also gave rise to people of knowledge. Qalqashandi said, &#8220;The city of Lahore is a very big and blessed place. A group of scholars have come from here.&#8221; (Subhul A&#8217;shi vol no.5 pg no.76). Maqdisi Bashari said, &#8220;There are very big scholars in Qanuj.&#8221; The first person to have conquered Qasdar was Mundhir Ibn Jarud Abdi (Radi Allahu Anhu) in the year 62 Hijri.</p>
<p>Apart from the above there were numerous scholars who were from the Sindh region.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Books Written By Scholars From Sindh</span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Rabi&#8217; Ibn Sabih was the first person to author a book in Basrah and after him it was Sa&#8217;id Ibn Abi Arubah. (al-Muhadith al-Fadhil pg no.611). After he added fiqhi codification to ahadith he went to Sindh for Jihad and died and was buried there in 160 Hijri according to the historians. Imam Bukhari mentions that he died in the land of Sindh in 160 Hijri. (at-Tarikh ul-Kabir vol no.2 pg no.285), Ibn Hajr also mentions this from Muhamad Ibn Muthana etc. (Tahdhib at-Tahdhib). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">It has already been mentioned that Imam Makhul had Sindhi lineage. Ibn Nadim mentions that he authored two books, Kitab as-Sunan Fil Fiqh and Kitab ul-Masa&#8217;il Fil Fiqh. (al-Fihrist 118). Abu Ma&#8217;shar Sindhi Madani authored a book called Kitab ul-Maghazi in the same era that Muhamad Ibn Ishaq and Musa Ibn Uqbah authored Kitab ul-Maghazi in Madinah. In the year 270 Hijri a scholar from Mansurah who knew many languages, translated the Quran and wrote the tafsir of it in Sindhi for the Raja (ruler) of Aror (modern day Rohri in Sindh Pakistan, this city was once the capital of Sindh) called Mahruq Ibn Ra&#8217;iq. The purpose of it was to explain to him the teachings of Islam. It is reported that he used to explain the ayat of the Quran to the non-Muslim Raja in open court and remained there for a period of three years. It has been further stated that during the course of translation when the Muslim scholar reached the ayah in Surah Yasin &#8220;He said, &#8216;who will give life to the bones when they are totally rotten&#8221; (Quran 36 ayah 78) the Raja alighted from his throne and threw himself on the ground. He remained in a long prostration weeping bitterly in such a manner that his face was covered with dust. He then raised his head and addressed the court, “Indeed Allah is the sole Ilah, the nourishing benefactor of the whole world.” When the scholar returned to Mansurah he said that the non-Muslim Raja had accepted Islam but kept his intentions secret for loss of the throne. (Aja&#8217;ib ul-Hind)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">There was a Muhadith called Abu Ja&#8217;far Sindhi who authored a book on Hadith. Imam Bukhari mentions that Amr Ibn Malik Rasibi borrowed the book of Abu Ja&#8217;far Sindhi and supplemented it with Ahadith. (Mizan ul-&#8216;Itidal vol no.2 pg no.35) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abu Ja&#8217;far Tusi mentions in Kitab ul-Fihrist that Abul Faraj Sindhi authored a book which was narrated through the chain of Muhadithin to us. (Mu&#8217;jam al-Musanifin vol no.3 pg no.33). Abul Faraj Sindhi was well known scholar of the past who narrated ahadith. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Ali Ibn Ahmad Debali&#8217;s book Adab al-Qadha was a well known accepted book of those who followed the Shafi&#8217;i madhab. Abu Umar Ahmad Ibn Sa&#8217;id Hindi Qurtubi was an exceptional scholar of this time. He authored a book on Ilm ash-Shurut which was very beneficial and detailed. This was widely accepted and relied upon by the scholars of Magrib and Andalus just as it has been mentioned by Qadhi Iyadh in Tartib al-Madarik. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abu Nu&#8217;aim mentions that Abu Ishaq Ibrahim Ibn Sindhi was an excellent scholar of Usul. (Tarikh Isfahan vol no.1 pg no.193) It seems as though he had a well known book of Usul. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abu Bakr Muhamad Ibn Raja Ibn Sindhi Isfara&#8217;ini took the book of Sahih Muslim and narrated it through the chain of Imam Muslim&#8217;s teachers or the teachers above them. A book written like this is called an Istikhraj and Takhrij. This book was called Mustakhraj Abi Bakr Sindhi Isfara&#8217;ini where only a remnant of it is now available. He became well known as Sahib us-Sahih Ala Shart Muslim. (Tadhkiratul Huffadh vol no.2 pg no.230).   </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abdullah Ibn Hasan Ibn Sindhi Andalusi authored a twenty volume book on Zuhd and Raqa&#8217;iq. Ibn Asakir mentions that the twentieth volume has been seen and a big group of Muhadithin have narrated in it. (Mukhtasar Tarikh Ibn Asakir vol no.7 pg no.363) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The Qadhi of Mansurah Abul Abas Ahmad Ibn Muhamad Mansuri had many durus and authored many books. Maqdisi Bashari mentions that he met him in Mansurah and wrote, &#8220;He has a well established study Majlis and authored many exceptional books.&#8221; (Ahsan ut-Taqasim)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Yaqut Hamawi wrote in Mu&#8217;jam al-Buldan, &#8220;He authored some books on the Dawudi (Dahiri) madhab.&#8221; Ibn Nadim mentions in al-Fihrist that he authored exceptionally good and great books. Some of them are Kitab ul-Misbah, Kitab ul-Hadi and Kitab un-Nir which has also been called Kitab un-Nirin. This book became so famous and well known that he became known from this book and was nicknamed author of Kitab un-Nirin as mentioned by Ibn Qaysarani in al-Insab ul-Mutafiqh. Sheyrazi attributed him as author of Kitab un-Nirin in Tabaqat ul-Fuqaha. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">There were two Sindhi scholars who were students of Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. They had unique knowledge of issues and specific narrations from him. One of them was called Hubaish Ibn Sindhi Baghdadi which Abul Khilal mentions about him that he was one of the major students of Imam Ahmad. He wrote twenty thousand ahadith from Imam Ahmad and he had two volumes of important Masa&#8217;il and Fatawa from Imam Ahmad which other students did not have. (Tabaqat ul-Hanabila vol no.1) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The other Sindhi scholar was Abu Bakr Sindhi Khwatimi which Abul Khilal mentions that he was equivalent in companionship and studentship as Abu Harith. He used to stay with Imam Ahmad and his children. He heard important and excellent Masa&#8217;il from Imam Ahmad. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abu Musa Ibn Sindhi Jurjani narrated ahadith from Imam Waki&#8217; Ibn Jarah. He had all of the books of Imam Waki&#8217; and these books were counted as the best from him. Suhmi mentions in Tarikh Jurjan that he had the books of Imam Waki&#8217;. (Tarikh Jurjan pg no.426)  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abu Ja&#8217;far Muhamad Ibn Ibrahim Debali he narrated Sufyan Ibn Uyaynah&#8217;s book Kitab ut-Tafsir from Abu Abdullah Sa&#8217;id Ibn Abdurahman Makhzumi. He also narrated Abdullah Ibn ul-Mubarak&#8217;s book al-Bir Wa Sula from Abu Abdullah Husayn Ibn Hasan Marwazi who narrated it from Abdullah Ibn Mubarak. (al-Aqd ath-Thamin Fasi pg no.397). Muhamad Ibn Ibrahim Debali had the unique reputation of narrating these two books. The scholars of hadith used to narrate books from him.   </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(1354H/1935 &#8211; 1438H/2017)</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh and Allamah Abdullah Nasir Rehmani said, <em>&#8220;Today I say this while being in a state of great sadness and being emotional, I heard the very upsetting news that the Ustadh al-Ulama al-Muhaddith al-Kabir, Mufassir al-Azim, al-Faqih, Fadhlilatush Shaikh Muhammad Abdullah Amjad, may Allah have mercy and envelope him in it, passed away and journeyed to the hereafter and left the Ahl al-Hadith, this is indeed a calamity for Jama’ah Ahl al-Hadith&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is al-Allamah, al-Muhaddith, the Shaikh al-Shuyukh a-Hadith, the Shaikh ul-Hadith Abdullah Amjad bin Abd al-Aziz bin Jamal ud Din Chathwi.  He was born in 1354H corresponding to1935ce in the village of Dahani in the district of Khanghanagar in the state of Bikanir in India. Some have said he was born in the area of Budhyamal in India. He read the Quran to his father, Abdul Aziz, he also read some of the books of Shaikh Hafiz Muhammad Lakhawi like, Ahwal Akhirat, Zinat Islam and other books to his father.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the partition he moved with his family and some elders to Chak no.36 in the Jaranwala district, which is in the greater district of Faisalabad and to its western side. The Pakistani nomenclature for villages which dates back to British rule is Chak, which is a Punjabi word, which essentially means village and instead of names, numbers and letters are used to identify villages in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The Shaikhs title of Chathwi is from the Urdu word translation of the number 36, which was the village he moved to after migrating from India during the partition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the nephew of the great Ahl al-Hadith scholar and the son in law of Shaikh Abdullah Budhyamalwi, who spent his whole life going from institute to institute and teaching the clear meanings from the Quran and Sunnah, giving Hadith it&#8217;s due right and superior importance, above and beyond the opinion of men and those who just referred back to the opinion of men within the madhabs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After moving to Pakistan, he joined the madrasah of Mian Muhammad Baqir which was Khadim al-Quran wal-Hadith and at the time Shaikh Muhammad Siddiq Karpalwi was teaching there. Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi remained at this madrasah for 2 years and learnt and studied with Shaykh Muhammad Siddiq Karpalwi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then moved to Owdanwala and enrolled at Shaikh Sufi Abdullah&#8217;s madrasah known as Dar al-Ulum Ta&#8217;lim al-Islam. It should be noted Shaykh Sufi Abdullah was not a Sufi as we know the term to denote but rather it was a colloquial term used for pious and righteous people. Shaykh Abdullah Amjad remained here for another two years and studied with versatile scholars like Shaykh Abdus Samad Rauf, Shaikh Muhammad Yaqub Quraishi, Shaykh Muhammad Sadiq Khalil and Shaykh Abdullah Budhyamalwi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His fellow students also went onto become major scholars and Shuyukh al-Hadith in their own right from the likes of Shaikh Abdur Rashid Hazarwi who was the Shaykh ul-Hadith in Dar ul-Hadith in Okara and the Shaykh and Qadi Muhammad Aslam Sayf as well as many others.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Abdullah Amjad’s Quest for Knowledge</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdullah Amjad was the nephew of Shaykh Abdullah Budhyamalwi and was was also married to his daughter. When Shaykh Abdullah Budhyamalwi moved from Owdanwala to Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara, Shaykh Abdullah Amjad also went with him. While at Okara Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi studied books of Hadith with Shaykh Muhammad Bhathwi, he studied the books like <em>Jame Tirmidhi, Sunan Abi Dawud</em> as well as other books on other sciences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the teachers that were teaching in Jamia Muhammadiyyah in those days was the Hadith Master Shaykh Muhammad Abduh al-Falah, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad had the opportunity to study books <em>Hujjatullah al-Balighah, Mutanaba, Sharh Aqaid al-Nasafi</em> and others with him. Shaikh Abdullah Budhyamalwi who was fulfilling the role of Musnad as Shaykh ul-Hadith and so in this regard Shaykh Abdullah Amjad studied <em>Sahih al-Bukhari, Tafsi<span style="color: #000000;">r Baidhawi</span></em> as well as other important books of the sacred science of advanced level.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During these years and specifically around 1953 the movement for upholding and honouring the Finality of the Prophethood was in full force. The government of Pakistan at the time was supporting the Qadiyani&#8217;s ie Mirzai&#8217;s. The people objected to the beliefs of the Qadiyani&#8217;s and their desecration of the Finality of the prophethood. Shaykh Abdullah Amjad was also very instrumental and highly active in this movement ie preserving the honour and finality of the prophet of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi wasallam. He along with a few other companions would visit the local areas and he would explain the deviation of these corrupt beliefs, the importance to uphold the honour of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi wasallam as well refuting the beliefs of the Qadiyani&#8217;s. The Shaykh at the time was just a teenager, perhaps when he was either 17 or 18.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When this fitnah subsided Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi continued with his studies, he took the exam for <em>Hujjatullah al-Balighah</em> and the paper was written by the eminent scholar of the Ghaznawi family, namely Shaykh Muhammad Dawud Ghaznawi, the Shaykh Alhamdulillah passed the exams with high marks. Once Shaykh Abdullah Amjad met Shaykh Muhammad Dawud Ghaznawi while in Lahore and Shaykh Ghaznawi asked Shaykh Abdullah Amjad to come to his Institute to teach and he also told him they would bare the complete expenses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was because Shaykh Abdullah Amjad had already studied a few books with Shaykh Muhammad Ishaq at Shaykh Muhammad Dawud Ghaznawi’s institute known as Dar al-Ulum Taqwiyatul Islam and some books at Jamia Ashrafiyyah. Shaykh Abdullah Amjad declined the kind and benevolent request and explained that he would be teaching in Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara whilst also seeking knowledge by studying and reading certain books on the sacred sciences to Shaykh Abdul Mannan Kamelpuri and Shaykh Abdul Qadir. When Shaykh Dawud Ghaznawi heard that he wanted to study with Shaykh Abdul Mannan, he said to him, to go ahead and continue to study and also teach at the same time. So he studied a few books on mantaq ie logic with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter at the behest of Shaykh Mu&#8217;in ud-Din Lakhawi, Shaykh Abdullah Amjad began teaching. Shaykh Abdullah Budhyamalwi was already teaching in Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara and when Shaykh Abdullah Amjad graduated in 1956 he began teaching at Jamia Muhamadiyyah, this is also where he had spent most of this time learning. After graduating and teaching at Jamia Muhammadiyyah, the people became well acquainted with him, his manners, and deep knowledge of the sacred sciences. Due to the status which Allah granted him, he became known amongst the students who would come to him to seek knowledge.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Teachers</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had numerous teachers which include the likes of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul -Hadith Wal-Tafsir Shaikh Abdullah Budhyamalwi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Hadith Muhammad Abduh Falah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Hadith Wal-Tafsir Muhammad Abdullah Rawpari</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Hadith Muhammad Yaqub</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Bhathwi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Siddiq Karpalwi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdus Samad Rauf</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Yaqub Quraishi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Sadiq Khalil</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Ishaq</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Mannan Kamelpuri</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Qadir</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Legacy as a Teacher Over Half a Millennia </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh continued to teach in Jamia Muhammadiyyah for 4 years, during which time he taught, <em>Sunan Nasai, Mishkat al-Masabih, Jame Tirmidhi, Tafsir Jame al-Bayan, Kafiyyah, Talkhis al-Miftah, al-Fiyyah</em> and other books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter the Shaykh ul-Hadith Abdullah Veruvalwi spoke to Shaykh Abdullah Amjad and asked him to come to Faisalabad to Dar al-Quran wal-Hadith, during the same year Shaikh Abdullah Budhyamalwi who was the Shaykh ul-Hadith also left Jamia Muhamamdiyyah and went to Jamia Salafiyyah in Faisalabad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdullah Amjad taught in Dar Al-Quran wal-Hadith in Faisalabad for 4 years, thereafter Shaikh Ismail Salafi requested Shaikh Abdullah Amjad to come to teach Jamia Salafiyyah in Faisalabad where he taught the <em>Muwatta of Imam Malik</em>, <em>Mukhtasar al-Ma&#8217;ani</em> and <em>Musallam al-Thabut</em>. He remained in Jamia Salafiyyah for a whole year and also taught other books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter at the behest of his teachers Shaikh Muhammad Abduh Falah and Shaikh Mu&#8217;in al-Din Lakhawi he returned to Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara by fulfilling the request of his teachers. During his first year there he taught <em>Sahih Muslim</em>, <em>Sharh Aqaid al-Nasafi, Muwatta Imam Malik, Sunan Abi Dawud</em> as well as other books. At the time Shaikh Muhammad Abduh Falah was the Shaikh al-Hadith and in 1970 Shaikh Muhammad Abduh Falah transferred to Jamia Ulum al-Athariyyah which was another learning institute in Faisalabad and so Shaikh Mu&#8217;in al-Din Lakhawi gave the position to Shaykh Abdullah Amjad and made him the Shaykh ul-Hadith of Jamia Muhamamdiyyah. In total and in general Shaikh Abdullah Amjad taught in Jamia Muhammadiyyah for 18 or so years and also taught <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> for a number of years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During the years 1973-1974 the problems of the Finality of the Prophethood of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi wasallam remerged and Shaikh Abdullah Amjad and Shaikh Mu&#8217;in al-Din Lakhawi were fervent in the movement to preserve the finality of the Prophethood of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and their severe refutation of the Qadiyaniyyah. Eventually both Shaikhs were arrested and put into prison and numerous other people were also with them in prison. The Shaikh continued delivering lessons and sermons on the Quran and its explanation while in prison.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh continued to teach in Jamia Muhammadiyyah for a few years after he was released from prison and thereafter the Shaikh went to a village called Pak Patan which was next to a place called Arifwala. In Pak Patan the Shaikh taught in Jamia Ishat ul-Islam for approximately 10 years, despite the fact Shaikh Mu&#8217;in ud-Din tried to stop him from leaving Jamia Muhamamdiyyah, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad replied that he had given his word.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After 10 years in Jamia Ishat ul-Islam he moved to Arifwala at the request of the Ahl al-Hadith people there. The Shaikh further spend 1 and half years teaching in Arifwala, after this period the administrators of the institute were having financial problems and had to let the Shaikh move on. During this time the Ahl al-Hadith brothers at Chichawatni learnt of the circumstances and thus some of the elders went to Arifwala and asked the Shaikh, the other teachers as well as all of the students to all come to Chichawatni and the Shaikh began teaching at their institute, Jamia Ishat al-Ulum al-Muhammadiyyah. The Shaikh remained here for 1 year and due to unforeseen circumstances the Shaikh had to leave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter, Shaikh Atiqullah Salafi and other respected people met Shaikh Abdullah Amjad and requested that he come and teach at their institute of Dar al-Dawah aAl-Salafiyyah situated at Satyana Bangla, which was situated in the district of Faisalabad. Since leaving Chichawatni, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad remained in Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah as the Shaykh ul-Hadith and Mufti and this is where he continued to teach until he died this week from approximately 1993, making it approximately 24 years of teaching in Satyana Bangla.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While in Satyana Bangla the Shaikh taught many books as one can imagine, he taught for example, <em>Hidayah, Tafsir Baidhawi</em> and of course <em>Sahih al-Bukhari.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh apart from his usual lessons would also deliver lessons and lectures on the explanation of the Quran during the whole month of Ramadhan, which he continued for 30 or more years which the students would benefit from immensely.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh has been teaching from approximately 1956 and has continued to teach well over half a millennia and probably closer to 60 years or so. In this regard he has taught classical fundamental texts numerous times, year in year out. He has taught the <em>Muwatta Imam Malik</em> many times as well as teaching <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> at least 40 times. Besides being an expert and specialist teacher he was also an excellent orator. He also had an analytical debating mind and would often engage in discussions with the people of knowledge of the various different methodologies.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Shaikh Abdullah Amjad Teaching Bukhari</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh loved to teach Bukhari and he would thus teach it with great diligence with giving each Hadith, the narrators and the points of benefit it&#8217;s due right and attention. He would take his time and make sure every student had understood each point. He would test them on a regular basis and the students in the same way would come prepared. At times if the students were ill prepared the Shaikh would be very firm and reprimand them, he would explain the lesson to them and then later show them kindness and highlight the importance to learn and memorise the knowledge. Some days the Shaikh would deliver two and sometimes even three lessons in a single day on Bukhari, which showed his love for this tremendous book on the saying of our Beloved Prophet Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi wasallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The rector of Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah, Shaikh Atiqullah Salafi informed us, the day before his death on the 14th of August 2017, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad gave his usual lesson on <em>Bukhari</em> and the the students were eventually dismissed but he wished to continue teaching as he did not feel content. So the students returned and the Shaikh continued with his explanation and lesson on <em>Bukhari</em> which he then finished for a second time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Atiqullah Salafi also mentions on the same day on the 14th of August 2017, there was a meeting at the university and the discussion was regarding starting a new class in a particular location and the idea was that any teacher that lived near the location should deliver it for convenience’s sake. However, none of the other teachers volunteered to take the role of teaching or beginning the class. So Shaikh Abdullah Amjad decided to deliver the first lesson for the opening of the class. Shaikh Abdullah Amjad delivered the lesson after Maghrib for approximately 1 and half hours on explaining the Quran.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7735 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah1.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="salafiyyah1" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah1.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah1.jpg?resize=768%2C576 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah1.jpg?w=960 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah, Satyana Bangla</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Atiqullah Salafi said I have known Shaikh Abdullah Amjad for over 2 decades and in all the time I have known him as teacher at Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah he has never taken a single day holiday or time off, he never came late, not even a minute, he never wasted anytime time especially of the students. Another student mentioned that once the Shaikh was extremely ill with severe fever but the Shaikh still came to teach without missing the day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was very simple in nature, without excessive talking and would only speak when needed. He would spend hours with students teaching them and answering questions when needed. Sometimes students would visit him throughout the day asking questions. Sometimes other dignitaries and students would come to visit him to ask questions and to benefit from him. When the people would ask him questions he would reply to them strictly from the Quran and Hadith and he would also give the references for the Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh also had another unique characteristic in that when he would answer questions and provide evidences he would also add any further discussions that could arise from the evidences. So he would say the answer is this Hadith and if someone claims such and such then the answer to that is this Hadith etc and this is how the Shaikh would cover all possible alternative issues when people would ask him questions. It was such unique characteristics that raised Shaikh Abdullah Amjads rank as a highly proficient Mufti.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah-bukha2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7734 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah-bukha2.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="salafiyyah-bukha2" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah-bukha2.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah-bukha2.jpg?resize=450%2C600 450w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/salafiyyah-bukha2.jpg?w=720 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Shaikh Abdullah Answering Questions as the Mufti</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh would also travel to Raiwind to deliver the Friday Khutbah which was periodically over 40 years, Raiwind is approximately 109Km / 68 Miles directly from Faisalabad but driving via the main roads takes in excess of 2 and half hours one way. So one can imagine the diligence and the effort Shaikh Abdullah Amjad would endure to deliver a Friday Khutbah and with this it must also be noted which is by no means an easy journey at such tender ages past the age of 60 and then doing this for 40 years periodically, at least once a month is something one needs to be in awe of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During one Khutbah in 1999 the Shaikh began to vomit blood but he continued and finished the Khutbah. The Shaikhs sermons would last 50 minutes or so and the people Alhamdulillah would listen attentively without showing any signs or disengagement. Thereafter the Shaikh limited his visitations and reduced his sermon times. It is very evident such students who learnt and listened to the Shaikh are the ones who benefitted the most and hence became scholars and students of the sacred sciences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was extremely humble and filled with immense humility, when people would ask him questions he would refer them to his students while saying they have good knowledge on this subject. Once a person asked him a question pertaining to Hadith and the angle was from rejecting Hadith, so Shaikh Abdullah Amjad told him to go to his student, Shaikh Irshad ul-Haq Athari. This shows his humility and the status of his students.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another time he was delivering a lecture and there were other scholars on the stage and so Shaikh Abdullah said, these Mashaikh are perhaps younger than me in age but they have more knowledge than me. This was from the Shaikhs humility, wara and taqwa. The reality was none of the Shaikhs were even near Shaikh Abdullah&#8217;s knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh had hundreds of students whilst teaching for over half a millennia and making a list of all of them would be near enough impossible. The Shaikh would always ask about his students, how they were and what they were doing, he would always convey his Salam to them. Sometimes visitors would come to him and he would ask them about his student who had studied with many many years ago and at times over a decade ago. This shows the love of a teacher for his students, that even after graduating he remembered them wishing them good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Aside from the daily teaching routine, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad would visit the students in their quarters everyday after Asr, where the students would ask general questions and issues related to their subjects and curriculum, the Shaikh would answer them with great patience and comprehension.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh would also look after his health and this is evident because the Shaikh died at an old age, and all praise is for Allah the giver of life. Once the students asked Shaikh Abdullah Amjad what his daily routine was. He replied that whilst he was a student and teacher in Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara, he would eat two apples everyday and he would play volleyball between Asr and Maghrib.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Shaikhs Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A teacher is often recognised by the calibre of his students. From them are the likes of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Allamah and Muhaddith Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq al-Athari</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shaikhs-irshad-and-amjad.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7732 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shaikhs-irshad-and-amjad.jpg?resize=267%2C477" alt="shaikhs-irshad-and-amjad" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shaikhs-irshad-and-amjad.jpg?resize=168%2C300 168w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shaikhs-irshad-and-amjad.jpg?w=539 539w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Shaikh Irshad humbily Greeting Shaikh Abdullah Amjad</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is well known for his knowledge and especially the science of Hadith. He has many detailed books on Hadith and narrators and also his specialty in correcting the false notions and errors of the hanafi madhab. His book <em>I&#8217;la Al-Sunan Fil Mizan </em>is a testimony to this. He also has numerous other books that are highly beneficial. His is one of the instrumental scholars who has kept the people of innovation at bay, so much so that one of the heads and defenders of the hanafi and deobandi madhab in Pakistan had to say about Shaikh Irshad that we ie the hanafis and deobandi cannot take charge of the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafi&#8217;s while their Ibn Taymiyyah of this era is around, and he was referring to Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq al-Athari.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Shaykh is of this calibre and status, one would naturally would like to know who his teachers are, since they produced such a brilliant student and scholar in his own right. Approximately 1999-2000 Shaykh Irshad ul-Haqq al-Athari visited England and Alhamdulillah we spend every second of our time with him, so upon asking him who his teachers were he mentioned Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi as one of them. So from that day we were acquainted with the Shaikh and then every so often upon reading the biographies of some of the other Shuyukh, we would read Shaikh Abdullah Amjad’s name as one of the teachers.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Shaikhs Last Hours</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After delivering his lesson and explaining the Quran for 1 and a half hours after Maghrib, he prayed Isha in Jama&#8217;ah and around 10.00pm he felt some pain in his shoulders which later subsided. Later in the night at 2.00am the Shaikh felt the pain again, thereafter which he was taken to a hospital in Faisalabad and passed away while returning to our creator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was the typical day in the life of these great scholars delivering lessons in the day on <em>Bukhari</em> whileexpounding and explaining the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi wasallam and then explaining in the Quran in the evening, what such great solace can a person have in propagating the Quran and Sunnah and then meeting our Rabb.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This great Salafi scholar of the Ahl alHadith died at the tender age of 82 years after having spend in excess of 60 years teaching and propagating the Quran and Sunnah. He died in Faisalabad around 2.00am on the Dhul Hijjah 1438H corresponding to 15th of August 2017. His funeral prayer was on the same day after Asr in Satyana Bangla which was attended by thousands of people, students and scholars alike.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ahl Al-Hadith have truly lost this giant Hadith master, we pray that Allah raises for us another such obedient servant who upholds the Salafi creed and Manhaj of calling to the teachings in his Quran and the Sunnah.  Amin</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Taken from: <strong><span style="color: #000080;">al-Barelwiyyah; Their History and Beliefs Volume 2, <em>Expounding The Belief of the Pious Ancestors and Ahl al-Sunnah w’al Jama’ah</em><em> </em><em>&amp; </em><em>What Opposes it from the Wicked Deviation of the Barelwi Renegades</em></span></strong></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Historical Overview &#8211; Sufi Barelwi Renegades &amp; Their Origins in Extreme Terror and Kharijism; The Barelwi Ancestry and Lineage</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We begin by looking at the Barelwi Ash’arite and Sufi Churchfathers and their affect on the muslim society. It is common knowledge and a specific and particular hallmark of the Barelwi underlings and global sufi sympathisers that the Saudi Wahabis are government funded, they rebel and murder people, Khawarij and all sorts of fallacious delusional points.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will show how the Barelwi forefathers were themselves upon the methodology of killing innocent Muslims and how they colluded against the Muslims. We will also show how some of them were renegades themselves,  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the lineage of Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Naqi Ali Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Raza Ali Khan son of  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Kazim Ali Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Azam Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’adat Yar Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’idullah Khan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Zafar al-Din Qadri Bihari, <em>Hayat A’la Hazrat</em>, (Karachi: Maqtabah Rizviyya, 1:2 Muhammad Sabir al-Qadiri Nasim al-Bastawi, <em>Ahwal wa Athar Hazrat Mujaddid Islam</em> (Lahore: Raza Academy, 1998) p.34 </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Sa’idullah Khan</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He hailed from Kandahar which in present day Afghanistan, he was a pathan belonging to the Barech tribe. He eventually migrated to Lahore with Sultan Muhammad Nadir Shah as part of his war expeditions. He was given prestigious and high ranking positions within Nadir Shahs Safavid Dynasty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then moved to Delhi whilst he was minister of a department. He received the accolade and title of ‘Bravery of war,’ an official title from the Ruler, ie Muhammad Nadir Shah for his bravery and ardent loyalty (Muhammad Sabir al-Qadiri Nasim al-Bastawi, <em>Ahwal wa Athar Hazrat Mujaddid Islam</em>, p.34) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Nadir Shah (d.1747) was the ruler or Iran of the Safavid Dynasty and had the title The Shah of Iran. He was, naturally of Iranian descent belonging to the Afshar tribe hailing from Khurasan. He was born a Shi’i as an Itha Ashari and was an ardent follower of the Jafari school of thought. Due to the political turmoil at the time he would often say to people he was also sunni in order to keep his cohorts to support him and also to keep the opposing Ottoman empire from fighting him. In fact, numerous people serving and working with him failed to highlight whether he was sunni or shi’i, such was his deception</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He attempted to mix the two and made his own madhab called the jafari madhab so that the ottomans would accept him. His aim was to allow the persians to perform Hajj which was under Ottoman control and administration, and his only aim behind this was to make this a revenue stream. (Michael Axworthy&#8217;s, <em>The Sword of Persia</em> (I.B. Tauris, 2006), Tucker, Ernest, &#8220;Nadir Shah and the Ja&#8217;fari Mazhab reconsidered&#8221;, in <em>Iranian Studies</em>, vol. 27, 1-4 (1994), pp,163-179.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He continued to fight for the Safavid dynasty which was in decline at the period and thus Nadir Shah seized the opportunity to launch his own house. Nadir Shah continued to lead numerous military expeditions throughout the lands, which he was successful in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the time Ghilzai Afghans had control of the southeast regions, namely Kandahar. This was later controlled by the Hotaki dynasty. Nadir Shah defeated the Hotaki dynasty in approximately 1738 and took control of Kandahar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is where Sa’idullah Khan joined Nadir Shah and became a part of his dynasty war campaign for domination. Nadir Shah then went onto fight the Mughals and their empire and in the process captured cities like Ghazni, Kabul, Peshawar, parts of Sindh and Lahore.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Nadir Shah’s history and campaign were a far cry from innocence, one only needs to read the annals of history and they will come to know the wicked and evil nature of his deviation, theologically and socially.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The aim is not to present a reading into the evil actions of certain individuals or a history lesson but to show if one makes erroneous and fabricated claims against Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and al-Saud family, the closet will yield some home truths! (For further reading on the generosity and life of Muhammad Nadir Shah Read, Michael Axworthy&#8217;s, <em>The Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from Tribal Warrior to Conquering Tyrant</em>. (I.B. Tauris, 2006), Ernest Tucker, <em>Nadir Shah&#8217;s Quest for Legitimacy in Post-Safavid Iran</em> (Florida, University Press, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the likes of whom the forefathers of Ahmad Raza Khan colluded with, to cause havoc and rampage in muslim territories, the atrocities, genocide, pillaging land, and philandering of wealth and woman of unprecedented levels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to ask the barelwi sympathisers what do they make of the claim, which they often hurl at Ahl al-Sunnah, petrol dollars, the illegal al-Saud state, corroborating with the British, killing innocent muslims, mass murdering and declaring Muslims to be disbelievers. Of course this is sheer nonsense which has been answered in great detail, however the ignorant wandering mind will always have difficulty focusing on the truth and facts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This said, Barelwi Sufi narrow mindedness and genius level of reasoning fails to see and acknowledge how the forefathers of their Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan were part of such acts which were absolutely heinous and catastrophically evil.  </span></p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Reference</strong>: Ahl al-Hadeeth Newspaper, Published in Amritsar, India. Edition 18, December 1931</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">From Abdul-Azeez bin Abdur-Rahmaan al-Faisal Aal as-Sa’ood to all our brothers of Ahl al-Hadeeth – May Allaah (the Most High) preserve them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">May peace be upon you, the mercy of Allaah and His blessings. Thereafter:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Indeed I praise Allaah, besides whom there is no deity truly worthy of worship except Him; I supplicate for peace and blessings upon the best of His Prophets and I ask Allaah (the Most High) – for us and yourselves – guidance to all that He loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You all know – may Allaah preserve you – that to cooperate upon enjoining the truth and being patient is from the characteristics of the believers. You also know that Allaah (may He be glorified) described the believers as being merciful towards each other. Our emphasis therefore, on trying to unite your ranks is in order to raise the status of Tawheed all over the world, and this is the reason compelling us to write to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Indeed it hurts us that we see your Jamaa’ah suffering from any loss of vigour or weakness, just as it pains us when you are harmed by any affliction for whatever reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">After following the news of your affairs, we have realised how the other sects have become united and organised in order to defend their interests, and yet you are not concerned with becoming united in order to preserve the status of your Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I therefore call upon you to unite your ranks, for the sake of Allaah. I also call upon the people of authority amongst you to become one and work together in order to spread Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">[You must be] patient and diligent in this regard; in the path that Allaah will reward greatly, by which much good will be established both in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When other people become united and yet your unity is dispersed, weakness will occur among your ranks and the status of your Jamaa’ah will be lost. We hope that this does not occur between you.I ask Allaah – for you – guidance to all that raises His status and is pleasing to His noble Face.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Brief biography of Siddiq Hassan Khan (rahimahullaah)</strong></p>
<p>Shaykh Siddīq Hassan Khan رحمه الله explained the book Ad-Durar al-Bahiyyah in his book ar-Rawdatun Nadiyyah.</p>
<p>His name is Siddīq bin Hasan bin ‘Ali al-Husaynee al-Qannoojee al-Bukharee. His kunya is Abu Tayyib. His lineage goes back to Hussayn ibn Fatima bint Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم . His noble family is from the tribes of the Arabs and they migrated towards Bukharaa and then proceeded towards India, where they settled in a place called Qannooj hence his name al-Qannoojee. He was from a well-known family with knowledge, and beauty in their bodies as well as their Aqeedah.</p>
<p>Although he was a Salafi scholar his grandfather was a Raafidee who used to consider some of the sahaabah to be disbelievers and he was against the fact that Abu Bakr and ‘Umar رضى الله عنهما were worthy of Khilafaah. The father of Siddīq Hassan Khan was a Salafi by Allaahسبحانه و تعالى granting him success. He studied under Salafi scholars and changed his way of thinking, even though his father was a Raafidee. This is the importance of ensuring that your children learn from teachers whose Aqeedah is pure, even if they are being taught in English.</p>
<p>Some of his teachers were Shaykh Muhammad Noor and he went to Dilhee and learnt from Shaykh Abdul Azeez. He also learnt from ad-Dahlawee. When the banner of jihad was raised when India fought against the British, he participated along with Sai’d Ahmad and Sai’d Ismaeel. His father was a man of righteousness and he refused to take from the great amount of wealth that his Rafidee father left him.</p>
<p>Shaykh Siddīq Hassan Khan was born in a place called Baas Barailee, about 122 miles to the North of Dilhee. This is where his maternal grandfather used to live. He was born on 19, Jumada al-Uula, 1248H. After that his mother brought him to Qannooj where his father was. At age 6 his father died and he became an orphan. When the children of the scholars are orphaned Allaah سبحانه و تعالى gives them a lot of strength and they are able to achieve much. His mother looked after him after the death of his father.</p>
<p>At an early age he began to learn Arabic. His father left him a large library. When the cleaners were cleaning the library and a book fell he would go and take it up and browse through it and read it and understand what he could, even though he was quite young. He started studying from the scholars of al-Qannooj and after that he moved on to try and acquire knowledge from more scholars. This great imaam learnt from many scholars. He started by studying the Hanafi fiqh, then the Ashariyyah aqeedah then Allaah سبحانه و تعالى guided him to learn from the Salafi scholars the aqeedah as-salafiyyah e.g. the al-Qaadi Husayn Ibn Muhsin al-Ansaari al-Yamaani and Mu’ammar ibn Fadl-lillaah a muhaddith and his imaam Khairuddeen Allalusi and others. He benefited from them greatly, and he was upon salafiyyah as they were.</p>
<p>After studying with these shuyuuk he had to leave the area because of the problems occurring in his country. He migrated to the Kingdom of Bhopal. There were scholars there and he found a job. He was then promoted and because of his noble character and knowledge the Director of the area asked the Shaykh to marry his daughter – Zakiyyah. He had two children with her – Noor al Hassan and Sai’d al Hassan.</p>
<p>He then made Hajj in 1285H and then passed by Hudaydah in Yemen and there he stayed some days and asked for the books of Imaam ash-Shawkaani the likes of Nayl al-Awtaar, Fath al-Qadeerand others and he wrote a copy of those books for himself by hand. When he returned to his people he compiled the books and began to teach the people and was promoted to the Minister responsible for affairs of Education. He found this a blessing from Allaah and an important duty to teach the aqeedah of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p>When the queen of that area died she was succeeded by her daughter. As problems heightened in the country the new queen needed someone to help her govern the country and could not find anyone more suitable than Siddīq Hassan Khan. She went to him personally and asked him to marry her, and thus he became the Amīr of that area, due to his marriage to the queen. This gave him a greater opportunity to spread the Da’wah. His life was long as is his biography. He used his position as Amīr to spread the Da’wah – many books were published and printed and schools were opened to teach the Sunnah and Hadith. In a brief time this area in India became an example to follow in establishing the Aqeedah as-Salafiyyah of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p>His da’wah included the writing of many books dedicated to guiding and rectifying the people. By the blessing and virtue of Allaah سبحانه و تعالى many ‘Ulamaa came to that area as he was very kind and had a lot of wealth that he used to spread the Da’wah. During that time he published Fath al-Baari the explanation of Sahih al-Bukharee, and sent it to many places of the world including Algeria and Morocco, where it was distributed free of charge to the people.
