<p><span class="bold">Name:</span> Muhammad bin Mus`ab Al-`Abid, from Baghdad. ( * )<br />
<span class="bold">Kunya:</span> Abu Ja`far.<br />
<span class="bold">The Nickname &#8220;Ad-Da`a&#8217;:</span> Abu Sa`d As-Sam`ani said about it: &#8220;It is used for the one who does a lot of du`a and is well-known of that, and the one known with that (nickname) is Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin Mus`ab Ad-Da`a&#8217;.&#8221; (1)</p>
<p><span class="bold">His Teachers:</span><br />
&#8211; Abdullah bin al-Mubarak<br />
&#8211; Ar-Rabee` bin Badr<br />
&#8211; Ahmad bin Hanbal</p>
<p><span class="bold">His Students:</span><br />
&#8211; Abul Hasan bin Al-`Attar<br />
&#8211; Ja`far bin Ahmad bin Sam<br />
&#8211; Muhammad bin Nasr As-Sa&#8217;igh (2)</p>
<p><span class="artRedTitle">His Life and Scholars&#8217; Views of Him:</span></p>
<p><span class="artBlue">Ibn Sa`d (d. 230 H.)</span> said: &#8220;His kunya is Abu Ja`far, he wasa recitors (reciters ??) of the book of Allah, and he heard the Hadith and sat with the people. He was trustworthy (thiqah) insha Allah.&#8221; (3)<br />
<span class="artBlue">Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal</span> said: &#8220;He was a righteous man, he used to tell stories, and make duaa standing in the Masjid&#8221;, then he said: &#8220;Sometimes Ibn `Aliyah might sit in the Masjid al Jame` listening to his du`a.&#8221;<br />
He also said: &#8220;He came to me once and wrote some Hadeeths, and sat in this seat of yours, and said: &#8216;O Lord hide me under Your Throne.&#8221; (4)<br />
Abu Bakr Al-Marrudhi said: &#8220;I asked Abu Abdullah (Imam Ahmad) about Muhammad bin Mus`ab Al-`Abid, so he praised him and said: &#8216;And what a man!&#8217;; I said: Was he upon Sunnah?; He replied: &#8220;Yes, I swear; and I have written from him&#8217;. &#8221; (13)<br />
<span class="artBlue">Muhammad bin Nasr As-Sa&#8217;igh</span> said: &#8220;I heard from Muhammad bin Mus`ab al-`Abid, he was from the ones whose du`as are answered, and I have not seen a better recitor of the Book of Allah (Quran) than him.&#8221; (5)<br />
<span class="artBlue">Al-Khateeb al-Baghdadi</span> said: &#8220;He was one of the remembered worshipers, and known recitors (of the Quran), Ahmad bin Hanbal praised him, and described him to be upon Sunnah.&#8221; (6) Adh-Dhahabi said about him: &#8220;One of the awliya&#8217; of Allah, he was a person of karamat.&#8221; (7)<br />
<span class="artBlue">As-Safadi</span> said: &#8220;His truthfulness and trustworthiness has been agreed upon.&#8221; (8)</p>
<p>The Ma`mun had once ordered that Muhammad bin Mus`ab be imprisoned. When he was being taken to prison, Muhammad raised his head to the sky, and said: &#8220;I take an oath by You (Allah) if I am imprisoned tonight, that I leave (prison) in the middle of the night.&#8221;, so Imam Muhammad prayed Fajr in his home. (9)<br />
The Messenger of Allah said: &#8220;There are some of Allah&#8217;s servants who, if they take an oath by Allah, Allah fullfils them.&#8221; <span class="artTakhrij">[Sahih Bukhari and Muslim]</span></p>
<p>Muhammad bin Mus`ab said: I heard Ibn al-Mubarak mentioning Al-Awza`i narrating that Bilal bin Sa`d said: <span class="artAthar">«Do not look at the smallness of the sin, but look at Who you disobeyed.»</span> (10)</p>
<p><span class="bold">He died</span> in Baghdad in the month of Dhul Qi`dah, year 228 Hijri. (11)</p>
<p><span class="artRedTitle">Some of His Statements in Matters of Belief:</span><br />
Muhammad bin Mus`ab said: <span class="artAthar">«Whoever claims that You do not speak, and that you are not seen on the day of judgement, then he is a disbeliever (kafir) in You and does not know You, I testify that You are above the Throne, above the seven heavens, and not as Your enemies, the heretics, say.&#8221; Its chain is sahih.
