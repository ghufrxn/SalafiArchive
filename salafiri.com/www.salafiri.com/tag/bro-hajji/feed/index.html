<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the fifth reply in the series on Bro Hajji’s distortion of the truth and matters pertaining to the unified position of Ahlus Sunnah on Khuruj or rebellion. In addition to these replies, I have answered many of his points on our forum, <em>Forum.Salafiri.com</em> and twitter. The previous replies can be found on our website, and they are as follows,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.salafiri.com/demolishing-and-mutilating-bro-hajji-oh-the-shame-expanding-on-outrageously-lame-destroying-the-neo-khariji-bro-hajjis-claim/">https://www.salafiri.com/demolishing-and-mutilating-bro-hajji-oh-the-shame-expanding-on-outrageously-lame-destroying-the-neo-khariji-bro-hajjis-claim/</a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This fifth reply answers Bro Hajji’s distortion that Imam Malik <em>Rahimahullah</em> allowed rebellion and deemed revolt against an unjust ruler to be permissible. I have already, very clearly presented the ignorance of Bro Hajji, his desecration and violation of hadith sciences and <em>al-Jarh Wa’t Ta’dil</em>. However, despite universal embarrassment and utter humiliation at the lack of his knowledge, he remains defiant and stubborn in his little make belief world of Youtube! This is more so on account of some comments and thumbs up by unknowns, which have massaged his ego, despite his abysmal failure in all other ventures. Let us now move on to refute this distortion and the ignorance of Bro Hajji.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A circulating document was shared with me that lists the evidence and statements for rebelling against an unjust ruler. This document seems to be a summarised transcription of the ill researched and uneducated speech of Bro Hajji. Point 27 of this document alleges Imam Malik allowed rebellion against an unjust ruler and the document reads,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">27.Imam Malik deemed it appropriate to revolt against (an) unjust ruler and tyrannical rulers. Imam Ibn Jarir reported that when he issued a verdict to the people in favour of the actions of Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Hasan, who revolted in the year 145 Hijri, he was told “On our conscious is allegiance to al-Mansur.” He said, “You were forced to swear and allegiance cannot be compelled.” Here ends his words as reported in Ibn Kathirs book al-Bidayah wal Nihaya.</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bro Hajji used this report of Imam Malik to prove he allowed and believed it was permissible to rebel and revolt against an unjust ruler.  The report used by Bro Hajji in in <em>Tarikh at-Tabari</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Sa’id is a typographical error, and it should be Sa’d which is clear from the books of Rijal and Tarikh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">And transmitted Sa’d b. Abdul Hamid b. Ja’far b. Abdullah b. al-Hakam b. Sinan al-Hakami, the brother of the Ansar. He said, I have been informed by <strong>MORE THAN ONE PERSON</strong> on the authority of Malik b. Anas who was asked about rebelling with Muhammad. It was said to him (i.e. Malik), “We have given the oath of allegiance (i.e. it is around our necks) to Abu Ja’far.” Malik responded, “You gave the allegiance under compulsion which is not binding upon everyone when they are coerced. The people then hurried to Muhammad (to join him) but Malik stayed at home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are two central problems with this report and both problems render it weak, as the problem relates to reporters in the chain.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Problem</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The chain is disconnected and there is no clear information on who actually reported this from Imam Malik. Since in the science of hadith, it is not acceptable because the requirements are for the names in the chain to be mentioned, i.e. who reported the incident. The usage of the words, <strong>“more than one person” </strong>is unclear and therefore the chain is disconnected. This then ultimately renders the chain weak. This in the science of hadith is known as <em>Jahalatur-Rawi</em>, such a problem is serious which renders the report weak. The narrator(s) is majhul i.e. unknown and therefore it falls under the ruling of <em>majhul ul-Ayn</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The report despite mentioning “more than one person narrated this” does not add any weight to the argument but rather it weakens it because if there were more than one person, naming them should be easier.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Problem</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The serious problem is the weakness of Sa’d b. Abdul Hamid, who is a narrator of this report. He was classified weak by the scholars of Hadith and Rijal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Abi Hatim said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">My father met him, but he did not write hadith from him, and I heard my father say this.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The View of Imam Ibn Ma’in</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Ma’in has several statements concerning him. Ibn Junayd asked Imam Ibn Ma’in about Sa’d b. Abdul Hamid. He said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no harm in him, I wrote hadith from him.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Junayd said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">A man said to Yahya b. Ma’in, I heard a hadith from Sa’d b. Abdul Hamid? He replied, “There is no harm in him, and he would hear hadith casually”.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhanna b. Yahya said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I asked Ahmad b. Hanbal, Abu Khaythamah and Yahya b. Ma’in (about) Abu Mu’adh Sa’d b. Abdul Hamid b. Ja’far? They said, “He is Ibn Abdul Hamid b. Ja’far al-Madani? So, I said, “How is his affair”? They said he is here in the suburbs of the Ansar, and he claims to have casually heard the books of Malik b. Anas”!<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The wording of Imam Khatib al-Baghdadi adds,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad said to me the people refute and reject this (his claims) since he was here in Baghdad and he did not perform Hajj, so how could he have heard from Malik casually?<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We know when Imam Ibn Ma’in says, <em>“There is no harm in him”</em> it means the narrator is authentic according to him. However, some narrators like this are declared weak according to other scholars of hadith. For example, Harith b. Abdullah al-A’ur. Imam Ibn Ma’in said about him, <em>“There is no harm in him”</em> Yet other scholars of hadith declared him to be a liar. Imam ad-Darimi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Ma’in cannot be supported in this.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are many examples like this. Sometimes Imam Ibn Ma’in will use the words to indicate someone is truthful but weak, see for example Yunus b. Harith at-Ta’ifi.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> We also know the last view of Imam Ibn Ma’in regarding any narrator is what was narrated by Abbas ad-Duri, he transmits from Imam Ibn Ma’in that he graded Yunus weak.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>This shows the possibility of Sa’d b. Abdul Hamid being weak as well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, from Imam Ibn Ma’in’s terminology as mentioned by Imam Adiyy is that when Ibn Ma’in says, <em>“write his hadith” </em>then it means the narrator is from the weak narrators whose ahadith are written.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imams al-Bukhari and Ibn Abi Hatim</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both Imams bring an entry for him in their respective books but without quoting or making any criticism on him or even praising him. On the apparent this seems the Imams did not criticize him. For their entries see Imam al-Bukhari’s <em>Tarikh al-Kabir</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> and in another edition<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> and Imam Ibn Hatim <em>al-Jarh Wa’t Ta’dil</em>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr explained when Imam al-Bukhari and Imam Ibn Abi Hatim remain silent on a narrator without quoting criticism, then such a narrator according to them is <em>Mastur al-Hal</em> and his ahadith need supporting evidence. <em>Mastur al-Hal </em>is<em> Majhul al-Hal</em> i.e. their affair is unknown which renders such narrators and their reports weak.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In one edition of the <em>Tarikh al-Kabir</em> he is described as Baghdadi, meaning a person from Baghdad.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Saji said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’d b. Abdul Hamid b. Ja’far, they (the hadith scholars) disparaged and criticised his ahadith.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Ali Saleh b. Muhammad Jazrah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no harm in him, another time he said, he had a weak memory.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Sufyan ath-Thawri also criticised him on the basis of his legal edicts.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ya’qub b. Shaybah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Trustworthy, truthful.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Khatib al-Baghdadi in his entry says he was from Ahlul Madinah but lived in the Ansar quarters in Baghdad and that he transmitted from Malik b. Anas.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a> It is possible Sa’d was born in Madinah but then moved to Baghdad at a young age and this does not contradict the statement of Imam Ahmad, that did not leave Baghdad. Hafiz al-Mizzi opens his entry by saying he resided in the Ansar quarter in Baghdad.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imam ad-Dhahabi</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam ad-Dhahabi declared him to be thiqah.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a> Another time he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Trustworthy and Ibn Hibban said he is not used as evidence.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam ad-Dhahabi also had an entry for him in his book of weak narrators, <em>al-Mughni</em>. He said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Truthful, Ibn Hibban said, He would make bad errors and he was not used as evidence.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam ad-Dhahabi also brings an entry for him in his book of weak and abandoned narrators, <em>Diwan ad-Dhu’afa wa’l Matrukin</em>. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hibban said, he would make bad mistakes and Ibn Ma’in said there is no harm in him.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the <em>Mizan</em> Imam ad-Dhahabi brings his entry and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Ma’in said there is no harm in him and Ibn Hibban said he would make bad mistakes, he is not used as evidence.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is therefore natural for us to conclude that despite Imam al-Dhahabi saying he was trustworthy, he also brings his entry in his books on weak and abandoned narrators. This at the very least raises doubts on the reliability of Sa’d in the view of Imam ad-Dhahabi</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Hafiz Ibn Hajr</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr after his entry brings the statement of the early hadith and rijal scholars and then proceeds with Imam Ibn Hibbans’ statement which Imam Ibn hibban mention in his book on abandoned and weak narrators. Imam Ibn Hibban said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">His kunyah was Abu Mu’adh. Originally from Madinah but resided in Baghdad and he narrated from Ibn Abi Zinad. He would narrate rejected reports from famous narrators which were very bad mistakes and excessive errors to the extent that people avoided using him as evidence.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani also brings his entry in his <em>Lisan</em>. He mentions he was born in Madinah and moved to Baghdad. In one edition of the <em>Lisan</em> it says he narrated the <em>Muwatta</em> from Imam Malik but most editions only mention he narrated from Imam Malik.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a> In summarizing his view on Sa’d b. Abdul Hamid, Hafiz Ibn Hajr said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Truthful but makes/has mistakes.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This seems to be the final position of Hafiz Ibn Hajr on Sa’d b. Abdul Hamid as his <em>Taqrib</em> is his summary of his position on the narrators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Mughlatai after bringing his entry, quotes the statement of Imam Ibn Hibban from <em>al-Majruhin</em>. He also adds Imam al-Hakim used his hadith in his <em>Mustadrak</em> and Ibn al-Qattan said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is Majhul al-hal.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imam al-Hakim and his Leniency</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bro Hajji and his blind supporters might argue that Imam al-Hakim used him as a reporter in his <em>al-Mustadrak </em>therefore, he was reliable with him. The answer to this is that Imam al-Hakim is Mutasahil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Imam as-Salah, in his reference work for hadith, <em>Ulum al-Hadith</em> also grades Imam al-Hakim as lenient.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imams al-Nawawi and al-Suyuti in his <em>Taqrib and Tadrib al-Rawi Fi Sharh Taqrib al-Nawawi</em> both held the view that Imam al-Hakim was lenient. al-Suyuti even went onto say that Imam ad-Dhahabi rendered many of al-Hakims hadith in his <em>al-Mustadrak</em> weak and even compiled a treatise of around 100 fabricated narrations. This indicates the leniency of Imam al-Hakim.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam ad-Dhahabi alludes to the leniency of al-Hakim and says he himself has collated the fabricated and weak ahadith in al-Hakims <em>al-Mustadrak</em>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> Imam ad-Dhahabi very clearly declares Imam al-Hakim to be Mutasahil, he says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Like the type that is referred to as Mutasahil like al-Hakim.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam ad-Dhahabi said another time, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The mutasahil (lenient ones) are like….al-Hakim …<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Irshad ul-Haq al-Athari said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say their leniency (tasahul ie of al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban) is well known and al-Shaykh al-Albani has mentioned in <em>Silsilah ad-Da</em><em>’</em><em>ifa</em> no.23 so refer to it.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Hamdi Abdul Majid as-Salafi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then it is well known about both (Ibn Hibban and al-Hakim) of them that they are mutasahil i.e. lenient.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Hakim brings this report in his <em>al-Mustadrak</em>,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1:452 no.1161 (DKI, 1411/1990)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2:230 no.1172 (Dar al-Minhaj al-Qawwim (1439/2018)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Hakim said about the hadith that was transmitted by Sa’d b. Abdul Hamid,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith is Sahih on the condition of Muslim and he did not transmit it.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam ad-Dhahabi agreed that it was on the condition of Muslim.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a> However, it is not on the condition of Muslim. The researchers of the Dar al-Minhaj al-Qawwim edition, under the supervision of Ashraf b. Muhammad Najib al-Misri said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’d b. Abdul Hamid has weakness in him and he (Imam Muslim) did not transmit from.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is also supported by Ramadhan Ahmad Ali Muhammad who said about the narration transmitted by Sa’d b. Abdul Hamid,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was narrated from Sa’d b. Abdul Hamid and he (Imam Muslim) did not transmit using him and he has weakness in him. He also said ad-Dhahabi said about him in <em>ad-Dhu’afa</em> that Ibn Hibban said he makes a lot of mistakes, Ibn Ma’in said there is no harm in him and al-Hafiz said, truthful but makes mistakes.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the researchers of <em>Sahih Tarikh at-Tabari</em> in <em>al-Khilafah Fi Ahd al-Abbasiyun</em> of Imam at-Tabari do not mention this incident. Therefore, they concluded and did not consider tis report to be authentic. This was compiled by Muhammad b. Tahir al-Barzanji and Muhammad Subhi Hasan Hallaq. It further says some chapters were presented to Dr. Ali Muhammad as-Sallabi and Dr. Ibrahim al-Jaf and they agreed with the everything in those respective chapters.<a style="color: #000000;" href="applewebdata://911595E9-F805-4CC5-A6C5-50AF775A7828#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have clearly learnt Bro Hajji lied on Imam Malik and he lied badly. The report from Imam Malik is not authentic and therefore propagating Imam Malik allowed armed rebellion, gave a fatwa but then stayed at home himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bro Hajji needs to retract this fabricated lie and the attempted deceptive ploy to fool his gullible listeners. It is also the duty of his listeners, followers and supporters to bring this up him and for him to retract and apologise for his blatant lie on Imam Malik.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>until the end of times,</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> To proceed,</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Breaking Down and Dismantling Bro Hajji </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Part 1</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bro Hajji had a meltdown rant, where he is clearly DISTURBED. There are so many cuts &amp; edits of the video, he must&#8217;ve had a nightmare.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In his video he rants that I talk about <strong>Asma wa&#8217;l Sifat</strong> all the time, which hurts him because he understands that as Dividing and causing discord (TS 45:50).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He proceeds to say the Salafis don&#8217;t have a monopoly on the Athari creed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is silly schooling this delusional fame seeker. The Athari&#8217;s of past, like <strong>al-Barbahari, al-Athram, al-Marwazi, al-Najjad, Sharif Abu Jafar </strong>&amp; many others defended and propagated the creed of the Salaf, they did divide the people as did the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasalam between <strong>Tawhid</strong> and <strong>Shirk</strong>, <strong>haqq</strong> and <strong>batil.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Same Atharis were all agreed in not rebelling against the ruler and sternly advocated <strong>al-Sam&#8217;a wa&#8217;t Ta&#8217;a</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bro Hajji doesn&#8217;t even know who or what the Athari&#8217;s are, but he uses the label to avoid the <strong>Salafi label</strong>. He went onto say al-Barbahari&#8217;s <em>Sharh al-Sunnah</em> was the Talmud of the Madkhalis, but <strong>al-Barbahari</strong> was the face of the Athari&#8217;s.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any sane intelligent person would ask where does that leave Hajji? This so called Athari, sits with the <strong>Sufi Deobandi Ash&#8217;ari Maturidis</strong>, who attack the <strong>Salafis and Ahl al-Hadith</strong> for their belief in <strong>al-Asma wa&#8217;l Sifat</strong> on their <strong>hanafi fiqh channel</strong>, where they push their <strong>innovative ta&#8217;wil</strong>, yet all parties are best of mates Bro Hajji holds the view; the truth is with the Ahl al-Hadith and <strong>Deobandis</strong>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is in of itself pure deviancy and this <strong>front room camera loving</strong> boy thinks it&#8217;s acceptable. Not at all, not even the <strong>Deobandis</strong> say this, who are firm on their <strong>Maturidi belief</strong> system, even though it Is corrupt &amp; contradicts the belief system of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bro Hajji, to this day has failed to shake of his <strong>Deobandi Hanafi Maturidi beliefs</strong>. He wants to be the new <strong>talmudic saviour</strong> and refute the Salafis but it&#8217;s all fun and games with the Hanafi Deobandis. This is the true reality of Hajji.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Deobandis believe in Wahdatul Wajud, deny Allah&#8217;s Uluww, seek intercession with the dead, seek help from Abdul Qadir Jilani yet Hajji&#8217;s motor mouth is zipped and hush hush because he doesn&#8217;t want to upset his true ancestors. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When pressed by a Rafidhi to state his Manhaj he first laughs and then disgracefully fails the basic aspects of Sunnism of declaring his Athari-Hanafi nexus. So much so, the <strong>Rafidi shi&#8217;i</strong> was forced to say to him <strong>&#8220;are you doing Ta&#8217;qiyyah&#8221;.</strong> Prior to that Hajji tells the Rafidi to ascertain what kind of Sunni he is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WHAT! Exactly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Athari&#8217;s and Salafis were always one, they still are and they will continue to be, but this new hybrid breed (as the Rafidi Shi&#8217;a) says to Bro Hajji, is a breed that are nothing but the <strong>Ruwaybidah</strong> who seek to sever the link between the Sunni layman and The Rabbani Sunni scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bro Hajji claims I&#8217;ve not studied, and if he had done his research, like he rants in the video like a mad man, that he found out who I was in half an hour, then</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">1. I was not hiding, I think he spent too much time with the Rafidah, that he got obsessed with the hole of the 12th Imam.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li>That I still currently study. In fact by the way of information, I started to intensely study, when Bro Hajji was 12 years old, when he was beginning to learn how to make his tie for his school uniform! This being said, Bro Hajji has no Islamic Education at all whatsoever. He has not studied with anyone, never sat with any scholar for formal learning, never learnt any book on <strong>Aqidah, Manhaj or Fiqh or even a basic primer</strong>. He probably has studied <strong>Ta&#8217;lim ul-Islam, Ta&#8217;lim ul-Haq</strong> and the infamous <strong>Beshiti Zewar</strong>! He spent ‎Nominal years with a <strong>Madinah University Graduate</strong>, who I know personally, his learning with him was purely Arabic <strong>ا ب ت</strong><strong>. </strong>So, we find this front room camera loving stubborn boy knows absolutely nothing.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He bought a few books, did some basic research in Shia&#8217;ism and we have a <strong>Bonafide ruwaybidah</strong>. At one stage this <strong>Deobandi Ash&#8217;ari Maturidis Hanafi sympathetiser was volunteering at a Deobandi Masjid</strong> when Shaykh Sudais came to Birmingham. He shrugs at the idea of him being a closet Ash&#8217;ari, this is like the <strong>Sufi Barelwi who believes that Allah incarnates Into humans,</strong> even he claims he is Salafi because he make taqlid of Abu Hanifah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We can perhaps extend this to the recent deception of the people of <strong>ta&#8217;wil and tafwidh</strong> who say, we follow the Creed of the Salaf, we are Athari but they intend with this <strong>Tafwidh al-Ma&#8217;ana A Salafi or Athari</strong> is the one who is Athari in Aqidah and Manhaj, they are interlinked and mutually exclusive, not this Deobandi Maturidi pick and choose, like the <strong>Zanadiqah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Bro Hajji full of himself says, I&#8217;m an Athari-Hanafi. Okay, so If we go back and look at an Athari-Hanafi, for arguments lets take <strong>Imam Tahawi and Imam Ibn Abil Izz</strong>, they refuted <strong>khuruj </strong>and advocated obeying the ruler! Bro Hajji doesn&#8217;t even have them to back his pick and choose corrupt methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the video where the Shia says to Bro Hajji are you doing Taqiyyah. You spend time with the innovators, you become like them. We, the Salafis know our Din and this &#8220;one&#8221; man army as he likes to delude himself into thinking, is going to refute us!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzRgObzDBjw&amp;feature=youtu.be</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Breaking Down and Dismantling Bro Hajji – Part 2</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bro Hajji &amp; his cohorts would be the first to support <strong>Iranian, Shia, Houti, Hezbullah Khuruj against Makkah &amp; Madinah</strong> because they&#8217;re in KSA &amp; it&#8217;s leaders are oppressive. This is the Manhaj these <strong>ruwaybidah</strong> want you to adopt. We ask, the Sunni scholars must&#8217;ve rebelled against the <strong>Fatimid Isma&#8217;ils, Ubaydullah &amp; his son Abul Qasim</strong>, who prevented Jumuah, right?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They want you to make Khuruj like the Qarmatah did. Who used to attack the Hajj caravans (around 299H). They attacked Basra in 311H, killed its inhabitants and destroyed their property. The same year they attacked the Hajj Caravans. In 315H they attacked Baghdad and ransacked it. In 317H they stole the black stone and took it to Bahrayn, it was only returned in 339H (after 22 years). This is just a Snippet of the things Khuruj produced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, these textbook <strong>ruwaybidah</strong>, who articulate shi&#8217;i tendencies, be it <strong>Fatimiyyah or Qaramatah</strong> want to say, Khuruj is a valid difference! They deceive the masses, they say it is better not to make Khuruj but it&#8217;s permissible and a valid Opinion under certain circumstances. They proceed to support this view by citing the differences and incidences that occurred between the illustrious Sahabah. When we are told, through divine texts that when the Sahabah are mentioned then, <strong>WITHHOLD.</strong> The Rawafidh spew fabrication After fabrication and these ruwaybidah, get affected by their doctrine and in turn they say well, the Sahabah did make <strong>khuruj</strong> and they did kill each other etc, the shi&#8217;i laughs and says <strong>&#8220;see I told you&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is this <strong>ruwaybid, front room camera loving</strong> <strong>little pappu</strong> Who loved the fame, the cameras of Hyde Park, a well done son from his ignorant followers which boosted his pea sized brain to the size of the ego he has. They opened the door for the Rawafidh while Shaytan fooled them thinking they were refuting. This is Bro Hajji for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Breaking Down &amp; Dismantling Bro Hajji &#8211; Part 3</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bro Hajji claims he is an Athari Hanafi and throughout his videos he fails to utilise any of these schools as authority to evidence his claims. He, at one time uses <strong>al-Jassas, a Mu’tazili</strong> This nexus in general is highly problematic, which we will Deconstruct later, InshaAllah. In some of his videos, as relayed to us, he relies on <strong>Imams Ibn Hazm and Ibn Abd al-Barr</strong>, both 5th century Sunni polymaths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bro Hajji&#8217;s main argument is that when the ruler takes your wealth and women, Ibn Hazm and others permitted <strong>Khuruj</strong>. Therefore, the central argument is, if the ruler is oppressive in this way, it&#8217;s permissible to rebel against him. So, we say: we will return to Ibn Hazm and Ibn Abd al-Barr at a later stage, but let us refer back to the annals of history and look at the affairs that preceded their era.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will look at how rulers and those in authority did some of these things but despite this, there were no widespread collective <strong>organised rebellions ie khuruj</strong>, except some riots and general skirmishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Almost 100-150 years before Ibn Hazm &amp; Ibn Abd al-Barr, in the 4th century (300+), Baghdad and the surrounding are faced great upheaval, turmoil and an extremely difficult financial crisis, that lasted for over 100 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Governance was very difficult, wuzara (ministers) had to borrow money to pay soldiers, general property was insecure and was the Subject of confiscation by government officials, soldiers or military personnel. There was general plundering, shops and markets were burned, there were floods, epidemics and famine, which was often accompanied with regular food riots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">General financial revenue was in decline from the various lands in terms of taxes. The government introduced <strong>iqta</strong>, which essentially means transferring the ownership of land. With this decline the government began paying soldiers with iqta land. They also tried to extort money from previous officials. They tried to collect more tax but all failed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From around 305-328H taxes on people, farmers increased. The governors for the rulers failed to pay taxes themselves. The military governors of Wasit and Basra both declined to pay. With little money the government resorted to Iqta. Only the The leader or Imam could transfer land to those who needed paying, but a small surcharge applied<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> and only the land the ruler owned could be transferred.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In due course the rulers changed the rules and began to transfer land they didn&#8217;t own and thus could do that to anyone&#8217;s land, any farmer or poor person. This lead to the military and senior military personnel confiscating land of the poor. The military class flourished, they Got richer as well as the elite upper class government officials. Natural disasters, epidemics caused more problems and poor farmers had less land to cultivate. They eventually were unable to pay land rent and the senior government officials and military took the lands. Those who retained their land, had to give some of it to the military elite in order to seek protection from other government officials who were extorting them. Government officials across the board began taxing <strong>waqf</strong> land and took the land expenses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The elite of society were gifted Iqta land which included singers, merchants and other influential people. On the other hand, the <strong>evil Qaramatah</strong> continued their relentless attack on the state. Throughout this period, tax collectors became extremely rich, military officers and wuzara used extortion on a daily basis, Food markets were pillaged due to the shortage of cash and food. Regular soldiers and low level officials extorting food merchants and they were even tortured.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many merchants and business owners abandoned major cities including Baghdad due to riots and civil unrest in general Warehouse owners hid wheat and other grains in fear of the administration. Senior government officials would steal and confiscate the food and this even led to people being killed, these events took place around 334H</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Around 381H food merchants were robbed again by government Officials and mass riots ensued.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 350H <strong>Mu&#8217;izz al-Dawla</strong>, the ruler and leader destroyed houses in order to build His residence, he forced people to sell their properties. He then levied huge taxes and confiscated the wealth of the people.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 373H similar things ensued, heavy taxes were imposed and commodities were very expensive to purchase. This caused more anger, the people damaged masajids and at one stage prevented people from praying. The governor&#8217;s imposed taxes on clothes and other basic stuff which led people to riot, further turmoil and chaos,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Political instability, bad administration, greed, natural disasters, floods, crop failure, primitive agricultural, socio-political issues, religious observances, sects and Madhhahib all contributed to problems in various Muslim cities and Baghdad. In 423H, 431H, 439H and 448H people suffered from the rise of food prices which lead to famine and disease. between 466-469 there was a flood every year in Baghdad which caused a lot of problems as described above.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite all of this, the <strong>Muslims didn&#8217;t rebel</strong>, they didn&#8217;t do <strong>khuruj</strong>, raise arms and fight the rulers. Yes,they did riot, they did express their anger and even killed people but there was no <strong>organised Khuruj</strong> to dispose the rulers. Were they upset And angry, well of course they were, but they had patience in their own way. Skirmishes, local rioting and some unfavourable activities were and are not considered making <strong>khuruj</strong>. History teaches us, this even led the rulers to change policies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this part I&#8217;ve presented A very basic synopsis of some of the events to show what Muslims had to endure during that era. So if they did not rebel, modern day people, like the debunked <strong>Dodgy Bro Hajji </strong>have no right to tell people that <strong>Khuruj</strong> was an option or is still a viable option despite not being The first method of rectification. As the Salaf said, we will refute Ahl al-Bid’ah through history.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Incompetent and hasty people like bro Hajji are a testimony to the authenticity of the ahadith which mention the <strong>ruwaybidah </strong>will disseminate views and opinions by which they will Misguide themselves and others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Breaking and Dismantling Bro Hajji &#8211; Part 4</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a few videos Bro Hajji references the honourable companion, <strong>Nu&#8217;man b. Bashir RadhiAllahu Anhu</strong> &amp; the Tab&#8217;i, <strong>al-Sha&#8217;bi</strong> from among those who rebelled! He uses their actions as unchallenged evidence while refuting the accepted And established view of Ahl al-Sunnah, which is not to rebel. The correct understanding, as the early scholars of Islam have explained will be inshaAllah presented later, with a plethora of statements that represent how Ahl al-Sunnah understood these events.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bro Hajji, repeatedly alleges that Salafis distort views, that they are selective in their quotations and thus, they ultimately misrepresent the truth. Without exceeding this particular part more than what is required. In the following Hadith, the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasalam said&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(The Muslims being a collective communal body) al-Jama&#8217;ah is mercy and splitting is punishment.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">which is transmitted by <strong>Nu&#8217;man b. Bashir RadhiAllahu Anhu</strong> and in turn <em>al-Sha&#8217;bi</em> transmits it from him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have highlighted the references for this hadith, where <strong>Dr. Basim al-Jawabirah</strong> <strong>Grades the chain Hasan &#8211; good</strong>, in his checking of <strong><em>Kitab al-Sunnah</em></strong> of <strong>Imam Ibn Abi Asim (d.287H)</strong><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>, at the end of the references, <strong>al-Haithami</strong> is quoted as saying, all of the narrators in the chain are trustworthy. The footnote shows further references for this report, so let the reader make recourse to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-8942 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/al-sunnah-cov.jpg?resize=323%2C436" alt="al-sunnah cov" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/al-sunnah-cov.jpg?resize=222%2C300 222w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/al-sunnah-cov.jpg?resize=768%2C1037 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/al-sunnah-cov.jpg?resize=759%2C1024 759w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/al-sunnah-cov.jpg?w=1184 1184w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-8943 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/al-sunnah-text.jpeg?resize=338%2C450" alt="al-sunnah text" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/al-sunnah-text.jpeg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/al-sunnah-text.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/al-sunnah-text.jpeg?resize=450%2C600 450w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/al-sunnah-text.jpeg?w=1200 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the celebrated Salafi theologist, Ibn Battah (387H) transmits the same Hadith in his <strong><em>al-Ibanah</em></strong><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>, but with a variation in the chain. The statement of <strong>Imam Ibn Abi Hatim</strong> from his father, is answered by an alternative chain that authenticates it. So the Hadith is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, this shows they were against splitting or separating from the Jama&#8217;ah of Muslims, knowing that it was tantamount to punishment and being united as a <strong>collective Muslim body was a mercy</strong>. So they knew this Hadith and what occurred with them cannot fall under rebellion, because that is splitting and Separating from the Jama&#8217;ah of the Muslims. So, with a single Hadith, we dismantle the feeble and weak arguments of Bro Hajji.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BENEFIT</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Imam Ibn Abi Asim</strong> died (287H) exactly 100 years before <strong>Imam Ibn Battah</strong> (387H).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tremendous Advice of the Salaf for Bro Hajji; ‘Saved Sect Syndrome’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ʿĀṣim Aḥwāl said, Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah said to us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Learn Islam and when you’ve learnt it, do not turn away from it. And follow the Straight path, for that is Islam. Do not deviate to the right or to the left of the Straight Path. Upon you is the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ, just as the people [Ṣaḥābah] were upon, before the killing of their Ṣaḥābah [i.e. ʿUthmān] and what they did after that [i]. For indeed we had read the Qurʾān 15 years before the Ṣaḥābah were killed and before what these people did after that. So, I warn you from these desires that sow the seeds of enmity and hatred amongst you.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʿĀṣim Aḥwāl said: I informed al-Ḥasan [al-Baṣrī] what Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah had said. He replied, “He spoke the truth and advised you with it”. Then I narrated this to Hafṣah bint Sirīn and she said, “You are family, have you narrated this to Muḥammad?” [ii] I said, “No”. She said, “Narrate this to him.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaykh Khalid b. ʿUthmān said, it is <strong>Ṣaḥīḥ Maqtuʿa</strong>, [meaning that it is authentic but the type of report is <strong>Maqtuʿa</strong> i.e. from a Tabʿī]. He references it to al-Maʿmar.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the <em>Iʿtiqād Ahl al-Sunnah</em> of Imam al-Lālakāʿī the report is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Learn Islam and when you’ve learnt it, do not turn away from it. And follow the Straight path, for that is Islam. Do not deviate to the right or to the left of [the straight path of] Islam. Upon you is the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ, which the Ṣaḥābah were upon, So, I warn you from these desires that sow the seeds of enmity and hatred amongst you.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the <em>Kitāb Sharīʿah</em> of Imam al-ʿĀjurrī he brings it in the second chapter, mentioning the command of the Prophet ﷺ to the Ummah to hold onto the Jamaʿāh and warning them from dividing into sects.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imam Ibn Baṭṭah transmits it his <em>al-Ibānah al-Kubrā</em><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>. Imam Ibn Baṭṭah also brings this report in the same chapter title as the of Imam al-ʿAjurrī.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[i]</strong> &#8211; This is what the <em>Khawārij</em> did after that period, in terms of reckless killing, rebelling against the legitimate Muslim rulers, killing innocent people and making <em>takfīr of the Muslims.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[ii]</strong> – He is the great Imām, <strong>Muḥammad b. Sirīn</strong> from the Salaf, well known for his stance against the people of innovation and desires.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This anecdote and advice of the Salaf advising to stick to the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger ﷺ and not to deviate from the straight path. <strong>Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah</strong> talks about the <strong>Khawārij</strong> and their <strong>killing of ʿUthmān RaḍīAllāhu ʿAnhu</strong>, their enmity for him and making <strong>takfīr </strong>and opposing all those who loved and revered him. He rebukes their actions and their methodology by describing it as desires. The harms of these desires were splitting the unity of the Muslims and breaking away from the Jamāʿah of the Muslim body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also learn how the <strong>Salaf were uniform and in agreement in such matters of Creed and Manhaj</strong>. All the aforementioned eminent <strong>Salafi Ahl al-Hadith</strong> scholars quote this account in the beginning of their respective Creed manuals, thereby giving weight to its content. Furthermore, the same <strong>Ahl al-Ḥadīth Salafī scholars</strong> place the account under the chapter of being united with the Muslim body and staying away from dividing into sects and groups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah</strong> adds, such ideas and ideologies that opposes the path of the companions, not only are they deviation, but they will also sow seeds of hatred in the Muslim Ummah. This is what we see, the oblivious individual, in addition to being weak in his knowledge and comprehension, is vehemently ardent in misguiding and confusing the Sunni Muslims. Individuals like Bro Hajji, are a 3D epitome and prime example of what the Salaf warned us from, they are nothing except concubines of the Khawārij, standing or sitting. They opened the doors for the worshippers of grave, the <strong>Rawafidh</strong> and sowed seeds of doubting the understanding of the illustrious Ṣaḥābah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The statement was profound &#8211; it led <strong>ʿĀṣim Aḥwāl</strong> to inform <strong>Ḥasan al-Baṣrī</strong> who endorsed the advice. Āṣim Aḥwāl then informs the daughter of <strong>Muḥammad b. Sirīn</strong>, who advises him to inform her father. This aspect of the account highlights how the eminent Salaf valued advice from their predecessors and hence its great importance. The Salaf named in this account were mounts of knowledge and all of them warned us from the <strong>Khārijī renegades</strong>, just like we see today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unbeknown to these off-the-shelf renegades, hurling labels like <strong>Madkhalis, Murji’s</strong> and institutional one thing or another, while being dreary, pathetic and <strong>unwanted shrieks</strong> does not and In-shāʾ-Allāh will not harm us and neither is it new for us. We have heritage and a rich history that extends to the Salaf, a little further than the walls of their front rooms and videos. Will they have the audacity to label 5 of the Salaf, <strong>Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah</strong>, <strong>ʿĀṣim Aḥwāl</strong>, <strong>al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī</strong>, <strong>Hafṣah bint Sirīn</strong> and Muḥammad b. Sirīn? as <strong>Madkhalis,</strong> waste papers <strong>institutionalised bootlickers?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is embarrassing to see Bro Hajji relying on substandard research and debunked. I have the displeasure of seeing a short clip today, and this poor individual was struggling to read basic technical terms and names in English, yet he wants to cause confusion on issues which are well over his job description.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let, these words of the Salaf be an <strong>admonition for Bro Hajji</strong> and his sympathisers.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ʿAudhu Billāhi min ash-Shayṭān al-Rajīm</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bismillāh al-Raḥmān al-Raḥīm</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Alḥamdullilāhi Rabbil ʿAlamīn, Waṣalatu Wassalām ʿAla Rasūlillahil Karīm, Wa ʿAla Alihī Wa Aṣḥābī Wa Man Tabiāhum Bi-Eḥsan Ilaʾ Yaum al-Dīn; Wa Baʿd</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>until the end of times,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> To proceed,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are no introductions, InshaAllah straight to the answers. This is an answer to the video of the deranged Sururi Neo-Khariji Bro Hajji.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We learn neo-Khariji Bro Hajji accused me of using a weak and Jahmi narrator. In this response I have shown Bro Hajji is a disgraceful failure and an embarrassment to his brain, his followers and the human race. In this response I have shown Bro Hajji,</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Used a forgetful, confused and weak narrator, who was abandoned by the scholars of hadith for having JAHMI views. He was further a ‘subservient bootlicker’ a ‘Madkhali’ according to the terminology of Bro Hajji. There was disconnection in the chain, yes despite all this Bro Hajji uses this narration. Absolutely embarrassing.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">He accuses me of using a weak narrator but he uses a narrator who was weak and accused of being a fabricator of hadith.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Bro Hajji in the past used the statement of Imam Ibn Hazm and since Bro Hajji’s principle is that a Jahmi is a weak narrator, he contradicts his own principle, that in his reply to me he refutes a Jahmi weak narrator.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Bro Hajji declared Abu Hanifah a weak narrator and a Jahmi.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">He distorts the words of Imam Abd al-Barr in his al-Istizkar.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">He distorts and manipulates the words of Imam Ahmad and Imam Ali b. al-Madini.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The narration he attempted to refute and weaken was authenticated by some researchers.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Bro Hajji uses the report from <strong><em>Tarikh Baghdad </em></strong>that says Ismail was a Jahmi but yet Bro Hajji cannot authenticate Muhammad b. Ali al-Muqri.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Bro Hajji uses <strong>al-Jassas </strong>who was a <strong>Mu’tazili</strong> with <strong>Rafidi, </strong> how disgusting, using a <strong>Mu’tazili</strong> to defend his position who were known to rebel due one of their <em>‘Usul al-Khamsa’</em> with the one they rebel and cause harm to Muslims being commanding the good and forbidding the evil – <strong><em>Al-Amr bil-Maruf Wa Nahya Anil Munkar. </em></strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2:00 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Apply the principle of slave of KSA to the vast <strong>Deobandi clergy</strong> and their <strong>“Madkhali Super Salafi”</strong> views because they hold the same view as us. For instance, you need to watch the statements of the late <strong>Deobandi</strong> scholar, Mufti Zarwali Khan. This is the first wake up call.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2:34 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says he cannot respond to every dog that barks, yet he records a video lasting 1h10mins, <strong>that is an exceptionally long time barking</strong> because only a dog barks back in reply. I did not bark, I wrote, Bro Hajji barked for that long, and since Khariji’s are dogs and his constant reference to bootlickers, all explain his need to bark and eventually bad rabid dogs are put down.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2:55 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He claims I was hiding behind a troll account. Pathetic and dumb to even assume, just to convince his retarded ego. EVERYBODY knows I am not a troll account. They can check <strong>20 years of my footprint on the internet</strong>. This explains Bro Hajji (BH) is a new kid. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4:20 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He talks about our technicalities, but InshaAllah I will show you some of his catastrophic, pathetic and utterly humiliating technicalities, which even the most incompetent deviants do not commit. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>5:08 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reason he responds to me is not because of my ego but because I damaged his psyche and dented his <strong>impeded deviancy</strong>, just like his pea sized brain which ultimately damaged his manhood amongst his followers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>6:38 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says no one reads! Well that is a polytheistic principle right there, saying one thing while practising something different. One only needs to look at his twitter and they will see all the screenshots of the books <strong>HE READS</strong> to fool the people with his <strong>Judaic distortions</strong> but does not want you to read my reply!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>7:12 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Of course, I am a layman, but Bro Hajji needs to cast his mind back to his little irrelevant self. He has no qualifications, he has only studied some nominal Arabic, the stomach bursting chuckles we have from his calamitous errors by watching the plethora of embarrassing videos on social media, <strong>Shadid Alal Jahmiyyah</strong> being latest violation of the Muslim mind. Bro Hajji has not even studied a single book in any discipline, I mean the guy cannot even read basic English properly and in his deluded mind he thinks he refutes people! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He burst onto the scene a few years ago while getting piggybacks with his <strong>Deobandi cohorts</strong>. <strong>His disgusting desire to make money and seek fame through his vile videos is evident</strong>. When he emerged from his <strong>Rafidic hole</strong> and labelled <strong>Imam al-Barbahari’s </strong><em>Sharh al-Sunnah</em>, the Talmud, that is when the need to defend the honour of our Ulama motivated me. I called BH out for this reason and in defence of the great scholars of this Ummah and since that day, he ran and hid like a meek mouse in his hole, following the footsteps of his <strong>Rafidi influencers</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>8:33 – Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr and <em>al-Istizkar</em> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I mentioned pro Khuruj because BH used his statement as <strong>EVIDENCE</strong> and understanding. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>9:50 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Remember his words, he says Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr is an <strong>Alim </strong>of the Din, agreed. Thereafter, you can see the circus, the numerous edits, and retakes due to his ignorance. I at least tried to veil Abu Hanifah, but Bro Hajji exposes Abu Hanifah, his family and that all of them were weak. So, what does everyone do including the Deobandis? They like and share his material and defame their own Imam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>12:20 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I will show BH <strong>“too deep right”</strong> now. Bro Hajji makes yet again another error, <strong>TWICE</strong> in reading the name <strong>Amir and calls the narrator Ammar</strong>. Let me show you now, how incompetent, deceptive, and embarrassing Bro Hajji really is, which show us that he has no idea what he is talking about, watch this embarrassing moment of Bro Hajji’s life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Ma’mun</strong> was the <strong>Abbasid</strong> ruler, who attempted to destroy the Din of Islam. He pushed foreign deviant ideas and creeds in Islam, <strong>Greek Philosophy</strong>, he was a <strong>Mu’tazili </strong>and even had powerful <strong>Rafidi tendencies</strong>, so much so that he was considered to a <strong>Shi’i</strong>. He also initiated the <strong>Minha</strong>, the inquisition against the Sunni Salafi creed of the Quran being the uncreated <strong>speech of Allah</strong> and the administrative torture, oppression, and theological persecution against <strong>Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal.  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What was <strong>Bishr b. al-Walid </strong>doing with <strong>Ma’mun</strong>? He was a court judge for Ma’mun and we know Ma’mun would only do that for those who ascribed to the kufr creed of the Quran being created. Ma’mun died in 218H. So not only was Bishr a <strong>Jahmi bootlicker</strong> and <strong>subservient </strong>to the ruler in his oppression and tyranny against the Muslims, but he also supported all the <strong>KUFR</strong> beliefs of <strong>Ma’mun</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bishr was also a <strong>Hanafi Qadhi</strong> and thus gave judgements according to the <strong>Hanafi Madhhab</strong> and was thus naturally bias towards the epistemological founder of his Madhhab. (<em>Al-Jawhar al-Mu’dhiyyah</em>, 1:452, <em>al-Fawa’id al-Bahiyyah</em>, 54, from <em>Lisan</em>, 1: Juzz 2:316. See footnote 3 of <em>Suwalat al-Sulami lil-Daraqutni</em>, 132.). So, Bro Hajji the deviant shows his <strong>double standards</strong> and takes the clarifying narrative of a <strong>Jahmi subservient Bootlicker</strong> himself. Oh, the embarrassment! Wallahi <strong>shameless polytheistic Hindu Judaic double standards</strong>, but do not die just yet, I have more.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whether Ismail was a <strong>Jahmi</strong> or not, the same principles needs to be applied to <strong>Hammad and Abu Hanifah</strong> and this was one of the reasons I presented this statement. When BH announced boastfully that he was going to refute me next, I knew which statement he would address because it was the very narration I had presented as devastating bait for him. Low and behold the novice fell hook, line, and sinker. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bishr was also forgetful, confused, and senile. <strong>Saleh b. Muhammad Jazrah</strong> said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“He was truthful but did not make sense because he became forgetful”. <strong>Sulaymani</strong> said, “He was munkar al-hadith rejected I hadith”. <strong>Al-A’jurri</strong> said, “I asked <strong>Abu Dawud</strong> is Bishr b. al-Walid trustworthy, He replied, No”. <strong>Al-Sulami</strong> narrated from <strong>al-Daraqutni </strong>that he said he was, Trustworthy”. (<em>Mizan al-I’tidal</em>, 1:327, <em>Lisan al-Mizan, </em>1: Juzz 2:316, al-Sulami, <em>Suwalat al-Sulami lil-Daraqutni,</em> 132 no.76.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both <strong>Ibn al-Kayyal (d.939H</strong>) and <strong>Burhan al-Din al-Halabi (d.841H)</strong> said he was from the <strong>forgetful narrators</strong>. (<em>al-Kawakib al-Nirat Fi Ma’rifah Min Ikhtilat Min al-Ruwat al-Thiqat</em>, 109-110 no.10, <em>al-Ightibat Biman Rumiya al-Ikhtilat</em>, 72 no.16)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, Bishr’s clarifying remarks, that this was only the opinion of Ismail cannot be taken. Furthermore, there is <strong>Inqita’</strong> (a breakage and disconnection ins the chain) in <strong><em>al-Intiqa</em></strong> of Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr to Bishr b. al-Walid of over <strong>100 years</strong>. Yet BH takes this, is this not weak? What would the <strong>Hanafi Muqallid</strong> know? The same <strong>Saleh al-Jazrah</strong> that BH used to criticise Ismail is the same one criticising Bishr. BH is someone ignorant of these sciences that he would not have even worked that out and I bet he still cannot as he is that stupid.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reason for bringing this specific statement was to show, if you take Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr’s view and his opinion from his <em>al-Istizkar</em>, which you also distorted as we will see, then you have to take this about<strong> ABU HANIFAH THAT HE WAS A JAHMI</strong>. Did the great <strong>ALIM</strong> Ibn Abd al-Barr not know the reality of Ismail? And that only <strong>Pappu Bro Hajji</strong>, the jahil of Birmingham found out. So, the reason for bringing this specific statement was to show if you take the opinion of Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr from <em>al-Istizkar</em>, you have to accept this too. Not only this, Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr did not even consider <strong>Imam Ahmad a faqih</strong>, do you also take that view and opinion of his? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, this was Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr’s <strong>Ijtihad</strong> which he can either correct or incorrect. So, why are there these selective <strong>Rafidic Judaic principles</strong> from BH? I even said on twitter that BH would bring this point when he excitedly shared, he would be doing a video against me, because he fell right into it like a right little untrained pappu!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bishr</strong> was further <strong>abandoned</strong> by the scholars of hadith for failing to clarify his Aqidah on the Quran and took the position of the <strong>Waqifiyyah Jahmiyyah</strong> and abstained from saying the Quran is uncreated (<em>Mizan al-I’tidal,</em> 1:327 no.1229, <em>Lisan al-Mizan</em>, 1: Juzz 2:316 no.1513). The story which the scholars of hadith mention that Bishr was imprisoned and under house arrest by other Abbasid rulers is unfounded without evidence, hence it is rejected.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Bishr being <strong>forgetful and confused</strong>, not knowing what he narrated was established by the scholars of hadith. So not only was he a <strong>Jahmi</strong> <strong>bootlicker</strong> but also unreliable and it is upon Bro Hajji to clarify when Bishr transmitted this clarification. So BH took this clarification from a <strong>Jahmi subservient bootlicker</strong>, according to his standards. Dear readers, you see the how they have the worst <strong>double standards</strong> when it suits their <strong>filthy Manhaj</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>14:11 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bro Hajji says this is not Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr’s statement but a transmission. So, if he was <strong>weak</strong> and a <strong>Jahmi</strong> narrator why did he transmit from them? Or is BH implying Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr the great <strong>Alim</strong> did not know <strong>rijal and hadith sciences?</strong> I await his answer. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>14:28 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fanatic needs to ask himself who said it was supposed to be about Khuruj, it was merely to test your brain and expose your <strong>Rafidic</strong> <strong>Judaic</strong> <strong>double</strong> <strong>principles</strong>. If you take Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr transmitting the Salaf allowed rebellion because <strong>THEY </strong>used the <strong>ayah 2:124</strong>, then you must take everything Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr says without evidence in matters of his <strong>Ijtihad</strong>, this is your principle. In this report does BH take Abu Hanifah to be <strong>Jahmi who believed the Quran was created</strong> and that <strong>Imam Ahmad was not a faqih</strong>. Let that sink in his dense pea sized brain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>15:46 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I would never bring a Jahmi to back my statement.  Bro Hajji used Bishr literally a few minutes ago!!! What substances is the unbalanced Bro Hajji taking?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>17:17 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, yes, <strong>EVERYONE</strong> <strong>WATCH</strong> <strong>THIS</strong>. Steady on son. Firstly, it will take about a week perhaps even longer for the Sururi Ikhwani Deobandi Jahmi Bro Hajji to determine who <strong>Abu Ali Saleh b. Muhammad</strong> is, because frankly the lad is dense, thick, a charlatan and an outright deceptive liar and I have even given him a<strong> HINT</strong>.  This is also when Bro Hajji reads <strong>Bi-Thiqah </strong>and <strong>Bi-ThiqAT</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let me explain, Bro Hajji tried to expose me that I used a Jahmi (please remember this point) and that <strong>Ismail was weak</strong>, so therefore, I used a weak report to make a point. Then ensued the <strong>dramatic hissy fits</strong> and <strong>squeamish shrieks</strong> from Bro Hajji. Therefore, you would think it was important and necessary for Bro Hajji to bring a statement with an authentic chain to prove his point in refuting me, right? Bro Hajji would not bring a weak report to refute me because he accuses me of using a weak Jahmi, would he? No, seriously, there is no way he would do that right? because if he did, that would just be the most <strong>humiliating, embarrassing, </strong>and<strong> shameful</strong> thing the world has ever seen, right? No, come on bro, no you are kidding me? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You are right, the disgraced Jahil Bro Hajji used the Jahmi, <strong>bootlicker</strong>, who supported oppression, Bishr and now he used the report of a narrator <strong>Muhammad b. Ali al-Muqri</strong> to declare Ismail a Jahmi. Whether Ismail was a Jahmi, his father or grandfather, I do not really care in the slightest, but to use a report of a majhul narrator, <strong>Muhammad b. Ali al-Muqri</strong>, is just too humiliating. It is upon Bro Hajji the jahil to prove the authenticity of this report by establishing the trustworthiness of <strong>Muhammad b. Ali al-Muqri</strong>. <strong>I will give Bro Hajji £1000 If he proves the reliability of Muhammad b. Ali</strong>, who is in this chain and hence the authenticity of this report, and for good measure, I will never refute Bro Hajji ever again. This is a challenge to Bro Hajji! BH do not curl away into your <strong>Rafidic</strong> <strong>Judaic</strong> hole just yet, I have more!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another disastrous deception by BH was that he held the <em>Kitab al-Sunnah</em> of <strong>Imam Abd Allah b. Ahmad b. Hanbal</strong> in his hand – showing off with it by waving it in his hand. The report from Ismail is in also in this book, and while some researcher made it weak (<em>Kitab al-Sunnah</em>, 1:184 no.235, al-Qahtani who said its chain is weak) others did authenticate it!!!! (<em>Kitab al-Sunnah Wa Radd Alal Jahmiyyah</em>, 1:119 no.244, (al-Riyashi), (Dar Ibn al-Jawzi), 1:215 no.258 (Dar al-Nasihah) and, Kitab al-Sunnah, 143 no.221, (Al-Hamdan)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">BH waves the al-Qahtani edition and although he makes the chain weak, others have authenticated it. However, here is another crushing blow to the neonate. Qadhi Abu Yusuf was asked,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Does Abu Hanifah say what al-Jahm says, he replied, yes”. (<em>Kitab al-Sunnah</em> 1:183 no.232 (al-Qahtani), 1:213 no.255 (al-Riyashi). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Qahtani fails to make a comment on the authenticity, knowing that it is authentic and then proceeds to counteract this report through a report from Imam al-Bayhaqi in his <strong><em>Asma Wa’l Sifat,</em></strong> 251 which he said are through trustworthy narrators and <em>al-Lalaka’i</em> also transmits it no.470. Imam Abd Allah’s report is over a 100 years earlier with a much shorter chain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point is, if BH refutes Ismail because he was a Jahmi and a weak narrator, then this statement from Abu Yusuf on Abu Hanifah and the criticism of Ismail from the <em>al-Kamil </em>and <em>al-Dhu’afa Wa’l Matrukin</em> also applied to Abu Hanifah as they said all three were weak. So, <strong>DOES BRO HAJJI APPLY THE SAME RULE TO ABU HANIFAH THAT HE WAS A WEAK NARRATOR AND JAHMI AND THEREFORE WE CANNOT TAKE ANYTHING FROM THE IMAM, LET ALONE HIS MADHHAB? </strong>You see dear readers, BH refuted, repudiated the honour and status of his own Imam in tatters due to his ignorance. Where are the Hanafis at?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>18:06 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says the statement in <strong><em>al-Intiqa</em></strong> was not a statement from Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr. Yet Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr still transmitted it in his book. Did Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr not know rijal, mustalah al-hadith and the situation of famous people like Ismail? Of course, he did. Furthermore, Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr also TRAMSITTS his view that a group of Salaf rebelled due to <strong>Surah al-Baqarah: 124</strong>, where is the chain for this attribution? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hang on a minute BH, you little deceptive liar, you bark all day about our technicalities and here you are doing the dirtiest deception of them all. Where is the chain from Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr to the Salaf, name them with their statement and their ijtihad of using <strong>Baqarah:124</strong>? This is what you call a filthy <strong>Ikhwani</strong> <strong>Khariji</strong> <strong>technicality</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>18:20 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You are using a Jahmi, says the squeaky lad. Does the pea sized brain in BH’s skull work? Since he has demonstrated he is stupid-thick due to the aggressive Khariji Ikhwani Sururi Syndrome he suffers from and his <strong>Rafidic</strong> <strong>Judaic</strong> selectiveness has led him to forget his <strong>OWN PRINCIPLES</strong> and its application. Bro Hajji the jahil used Ibn Hazm’s <em>al-Fisl/al-Fasl</em>, do you remember that incident, when he was holding a book and reading it with a different name. He used Ibn Hazm’s <em>al-Fisl</em> to present his case on armed rebellion quoting Ibn Hazms views in his miserable attempt to refute Salafi Brothers. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imam Ibn Abd al-Hadi</strong> refers to Ibn Hazm as an ardent <strong>JAHMI</strong> after reading his <em>al-Fasl Fi al-Milal Wa’l Nahal</em> (<em>Tabaqat Ulama al-Hadith </em>3:350, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition (Damascus, Mu’assisah al-Risalah, 1435H/2014CE) ed. Akram al-Bushi and Ibrahim al-Zaybaq). This is the same book Bro Hajji heavily relied on to refute Salafis. Whether Ibn Hazm was an ardent Jahmi or not is not the discussion, the point was to show the two faced contradictory selective application of Bro Hajji’s fabricated principles. So, it was acceptable to take from Ibn Hazm but not from Ismail? So, either you to take from Jahmi’s, in which case the statement on Abu Hanifah and family being Jahmi is acceptable which you also need to accept. Who just got slapped so bad? Bro Hajji did and when I’ve finished with you, your life will not be the same, you jahil train wreck. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And who transmitted the Ismail’s statement, the same Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr, if he was weak and a Jahmi apply the principle to Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr first, yes what a joke, the biggest joke deception to beguile the listeners, but you got caught badly and how the world has seen you choke in your humiliation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>19:00 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the worst part, even I feel embarrassed of his jahl. Bro Hajji then actually confirms that <strong>Imam Khatib al-Baghdadi</strong> proceeded to quote the report of Ismail, knowing well that he was a <strong>JAHMI</strong> and <strong>WEAK</strong>. (see, <em>Tarikh Baghdad</em>, 5:183 no.3279. 1<sup>st</sup> edition (Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, 1424H2004CE) ed. Sidqi Jamil al-al-A’ttar). Can Bro Hajji claim <strong>Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr</strong> was unaware of the Jahmi tendencies and weakness of Ismail? Bro Hajji, the pea brain is so badly stuck. Yet again another slap on his face. <strong>Khatib al-Baghdadi</strong> brings this report 2 times in his book, <em>Tarikh Baghdad</em>, 5:183 and 11:267. (Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, 1432H/2011CE). The first citation the only problem is Ismail and in the second citation <strong>al-Hussayn</strong> is weak. However, researchers have authenticated this report.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>19:45</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Right about now the whole world is gob smacked at Bro Hajji’s horrendous humiliation and his ignorance in his wretched attempt to hide behind his Judaic technicalities. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>20:00 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note that Bro Hajji uses <em>al-Kamil</em> to refute me. Bro Hajji declared his own <strong>Imam</strong> <strong>weak</strong>. We cannot take from Ismail because he is weak narrator and a <strong>Jahmi</strong>, yet Bro Hajji and others can take the reports of Abu Hanifah, but Bro Hajji just declared Abu Hanifah weak as well. Bro Hajji then shows us <strong>Imam Abdullah b. Ahmad b. Hanbal’s </strong><em>Kitab al-Sunnah </em>in which he criticised Abu Hanifah’s creed and practically declared him to be a Murji and Jahmi. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So according to this jahils logic, he declared Abu Hanifah weak while he admits and accepts <strong>Imam Abdullah</strong> declared him to be <strong>Murji</strong> and <strong>Jahmi</strong> (according to Bro Hajjis logic) then he is the same as Ismail. So, this means Abu Hanifah is a weak Jahmi just like his grandson, yet Bro Hajji takes his whole religion and fiqh from him? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then to add insult to his own injury, the jahil says its <strong>Jarh Mubham! What!</strong> He accused others of smoking things or taking things but seriously what kind of substance abuse is this? If the <strong>Jarh</strong> on <strong>Abu Hanifah</strong> is <strong>mubham</strong> then it is also <strong>mubham</strong> on <strong>Ismail</strong>, so why did you take the <strong>Jarh</strong>? And again, the biggest slap any jahil could ever get. Oh, the pain, and no Bro Hajji, you cannot jump of a cliff just yet! I am not even halfway.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>21:29 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Remember that he uses <em>Kitab al-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin</em> to criticise Ismail. So, Abu Hanifah and his clan are weak, and Bro Hajji says <strong>NO</strong> <strong>PROBLEM</strong>. What happened to the Deobandis, their Imam is being attacked and they are too busy having tea and biscuits with the very jahil who declared him weak, Honestly no virility.    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>22:40 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Everyone has seen the real fraud from Bro Hajji as I have answered everything in detail.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>25:08  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He continues to squeak, you cannot use a <strong>Jahmi</strong>, but he used Jahmis himself according to his own standards, this is what you called exposing, exposing Bro Hajji from his own fraud. The schoolboy error Bro Hajji makes here, and we will educate him, that a narrator having a deviant Aqidah does not render him to be weak. His own <strong>ragdoll deviant posse</strong> (the ones he <strong>bromances</strong> with) argued the point, that Sunni scholars of hadith used narrators who had innovations with them (innovations of beliefs). Perhaps they should sit and educate each other and alleviate each other’s diabolical ignorance. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>25:29 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Watch this dear readers, this one will hurt Bro Hajji and his lemmings so bad that they will fall away like <strong>diseased</strong> <strong>flies</strong>. <strong>Page 319 of the <em>al-Intiqa</em>,</strong> and by the way this jahil does not even have the book!!! (<em>al-Intiqa Fi Fadhail al-Aimah al-Thalatha al-Fuqaha</em>, 318-319 2<sup>nd</sup> edition (Beirut: Dar al-Basha’ir al-Islamiyyah, 1431H/2010CE) ed. Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghuddah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After having the most feminine rant ever on Youtube, with his <strong>hair out and make up messed up</strong>, at this point of the video you would expect the deranged individual not to bring weak reports to defend his view, all the while attempting to refute me for approximately 25 minutes for allegedly using weak narrators, would you? No way did Bro Hajji do that, there is no way he would ever do that after squeaking for so long, you are gasping and wondering can anyone be so stupid, dumb and retarded to do this? You are thinking, not even <strong>shaytan</strong> would be so dumb and thick to do that. Well, I am sorry, Bro Hajji is that dumb, an utterly deceptive and treacherous jahil that in his rage of hissy fits, he fell into the very things he accused me off. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers the narrator <strong>Abu Muqatil Hafs b. Salam</strong> is an overwhelmingly weak <strong>abandoned</strong> <strong>narrator</strong> and a <strong>FABRICATOR</strong> <strong>OF</strong> <strong>HADITH</strong>. So, just as Bro Hajji attempted to weaken the report of Ismail, why did he use the report of an established weak and <strong>fabricator</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>hadith</strong>? Because he is an outright <strong>ignorant</strong> <strong>Ikhwani</strong> <strong>Sururi</strong> who likes to <strong>humiliate</strong> himself for people’s entertainment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>26:49 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He does not even know whose son asked who. It was <strong>Hafs b. Salam’s</strong> son asked who him. So, this report is also rejected due to the weakness of Hafs. What is even worse and disturbing about the <strong>Rafidic Judaic polytheistic principle of Bro Hajji</strong> is that he was ranting on me using a Jahmi against Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr but here, he himself is using a <strong>fabricator of hadith</strong> and we know the <strong>fabricator of hadith are the worst liars</strong>. They attribute things to the beloved Nabi Sallalahu Alayhi Sallam and whoever does so, will take their place in Hell. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bro Hajji and his ignorant followers can have a mothers meeting or drugs anonymous meeting and work that out for themselves. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>24:68 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bro Hajji says, <strong>“THIS IS WHAT THIS SCHOLAR SAID”.</strong> Bro Hajji the lying deceiver calls this lying fabricator of hadith who lied on our beloved Nabi Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam a <strong>SCHOLAR</strong>! Why don’t you die in your embarrassment already? Not just yet son, I have still have not finished!!!  <strong>Wallahil</strong> <strong>A’dhim</strong> BH has been violated Islamically.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Remember Bro Hajji used <strong><em>al-Kamil at timestamp 20:00</em></strong> and <strong><em>Kitab al-Dhu’afa Wa’l Matrukin at timestamp 21:29</em></strong> to bring criticism on Ismail. Well both books also show criticism on <strong>Hafs b. Salam. </strong>This is what you call <strong>Judaic deception</strong>.<strong> Imam Ibn Adiyy</strong> said under the entry of the <strong>liar and fabricator</strong>, Hafs b. Salam Abu Muqatil al-Samarqandi that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“He is not from the narrators whose narrations are relied upon”. (Ibn Adiyy, <em>al-Kamil Fi Dhu’afa al-Rijal</em>, 3:331 no.517. 1st Edn. (Damascus: al-Risalah al-Alamiyyah, 1433H/2012H). ed. Muhammad Anas Mustafa al-Khin. Another Edn. <em>al-Kamil Fi Dhu’afa al-Rijal</em> 4:87 no.516. 2nd Edn. (Riyadh, Maktabah al-Rushd, 1435H/2014H) ed. Mazin b. Muhammad al-Sarsawi. <em>Tahdhib al-Tahdhib</em> 1:449). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Taqi al-Din Ahmad b. Ali Maqrizi in</strong> his summary of Ibn Adiyy’s <em>al-Kamil</em> said, <strong>Al-Sa&#8217;di</strong>, said he would fabricate a chain for something good he heard. <strong>Ibn Adiyy</strong> said, he was not from those who’s narrations were relied on. (Al-Maqrizi, <em>Muktasar al-Kamil Fi al-Dhu’afa wa I’llal al-Hadith</em>, 227 no.515)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Burhan al-Din al-Halabi (d.841H)</strong> authored a work on all those accused and attributed with fabricating or forging ahadith. In this work, <strong>Burhan al-Din al-Halabi</strong> brings an entry for Hafs b. Salam and thereby enumerates him from those who was a forger and <strong>fabricator</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>hadith</strong> i.e. <strong>wadeh al-hadith.</strong> He says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Hafs b. Salam Abu Muqatil al-Samarqandi.</strong> <strong>Sulaymani </strong>said Hafs b. Salam al-Fazari, the author of <em>al-Alim Wa’l Mu’tallim</em>, he is classified from amongst those who fabricated hadith. (Burhan al-Din Halabi, <em>al-Kashf al-Hathith Amman Rumiya Bi-Wadheh al-Hadith</em>, 101 no.249).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imam Waki b. al-Jarrah</strong>, <strong>Imam Abd al-Rahman b. Mahdi</strong> both declared him to be a <strong>liar</strong>. <strong>Ibn Mahdi</strong> further said, I swear by Allah it is not halal to narrate from him. (<em>Kitab al-Majruhin Minal Muhaddithin</em>, 1:475; <em>Sharh I’llal al-Tirmidhi</em> 1:99, <em>Tahdhib al-Tahdhib</em> 1:449. Abu Nu’aym, <em>Kitab al-Dhu’afa</em>, no.52m, 73; Ibn Rajab, <em>Sharh I’llal al-Tirmidhi</em> 1:100; al-Hakim, <em>al-Madkhal Ilas Sahih</em>, 131, Ibn al-Jawzi, <em>Kitab al-Dhu’afa Wa’l Matrukin</em>, 1:221. Al-Dhahabi, <em>Mizan al-I’tidal Fi Nqad al-Rijal</em>, 1:557 no.2120 Ibn Hajr, <em>Lisan al-Mizan,</em> 1: Juzz 3:225 no.2644, <em>Tahdhib al-Tahdhib</em> 1:449). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imam Qutaybah b. Sa’id</strong> transmits that one day he said to Hafs b. Salam about a hadith,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Oh, <strong>Abu</strong> <strong>Muqatil</strong> that hadith is <strong>fabricated</strong>. He (Hafs) replied, ‘Baba, it is in my book and you’re saying its <strong>fabricated’</strong>? So, I said to him, ‘Yes, they <strong>fabricated</strong> it into your book’. (<em>al-Kamil Fi Dhu’afa al-Rijal</em>, 3:230; <em>Lisan al-Mizan</em>, 1: Juzz 3:225-226; <em>Tahdhib al-Tahdhib</em> 1:449, <em>Sharh I’llal al-Tirmidhi</em> 1:100).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imam Ibn al-Jawzi </strong>brings an entry for Hafs b. Salam Abu Muqatil al-Samarqandi in his book on <strong>weak</strong> and <strong>condemned</strong> narrators. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He narrated on Ayub, Ubaydullah b. Umar and Ibn Abi Ruwad. <strong>Qutaybah</strong> weakened him once and said, ‘he does not know what he narrated’. <strong>Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi</strong> said, ‘I swear by Allah it is not lawful to narrate from him’. <strong>Ibn Hibban </strong>said, ‘he narrated rejected reports which had no basis’. <strong>Ibn Adiyy</strong> said, ‘His narrations are not replied upon’. (Ibn al-Jawzi, <em>Kitab al-Dhu’afa Wa’l Matrukin</em>, 1:221, no.932)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imam al-Tirmidhi, Imam Abu Fadhal Ahmad Sulaymani, Imam Ibrahim b. Yaqub al-Sa’di Abu Ishaq al-Juzjani, Imam al-Daraqutni, Imam Ibn Hibban, Imam al-Hakim, Imam Abu Nu’aym Asbahani, Hafiz Ibn Rajab, Imam al-Dhahabi, Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani </strong>and others all weakened him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bro Hajji showed what he needed to and hid what he needed to conceal, just like the Jews. This renders BH to be an ignorant retard and schoolboy in <strong>rijal</strong> <strong>sciences</strong>. Now look, he has shown the world how stupid and incompetent he really is. If only BH had kept his brain in his skull, it would have stopped him from pouring it out and frothing his rabid mouth!! Now all his deviant’s supporters and lemmings will need therapy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>28:02 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bro Hajji asks me a question as to why I never quoted the passage above. Well, do you really want me to answer that again, scroll up and have a look, then run along in the corner and have a little cry son and I promise I will not look! I never quoted it because the narrator was a fabricator. So, you <strong>‘Super Sururi Jahmi Khariji Deobandi freak’ </strong>now you know why I presented this report? Who is the most ignorant person on earth right now, Bro Hajji. The earth will not even give BH sanctuary, due to his intellectual crimes against Muslims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>29:27 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The <strong>deviants</strong> always act sly and <strong>deceive</strong> the people. I was in a Twitter group with these juhal. I was added without permission by a brother. I observed for a while and realised they are all burnt <strong>Sururis</strong> and <strong>Qutubis</strong>. In the group they shared Bro Hajji’s screenshots from his videos against another Salafi brother and one them was <em>al-Istizkar</em>. I realised most of the guys were yes sir boys and copied and pasted his shoddy research. So while conversing with this guy I wanted to draw them and their evidences out and I found out they have nothing other than Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr attributing a view to the Salaf and this ayah they used for their <strong>Ijtihad</strong>, but all of this is without any chains.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My points stand, show us where the Salaf used this ayah for evidence, it is merely a case of Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr attributing this to the Salaf without an authentic chain and without any of the names of the Salaf mentioned. If Bro Hajji and the ragdoll gang say <strong>al-Hussayn</strong> and <strong>Abd Allah b. Zubayr</strong> did rebel, then it is upon them to provide the evidence. This same <strong>ragdoll lemming Abu Abdullah (erudite hand) </strong>deceives the people that he is with <strong>Shaykh Zubayr Ali Za’i</strong>, when we clearly know the Shaykh refuted these <strong>barking</strong> <strong>Kharijis</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>32:42 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bro Hajji accuses me of not having read or consulted <em>al-Istizkar</em>. He thinks the Salafis do not know their books. Watch this for catching this disgraced fraud. In the video BH shows and holds the DKI edition of <em>al-Istizkar</em> yet shows scans of the Dar Qutaybah and Dar al-Wa’i which was edited by Dr. Abd al-Mu’ti Amin Qil’aji and the 1st edition was printed in 1414H/1993CE. I have the al-Faruq al-Hadithiyyah edition. 1st edition, Cairo 1437H/2017H. It was edited by Abi Muhammad Usamah b. Ibrahim b. Muhammad who used more than 10 handwritten manuscripts to verify the text of <em>al-Istizkar</em>. A new edition of <em>al-Istizkar </em>is due to be released from Dar Eloollaa, Egypt in 11 volumes with the hadith verification of Anwar Baz and Sulayman al-Qatuni.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>33:12 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is Bro Hajji’s salvation statement for defending his warped understanding of <strong>Khuruj</strong>. Disputing or differing does not entail <strong>Khuruj</strong>, except in the mind of a <strong>pea sized Khariji brain</strong>. Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr says the group of people who did not uphold the first view and thought it was permissible to dispute with those in authority over them used <strong>al-Baqarah: 124</strong> as evidence </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>TO DISPUTE</strong>, <strong>DISAGREE</strong> not <strong>KHURUJ</strong>. Bro Hajji lies and adds the word Khuruj to explain those who believed it was acceptable to dispute. <strong>Tanaz’a</strong> does not mean Khuruj. A group of the Salaf holding this view is<strong> Mubham</strong> without any names. As for Ibn Abd al-Barr saying <strong><em>“Kharaja Ibn al-Zubayr and al-Hussayn (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) Ala Yazid…”</em></strong> here means they disputed Yazid’s authority, this was the not <strong>Khuruj</strong> of rebellion, why did not BH bring the context here?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even the beginner of Islamic history knows, <strong>Mu’awiyyah</strong> <strong>RadhiAllahu</strong> <strong>Anhu</strong> went to potential claimants of the Caliphate and asked them to give their oath of allegiance to Yazid when he would assume power. <strong>Al-Hussayn and Ibn Zubayr Radhiallahu Anhuma</strong> did not even give their allegiance to Yazid because they felt they were worthy of the Khaliphate because they were <strong>“Ahluhu,”</strong> i.e. they were worthy candidates of the Khaliphate due to their standing in the Muslim Ummah. So, when they never even gave the Ba’yah, how did they make Khuruj? The Muslims were not united on the appointment of Yazid, despite a great number of authorities having given him their pledges. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The wording of the hadith which Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr explains is restricted and specific to the pledge of allegiance i.e. <strong>“Baya’na”</strong> and since we know <strong>al-Hussayn Radhiallahu Anhu </strong>did not offer Yazid his allegiance, it is not the Khuruj of rebellion. Therefore, when he saw the deception of the accursed <strong>Rawafid</strong>, he wanted to return to <strong>Yazid</strong> to offer his pledge of allegiance. I will further expand on this in a separate response, InshaAllah. Once again, this is Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr asserting the Salaf used this ayah, but where is the statement of the actual Salaf using this ayah? Nowhere.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No.19331. Yet another Judaic sleight of hand. I have explained the intended meaning of <strong>Kharaja</strong>, and we also know how the companions had advised and reminded <strong>al-Hussayn</strong> <strong>Radhiallahu Anhu</strong> of the treacherous nature of the <strong>Rafidi</strong> <strong>Kufi’s.</strong> Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr clearly saying about the <strong>Mu’tazilites</strong> and the <strong>Khawarij</strong> said similar things, which indicated they are the ones who held this belief system. We do not say the <strong>Khawarij </strong>and the <strong>Mu’tazilites</strong> were like the Sahabah, only a person who has been knee bouncing with the <strong>Rawafid</strong> in <strong>Hyde Park</strong> would say this. We say Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr made a distinction and we don’t say the Companions rebelled. BH has been lying through his teeth to his gullible yes sir fanbase. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No.19932. More deception from BH. Who is he trying to fool? Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr makes a distinction and clarifies the view of <strong>al-Hussayn </strong>and <strong>Ibn Zubayr Radhiallahu Anhuma.</strong> According to his disastrous logic BH takes <strong>al-Hussayn </strong>and<strong> Ibn Zubayr Radhiallahu Anhuma </strong>and a whole group people out of Ahl al-Sunnah. <strong>So, is he making tabdi’ of the Companions?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>41:10 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Al-Qurtubi was from the 6th century and he quotes and uses Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr’s statement pretty much verbatim, so it is indifferent. This is common amongst authors of the same science, more so, due to both hailing from the <strong>Maghrib.</strong> The same response applies to Imam al-Qurtubi, and that is where are the names with them directly using this ayah for evidence. About 20 minutes ago BH was having <strong>verbal diarrhoea </strong>because I presented a weak chain, while BH himself, the <strong>two-faced Judaic manipulator</strong> cannot even present a chain, let alone a weak one!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>41:51 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">BH brings the statement of <strong>al-Jassas.</strong> And again, another selective deception. BH criticised me for using an alleged<strong> Jahmi</strong> narrator, but he himself now uses someone of the same level as the Jahmis. The jahil would not do that would he? Use someone who adheres to a deviant creed, who were considered innovators against me, again. We already saw him using Bishr and now he will get another blow to this dense brain. <strong>Al-Jassas</strong> was a <strong>Hanafi Mu’tazili.</strong> (<em>Tabaqat al-Mu’tazilah</em>, 118, <em>Fadhal al-I’tizal Wa Tabaqat al-Mu’tazilah</em>, 391). <strong>Imam al-Dhahabi</strong> was also of this view when he said he was inclined to the <strong>Mu’tazilites</strong>, despite his writings not showing this, more so concerning the beatific vision of Allah and other issues and we seek safety in Allah. (<em>Siyar A’lam al-Nubala</em>, 16:341).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Jassas</strong>, the <strong>Mu’tazili</strong> also denied magic and its offshoots claiming it is mere deception without any reality. <strong>Al-Jassas</strong> is on record for making the <strong>funniest</strong> <strong>theological</strong> <strong>joke</strong>. He says if magic was real why don’t the magicians remove the kings and rulers from power, steal their wealth and rule the world!!! Now you know where BH gets it from, and how the early <strong>Mu’tazilites</strong> influenced BH and his ilk’s with <strong>Khariji</strong> <strong>tendencies</strong>. (<em>Ahkam al-Quran</em>, 1:41-58). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is who BH quotes, a devious <strong>Mu’tazili</strong> who deviated from Sunni theology and known to be from the innovated sects. <strong>Al-Jassas</strong> also had some seriously warped and perverted ideas, one only needs to look at his <em>al-Fusul Fi al-Usul</em> to get an idea. This is the guy BH uses to refute the orthodox Sunni position of not rebelling against a Muslim ruler. I think we are pretty much done with BH and its back to potty training time for him!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>43:19 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet you used <strong>Bishr</strong>, <strong>Ibn</strong> <strong>Hazm</strong>, and <strong>al-Jassas</strong>? All according to the very principle BH fabricated and used. BH does not deny he is a hyper Youtuber.  Bro Hajji had no answer for this tweet because it ripped his evil Manhaj. <strong>Jahm</strong> <strong>b. Safwan</strong> was one of the pioneers of <strong>Khuruj</strong> against the Muslims rulers in later times and aided the <strong>Pro Hanafi Murjis.</strong> It all seems like a deviant tea party.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>44:50 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">BH says I will regret calling his name. The best joke of his video. If you have a look on social media, you will see how much I refute your <strong>Khariji</strong> ideas and principles. In fact, it was a concerted effort and a calculated plan to draw you out into these exchanges. Unfortunately, this regret you are talking about is something you suffered coupled with depression and anxiety. BH blocked me on twitter, he would sneak like a scared mouse and view my tweets and in the end begged people to stop sending him my tweets. So, you will find that BH is the one having sleepless nights and has since resorted to a lifetime of teddy bear hugging at night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>45:25 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">BH if you are a real man, I dare you to go through my tweets!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>45:29 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You know who I am. Such little minions. I was not hiding and the people who know me, know me. And don’t you remember I called you two times and you never picked up both times, what were you doing, having your nails done? BH does not remember his message to me on twitter saying to me to keep in touch and then he blocked me, the humiliated coward!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>46:43 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">BH the deceptive deceiver distorts things in an attempt to show he has a response and what a shamble it is. The red line on the text had no bearing to the response. Note, how he cannot even pronounce <strong>Imam al-Lalaka’i’s</strong> name properly! Hang on a minute, this is what you call a vile deceptive technicality. I quoted <strong>Imam Ali b. al-Madini</strong>, BH quotes the creed of Imam Ahmad. BH should know substance abuse is illegal? Look, at this evil deceit. He proceeds to make a horrendous error in translation which is his evil lie and distortion, <strong>he translates al-Birr &#8211; piety or righteousness as arrogant!!!</strong> What a jahil man. In the translation of the pivotal part BH lies and distorts the meaning again. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The disgusting and vile deception here is that BH pretended to show the listeners that I deliberately covered a portion of the text with a red line. BH then shows a totally different Aqidah, he shows the Aqidah of <strong>Imam</strong> <strong>Ahmad</strong> instead of the Aqidah of <strong>Imam Ali b. al-Madini</strong>. He then shows a totally different line of text. Even the Jews and polytheists do not distort things this much. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He translates the highlighted part as <strong><em>“Whoever forcefully takes over…” </em></strong>another <strong>Khariji</strong> distortive technicality and lie, giving the impression of Khuruj when this is a total lie. <strong><em>Wa-man Ghalabahum </em></strong>is whoever overpowers the people with the sword and rules over them. Then the ignorant individual goes on to say whoever takes over by force rebels!!!! He will argue the version in <em>Tabaqat al-Hanabillah</em> says <strong><em>“Wa Man Kharaj”</em></strong> then we say this shows when <strong>Kharaja </strong>is used in this context, it means in the context of <strong>Ghalaba</strong> as both words have bene used interchangeably.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ahmad is talking about when two Muslims parties fight, this is totally different to rebelling! With one of them overpowering the other or the masses, then they are to be given the pledge of allegiance as they are Khaliph. This is the reality of this statement which BH tried to distort to save face for his <strong>debunked</strong> <strong>Manhaj</strong>, while using his <strong>Rafidic </strong>and<strong> Judaic</strong> manipulation. This <strong>ignorant</strong> <strong>Deobandi</strong> does not even know basics. This is one possible explanation of this point as the scholars have mentioned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This <strong>Aqidah</strong> point is drawn from the ayah, <strong>“And if two parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both, but if one of them rebels against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which rebels till it complies with the Command of Allah; then if it complies, then make reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily! Allah loves those who are equitable.”</strong> (Surah al-Hujurat: 9). This is further evidenced from the Hadith in <em>Sahih Muslim</em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">وَمَنْ بَايَعَ إِمَامًا فَأَعْطَاهُ صَفْقَةَ يَدِهِ وَثَمَرَةَ قَلْبِهِ فَلْيُطِعْهُ إِنِ اسْتَطَاعَ فَإِنْ جَاءَ آخَرُ يُنَازِعُهُ فَاضْرِبُوا عُنُقَ الآخَرِ</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He who swears allegiance to a Khaliph should give him the pledge of his hand and the sincerity of his heart He should obey him to the best of his ability. It another man comes forward (Claiming the Khaliphate), disputing his authority, should behead the latter (<em>Sahih Muslim</em>, no.1844)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">BH then proceeds to make himself look utterly stupid with his pathetic logic due to his inability to understand these issues, all due to his <strong>Deobandi Ash’ari</strong> background. And since BH thinks he knows rijal and wretchedly attacks others for bringing weak narrations, did he not look at the chain of this creed. You gloatingly rejected <strong><em>Sharh al-Sunnah</em></strong> of <strong>Imam al-Barbahari</strong> due to the chain while he accepted and used the chain here! I ask you, is the chain of this creed authentic for you to fully take it? As this is BH’s criteria. I know I won’t get an answer to this because its just past the level of this front room sofa bouncer! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>50:25 </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">BH finally comes to the <strong>Imam Ali b. al-Madini </strong>statement. No context is needed since it applies to the innovators of the deviant sects like the <strong>Khawarij</strong>. BH through his innate ability to display his compulsive lying disorder proceeds to steer the listeners away from the true context of this statement. He sheepishly says this statement is linked to the proceeding statement which refers to the permissibility of killing the <strong>Khawarij</strong>. The true context of this statement is understood and is linked to the preceding lines. Which states <strong>Imam Ali b. al-Madini</strong> said,  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whoever rebels against a leader from among the Muslim leaders, who the people are united upon and affirm his <strong>Khilafah</strong>, however it was attained, whether through agreement or by forcing (the people), then the rebel has disobeyed and left <strong>[(Kharij)]</strong> from the <strong>Jama’ah</strong>]. He opposed the reports from Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and if he dies in this state of <strong>Kharij</strong> (abandoning the Jama’ah) then he dies a <strong>death</strong> of <strong>jahiliyyah</strong>… (<em>Sharh Usul al-I’tiqad Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah</em>, 1:131, Cairo: Dar al-Hadith, 1425 2005, ed. Sayyid Imran, same edition as the one BH holds in his hand in the video). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">BH then using <strong>Judaic</strong> <strong>Rafidic</strong> wizardry casually slips in words, just as deceptive <strong>Ash’ari Deobandis</strong> do<strong>, “And we are not denying there were certain Salaf or Imams of the Salaf that opposed khuruj against a fasiq unjust ruler.”</strong> He knew he got refuted and he was unable to present an adequate reply. In fact, he looked utterly silly jumping to Imam Ahmad and then back to Imam Ali.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This jahil lost the plot. Imam Ahmad was the who said saying this, so if he wants to accuse us of having dumb logic then Imam Ahmad should be the first one he should label. The jahil equates taking over by force to Khuruj. It means in the context that is opposite to agreement, arrangement or happy with, i.e. they were not happy with the potential Khaliph, and he took over by force and strength, as some rulers did, this does not mean Khuruj. This is the first lie and deception. He also lied deceived the people by not bringing what Imam Ahmad wrote completely in his creed. The deceptive deceiver accuses others of allegedly covering lines and all sorts. Yet he holds a different edition and shows the scan of a different edition!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the edition which Bro Hajji holds in his hand (<em>Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l Jama’ah</em> 1:126, ed. Sayyid Imran). He also tries desperately to someone how answer this point while failing badly like a damage doll. This is some the trickery he employed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Firstly,</strong> he used <strong>Imam Ahmad’s creed</strong> to answer <strong>Imam Ali b. Ali Madini’s </strong>point. What kind of Jewish logic is this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secondly,</strong> he goes a few paragraphs back and talks about the issue of a ruler forcing the people, which has nothing to do with khuruj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thirdly,</strong> Imam Ahmad literally nine (9) lines later, on the same page the edition BH has in his hand. says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whoever rebels against a Muslim leader after the people are united on him [being the leader] while affirming his Khilafah in whatever way it might have been, whether through agreement or by force, then the rebel has disobeyed the Muslims and opposed the reports from Allah’s messenger and if and died in the kharij state, then he dies the death of jahiliyyah. (<em>Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah</em> 1:126)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This does not mean Khuruj as Imam Ahmad clarifies that the rebel or Khariji is the who rebels after the people are<strong> UNITED </strong>and affirm his Khilafah and thus he explains a few lines later, giving context to his first statement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fourthly,</strong> no one from the scholars of the<strong> Hanabillah</strong>, early or late or any other scholar, scholars who support Khuruj and even the modern <strong>day Kharijis, Sururis Qutubi Harakiyin</strong> have ever used this statement of Imam Ahmad to evidence the permissibility for Khuruj or even understood this statement to mean potential <strong>Khuruj</strong>. However, an unqualified deluded pathetic untrained kid, who has not studied anything, Aqidah, Manhaj and even fiqh is making these deranged conclusions while looking at PDFs in his front room and then trying to make money from his Youtube videos!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fifthly,</strong> Imam Ahmad equates <strong>Khuruj</strong> with the <strong>Khawarij </strong>because he clearly says whoever goes against the Ruler is <strong>Khuruj </strong>and he separates from the body of the Muslims and they are to be killed. This is further supported by authentic evidences. Citing the finer details about these issues would lengthen the discussions. One just needs to read Imam Ahmads other works on creed and what his students transmit from or what others attributed to him and cited in the <strong><em>Sharh Usul I’tiqad</em></strong> and in the <strong><em>Tabaqat al-Hanabillah</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sixthly,</strong> None, of the scholars who ever explained this text, more so recently, from the dozens of explanations of this creed ever said this. Honestly the biggest Jahil I have seen in the last two decades has to be BH without contention.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The main reason for providing this particular statement of <strong>Imam Ali b. al-Madini</strong> was to corner Bro Hajji. The ignorant individual is unaware that this very creed of <strong>Imam Ali b. al-Madini</strong> is pretty much cited verbatim through the <em>Sharh al-Sunnah</em> of <strong>Imam al-Barbahari</strong>, and he accepts this creed by rejects the <em>Sharh al-Sunnah</em>. Another slap for the jahil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then BH unable to present anything else against me, goes off on a perverted tangent, diluting the matter to cover his ignorant comprehension of the issues and to save some face from the utter and absolute humiliating embarrassment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Wa Sallallahu Ala Sayyidina Muhammad Wa Ala Alihi Wa Ashabihi Wa-Sallam Tasliman Kathira.</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʿĀṣim Aḥwāl said, Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah said to us:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Learn Islam and when you’ve learnt it, <span style="color: #961212;">do not turn away from it</span>. And follow the Straight path, for that is Islam. <span style="color: #961212;">Do not deviate to the right or to the left of the Straight Path</span>. Upon you is the Sunnah of the Prophet </em><em>ﷺ</em><em>, just as</em><em> the people [Ṣaḥābah] were upon, <span style="color: #961212;">before the killing of their Ṣaḥābah [i.e. ʿUthmān]</span> and what they did after that [i]. For indeed we had <span style="color: #961212;">read the Qurʾān 15 years before the Ṣaḥābah were killed</span> and before what these people did after that. So, I warn you from these desires that sow the seeds of <span style="color: #961212;">enmity and hatred amongst you</span>.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em><span style="color: #961212;">ʿĀṣim Aḥwāl</span> said: I informed <span style="color: #961212;">al-Ḥasan [al-Baṣrī]</span> what <span style="color: #961212;">Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah</span> had said. He replied, “He spoke the truth and advised you with it”. Then I narrated this to <span style="color: #961212;">Hafṣah bint Sirīn</span> and she said, “You are family, have you narrated this to <span style="color: #961212;">Muḥammad</span>?” [ii] I said, “No”. She said, “Narrate this to him.” </em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Imām Muḥammad b. Naṣr al-Marūdhī, <strong><em>al-Sunnah</em>, </strong>68-69 no.18. Khalid b. ʿUthmān said, it is <strong>Ṣaḥīḥ Maqtuʿa</strong>, [meaning that it is authentic but the type of report is Maqtuʿa i.e. from a Tabʿī]. He references it to al-Maʿmar, <strong><em>al-Jāmʿi</em></strong> 11:367; LālikāʿI, <strong><em>Iʿtiqād Ahl al-Sunnah</em></strong> no.17; Abū Nuʿaym, <strong><em>al-Ḥilyah</em></strong> 2:218; al-ʿAjurrī, <strong><em>al-Sharīʿah</em> </strong>no.19, 21 and Ibn Baṭṭah <strong><em>al-Ibānah</em></strong> 1:96. He shows all the narrators are trustworthy. (Cairo: Dār al-Athār, 2003)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the <strong><em>Iʿtiqād Ahl al-Sunnah</em></strong> of al-Lālikāʿī the report is, <strong>“<em>Learn Islam and when you’ve learnt it, do not turn away from it. And follow the Straight path, for that is Islam. Do not deviate to the right or to the left of [the straight path of] Islam. Upon you is the Sunnah of the Prophet </em><em>ﷺ</em><em>, which the </em><em>Ṣaḥābah were upon, So, I warn you from these desires that sow the seeds of enmity and hatred amongst you.”</em></strong> [Lālikāʿi, <strong><em>Sharḥ Uṣūl Iʿtiqād Ahl al-Sunnah Waʾl Jamāʿah</em></strong> no.17, 40. The researcher, Dr. ʿImād Qadrī graded it <strong>Ṣaḥīḥ</strong> and traces it to ʿAbd al-Razzāq, <strong><em>Muṣannaf</em> </strong>no.20758; Abū Nuʿaym, <strong><em>al-Ḥilyah</em></strong> 2:218; Ibn ʿAdiyy, <strong><em>al-Kāmil</em> </strong>3:163. (Cairo: Dār al-Gad al-Jadīd, 1438/2017).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the <strong><em>Kitāb Sharīʿah</em></strong> of al-ʿĀjurrī he brings it in the second chapter, mentioning the command of the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em> to the Ummah to hold onto the Jamaʿāh and warning them from dividing into sects. (<strong><em>Kitāb Sharīʿah</em></strong>, 1:284). The researcher, Dr. ʿAbd al-Wahhāb b. ʿUmar b. Sulaymān al-Damijī graded it its chain <strong>Ṣaḥīḥ</strong>. He traces it to ʿAbd al-Razzāq, <strong><em>Muṣannaf</em> </strong>no.20758 in summarised form; al-Marūdhī, <strong><em>al-Sunnah</em></strong>, 8, Ibn Waḍāh, <strong><em>al-Bidʿah Waʾl Nahya ʿAnhā</em>,</strong> 32-33; LālikāʿI, <strong><em>Sharḥ Uṣūl</em></strong> 1:56 no.17; Ibn Baṭṭah, <strong><em>al-Ibānah al-Kubrā</em></strong> no.115, 138. (al-ʿĀjurrī, <strong><em>Kitāb Sharīʿah</em></strong>. 1:300 no.19. (Riyadh: Madār al-Waṭan Lil-Nashr, 1437/2016) 4<sup>th</sup> Edition).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Baṭṭah transmits it his <strong><em>al-Ibānah al-Kubrā</em>,</strong> 1:113 no.146. The researcher Al-Ḥamdān fails to mention any tracing or a grade for it. (Ibn Baṭṭah, <strong><em>al-Ibānah al-Kubrā</em>.</strong> (Beirut: Dār al-Lūʾlūʾ, 1439/2018) 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition). Ibn Baṭṭah also brings this report in the same chapter title as the of al-ʿAjurrī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">[i] &#8211; This is what the Khawārij did after that period, in terms of reckless killing, rebelling against the legitimate Muslim rulers, killing innocent people and making takfīr of the Muslims.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">[ii] – He is the great Imām, Muḥammad b. Sirīn from the Salaf, well known for his stance against the people of innovation and desires.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This anecdote and advice of the Salaf advising to stick to the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger <em>ﷺ</em> and not to deviate from the straight path. <strong>Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah</strong> talks about the <strong>Khawārij</strong> and their <strong>killing of ʿUthmān</strong> RaḍīAllāhu ʿAnhu, their enmity for him and making takfīr and opposing all those who loved and revered him. <strong>He rebukes their actions and their methodology by describing it as desires</strong>. The harms of these desires were splitting the unity of the Muslims and breaking away from the <strong>Jamāʿah</strong> of the <strong>Muslim body</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We also learn how the Salaf were uniform and in agreement in such matters of Creed and Manhaj. <strong>All the aforementioned eminent Salafi Ahl al-Hadith scholars quote this account in the beginning of their respective Creed manuals, thereby giving weight to its content</strong>. Furthermore, the same Ahl al-Ḥadīth Salafī scholars place the account under the <strong>chapter of being united with the Muslim body and staying away from dividing into sects and groups.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah adds, such ideas and ideologies that opposes the path of the companions, not only are they deviation, but they will also sow seeds of hatred in the Muslim Ummah</strong>. This is what we see, the oblivious individual, in addition to being weak in his knowledge and comprehension, is vehemently ardent in misguiding and confusing the Sunni Muslims. Individuals like <strong>Bro Hajji</strong>, are a 3D epitome and prime example of what the Salaf warned us from, they are nothing except concubines of the <strong>Khawārij</strong>, standing or sitting. <strong>They opened the doors for the worshippers of grave, the Rawafidh and sowed seeds of doubting the understanding of the illustrious Ṣaḥābah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The statement was profound &#8211; it led ʿ<strong>Āṣim Aḥwāl</strong> to inform <strong>Ḥasan al-Baṣrī</strong> who endorsed the advice. <strong>Āṣim Aḥwāl</strong> then informs the daughter of <strong>Muḥammad b. Sirīn</strong>, who advices him to inform her father. This aspect of the account highlights how the eminent Salaf valued advice from their predecessors and hence its great importance. The Salaf named in this account were mounts of knowledge and all of them warned us from the <strong>Khārijī renegades</strong>, just like we see today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Unbeknown to these <em><strong>off-the-shelf</strong></em> renegades, hurling labels like <strong>Madkhalis</strong>, <strong>Murji’s</strong> and<strong> institutiona</strong>l one thing or another, while being dreary, pathetic and unwanted shrieks does not and In-shāʾ-Allāh will not harm us and neither is it new for us. We have heritage and a rich history that extends to the Salaf, a little further than the walls of their front rooms and videos. Will they have the audacity to label 5 of the Salaf, <strong>Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah, ʿ<em>Āṣim Aḥwāl, al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī, Hafṣah bint Sirīn </em></strong><em>and</em><strong><em> Muḥammad b. Sirīn? </em></strong><em>as</em><strong><em> Madkhalis, waste papers institutionalised bootlickers?</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is embarrassing to see <strong>Bro Hajji</strong> relying on substandard research and mediocre arguments. I have the displeasure of seeing a short clip today, and this poor individual was struggling to read basic technical terms and names in English, yet he wants to cause confusion on issues which are well over his job description.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let, these words of the Salaf be an admonition for <strong>Bro Hajji</strong> and his sympathisers.</span></p>
