<h3><strong>Ahlul Hadith is a old and Specific Madhab</strong></h3>
<h3>So our opposers due to their lack of knowledge think the Ghair Muqallideen sect (this is how they name and address us due to their lack of knowledge and instead of referring to us as Ahlul Hadith) is a new movement and hence there was no specific madhab prior to this. So we say our way is an old methodology and yet they counter claim and say there are only four main madhabs and their is no other specific madhab upon the way of the muhadithin or the Ahlul Hadith.</h3>
<h3>The fact of the matter is that if these people had looked in the very same books that are well known and agreed upon, then they would have found the madhab of Ahlul Hadith and also found it to be a specific and separate madhab from the four madhabs. It is known that these books don’t encompass the other madhabs or statements from them, you will rather find statements and opinions that are required on a regular basis.</h3>
<h3>Therefore you will find the names of Imam Ahmad and Imam Malik less in these books. In these writings the authors will write the Fiqh opinion of the madhab of the Ahlul Hadith different to the other madhabs thereby deducing the madhab of Ahlul Hadith to be a separate entity. This therefore clearly elucidates this madhab is old and existed in previous times and various authors in different era referred to this madhab, this was something they credited and highlighted a madhab to be referenced at various instances.</h3>
<h3>So this is the madhab of the people that are ignorantly labelled as Ghair muqallidin or La Madhab in the same way the people in our times criticise them and create all kinds of false aspersions about them. The truth is that it is a madhab, the madhab of Ahlul Hadith and in essence the correct methodology of Islam.</h3>
<h3>(For example the saying in the issue of consensus, Talwih mentions, “The general Ahlul Hadith are on this opinion.” (pg.354, Naulkishaur)</h3>
<h3>and on the issue of the permissibility of Qunut an-Nazilah, “And a group of Ahlul Hadith are upon this.” (Fath ul-Qadir Sharh Hidayah (pg.188), Naulkishaur)</h3>
<h3>and on the issue of nullification of the fast with Hijamah it says, “as the Hanabillah and the Ahlul Hadith say” (Fath ul-Qadir Sharh Hidayah (pg.411) and much more.</h3>
<h3>(Refer to Sa’iq al-Ibad Ila Matalib al-Irshad Sharh al-Irshad Ila Sabil ar-Rashad Fi Amr Taqlid Wal-Ijtihad (pg.308)</h3>
<h3>Why is the Madhab of Ahlul Hadith Rejected.</h3>
<h3>Since these people are in reality ignorant and unaware of the facts because they continue and chose to be on the religions of their forefathers in a customary manner. They continue in this way as if they are blind folded and strangers to this madhab. So they fail to understand and on the contrary formulate all kinds of false allegations and problems whilst they themselves adamantly present their madhabs in a pristine way without any errors.</h3>
