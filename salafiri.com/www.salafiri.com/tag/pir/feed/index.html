				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Fawakah al-Adhab Fi Radd A’la Man Lam Yahkam al-Sunnah wa’l Kitab</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ahmad bin Nasir bin Uthman al-Mu’amari al-Najdi [1225H]</span></strong></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(From the students and disciples of Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab [1206H])</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mushrikin would worship the righteous people and ask them for their needs, believing they were intermediateries and intercessors. Allah the Mighty also warned and reprimanded them from this type of calling and informed them those they call upon cannot help them alleviate their sorrow nor change anything. Therefore every individual who calls upon the Prophets, the righteous, the dead, the angels or the Jinn does so in order to seek help and they ask such entities that are unable to help. They are unable to remove or change their difficulties and calamities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The norm of the mushriks today is that when a calamity or hardship befalls them, they call upon their Shaikhs and saints (Pirs). They continuously cry and call their names and humble themselves whilst submitting themselves in a dire state of need. They feel ease and tranquillity by calling on the names of the Shaikhs and saints and they do this at times of hardship but also generally on a daily basis and they feel ease and peace in this just as a child feels ease and peace when they hear their mothers name or voice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Strangely when they say Oh Ibn Abbas or mention the name of any other righteous person they will never say anything in vain or lie without fearing Allah and when they mention the name of their righteous individuals and saints they will never lie because they think it will harm them or put them into difficulty and hardship and therefore they fear the creation more than the creator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[he goes onto say]&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Obeying and following the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam is mandatory in every affair and by the grace and blessings of Allah, we follow and obey the commands of the Messenger of Allah Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam the most. Whatever he informed us; we follow and affirm more than our hearts and lives and thus obey his commands and rulings. We also follow and obey the rules and regulations he was sent with and we adopt the principles he came with.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">In Defence of The Imaam, </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir Jilani (d.561H) </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(Rahimahullah)</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Series Part 13 &#8211; Part 2</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">By</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Series Compilers, Translated and Annotated </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;">Zuhd and Tasawwuf.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be known that concepts such as Hulool, Wahdatal-Wajood, Wahdash-Shahood and other were found amongst the soofee’s like Ibn Arabee and Abdul-Kareem Jailee, the later soofees and in Mansoor al-Hallaaj. This is the reason why earlier books of so-called Soofee’s had correct Aqeedah in them also but they also fell short in aspects of purifying their souls.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The term soofism was not found amongst the earlier generations especially during the first period. However in the second and third periods the words Zuhd, Aabid and Saaleh would be used for highly pious people and later the word soofee began being used for these people. (See Majmoo Fataawa (6/11).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir has a detailed discussion in his al-Ghuniyyah (2/269-336) which is nothing but concerning Zubd and Taqwaa, trust, hope, love and truthfulness in Allaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh himself refuted Wahdatal-Wajood and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Allaah rises over his throne.. Allaah is upon his throne…..and he is separate from the creation and nothing is hidden from his knowledge and it is not correct to say he is present everywhere and this is what Allaah has mentioned in the Qur’aan, “The most Merciful rose over the Throne.” (Tahaa:5)” (al-Ghuniyyah (1/121-124).</span></em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;">Karamah And Miracles (Mu’ajizah)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Difference between the two is that a miracle is performed at the hands of the Prophets like the splitting of the moon by our Messenger (Sallahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) and the cooling of the Fire for Ibraaheem (Alyahis-Salaam). A karamah on the other hand is something amazing performed at the hands of a Walee. Howeverthe following need to be understood,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A mu’ajizah is performed at the hand of a prophet and a karamah in the hands of a Walee.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Just as a walee’s status cannot reach the status of a Prophet, similarly a walee’s karamah cannot be considered to be synonymous with a Prophets miracle. (Dalaa’il an-Nabuwwah (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pgs.109-112</span>).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophets or walee’s do not have any authority in performing the miracles or karamah’s, their occurrence is due to the command of Allaah. (Soorah al-Israa:90-93).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is not permissible for a muslim at all to deny a miracle of a Prophet however a walee’s karamah can be accepted OR rejected. (See Majmoo Fataawa (11/208).</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no doubt Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir was a pious and righteous individual and it is possible some of the karamah’s attributed to him maybe correct, however so many have been attributed to him by extreme soofee’s who pass the limits and enter the realms of Ghuloo in doing so and most of these are without evidence or authentic chains. So the affair is that many of the karamah’s attributed to him are not true but mere blind love of the soofee’s who forged them and attributed them to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Dhahabee said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“I say there is not a shaikh from the major Shayookh’s whose karamah’s are more well known than the karamah’s of Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir, however most of them are not correct and some of them are from the things which are impossible.” (Siyar (20/450).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Katheer also said something very similar. (al-Bidaayah Wan-Nihaayah (12/252).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the people who had extreme love for Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir compiled his karamah’s in a book. One such person was Alee bin Yoosuf ash-Shatnoofee who died 150 years after the death of Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir in approximately 713H. (see al-A’laam (5/188), Kashf adh-dhanoon (1/257).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shatnoofee mentioned the karamah’s of Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir in such a manner as if he was from the Shaikh’s time and the reader is fooled into thinking this. Shatnoofee also attempted to mention these karamah’s with his own chains and most of these are weak due to the narrators in the chain. This is the reason why the research scholars reprimanded Shatnoofee strongly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Haafidh Ibn Hajr mentioned from Shaikh al-Kamaal Ja’afar, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Shatnoofee has mentioned very strange and odd things in this book and the people have criticized most of the incidences he has mentioned and their chains.” (ad-Durr al-Kaaminah (3/142).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Wardee mentioned in his Taareekh, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Bahjatul-Israar (the name of Shatnoofee’s book) contains such things which cannot be accepted and such exaggerated things have been mentioned about Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir that are not possible for anyone except Allaah.” (Kashf adh-Dhanoon (1/257).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Rajab said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Shatnoofee has written a three volume book on Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir and in it he has compiled a mountain of lies. Whereas it is sufficient for a person be declared a liar for him to narrate everything he hears. I have seen some of the quotes in the book but my soul was not content in believing them because firstly the narrations have been taken from unknown people. Secondly not only are their mountains of lies and allegations on Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir but it is also contrary to the status of the Shaikh if attributed to him. The statement of Shaikh al-Kamaal has also passed by me where he says the things Shanoofee has mentioned in his book Bahjatul-Israar have caused him to be accused (of lying).” (Dhail Tabaqaat (1/293) of Ibn Rajab). </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Although Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir Jeelaanee also had mistakes like every son of Adam, Haafidh Dhahabee the student of Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah described them as,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The summary is Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir was a man of great respect however some of his statements still need looking into and weighed up, which we leave to Allaah, and from some of them are lies which have been attributed to him.” (Siyar (20/451).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islaam Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Such statements and actions have been mentioned from some of the Mujtahid’s from the Salaf us-Saaliheen which are included as innovations. However the people of knowledge did not take them as innovations rather they took them on the basis of weak narrations thinking the narration was authentic. Similarly they extrapolated from verses and these extrapolations were not correct and they were unable to find specific texts in some of these issues. When someone has fear of Allaah in his heart then he falls under the saying of Allaah, “Oh Rabb if w err or make a mistake then do not account us for it.” And the Saheeh mentions, “Allaah says I accept.” (Majmoo Fataawa (19/191).</span></em></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir Jilani (d.561H) </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(Rahimahullah)</span></strong></h5>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Introduction</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahlul-Bid’ah Waz-Zaigh have attributed all sorts of heretical and innovative beliefs to Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir Jeelaanee, more so in our times especially by the soofee’s of the world, the bareilwee’s the deobandee’s. Some of these individuals have distorted and misinterpreted the teachings of the Shaikh in as much portraying the shaikh to be from amongst the propagator’s of Soofism, Wahdatul-Wajood, Fana, Baqa and Wahdatash-Shahood and other heretical beliefs. These individuals from Zaytuna institute in California, the translator of the reliance of the traveler and their foot soldiers are all upon this, this is their way and this what they propagate. So we humbly ask them show us the uniformity of your beliefs and the beliefs of Shaikh Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee. </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;">His Life (Summarised)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir Jeelaanee’s full name is Abdul-Qaadir bin Abee Saaleh Abdullah bin Jankee Daust al-Jailee (al-Jeelaanee). His kunyah was Abu Muhammad and his title’s were Muhi ud deen and Shaikh ul-Islaam. (Siyar A’laam an-Nabula (20/439), al-Bidaayah Wan-Nihaayah (12/252). Fawaat al-Wafyaat (2/373), Shadhraat adh-Dhahab (4/198).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Sama’anee referred to him as Imaam al-Hanaabillah (Imaam of the Hanbalee’s) (Dhail A’la Tabqaat al-Hanaabillah (1/291) of Ibn Rajab)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author of Shadhraat traced his lineage to Hussain bin Alee (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) and he was born in 471H and according to some 470H in the place of Jeelaan. (Siyar A’laam an-Nabula (20/439).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Dhahabee mentioned he came to Baghdaad in his childhood. (Siyar A’laam an-Nabula (20/439).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;">His Teachers and Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Dhahabee mentioned the following as his teachers. Qaadheee Abu Sa’eed Makhramee, Abu Ghaalib (Muhammad bin Hussain) Baqalaanee, Ahmad bin Muzaffar bin Saus, Abu Qaasim bin Bayaan, Ja’afar bin Ahmad Siraaj, Abu Sa’ad bin Khasheesh, Abu Taalib Yoosufee and others. (Siyar A’laam an-Nabula (20/440).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From his students Imaam Dhahabee has mentioned, Abu Sa’ad Sama’anee, Umar bin Alee Qurashee, Shaikh Muwaffiq ud deen ibn Qudaamah (the author of the monumental book, Lu’matul Ei’tiqaad), <span style="font-style: inherit;"> </span>Abdur-Razzaaq bin Abdul-Qaadir and Moosaa bin Abdul Qaadir (both are the sons of the Shaikh), Alee bin Idrees, Ahmad bin Mu’tee Abu Hurairah, Muhammad bin Laith Wastaanee, Akmal bin Mas’ood Haashimee, Abu Taalib Abdul-Lateef bin Muhammad bin Qabeetee and others. (Siyar A’laam an-Nabula (20/440).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After learning the Shaikh began to admonish and cultivate the people with sincerity. As a result Allaah aided him and put much blessing in his work and his circles and his admonishes became very famous, to the extent that the rulers of the time would also participate in his circles aswell as major people of knowledge of his time. The affect of the Shaikh’s admonishing was such that many a people repented for their sins and mistakes. (Siyar A’laam an-Nabula (20/441).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Katheer said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“After he came to Baghdaad he started seeking knowledge of hadeeth and Fiqh from Abu Sa’eed Makhramee Hanbalee. Abu Sa’eed had a small institution, which he handed over to Shaikh Abdul Qaadir. In this institution the Shaikh would deliver lectures of knowledge and would admonish the people, many people benefited from him.” (al-Bidaayah Wan-Nihaayah (12/252).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh died in 561H and the age of 90. (Siyar A’laam an-Nabula (20/450)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh authored a number of books (which will be quoted from) however many books are also attributed to him which he himself did not write and it is these books which Ahlul-Bid’ah have utilized in disparaging the Shaikh and his Aqeedah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This the Shaikh’s most famous work and his beliefs, his way and ideology are mentioned in this book. Its proper name chosen by the Shaikh as al-Ghuniyyah ut-Taaliben Tareeq al-Haqq. However some latter people (from the Soofiyyah) have denounced this book and denied it to be a work of the Shaikh on the account of its contents. So in order to repel this fallacy, Haajee Khaleefah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“al-Ghuniyyatuh ut-Taalibeen Tareeq al-Haqq is the work of Abul-Qaadir Jeelaanee who died in 561H.” (Kashf adh-Dhanoon (2/121).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Katheer and Shaikh ul-Islaam Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah have mentioned this to be the book of Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir Jeelaanee (al-Bidaayah Wan-Nihaayah (12/252), Majmoo Fatwaa (5/15).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also wrote Fatooh al-Gayb, Fath ur-Rabbaanee Wal-Faidh ar-Rehmaanee and a number of other works.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;">The Shaikhs Belief’s and Teachings.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the works of the Shaikh his belief’s and teaching were the same as Ahlus-Sunnah Wal-Jama’ah. The Shaikh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“My belief’s are the belief’s which were upheld by the Companions and the (Salaf us-Saaleh) Pious Predecessors.” (Siyar A’laam an-Nabula (20/442).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly he would also instruct and advise others to adhere to this madhab and the belief of the companions and Salaf us-Saaleh, he would say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Upon you is Ittibaa (following and obeying) and not innovation and upon you is the madhab of the Salaf as-Saaleh and this is the straight path you should firmly adhere to.” (al-Fath ur-Rabbaanee (p.35)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“It is upon the believer to follow and obey the Sunnah and those upon the Sunnah, the Jama’ah. The Sunnah is what the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) declared to be Sunnah and the Jama’ah is that, which the companions are agreed upon.” (al-Ghuniyyah (1/165).. </span></em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;">Concerning Eemaan.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are differences in the Issue of Eemaan between Ahlus-Sunnah and the deviated sects. Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir explained Eemaan just as Ahlus-Sunnah described it. He said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“We believe Eemaan is the statement of the tongue, the affirmation of the heart and action of the limbs, it increases with obedience and decreases with disobedience. It is strengthened with knowledge and weakened with ignorance…” (al-Ghuniyyah (1/135).</span></em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;">Concerning Tawheed.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh said concerning Tawheed ar-Raboobiyyah and Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The soul is inclined to obey its creator because The Rabb is his creator and master and it (the soul) is dependent in worshipping its Rabb.” (Fatooh al-Gayb (pg.21)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The person who wishes to enter into Islaam, it is obligatory upon him that he must first say the Shahadah that None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) is his Messenger. He must also dissociate himself from all the other religions other than Islaam and believe in the oneness of Allaah with his heart.” (al-Ghuniyyah (1/13).</span></em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;">Concerning Asmaa Was-Sifaat</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“In regard to this we do not leave the Book and the Sunnah. We recite the verses and the narrations and have faith in them and we leave the kayfiyyah (howness-of these) attributes to Allaah.” (al-Ghuniyyah (1/125).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh has refuted the deviated sects on their beliefs of the attributes of Allaah in detail in his book (al-Ghuniyyah (1/125-140) so please refer to it.</span></p>
<h4 style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning The Qur’aan</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Our belief is the Qur’aan is the speech of Allaah, the holy book and it is revelation which was revealed upon the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee-Wasallam) by Jibraa’eel.” (al-Ghuniyyah (1/125-140).</span></em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;">In Refutation of Shirk and Innovations.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was a firm propagator of Tawheed and a destroyer of Shirk and innovations as was evident from his statements. Some of them are,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">“Man should supplicate to Allaah, praise and glorify him, then send salutations upon the Messenger of Allaah and then finally ask Allaah for his needs.” (al-Ghuniyyah (1/92).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">“It is unlawful to swear by anyone other than Allaah so if someone wishes to swear then let him do so by Allaah only or otherwise let him remain silent.” (al-Ghuniyyah (1/92).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">“When you visit the graves then do not put your hands on them or kiss them as this is the habit of the jews, nor sit on the graves or rest against them. Then ask Allaah for your needs.” (al-Ghuniyyah (1/91).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">“Follow and obey and do not innovate. Agree with the religion and do not differ, obey and do not disobey, have sincerity and do not do Shirk.Accept Allaah as one and do not turn away from him. Ask Allaah and do not ask others. Ask him for help and do not anyone else for help. Have reliance and trust in him and do not have reliance in anyone else.” (al-Fath ur-Rabbaanee (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.151</span>).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">“The whole creation is dependent upon him and helpless without him. No can benefit or harm you…” (Fath ur-Rabbaanee (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.89</span>).</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;">Shaikh ul-Islaam Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah On Shaikh Abdul Qaadir.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It also appears the Shaikh was an upholder of the Salafee Aqeedah as he has in his al-Ghuniyyah refuted and censured all the deviated sects from the Shee’ah Rawaafidh, Murjee’ah, Qadariyyah, Jahmiyyah, Karamiyyah, Mu’tazilah and others. The only one left are the Ashaabul Hadeeth or Ahlus-Sunnah and it is this group of people the Shaikh informed the people to adhere to.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islaam in his refutation of the deviated sects, and he has a recognized status in this, used the statements of Shaikh Abul-Qaadir as supports and witnesses. (see Majmoo Fataawa (5/85), (10/455, 524, 548), (11/604).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So if there were any problems with the Aqeedah of Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir then Shaikh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah would have most definitely indicated or clarified them. Rather, we see the contrary to this as he refers and addresses Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee as, The Major Shaikh, ash-Shaikh, the Imaam, One of the Imaams and so on. (see Majmoo Fataawa (5/85), (11/604).</span></p>
