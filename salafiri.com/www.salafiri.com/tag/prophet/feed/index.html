<h3><span style="color: #000080">Hadith No. 104</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam At-Tirmidhi said: Muhammad bin Bashar narrated to us: Wahb bin Jarir narrated to us: My father informed me on the authority of Yunus from Qatadah, who narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><strong>&#8220;The pommel of the sword of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was [made] from silver.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Ṣaḥīh</strong>, Sunan At-Tirmīdhi (#1691, and he [Abū ʿĪsā At-Tirmidhi] said &#8216;This is a ḥasan gharīb ḥadīth&#8217;), Sunan Abī Dāwūd (#2583), Sunan An-Nasāʿī (#5376)</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080">Explanation and Benefits</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">1. In some cases (for example, a ring made of silver or the handle of a sword, and other than these) it is permissible for men to use silver and in other cases (for example, drinking and eating from silver utensils) it is not permissible for anyone to use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2. One should be prepared for Jihād at all times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3. Keeping weapons and to adorn them with silver is a Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">4. The fundamental matters of the religion of Islām are protected and compiled, and in the matters of ijtihād, the doors are open for the scholars of Ahlul-Ḥaqq until the Day of Judgement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the greatest blessings and favours of Allaah upon his creation is that he instils a lot of love in their heart for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). The people of iman have a great desire and fervour to know and understand the ways and means they can achieve the love of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and that it remains continuous</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With the aid of Allaah, the attempt is to know such means and ways in loving Allah and then to convey this to others, so that they benefit from them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One should not forget the obligation of loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). It is obligatory upon every Muslim that he loves the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) more than anything from amongst his love for anything from the creation. An evidence for this is what we find from the hadith which Imam Bukhari has transmitted from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;Verily the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, &#8220;I swear by the one in whose hand my soul is in, none of you is a believer up until I am more beloved to you than your father and child.&#8221; </i>(Sahih al-Bukhari, The Book of Iman, Chapter Loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is part of Iman no.14 1/58)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith which elucidates this point is what Imaam Muslim has transmitted from Anas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><i>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, &#8220;No one is a believer until I am more beloved to him than his family, wealth and the whole of mankind.&#8221; </i>(Sahih Muslim, The Book of Iman, Chapter The obligation of loving the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) more than ones family, father, child and more than mankind, no.69 (44) 1/68)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the Quran warns us of the punishment for every individual who loves his father, child, brothers, wives, tribe, wealth, business or houses more than jihad and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). Allaah the most high said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>&#8220;Say, [O Muhammad], &#8220;If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jihad in His cause, then wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.&#8221; (Soorah at-Taubah:24)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafidh Ibn Kathir said in explanation of this ayah, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;If these things are more beloved to you, more than Allah, the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and doing jihad in the way of Allah, then await for the type of punishment that will befall you.&#8221; (Tafsir Ibn Kathir 2/378)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Qurtubi said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;This ayah elucidates the obligation of loving Allah and his Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and there is no difference of opinion in that, furthermore this love has precedence over loving anything else.&#8221; (Tafsir Qurtubi 8/95)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When a person understands this and he places before him the reality that his iman will be incomplete up until he loves the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) more than anything from the creation. In such an instance with the aid of Allah love and passion for the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will increase further in its intensity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This reality is clearly proven from a Hadith which Imam Bukhari has transmitted from Abdullah. </span><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to always remember Allah and also seek the fruits and merits of loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is not in need of our love at all. Allaah the most merciful has excluded him and exalted him from this. We attain and achieve great blessings and fruits in this world and in the hereafter by loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). Loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is from the means of tasting the sweetness of Imam in this world.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim have transmitted a narration from Anas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;There are three things which if a person possesses are from the sweetness of Iman, that one loves Allaah and his Messenger more than anything, whoever he loves he does so for the sake of Allaah and he dislikes returning to disbelief just as he would dislike be thrown in the fire.&#8221;</i> (Sahih al-Bukhari 1/60 no.16, Sahih Muslim 1/66 no.67 (43)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore from the mercy of Allaah is that the one who loves the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will achieve a great reward due to being neighbour in Paradise which has everlasting and eternal bounties.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim have transmitted a narration from Abdullah ibn Mas&#8217;ood (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;A man came to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and said, &#8220;Oh Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) what do you say about a man who loves a nation but he is not able to meet them?&#8221; The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) replied, &#8220;A person will be with who he loves.&#8221; (Sahih al-Bukhari 10/557 no.6169, Saheeh Muslim 4/2034 no.165 (2640)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The saying of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;will be with who he loves.&#8221; means he will be with him in Paradise.</i> (Refer to Umdah tul-Qari 22/197)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When a person is aware and knows the great benefits and blessing of loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) he will always remember him and never forget him. With the grace of Allaah, showers of love for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will emanate from his heart which will expand and increase because the human disposition is such that it loves beneficial things and so it will attempt to attain and achieve this as much as possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One should never neglect the favours of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).</span> <span style="color: #000000;">It has been instilled in a humans nature that he loves the individual who shares his times of sadness, sorrow, and pain and who also tries to help him in this regard and also tries to benefit him with good. It is famous from olden times that, &#8216;Love has been instilled in the hearts for those who do favours.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in attempting to inform and highlight every beneficial and good thing to the Muslim Ummah he would emphatically struggle. Allaah the most high himself has testified to this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>&#8220;Th</b></span><span style="color: #000000;"><b>ere has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. Grievous to him is what you suffer; [he is] concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful.&#8221; (Soorah at-Taubah:128)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) wishing good and looking out for the Ummah was to such an extent that he would be sad and upset due to the people not accepting the truth (about Islaam) and he would be so engrossed in this it was feared he would end up losing his life. The Lord of all knowing himself said about this</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>&#8220;Then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them, [O Muhammad], if they do not believe in this message, [and] out of sorrow.&#8221; (Soorah al-Kahf:6)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to this Allaah has also prohibited us from being severely upset over someone not accepting Islaam, he said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Then is one to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive so he considers it good [like one rightly guided]? For indeed, Allah sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So do not let yourself perish over them in regret. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what they do.&#8221; (Soorah al-Faatir:8)</span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="storytitle">Narration of Malik al Dar, evidence for Tawassul by the living &amp; not by the Prophet after his death</h3>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><em>Bismillah, wal-hamdulillah was-salatu was-salamu ‘ala Rasulillah.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The incident mentioned in the narration of Malik al Dar happened during the Khilafah of Umar radiyallahu anhu, during the time of drought, and so did the incident of Umar bin al Khattab’s (radiyallahu anhu) tawassul through the Prophet’s (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) uncle, Al Abbas radiyallahu anhu.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">I have come across many discussions in regards to this narration, and all of them were concentrating on the “authenticity” of the narration, discussing its chain.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">But I have not come across any discussions on the text of the hadith itself, the story,<br />
except for some quotes here and there from some current shaikhs, sited in ahl alhadith forum, and those 2 or 3 points mentioned by those shaikhs led me to research the story of the hadith in classical books of past scholars, and I have found it very interesting and informative.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The things I discovered and read show a totally different understanding of the hadith, than what is understood by many Muslims today including some scholars, it only needs for one to go deep and see where the scholars of the past quoted the narration, in which chapter and what they said before quoting it to understand the real meaning of the hadith.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">I will go straight to the points that I have regarding the text and story of this narration of Malik al Dar. After that I will mention some logical arguments in reply to the ones who use this narration as evidence for tawasul that is “<strong>asking the Prophet</strong> <strong>(sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) to make duaa to Allah for us AFTER HIS DEATH</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>The text of the narration:</strong><strong><br />
</strong><br />
It is related from Malik al-Dar, `Umar’s treasurer, <em>that the people suffered a drought during the time of `Umar (his khilafah), whereupon a man came to the grave of the Prophet and said: “O Messenger of Allah, ask for rain for your Community, for verily they have but perished,” after which the Prophet appeared to him in a dream and told him: “Go to `Umar and give him my greeting, then tell him that they will be watered. Tell him: You must be clever, you must be clever!” The man went and told `Umar. The latter said: “O my Lord, I spare no effort except in what escapes my power!””</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Scholars’ understanding of this narration</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Hafidh <strong>Ibn Hajar al Asqalani</strong> –<em>rahimahu Allah</em>– in his books “<em>Fath al Bari</em>” (vol 3 pg. 441):</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">He sites it in chapter “<em>The people asking the Imam to do istisqa’ in times of drought</em>,” in the chapter heading section, in which he quotes ahadith that have relevance to the chapter heading, and that connect it with hadiths that come under that chapter.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Amongst those narrations he mentions the narration of Malik al Dar, and he only quotes part of the narration, he stops at “go to Umar”. He used this as evidence that people ask the imam to do istisqa (<em>ask for rain</em>) for them in times of drought.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">He didn’t mention the rest of the hadith because it has nothing to do with the chapter heading, he only quoted what he believed fits the chapters title, for he says at the end of the section, after mentioning this narration:</p>
<p>“<em>From all of this appears the relevance of the chapter heading to the origin of this story</em>“<br />
so, al Hafidh Ibn Hajar <em>rahimahu Allah</em> understood from this hadith that the Prophet <em>sallallahu alayhi wa sallam</em> was directing the man to go ask the Imam, during that time (Umar <em>radiyallahu anhu</em>), to do istisqa’ for them.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Hafidh <strong>Ibn Kathir</strong> –<em>rahimahu Allah</em>-:<br />
He sites it in his book “<em>al Bidayah wan Nihaya </em>” (vol7 pg.104 <em>), </em>in which he mentions some narrations, right before he mentions Malik ad Dar’s narration, which explain the meaning of the narration.<br />
The narrations before it are by Sayf Ibn Umar, and in them is the mentioning of Umar radiyallahu anhu, after hearing about the man’s dream (who is said to be Bilal al Harith), asking the people on the minbar if they have seen anything bad from him, and then he tells them about the dream that Bilal saw, so they told him:</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">“Bilal has spoken the truth, <strong>so make istiqatha (seek or ask for help) to Allah</strong>, then the Muslims”. So then Umar radiyallahu anhu does istisqa’ through al Abbas radiyallahu anhu.<br />
In the second narration, they said “he found you slow in doing istisqa’, so <strong>do istisqa’ for us</strong> “, so he did.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">(Note: these 2 narrations could be weak, but the point is that al Hafidh Ibn Kathir rahimahu Allah mentioned them right before the narration of Malik, showing what it is about, which shows what he understood it to mean, same as what Ibn Hajar (r A) understood from it).</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Ala’ ad Deen Ali al Mutaqi al Hindi al Burhan Furi</strong> (d. 975) in his book <em>“Kanz al Ummal“:<strong><br />
</strong></em>He sites it in chapter of (<strong>salat al Istisqa’ – prayer for rain</strong>),</p>
<div>
<p>and what the man did at the grave of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was asking for dua, not istisqa’ prayer, and salat al Istisqa’ was done by Umar radiyallahu anhu, when he made tawassul through Al Abbas radiyallahu anhu, thus both narrations are connected to each other, as shown in the previous points.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> That the story of Malik al Dar’s narration is connected to the hadith about Umar’s tawassul through al Abbas, all leading to doing istisqa’ through the living, and not through the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam after his death.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Narrations with an addition.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">There are narrations of the same story, with an addition, if they are authentic (the authenticiy is not known to me so far), they would give very strong support to the understanding of the above scholars.<br />
and it also shows what the scholars who sited the narrations believed the narration to mean.<em><br />
<strong><br />
</strong></em>Imam Ibn Abd al Bar al Maliki in his book “al Isti’ab fi ma’rifat al As-hab”:<em><strong><br />
</strong><br />
</em>The people suffered a drought during the time of ‘Umar (his khilafah), whereupon a man came to the grave of the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) and said:”O Messenger of Allah, ask for rain for your Community, for verily they have but perished,” after which the Prophet appeared to him in a dream and told him: “Go to ‘Umar <strong>and tell him to do istisqa’ (ask Allah for rain) for the people,</strong> and that they will be watered. And tell him: You must be clever, you must be clever!” So, the man went and told ‘Umar, and Umar cried and said “O my Lord, I spare no effort except in what escapes my power!” <em><br />
</em><br />
Ahmad Abdullah at Tabari (d. 694 ) in his book “ar Riyadh an Nadhirah fi Manaqib al Ashara”:Anas bin Malik narrated:<br />
The people suffered drought during Umar’s time, whereupon a man came to teh grave of the Prophet (Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam), and said: “O Messenger of Allah, ask for rain for your community, for verily they have but perished,”, he said so the Messenger of Allah came to him in a dream and told him “Go to ‘Umar <strong>then tell him to do istisqa’ (ask Allah for rain) for the people,</strong> and that they will be watered. And tell him: You must be clever, you must be clever!” So, the man went and told ‘Umar, and Umar cried and said “O my Lord, I spare no effort except in what escapes my power!”. narrated by al Baghawi in al fada’il and Abu Umar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Logical Arguments</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The ones who use this hadith for this type of tawassul say that Umar radiyallahu anhu did not rebuke the man who did istisqa’ at the grave.<br />
<strong>Reply</strong>: There is no clear evidence in the hadith indicating that the man told Umar of him going to the grave, but clearly he did tell him of the dream, telling him the message of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.<br />
so to say that he told him about his istisqa’ at the grave is an assumption, and we can’t use assumptions as evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>It didn’t rain until after Umar radiyallahu anhu made istisqa’ by al Abbas radiyallahu anhum</strong>.<br />
If the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was capable or had permission to do du’aa to Allah after his death, when asked by others, then it would have rained immediately after the man asked the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam at his grave, but it didn’t until after Umar’s istisqa’ through the duaa of Al Abbas radiyallahu anhu.<br />
This shows that the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was guiding the man to ask the Umar to do istisqa’ and not him, hinting to Umar by saying to him “<strong>be clever!</strong>“, and when Umar did istisqa’ by al Abbas (radiyallahu anhuma) it immediately rained..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If going to the grave of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to ask him to make duaa to Allah was permissable, Umar radiyallahu anhu would have done that when wanting to do istisqa’ instead of doing it through the uncle of the Messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, who was alive, and Umar’s (r.a) saying “<strong>we used to</strong> make tawassul through your Prophet’s duaa, and now we do tawassul through the uncle of your Prophet…”, indicates that they don’t make tawassul through the Prophet’s (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) duaa after his death, and only when he was alive, or else <strong>why would he say “we used to”</strong>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If what the man did (wether it was Bilal ibn al Harith radiyallahu anhu or someone else) was correct\permissable, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Why didn’t any of the scholars I quoted mention the narration in a chapter titled (tawassul by the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) or some title indicating that the narration is EVIDENCE for permissibility of that type of tawassul?<br />
Instead they title the chapter in which the narration is in (salat al istisqa’- the man didn’t do salat al Istisqa’ at the grave, only did duaa, while Umar rA did salat al istisqa) , (The people asking the Imam to do istisqa’ in times of drought),  wouldn’t it be more important to point out the permissibility of tawassul through the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam after his death, which is stronger than doing tawassul through the righteous and ahl al bayt?<br />
Instead they ignored that part , <strong>showing no importance to it at all</strong>.<br />
So if they believed that the narration indicates the permissibility of such a tawassul, why didn’t they at least <strong>hint</strong> to it by the chapter title or a comment like they did to show that it meant to do intercession through saliheen and ahl al bayt, and ask the imam to do istisqa?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">What was the point of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam telling Umar r.A “<strong>be clever</strong>“?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If the man told Umar that he went to the grave, and then told him about the dream, why would Umar do salat al istisqa’ when the man already asked the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to do istisqa’ and he told him that they will be watered?<br />
<strong>Isn’t the istisqa’ of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam sufficient?<br />
</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If the action of the man was correct (to ask the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to do istisqa), and the Prophet S.A.W answered his request, then why didn’t it rain immediately after the dream, and instead came down immediately after al Abbas’s (radiyallahu anhu) duaa?<br />
<strong>Who is higher in status, the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam or his uncle?</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now that we know the Message of the Prophets was Tawheed it follows that it is such an important issue that all the Prophets and Messengers where sent to explain this message, Allah the most high said<span id="more-808"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Accordingly, we sent to every community a Messenger, saying, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Worship Allah and keep away from the taghut.  After that Allah showed guidance to some of them, while deviation took hold of others.  So, roam about in the earth and behold what has been the end of the rejectors of the Messengers (Soorah an-Nahl 16:36)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To propagate this message, sacred Books and Scrolls were revealed and the final book, the Quraan was revealed to the final Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). Its purpose was to spread the message and call of Tawheed and to make it manifest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Most High says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“This [Quraan] is notification for the people that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that He is but one God and that those of understanding will be reminded.” (Soorah Ibraheem 14:52)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather every verse clearly or indirectly establishes and manifests Tawheed and this is what Shaikh-ul-Islaam Abul Wafaa Thanaullah Amristsari said in this treatise Kalimah Tayyibah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the most high says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Alif, Lam, Ra. [This is] a Book whose verses are perfected and then presented in detail from [one who is] Wise and Acquainted. Through a messenger, saying, “Do not worship except Allah. Indeed, I am to you from Him a warner and a bringer of good tidings.” (Soorah Hud 11:1-2)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The prophets had to endure many trials and tribulations and this was due to the call to Tawheed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the most high says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Similarly, there came not to those before them any messenger except that they said, “A magician or a madman.” (Soorah adh-Dhariyat 51:52)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Indeed, We are sufficient for you against the  mockers. Who make [equal] with Allah another deity. But they are going to know.” (Soorah al-Hijr 15:95-96)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And his saying, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And they resented them not except because they believed in Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy.” (Soorah Al-Buruj 85:8)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right – only because they say, “Our Lord is Allah.” And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of Allah is much mentioned. And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might. (Soorah Al-Haj 22:40)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And ,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>“It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion. And sufficient is Allah as Witness.” (Soorah Al-Fath 48:28)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same happened with the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam), </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves. And the disbelievers say, “This is a magician and a liar.” (Soorah Sad 38:4)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>“We have not heard of this in the latest religion. This is not but a fabrication.” (Soorah Sad 38:7)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) had to face many troubles from those who opposed him as Allah informs us, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“You will surely be tested in your possessions and in yourselves. And you will surely hear from those who were given the Scripture before you and from those who associate others with Allah much abuse. But if you are patient and fear Allah – indeed, that is of the matters [worthy] of determination.” (Soorah Ale-Imraan 3:186)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There were many wars at different places and in approximately a period of nine years, the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) participated in 24 wars, examples are Uhud, Badr Hunain and Tabook. These where all for the sake of Tawheed of Allah (his oneness and to establish it)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the most high says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah. And if they cease – then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do.” (Soorah Al ‘Anfal 8:39)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During the Makkan period the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) had to face harm and problems. Examples included verbal abuse, insults, being hit and beaten, he was abandoned socially and all association with him was prohibited. He faced days of isolation in Shuab Abee Taallib and finally he had to migrate to Madeenah, and upon leaving he said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I swear by Allah for verily you are the best land of Allah and the most beloved land of Allah from Allah’s land and if I was not expelled from you I would not leave”</em> (Tirmidhee and Ibn Majah)   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The whole reason for these troubles and problems was the call to Tawheed and whenever the Messenger of  Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) sent  any callers to Islam to any place he would tell them to call to Tawheed first. Hence when he sent Muadh Ibn Jabal to Yemen he said to him, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Let the first thing you call to be Tawheed (Oneness of Allah)”</em> (Bukhaari no. 7372)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As this is the basis for all actions to be accepted Allaah the most high said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allah, your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers.” (Soorah Az-Zumar 39:65)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is in fact Tawheed which inclines you towards doing righteous actions as this leads to believing and having faith in Allah and this is what expels all fear of other things and those entities with whom hope is associated with. It is these two things i.e. hope and fear which incline the heart to do righteous deeds. The people who have difficulty understanding this as Allah himself and the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) have mentioned therefore have a problem in distinguishing between Allah and other than him who are falsely worshipped.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the same manner the people who ask other than Allah for help and seek their assistance, do so because they seek salvation and redemption by asking them to intercede for them to solve their problems or illnesses and they hold this as their Aqeedah, they become totally lost and oblivious of the fear of Allah. They constantly think of their false deities and intermediateries and think of them when in need and hope for their intercession.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The doors of bad deeds and sins remain open for them and they distance themselves from the truth. It is the greatness of Tawheed by which a believer can remain firm and steadfast on good and righteous deeds, good manners and Eeman. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.” (Soorah Baqarah 2:256)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And whoever submits his face to Allah while he is a doer of good – then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold. And to Allah will be the outcome of [all] matters.” (Soorah Luqman 31:22)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tawheed can make mankind remain firm in this life. Allah says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“You worship not besides Him except [mere] names you have named them, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. Legislation is not but for Allah. He has commanded that you worship not except Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.” (Soorah Yusuf 12:40)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And with this the Muslim Ummah (nation) can remain unified and firm upon. Allah says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus – to establish the religion and not be divided therein. Difficult for those who associate others with Allah is that to which you invite them. Allah chooses for Himself whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him].” (42:13)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With the greatness of Tawheed the disheartened heart will unite and will be purified of jealously and hatred. Allah says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Never will your relatives or your children benefit you; the Day of Resurrection He will judge between you. And Allah, of what you do, is Seeing.” (Soorah Al-Mumtahanah 60:3)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Calling to Tawheed and spreading its message is the norm and is a sign of the followers of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and they are the true inheritors in spreading and propagating this message, Allah says, Say, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“This is my way; I invite to Allah with insight, I and those who follow me. And exalted is Allah; and I am not of those who associate others with Him. (Soorah Yusuf 12:108)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Tawheed sits firmly in the hearts of the people every tribulation to befall them will become easy. For example the proclaiming of Allah is One. An example of this is when Bilaal al-Habshee(RadhiAllaah Anhu) was made to lie in the blazing heat on top of burning coals and rocks, Khabeeb Jua’nee (RadhiAllaah Anhu) requesting to read two rakah (units) of prayer before being martyred, the crying of Khalid bin Waleed (RadhiAllaah Anhu) at the time of his death for the longing of martyrdom when his body was riddled with pain, similarly having patience when food and sustenance was scarce  at the battle of Tabook, the patience of the female companions upon the slaying of their children and we find many examples like this in the history of Islaam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of this shows and indicates these people understood Tawheed from the depths of their hearts and believed in it firmly and this is that sweetness of Eeman (faith) which is mentioned in authentic ahadeeth, that the one who will taste the sweetness of Eemaan is he who possesses three attributes, It is reported on the authority of Anas (RadhiAllaah Anhu) that the Prophet of Allaah said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There are three qualities for which anyone who is characterised by them will relish the sweetness of faith: he to whom Allaah and His Messenger are dearer than all else; he who loves a man for Allaah’s sake alone; and he who has as great an abhorrence of returning to unbelief after Allaah has rescued him from it as he has of being cast into Hell.”</em> (Saheeh Muslim <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.67</span>)</span></p>
