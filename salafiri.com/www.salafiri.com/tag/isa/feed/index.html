				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><a style="color: #000080" name="_Toc124860484"></a>[The Descent of ‘Isa bin Maryam (Peace be upon him)]¹</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">After the Mutawatir Ahadith and the consensus of the Ummah on the Finality of Prophethood, it is said that Sayyiduna ‘Isa (Peace be upon him) will descend from the Heavens to the Earth and will kill the Dajjal before the Day of Resurrection, as is proven by the Sahih Ahadith.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that Abu’l Qasim (the Messenger of Allah ﷺ) said [as part of a lengthier narration], <strong>“Then ‘Isa bin Maryam </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong> will descend from the Heavens…” </strong><em>(Al-Bahr Az-Zakhar 17/96 #9642 and his wording after has </em><em>فيؤم الناس</em><em>, Kashf Al-Astar ‘An Zawa’id Al-Bazzar 4/142-143 and his wording after has </em><em>فيقوم الناس</em><em>, Majma’ Az-Zawa’id 7/349, the chain of narration is authentic – refer to my book ‘Tahqiqi Maqalat 1/111,112)</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">The wording of the Hadith فيقوم الناس means that the people will stand up for prayer, the meaning of فيؤم الناس is that after the day that Sayyiduna ‘Isa (Peace be upon him) descends, he will lead all the remaining prayers – due to this, there is no contradiction between these Ahadith.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>Sayyiduna Nawas bin Sam’an (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said [as part of a lengthier narration], <strong>“Then, Allah (Exalted is He) will send Al-Masih bin Maryam, and he will descend at a white minaret in the East of Damascus wrapped in two garments, both hands placed on the wings of two angels…” </strong><em>(Sahih Muslim #2937, Tahqiqi Maqalat 1/117)</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">This Hadith is explicitly clear in that Sayyiduna ‘Isa (Peace be upon him) will be brought down by two angels while he has both hands on their wings.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>On the Night of Mi’raj, the Prophet ﷺ met Sayyiduna ‘Isa (Peace be upon him), who said to him [as part of a lengthier narration], <strong>“I have been enjoined [with some tasks] before The Hour. So as for The Hour, then nobody has knowledge of it except for Allah.” </strong>Then he mentioned the coming of the Dajjal and said, <strong>“So I shall descend and then kill him…” </strong><em>(Sunan Ibn Majah #4081 and its chain is Sahih, Tahqiqi Maqalat 1/121-122)</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">This Hadith is explicitly clear that the [same] Prophet that was sent to Bani Isra’il, Sayyiduna ‘Isa bin Maryam (Peace be upon him), will descend from the Heavens and kill the Dajjal.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>Allah (Exalted is He) says in the Noble Qur’an:</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: center">وَإِنْ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ إِلَّا لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“And verily there is none from the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) except that they will surely believe in him (‘Isa bin Maryam) before his death.”</strong><br />
<em>(Surah An-Nisa’, 4:159)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said in explanation of this Ayah, <strong>“[Meaning] the death of ‘Isa.” </strong><em>(Tarikh Dimashq of Ibn ‘Asakir 47/513 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The famous Faqih and Mujtahid, Amir Al-Mu’minin in Ahadith, the Sahabi of great status, Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) also used this Ayah as evidence for the descent of ‘Isa bin Maryam (may Allah be pleased with him). <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3668, Sahih Muslim #155, Darussalam Edn. #390)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The famous trustworthy Tabi’i, Imam Hasan Al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him), said in explanation of this Ayah, <strong>“[Meaning] before the death of ‘Isa, and by Allah! Verily he is alive right now with Allah (in the Heavens), but when he descends, all of [Ahlul-Kitab] will believe in him.” </strong><em>(Tafsir Ibn Jarir At-Tabari 4/254 #10822 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center">وَإِنَّهُۥ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“And verily he (‘Isa) will be a known sign for The Hour…”</strong><br />
<em>(Surah Az-Zukhruf, 43:61)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said in explanation of this Ayah, <strong>“[Meaning] the coming of ‘Isa before the Day of Resurrection.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Ibn Hibban Al-Ihsan #6778 and its chain is Sahih, see Tahqiqi Maqalat 1/86)</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center">إِنِّى مُتَوَفِّيكَ</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“…Verily I will take you…”<br />
</strong><em>(Surah Ali ‘Imran, 3:55)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Hasan Al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said in explanation of this Ayah, <strong>“[Meaning:] I will take you from the Earth.”</strong> <em>(Tafsir At-Tabari 3/244 #7128 and its chain is Sahih, Tafsir ‘Abdur-Razzaq 1/129 #407)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The truthful Tabi’ Tabi’i, Matar bin Tahman Al-Warraq, who is considered truthful according to the majority [of scholars of Hadith] and is Hasan Al-Ahadith said, <strong>“[Meaning]: I will raise you from the world without death.” </strong><em>(Tafsir At-Tabari 3/243-244 #7128 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a name="_Toc124860485"></a><span style="color: #000080">[Consensus on The Descent of ‘Isa bin Maryam (Peace be upon him)]</span>³</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">There is not a single person known to oppose [this belief] from the best of generations (the Companions, their successors, and their successors), thus there is Ijma’ (consensus) on the fact that Sayyiduna ‘Isa bin Maryam An-Nasiri (Peace be upon him) is alive in the heavens and will descend before the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The famous Mufassir (exegete) Abu Hayyan Muhammad bin Yusuf Al-Andalusi (d. 745H, may Allah have mercy on him) said, <strong>“And the Ummah have agreed upon what is included in the Mutawatir Al-Hadith that ‘Isa is in the Heavens and that verily he shall descend in the final duration [before the Day of Resurrection].”</strong> <em>(Tafsir Al-Bahr Al-Muhit 2/497)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Abu’l Hasan Al-Ash’ari (d. 329H), the one who turned to the truth towards the end of his life, said, <strong>“And the Ummah have agreed upon that Allah, Mighty and Majestic, surely raised ‘Isa to the Heavens.” </strong><em>(His famous book ‘Al-Ibanah ‘An Usul Ad-Diyanah’, p. 34)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">One should remember that it is established from the Mustadarak of Al-Hakim (1/116)<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> and other than it from the Sahih Ahadith that the Ijma’ (Consensus) of the Ummah is a Shari’ proof and evidence – rather, Imam Ash-Shafi’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said, <strong>“The Asl (foundation) is the Qur’an and Sunnah, and if [there is no explicit text from either] then Qiyas (analogy) is done based on the two. When the Hadith is continuous (i.e., the chain of narration is connected) from the Messenger of Allah </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong> and its chain of narration is authentic then it is a Sunnah, and Ijma (consensus) is greater than a singular narration, and the Hadith is [taken] upon the apparent [meaning], and if it carries two meanings then the one closer to the apparent meaning is given precedence, and if two Hadiths counterbalance each other, then the one with the more authentic chain of narration is given precedence.”</strong> <em>(Adab Ash-Shafi’i wa Manaqibih of Ibn Abi Hatim p. 177-178 and its chain of narration is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Regarding his statement about Consensus, Imam Shafi’i meant that a singular narration may be prone to a faulty interpretation. However, Consensus [of the Ummah] cannot have a faulty interpretation, thus Consensus is clearer than a singular narration.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><em>(Mas&#8217;ala Khatam An-Nabuwwat, p.56-60)</em></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> [TN:] The following chapter headings are not found in the original work of the Shaykh, I (Abu Sinan) added them for clarity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> [TN:] The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! Surely the Son of Maryam (‘Isa) is about to descend amongst you as a just ruler, then he will break the Cross, kill the pigs, and abolish the Jizyah &#8211; and money will overflow until there is no one to accept it [as charity], and at that point a single prostration [for Allah] will be greater than the world and whatever is in it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said after narrating this Hadith, <strong>“And recite, if you wish: ‘And verily there is none of the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) except that they will surely believe in him (‘Isa bin Maryam) before his death.’” </strong><em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3448)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> [TN:] Many of the Imams of the Religion mentioned this belief in their books of I’tiqad (creed), for example:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>Imam ‘Ali bin Al-Madini (d. 231H) narrated regarding that which is obligatory to believe in, <strong>“Belief in that The False Messiah, Ad-Dajjal, has ‘Kafir’ written between his two eyes, and in the Ahadith that have come regarding that, [and] belief that that will occur, and that ‘Isa bin Maryam will descend and kill him at the Gate of Lud.” </strong><em>(As transmitted by Imam Al-Lalaka’i in his chapter: ‘I’tiqad of Ali bin Al-Madini and that which he transmitted regarding it from a Jama’ah of the Salaf’, 1/260-262 #290/10, Dar Al-Lu’lua Edn.)</em></li>
<li>Imam Ahmad said, <strong>“The foundations of the Sunnah with us are holding onto what the Companions of the Messenger of Allah were upon…” </strong>until his saying: <strong>“…and belief that Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will come out, and written between his two eyes is ‘Kafir (Disbeliever’, and [belief in] the Ahadith that have come regarding that, and belief that that will all occur, and that ‘Isa bin Maryam (Peace be upon him) will descend then kill him.” </strong><em>(As transmitted by Imam Al-Lalaka’I in his chapter: ‘I’tiqad of Al-Imam Abi ‘Abdillah Ahmad bin Hanbal’, 1/252-259 #289/18, Dar Al-Lu’lua Edn.)</em></li>
<li>Imam Ibn Battah Al-‘Ukbari said in explanation of the Sunnah, <strong>“Belief in that ‘Isa bin Maryam (Peace be upon him) will descend from the Heavens to the Earth, then he will break the cross and kill the swine…” </strong><em>(Ash-Sharh w’al-Ibanah 2/57)</em></li>
<li>Imam Ibn Abi Zayd Al-Qayrawani said, <strong>“Section: In clarification of what the Ummah has gathered upon…”</strong> until his saying: <strong>“and belief in what has been narrated regarding the Night Journey of the Prophet </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong> to the Heavens […] and in what is established from the coming out of the Dajjal and the descent of ‘Isa bin Maryam (Peace be upon him)…” </strong><em>(As transmitted by Ibn Al-Qayyim in Ijtima’ Al-Juyush p. 215-220, Dar Ibn Hazm Edn.)</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> [TN:] The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“Allah shall never gather my Nation together upon misguidance, and the Hand of Allah is above the Jama’at.”</strong> <em>(Al-Mustadarak of Al-Hakim 1/116 #399, and Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i authenticated it in his article on Ijma’ – see Monthly Al-Hadith Hazro #91, p. 9-49)</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">His travels in search of hadeeth were very vast and expansive and during his search he travelled to Basrah, Koofah, Waasit, Reh, Khurasaan and Hijaaz.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Scholars Praise For Imaam Tirmidhee</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">He was not a big man, he was weak and skinny. During the latter part of his life he became blind due to constant crying and Imaam Ibn Katheer said according to one statement he was born blind however the more well known reason for him losing his sight is the first one.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Ya’ala al-Khaleel bin Abdullah al-Khaleelee al-Qazwaynee wrote in his book ‘Uloom al-Hadeeth’,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“All the scholars of hadeeth (muhadditheen) are agreed upon (his trustworthiness) Muhammad ibn Eesaa bin Soorah bin Shadaad al-Haafidh.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Haakim said,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“I heard from Umar bin A’lk who said, ‘When Imaam Bukhaaree died he left no man behind him as Abu Eesaa in knowledge, memory, piety and righteousness, he would cry so much due to the fear of Allaah that he became blind and he remained alive for a number of years in this state.&#8217;”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Daqeeq as-Sa’eed said,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“The pronouncement of the word Tirmidh with Taa and Meem became so much so that it began reaching the level of tawatur.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hibbaan said in Kitaab ath-Thiqaat,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Abu Eesa compiled the knowledge of hadeeth and authored books in this field and preserved them by his memory and re-itterated.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Sa’eed Idreesee said,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Abu Eesaa’s memory was one of example.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They say some scholars of hadeeth tested Abu Eesaa, so they recited 40 of their ghareeb (strange/odd) ahaadeeth to him. Then immediately Imaam Abu Eesaa at-Tirmidhee recited all 40 ahaadeeth back to them. Upon this they said,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“We have not seen a scholar of hadeeth like you.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Idreesee narrates with his chain from Imaam Abu Eesaa who said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Once on the way to Makkah I wrote two parts of a hadeeth of a Shaykh. Coincidently I met him so I asked him to narrate the ahaadeeth, which he accepted. I had thought I had written the two parts but unfortunately I had both parts (of paper) in my hand without anything written on them. The Shaykh recited the ahaadeeth and he saw the two parts in my hand and said, ‘Are you not ashamed.’ So I explained the events and told him not to worry and your efforts are not wasted, ‘I have memorised all the ahaadeeth you have narrated.’ But he did not believe me and said, ‘Recite them.’ So I recited them. But he was still not saisfied and said, ‘You had memorised them from before.’ So I said, ‘Narrate some other ahaadeeth and we will see.’ So he narrated a further 40 ahaadeeth, and I recited them all back to him without the mistake of a single letter.”</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Sam’anee said in al-Insaab,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Imaam of his era without competition, the author.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam al-Mizzee said,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“al-Haafidh the author of al-Jaami and other works, one of the Haafidh Imaams.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam adh-Dhahabee said,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“al-Haafidh of the time, the author of Jaami, his trustworthiness is agreed upon.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Hajr said,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“One of the Imaams.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Katheer said,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“He was an Imaam of his time from the Imaams who had high status’s.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Status of Jaami at-Tirmidhee</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">His Sunan has approximately 3956 Ahaadeeth. Some of the specialities of his Sunan are that it mentions the practices of the companions and sucessors, of the major scholars, critical analysis of the narrators, defects and grading of ahaadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">The level of Imaam Tirmidhee’s fiqh can be appreciated from the chapter headings he uses in his Sunan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Abu Eesaa Tirmidhee himself said,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“When I authored this work I presented it to the scholars of Hijaaz, A’raaq and Khurasaan, all of them read it and liked it. Whoever has this book in his house (i.e. Jaam’i Tirmidhee) then it is as if the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) is talking himself.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Nasr Abdur-Raheem bin Abdul-Haqq Yusoofee said,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“There are four types of ahaadeeth in Jaam’i Tirmidhee, (1) their authenticity is certain. (2) This type is upon the conditions of Abu Daawood and Nasaa’ee. (3) A type in which he has mentioned the defects and weakness of the hadeeth, (4) and about the fourth type he says himself, “I have not transmitted any such hadeeth in my book upon which a faqeeh did not act.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Explanations of Sunan at-Tirmidhee</strong></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A’aridah al-Ahwadhee Fee Sharh al-Jaami Lit-Tirmidhee, by Haafidh Abu Bakr bin Abdullah al-Ma’aroof Ibn al-Arabee. It has been printed in Egypt with many mistakes and there are two manuscripts of it, one in Madeenah and the second in a library in Bihaar.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Sharh Jaami Lit-Tirmidhee, by Haafidh Abul-Fath Muhammad bin Sayyid an-Naas.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Sharh Jaami Lit-Tirmidhee, by Zain-ud-Deen Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Ahmad Naqeeb al-A’raaqee, it reached a total of 20 volumes but got burnt during some fitnah.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">al-Urf ash-Shadhee Ala Jaami at-Tirmidhee, by Siraaj-ud-Deen Umar bin Raslaan, only a small part was explained.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Sharh az-Zawaa’id Lit-Tirmidhee, by Allaamah Siraaj-ud-Deen Umar bin Alee al-Mulqin, this is an explanation of the additional ahaadeeth other than those in the two Saheehs and in Sunan Abee Daawood.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">al-Lab al-Libaab Feemaa Yaqool at-Tirmidhee Wa Fil-Baab, by Haafidh Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee, this is in one volume and a copy is in Madeenah. It is an extremely indespensible book in which he has explained the words and ahaadeeth with the sciences of Jarh Wa-Ta’deel when Imaam Tirmidhee says, “Wa Fil Baal An Fulaan…” about the ahaadeeth pertaining to fiqhee issues.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Quwwat al-Mughtadee Ala Jaami at-Tirmidhee, by Allaamah Suyootee.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Sharh Jaami at-Tirmidhee, by Haafidh Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee, as he has mentioned himself in Fath ul-Baaree.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Sharh Jaami at-Tirmidhee, by Shaykh Abul-Hasan bin Abdul-Haadee as-Sindhee, an excellent explanation which the author did in the Haram (sanctuary) it is in 40 Juzz.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Sharh Jaami at-Tirmidhee, by Allaamah Abu Tayyib Sindhee.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Hidaayatul-Lu’zee Bi-Nukaat at-Tirmidhee, by Allaamah Abu Tayyib Shams ul-Haqq A’dheemabaadee, other than an explanation it has a very detailed and comprehensive analysis and discussion on the chains of Sunan at-Tirmidhee. It was not completed.</span>
<p align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaamah ash-Shaykh Ubaidullaah Rehmaanee said,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“What pity the Allaamah was unable to complete this explanation during his life.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Tuhfatul-Ahwadhee Sharh Jaami at-Tirmidhee, by Allaamah ash-Shaykh Abul-A’la Abdur-Rahmaan Mubaarakpooree, this is one of the best explanations ever authored on Jaami at-Tirmidhee the first volume was printed in 1342H. Those who have consulted have always sighed in exclamation. It also includes answers and refutations of the Hanafee Madhhab and more so answers to the works and idea’s of Nimawee and his work Aathaar as-Sunan.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">al-Jaami as-Saheeh Wahuwa Sunan at-Tirmidhee Tahqeeq Wa Sharh, by Allaamah ash-Shaykh Abil-Ishbaal Ahmad Muhammad Shaakir, the first two volumes were published in 1356H. It was later published in 5 volumes the explainer however pased away and was thus unable to complete it.</span>
<p align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ubaidullah Rehmaanee said,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“My heart supplicates dearly that this book is printed quickly in the manner of the previous volumes, it is an invalubale gift of knowledge for the scholars of Ahlul-Hadeeth.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">&amp; 15. Rashh as-Sihaab Feemaa Tark ash-Shaykh Mimaa Fil-Libaab and Takhreej Ahadeeth at-Tirmidhee Maa Fil-Libaab, by Allaamah al-Usaadh Faidh ur-Rahmaan ath-Thawree, these two books have integral scholarly points and great benefit.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Death</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">The Imaam died on the 13th of Rajab in 279H in his city of Tirmidh.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Umar Fullatah may Allah have mercy upon him said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: Eesa (Jesus) the son of Maryam; Allah created him from a mother and he does not have a father. Similarly Allah created Adam without a father or a mother. And likewise Allah created Hawwa (Eve) with a father and no mother. Thus the affair is not strange. Allah said in His glorious Book:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">إِ`</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our father Adam—peace be upon him—Allah created him from soil, from sounding clay like the clay of pottery, from an adhesive soil. After that Allah ordered that a soul be blown into him with the statement, ‘Be’. Thus Adam was.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Where is the mother of Adam? Where is the father of Adam? The father of mankind—Adam—does not have a father or a mother. Thus the All-Knowing, the Most Great, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise, the One who does whatever He wants and chooses, created Adam without a mother or a father. And the affair is not like Darwin (upon him is the curse of Allah) says; the theory of Darwin which states the origin of mankind is from monkeys, and they evolved. The theory of evolution, says that monkeys evolved through stages until it became Adam. And that Adam is not from soil but rather he is an animal who evolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah the Exalted said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">إِ<strong>نَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَى عِنْدَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ آدَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِنْ تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Verily, the likeness of Eesa (Jesus) with Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from soil, the He said to him ‘Be’ and he was. (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:59)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Hawwa (Eve); Allah created her from a rib from Adam. She does not have a mother while she has a father. Thus Allah the Exalted wanted to create Eesa (Jesus) so He created him from a mother, and she is the virgin Maryam, the untouched; may the best prayers and peace be upon her and upon our Prophet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">She is Maryam the daughter of Imraan, the one whom Allah described with His statement:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">ا<strong>لَّتِي أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The one who guarded her chastity (Soorh At Tahrim 66:12)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In this is a testimony from the Creator, the Exalted, that she surely guarded her chastity and she was not a lewd woman, peace be upon her.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Her father was a righteous man, a worshipper. Her mother became pregnant with her, meaning with Maryam, so she dedicated her to the service of Allah. (Her intent was) if Allah blessed her with a son, she would dedicate this son to the Masjid, worship and the obedience of Allah. But Allah decreed the mother of Maryam was to give birth to Maryam; a girl and not a boy who would take care of the affairs of the Masjid and worship Allah in the Masjid.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thus when she gave birth to a girl she wanted an excuse with Allah, she said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">فَلَمَّا وَضَعَتْهَا قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَضَعْتُهَا أُنْثَى وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا وَضَعَتْ وَلَيْسَ الذَّكَرُ كَالْأُنْثَى وَإِنِّي سَمَّيْتُهَا مَرْيَمَ وَإِنِّي أُعِيذُهَا بِكَ وَذُرِّيَّتَهَا مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Then when she delivered her [child Maryam], she said: “O my Lord! I have delivered a female child,” – and Allah knew better what she delivered, – “And the male is not like the female, and I have named her Maryam, and I seek refuge with You (Allah) for her and for her offspring from Satan, the outcast.” (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:36)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Exalted said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">فَ<strong>تَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ وَأَنْبَتَهَا نَبَاتًا حَسَنًا وَكَفَّلَهَا زَكَرِيَّا كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا الْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِنْدَهَا رِزْقًا قَالَ يَا مَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هَذَا قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So her Lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of Zakariya. Every time Zakariya entered upon her in the prayer chamber, he found with her provision. He said, “O Maryam, from where is this [coming] to you?” She said, “It is from Allah. Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without account.” (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:37)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maryam—while she was still young—was honored by Allah. The provision that Zakariya found with Maryam—and Zakariya was from her closest guardians—he would come and find the fruits which only grow during the summer months with her during the winter months; and he would find with her the fruits which only grow during the winter months with her during the summer months. She was blessed, righteous, pious, throughout her youth and when she reached womanhood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yusuf the carpenter asked for her hand in marriage, and he was from her relatives. He desired to marry her. And she was righteous; dedicated to her prayer area, dedicated to obedience to Allah and worship. The entire community of that time period testified to her righteousness and piety. And for this reason when she became pregnant (they said to her)</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">يَا أُخْتَ هَارُونَ مَا كَانَ أَبُوكِ امْرَأَ سَوْءٍ وَمَا كَانَتْ أُمُّكِ بَغِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">O sister of Harun, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.”       (Soorah Maryam 19:28)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">How did you get pregnant with this boy? Where did you get this boy from?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Verily this boy was a miracle from Allah the Exalted. Allah wanted for her to have this son, so an angel came to her. The angel informed her that Allah had sent him to her.</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">لِأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلَامًا زَكِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(To announce) to you the gift of a righteous son (Soorah Maryam 19:19)</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَتْ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لِي غُلَامٌ وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِي بَشَرٌ وَلَمْ أَكُ بَغِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">She said: “How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?” (Soorah Maryam 19:20)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">How can I have a son, I do not have a husband and I have not been unchaste nor committed fornication? So how can I have a son?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And it is from the way of Allah the Exalted that the child is not born except by two parents, between a husband and a wife, man and a woman. He (the angel) informed her that this is what Allah wanted.</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَتْ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَنِ مِنْكَ إِنْ كُنْتَ تَقِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">She said: “Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Beneficent (Allah) from you, if you do fear Allah.” (Soorah Maryam 19:18)</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَ إِنَّمَا أَنَا رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لِأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلَامًا زَكِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(The angel) said: “I am only a Messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son.” (Soorah Maryam 19:19)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah commanded him (the angel) to blow into the sleeve of her outer garment. Allah the Exalted commanded the angel Jibreel to blow (into the sleeve of her outer garment) the word ‘Be’. Thus Jibreel came with a command from Allah. Thus Jibreel blew the word ‘Be’ that Allah had sent him with (into the sleeve of her outer garment) and thus Maryam became pregnant with Eesa (Jesus) may the best prayers and peace be upon her and our Prophet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And I remind you and I say to you, this affair is not strange. Because Allah created Adam peace be upon him, without a father or a mother, and we are all offspring of Adam, peace be upon him. This because Adam is the father of all mankind, except for those who follow the Darwin theory of evolution, so if they are not the children of Adam then they are the offspring of monkeys. But as for us, then we are the offspring of Adam; the one who Allah created with His Hands. And Allah breathed a soul into him. And Allah caused him to live in paradise, and Allah created from his rib Hawwa (Eve). After He entered them into paradise He forbade them to eat from the tree. When they ate from the tree He expelled them down to the earth. Thus this has been the linage since Allah created Adam and Hawwa up until this day of ours, and until Allah inherits the earth and all those upon it.</span></p>
