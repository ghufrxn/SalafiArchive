<div class="entry-content">
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Reference</strong>: Ahl al-Hadeeth Newspaper, Published in Amritsar, India. Edition 18, December 1931</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">From Abdul-Azeez bin Abdur-Rahmaan al-Faisal Aal as-Sa’ood to all our brothers of Ahl al-Hadeeth – May Allaah (the Most High) preserve them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">May peace be upon you, the mercy of Allaah and His blessings. Thereafter:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Indeed I praise Allaah, besides whom there is no deity truly worthy of worship except Him; I supplicate for peace and blessings upon the best of His Prophets and I ask Allaah (the Most High) – for us and yourselves – guidance to all that He loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You all know – may Allaah preserve you – that to cooperate upon enjoining the truth and being patient is from the characteristics of the believers. You also know that Allaah (may He be glorified) described the believers as being merciful towards each other. Our emphasis therefore, on trying to unite your ranks is in order to raise the status of Tawheed all over the world, and this is the reason compelling us to write to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Indeed it hurts us that we see your Jamaa’ah suffering from any loss of vigour or weakness, just as it pains us when you are harmed by any affliction for whatever reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">After following the news of your affairs, we have realised how the other sects have become united and organised in order to defend their interests, and yet you are not concerned with becoming united in order to preserve the status of your Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I therefore call upon you to unite your ranks, for the sake of Allaah. I also call upon the people of authority amongst you to become one and work together in order to spread Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">[You must be] patient and diligent in this regard; in the path that Allaah will reward greatly, by which much good will be established both in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When other people become united and yet your unity is dispersed, weakness will occur among your ranks and the status of your Jamaa’ah will be lost. We hope that this does not occur between you.I ask Allaah – for you – guidance to all that raises His status and is pleasing to His noble Face.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="post_message_257561" style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Question</strong> :</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is the correct methodology for advising, particularly with regard to advising the rulers? Is it by publicising their evil actions from their evil actions from the mimbars or by advising them in private? I would like to know what the correct methodology is concerning this matter?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Infallibility is not for anyone except Allaah’s Messenger . Rulers are humans and they make errors. So no doubt they have errors and mistakes, as they are not infallible. But do not make their errors a reason for you to publicise them and remove yourself from obeying them, even if they may be oppressive and unjust  ,and even if they may be sinful, so long as they do not commit clear disbelief. This is that the Prophet commanded us.</span></p>

<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6">

<tr>
<td style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah with respect to the Muslim ruler. The author of Al-‘Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah said:“And we do not hold it permissible to rebel against our Imaams and our leaders, even if they may be oppressive. Nor do we supplicate against them or remove ourselves from obedience to them. And we hold that obeying them is part of obeying Allaah and hence an obligation so long as they do not order (us) commit sins. We supplicate to Allaah for them that He grant them rectification and pardon.”This is the same belief that the callers to truth are upon to this very day. These same words and those that bear a similar meaning to it were constantly repeated by our teacher, Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him, in his classes and lectures.</span></td>

<td style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is referring to the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah bin as-Saamit (radhiyAllaahu anh) in which he said:“The Prophet summoned us and so we gave him the oath of allegiance that we would hear and obey (the leader) in matters that we liked and matters that we disliked and in things that were hard upon us and things that were easy upon us, and (that we would give him) preference over ourselves. And that we would not oppose the authority of the leader unless we notice him having open disbelief, for which you would have a clear proof from Allaah against him.”(Fath-ul-Baaree: 13/5)</span></td>

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad added to this in his narration:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“And if you believe that you have some justification in the matter (i.e. of rebelling), do no act upon this suspicion. Rather, just hear and obey until it reaches you, without removing yourself from the obedience.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And there is further addition in the report of Ibn Hibbaan and Ahmad:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“…even if they take your wealth and beat your back.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Fath-ul-Baaree: 13/8)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And if they have sins and commit oppression and injustice, then indeed having patience while obeying them  keeps the unity, maintains unification of the Muslims, and protects the lands of the Muslims. Furthermore, there are great evils that result from in opposing them and seceding from them, which are greater than the evils that (may) come from them. So there will occur greater evil –</span></p>

<td style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh, may Allaah preserve him, is referring to the hadeeth of the Ibn ‘Abbaas (radhiyAllaahu anh) in which he narrated that the Prophet said:“Whoever sees in his leader something that he dislikes, then let him be patient with it, for indeed, whoever splits away from the Jamaa’ah (unified group) even an inch, and then dies, he does not die except the death of some in the Days of Ignorance.”(Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (7054); See Fath-ul-Baaree (13/5))And he is also referring to the hadeeth of Anas bin Maalik (radhiyAllaahu anh) in which the Prophet said:“You will indeed see things after me that you will disapprove of.”</span><span style="color: #000000;">So they said:“What do you order us to do with them, O Messenger of Allaah?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He replied:“Give them (i.e. the leaders) their rights and ask Allaah for your rights.”</span></p>

These demonstrations are from the practices of the disbelievers , and not from the Muslims. And it is not part of the Religion in any way.

We are not saying that one should remain silent at the errors that come out from the rulers. No, rather they should be corrected. But they must be corrected in a pure way, by advising them privately, and writing to them in private. By writing to them, we don’t mean that which is written down, passed through the hands of a group of individuals and then spread amongst the people. This is not permissible. Rather, a confidential letter, should be written, in which there is advice –</span></p>

<tr>
<td style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">(This is the methodology of the Salaf with regard to advising the rulers – that it be private and concealed so that there is no room for self-amazement (riyaa) to enter. And in these circumstances, it is much more likely that they (i.e. the leaders) will accept the advice and that Allaah will accept the (good) deed. We will mention some of the texts and narrations regarding this later.)</span></td>

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">,and handed over to the ruler or read to him orally. As for a letter that is written, then photocopied, then distributed to the people, then this act is not permissible because it is publicising (his errors), and it is just like speaking against him from the mimbar. In fact, it is worse because it is possible for a person to forget a speech, but as for a written letter, it remains and passes through hands. So this is not from the truth. The Prophet said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“The Religion is sincerity (advice). The Religion is sincerity (advice). The Religion is sincerity (advice).”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">We said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“To who, O Messenger of Allah?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“To Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Reported by Muslim (55))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in the hadeeth, it states:</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">“Verily Allaah is pleased with three things for you and He is displeased with three things for you. He is pleased that you (1) worship Him and not associate anything (in worship) with Him; and that (2) you hold tight onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together, and not be divided, and that (3) you mutually advise he whom Allaah gives authority of your affairs.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Saheeh: An authentic hadeeth reported by Ahmad (2/367) and Maalik in Al-Muwatta (2/756) with the verification of ‘Abdul-Baaqee.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people most fitting and qualified to advise the rulers are the scholars, the members of legal and consultative decisions, and those responsible for making decisions and problem-solving. Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people). But if Only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority amongst them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly).And had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allaâh upon you, You would have followed Shaitân (Satan), except for a few (from you).</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah an-Nisaa: 83)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So not everybody is fit to do this. And disseminating and publicising their errors is not from advising at all. Rather, it is from spreading evil and wickedness amongst those who believe. And it is not from the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih, even if the intention of the one who does it may be good and pure, such as for the sake of forbidding an evil, according to his view. However, what he did is a greater evil than that which he is forbidding. Therefore, forbidding an evil may be evil in itself if it is done in a way other than what Allaah and His Messenger have legislated.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Quote:</span></div>
<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said:“Gentleness is a way towards commanding good and forbidding evil. This is why it is said: “Let your commanding of good be good, and your forbidding of evil not evil.”And since commanding good and forbidding evil are from the greatest of obligatory and recommended acts, the benefit derived from it must always outweigh the evil… Rather, everything that Allaah commanded us with is in fact good. Allaah has praised good and the doers of good, and He has condemned evil and the doers of evil in many places (of the Qur’aan). So in the case where commanding good and forbidding evil will only bring about greater corruption, it is something that Allaah has not commanded, even if it results in a person abandoning an obligation and committing a prohibition, since the believer is only required to fear Allaah with regard to Allaah’s servants, and it is not upon him to guide.”(Al-Amr bil-Ma’roof wan-Nahee ‘anil-Munkar (pg. 19)This is since this person has not followed the legislated way of the Prophet, which he described when he said:“Whoever amongst you sees an evil, then let him change it with his hand. But if he is not able to, then with his tongue. And if he is not able to, then with his heart, and this is the weakest of Faith.”</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Reported by Muslim (49))</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p id="post_message_257561" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Allaah’s Messenger divided people into three categories: Amongst them is he who able is able to terminate the evil with his hand, and he is the one in authority, such as the ruler and those entrusted with authority, such as committees, governors and leaders. The second type is the scholar who because he has no authority, forbids (evil) by explaining and advising with wisdom and fair admonition, and by advising those in authority in a wise manner. The third category consists of those who have no knowledge or authority. They should forbid the evil with their hearts, by hating it and by hating and withdrawing away from those who do it.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Advising and clarifying is from the basic concepts of Islaam. It is this as well as other such everyday concepts that give this beautiful way of life superiority and manifestation over and above other religions.<span id="more-1920"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As Muslims we should always advise and attempt to rectify the affairs of the Muslims even if they dislike this or they consider you to be from amongst the armchair critics. The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) emphasised such commands in numerous ahadeeth along with the great rewards they carry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah the most high says, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful.” (Soorah Ale-Imraan:104)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Command the good and forbid the evil before you supplicate so that it is answered.”</em> (Ibn Maajah 2/381 no.4052, Imaam al-Albaanee graded the Hadeeth Hasan in Saheeh Ibn Maajah 2/367 no.3235, Imaam Ibn Hibbaan has also transmitted a similar narration. (Mawaarid az-Zamaan Ilaa Zawaa’id Ibn Hibbaan 1/455-446 no.1841)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said in a sermon,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Verily, fear of people should not stop a man from speaking out the truth that he knows.”Upon hearing this, Abu Sai’d wept and said: “By Allaah, we have seen things (for which we should have spoken out the truth) but we were silenced by fear (of people). <span style="color: #000000;">In another narration in Musnad Ahmad there is an addition “It does not bring death nearer nor pushes earnings farther to speak the truth or remind a powerful man of it.” </span></em>(Tirmidhee, Ibn Maajah, al-Fath ar-Rabbaanee Li-Tarteeb Musnad al-Imaam Ahmad from the book of commanding the good and forbidding the evil (19/174). Imaam Ibn Hibbaan has also transmitted a narration with a similar wording (Mawaarid az-Zamaan Ilaa Zawaa’id Ibn Hibbaan 1/456 no.1842). Haafidh Haithamee has also transmitted it and said, “transmitted Abu Ya’ala and it’s narrators are narrators of the Saheeh.” (Majma’a az-Zawaa’id Wa Mamba’a al-Fawaa’id 7/273). Shaikh Ahmad al-Banna said, “Abu Ya’ala has transmitted it in his Musnad, Tabaraanee in his Mu’ajam al-Kabeer, Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh and Baihaqee in his Sunan and it’s chain is Hasan. (Buloogh al-Amaanee Min Astaraar al-Fath ar-Rabbaanee 19/174)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Sa’eed al-Khudree (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) reported the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whoever amongst you sees anything evil let him change it with his hand, if he is not able, then with his tongue, and if he is not even able to do so, then with his heart, and the latter is the weakest form of eemaan.”</em> (Saheeh Muslim and Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan 1/69 no.78)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus what will these people say to the following verse of the Quraan and in this instance we are referring to those who have a problem with not willingly accepting constructive criticism or aspects of clarification</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience.” (Soorah al-Asr:3)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore it is imperative as indicated from the essential core teachings and etiquettes of Islaam that we contemplate and check our intentions and actions. Secondary to this, some integral parts of Islaam are ordained and we have been commanded to advise our fellow Muslims with or without their consent. Another essential pillar of Islaam is commanding the good and forbidding the evil and again this command is for all of the Muslims to practise and to observe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of the basic teachings of Islaam and some of the superior elements of Islaam, why is it when people are advised and issues are clarified it is assumed to be mischievous or troublesome. Why is any advice or clarification heavy on the minds and hearts of the people that terms such as armchair critics are coined and deduced. As Muslims we need to be understanding and adopt an ideology of accepting the truth wherever it comes from without arrogance or pride.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Commanding the good and forbidding the evil is from the major aspects that are obligatory and recommended.”</em> (al-Amr Bil-Ma’aroof Wa Nahya Anil Munkar pg.17)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Nawawee said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><em><span style="color: #000080;">“The scholars said and may Allaah be pleased with them all, the responsibility of commanding the good and forbidding the evil is not relieved from an individual who is required to fulfil this, just because he thinks there may be no benefit. On the contrary the obligation to fulfil this command is even more important because reminders benefit the believers. We have also mentioned previously commanding the good and forbidding the evil is obligatory but getting the people to accept this is not obligatory as Allaah said, Upon the Messenger is to convey.”</span></em><span style="color: #000080;"> (Sharh Saheeh Muslim 2/22-23).</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this is the reason why the Muslims in their respective masjids advise their administrators.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Can An Average Person Advise, Clarify &amp; Command The Good?</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><br />
</strong>Those who have assumed leadership positions over their communities by the way of Imaams, community leaders, masjid committees and or institutes have shunned those who have attempted to advise them or spoke about points that needed clarification. Instead of pondering or being humble and acknowledging these points, they have abused their positions and labelled them as arm chair critics or inferior to them. They also say advising and clarifying is not the position of the normal people as they dont even know the basics of Islaam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This notion my dear Muslims is false and wreaks of the understanding of the people of the false religions. Firstly this notion abolishes the great obligation of commanding the good and forbidding the evil. Secondly it opposes the understanding of the Salaf and the Scholars of Islaam. The normal average people, like the most of us can criticise under the concept of advising and commanding the good and reprimanding the evil, this should be understood as constructive criticism and advice for the greater benefit of the Muslim Ummah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Abu Bakr al-Jassaas said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Similarly the person who is not able to fulfil all of the righteous deeds or if they not able to refrain from all of the bad deeds, in-spite all of this the obligation of commanding the good and forbidding the evil does not diminish from him.”</em> (Ahkaam al-Quraan 2/33)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Nawawee said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“The scholars have said it is not necessary for the one who commands the good and forbids the evil that he has to have reached the level of being complete in his affairs (ie attained a lot of knowledge), rather commanding the good is obligatory upon him even though he is not from amongst those who fulfils it completely himself. Similarly prohibiting the evil is also obligatory upon him even though he maybe committing it himself. So in essence 2 things are obligatory upon him, the first that he commands his self to do righteous deeds and abstain from the evil ones and secondly he command others with good deeds and forbid the evil ones. So if he falls short in establishing one obligation how is it permissible that he falls short in the other one.”</em> (Sharh Saheeh Muslim 2/23)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same understanding has been mentioned by the following explainers of the Quraan ie Raazee in Tafseer al-Kabeer 3/47, Baidhaawee in his Tafseer 1/150, Abu Sa’ood in his Tafseer 1/97 and in Tafseer Siraaj al-Muneer 1/55).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The non arm chair critics may argue and say the one who commands good and forbids the evil with respect to his advising and criticising must also himself be upon this ie not commit the evil and being doing the same good. Then the answer to this is that you will find no one in this category and no one will ever be carrying out this great obligation and it will remain unpractised.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Sa’eed ibn Jubair may Allaah have mercy upon him said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“If a person does not command the good or forbid the evil (with regards to advising, engaging in constructive criticism) until nothing remains of them (of them in him ie he does all good deeds and no bad deeds) then no individual will ever be able to advise the good or forbid the evil.”</em> (Tafseer Qurtubee 1/367-368)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Maalik may Allaah have mercy upon him, commented on the above statement of Sa’eed and said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“He has spoken the truth, who is there who has nothing in him (by the way of bad deeds)”</em> (Tafseer Qurtubee 1/368)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Hasan al-Basree said to Mutarraf bin Abdullaah, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Advise your companions!” Mutarraf replied, “I am scared to say something to them that I do not practise myself.” Imaam Hasan al-Basree replied, “May Allaah have mercy on you, who is there amongst us who does exactly what he says? This is how shaytaan attains his objective so that no one commands the good or forbids the evil.”</em> (Tafseer Qurtubee 1/367).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Tabaree has elucidated this point further and said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“As for whoever said, “The persons who has no mistakes should be the one commanding the good.” If they mean by this that this is the best scenario then this is something good. If in the instance there is no one else to command the good then the door of commanding the good will be closed.”</em> (Fath ul-Baaree 13/53)</span></p>
