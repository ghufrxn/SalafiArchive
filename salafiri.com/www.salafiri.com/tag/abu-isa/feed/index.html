<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With the recent “Arab Spring” has given another group of dissident and fractioned individuals some power in their poor effort in disparaging the Madhab Ahlul Hadeeth, so much so that they think by misspelling the name it will give them some credibility in a shambled attempt to dissociate them from the true Ahlul Hadeeth. In reality these people have enough time to rant their toddler cries on so called “Ahlul Hadeeth forums” with their self formulated, desire based and individual unqualified opinions – the very same concept they think they are refuting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fact is these individuals are lost and confused due to following their own intellects and have in recent years unsuccessfully lashed out at the well known established madhab of Ahlul Hadeeth. It has not been long that they just left their shackles of blind following themselves and have realised, “Oh there is a difference of taqleed and taqleed Shakshi” which is is really a failed ploy to mislead the masses. More will be discussed about these free thinking individuals later as well as their modernistic madhabee approach, neither are we afraid to mention names, at this moment we ask let them address us directly and then watch this space “WHOEVER THEY ARE”<span id="more-2237"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such unwarranted relentless attacks on the Salafis and Ahlul Hadeeth have emanated from a number of individuals, some hiding behind organisations and forums and others promoting clear deviants. Some of the people do not have the slightest idea of what they are saying yet because it is an attack on the Salafis and the Ahlul Hadeeth. Some of these people due to their ignorance equate us to having a fight with the deobandis or barailwis based on difference, yet these very same people are accepting and accommodating of their beliefs. The ignorant people should shut up and cause less damage and iftiraaq in the Ummah based on their whims and desires, anyway</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some have been recently advocating the Salafis and Ahlul Hadeeth were dropping like flies in the subcontinent and the DEO-KATS were holding it down!!! If only people were honest and just to themselves. Furthermore the individual says this in a disparaging and censurable way and belittling the Salafis and Ahlul Hadeeth. He says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i1.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/img-20130902-wa000.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2145" src="https://i1.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/img-20130902-wa000.jpg?resize=350%2C220&#038;ssl=1" alt="IMG-20130902-WA000" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/abu-esa-statement-of-kufr.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2146" src="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/abu-esa-statement-of-kufr.jpg?resize=350%2C220&#038;ssl=1" alt="abu esa statement of kufr" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What does he mean by holding it down, well holding it down is performing Jihaad against the British Colonial Raj and the rest of them were dropping like flies!!! OK. Most of the readers who are well versed with the subcontinent history and its struggle are probably getting hysterical or just shocked due to the gravity of this erroneous statement and this is putting it mildly. Our response at this moment in time is not who was doing what as much has been writing about this and inshaAllaah we can highlight this at a later date.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We intend to show how these DEO-KATS were exactly holding it down and why their is this mad respect for the DEO-KATS. Firstly the stepbrothers of the DEO-KATS, the BAR-DOGS (Barailwi) (We apologise for using the word dog as some people might find this offensive and we apologise again but the fact is the barailwis call themselves the dogs of Madeenah and the dogs of “Gauth-Pak or Gauth-Azam” ie of Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee). The Sufis, their ardent adherents and the anti wahhabis have been having mango kulfis for years as early as 1872 see here&gt;&gt;&gt;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2013/05/28/the-wahabis-zainee-dahlans-real-opinion-the-british/">https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2013/05/28/the-wahabis-zainee-dahlans-real-opinion-the-british/</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lets have a look what the Deobandis (WHO ARE CLEAR SOOFEES) were doing, whether they were having mango kulfis with the British Colonial Raj or holding it down,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>MADRASSAH DAR UL-ULOOM DEOBAND</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ayub Qadiri in his biographical note on Maulana Muhammad Ahsan Nanotvi writes an account of a British spy and his time at Madrassah Deoband. The Deobandis have sugar coated it in the following way <strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.deoband.net/1/archives/12-2012/1.html">SEE HERE</a></strong> however the reality is a little different as can be seen below it says, the lieutenant Governor sent John Palmer as a spy to report on the activities of Madrassah Deoband, he reports,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“The efforts and activities that are being achieved (Is passive idle behavior against the British Raj) in the colleges by spending thousand of rupees on them is being done here out in pennies (figure of speech denoting almost next to nothing). The activities and efforts the Principal (of these colleges in pacifying the masses against revolt) is being paid thousand of rupees in monthly salary the moulvis here are doing for 40 rupees  a month as a salary, THIS MADRASSAH IS NOT AGAINST THE BRITISH RAJ BUT RATHER IT IS AGREEMENT, PRAISING AND IN A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BRITISH RAJ (GOVERNMENT)… then he goes onto say it is the best learning institute for any muslim and there can not be any better and even the non muslims should come and learn here…” (Maulana Muhammad Ahsan Nanotvi (pg.217), see also Fakhar al-Ulama (pg.60) of Sayyid Ishtiyaaq Azhar)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/anc.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2149" src="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/anc.jpg?resize=400%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="anc" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/ant.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2150" src="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/ant.jpg?resize=400%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="ant" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">so…. holding it down with 40 rupees and mango kulfis….hmmmm</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>MAULANA ASHRAF ALI THANWI ON 600 RUPEE DRINK MONEY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another deobandi Sufi Churchfather Ashraf Ali Thanwi, lets see how he was holding it down and not dropping like a mango kulfi !!! He says in his daily discourses,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“He said in a discourse that a person asked me how would you behave and work with the british if you had government? I (Ashraf Ali) replied, “I will govern them because since Allaah would have given me the government I will govern over them but with this we will look after them with ease and comfort because they have given me comfort (ie looked after me comfortably). This is also the teaching of Islam and the teachings of Islam can not be found in any of the world religions therefore this is divine teaching to the extent that even the rights of non muslims have been sanctified….etc.”</strong> <strong>(Malfoozat Hakeem al-Ummat (6/102 discourse no.87) (also known as al-Afadhaat al-Yaumiyyah Minal Afadaat al-Qawmiyyah)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i0.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/ayt.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2152" src="https://i0.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/ayt.jpg?resize=525%2C475&#038;ssl=1" alt="ayt" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">in another edition published from the “holding it down publishing house in Thana Bhawan” the hometown of the Mango Kulfi sellers, <strong>al-Afadhaat al-Yaumiyyah Minal Afadaat al-Qawmiyyah (6/79 discourse no.87)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/ayoc.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2153" src="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/ayoc.jpg?resize=400%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="ayoc" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i1.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/ayot.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2154" src="https://i1.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/ayot.jpg?resize=475%2C475&#038;ssl=1" alt="ayot" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It appears the British Colonial Government gave Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi comfort and kept in ease and comfort. On its apparent meaning this does not seem much and your probably thinking whats the point? Well lets move onto the next point which highlights what this comfort was,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This comfort was a monthly salary of 600 rupees from the British Colonial Government, yes meaning Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi was on the payroll. There was officially no verbal acceptance of this but it was well known amongst most quarters and especially the deobandis, who were presumably holding it down and not dropping!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>THE JAMIAT ULAMA HIND (JUI) </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the monthly journal of the Jamiat Ulama Hind and Jamait Ulama Islam (JUI), who were and still are a deobandi extension on the political front known as Makalamah as-Sadrain published from Deoband, they say,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Look Hazrat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi was our and your muslim elder and leader, the people have been heard saying about him that he would get paid 600 rupees a month from the (British) Government. With this they would also say the Maulana was unaware the government was giving him the money but the government would give him the money in such a way that he would not suspect anything.” (Makalamah as-Sadrain pg.9)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/src.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2155" src="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/src.jpg?resize=450%2C550&#038;ssl=1" alt="src" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/sr3.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2156" src="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/sr3.jpg?resize=500%2C650&#038;ssl=1" alt="sr3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Makalamah as-Sadrain (pg.9)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So now we know where the money was coming from for the mango kulfis and why, how and WHAT the deobandis were holding down.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Jamiat Ulama Hind (JUI) known current as Jamiat Ulama India who over decades have been unleashing all kinds poison and venomous against the Ahlul Hadeeth and Salafis in every possible manner and even organised international conferences in England against the Salafis. For example the current Ustadh of Hadeeth in Dar al-Uloom Deoband is Sayyid Arshad Madani (Son of  Hussain Ahmad Madani Deobandi, a founding father) who is also the President of Jamiat Ulama Hind. They openly admit that they too were on the payroll of the British Government. Reading the following passage from the Makalamah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/srt1.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2157" src="https://i2.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/srt1.jpg?resize=525%2C675&#038;ssl=1" alt="srt1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Makalamah as-Sadrain (pg.7)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>JAMAAT UT-TABLEEGH ON THE BRITISH COLONIAL PAYROLL</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Makalamah Sadrain journal goes onto mention even the leader of Jamaat ut-Tableegh ie Maulana Ilyas Khandelvi was also getting money from the British government via Haji Rashid Ahmed which was later stopped. The passage also goes on to say a hindu gained an administrative position within the British Colonial Raj and thereafter informed the government the money being spent on these sufi deobandis and tableeghis was useless and wasteful. (Probably because they were sitting and having mango kulfis with the Raj imperialists in agreement)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i1.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/sr2.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2159" src="https://i1.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/sr2.jpg?resize=425%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="sr2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Makalmah as-Sadrain (pg.8)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>MAULANA QASIM NANOTWI AND MAULANA MUHAMMAD TAYYIB</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maulana Sayyid Manazir Ahsan Ghilani authored a 3 volume biography of Maulana Qasim Nanotvi upon the instructions and request of Maulana Muhammad Tayyab, who was rector of Madrassah Dar al-Uloom Deoband during his time. In one part of the second volume Maulana Muhammad Tayyab adds a note which does not necessarily apply to Maulana Qasim Nanotvi but rather to the Deobandi elders!!! He says,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“He had no interest even in the affairs of the city and this was also the affair of the individuals who were old employees and getting pensions from the government and hence they had no reason to doubts them at all (with regards to their loyalty).” (Sawaaneh Qasimi (2/247)</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maulana Ashiq Ilahi Meerthy (A well known, recognised deobandi authority) in his biography of Maulana Rasheed Ahmed Gangohi says about the British Colonial Raj, presenting Maulana Gangohis opinion on the Mango Kulfi sellers, </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maulana Ashiq Ilahi Meerthy writes about Maulana Qasim Nanotvi,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Just as you people were well wishers from your heart for your compassionate government and may this compassion remain forever.”</strong> <strong>(Tazkiratul Rasheed (1/79)</strong> (the incident below also mentions when they allegedly came to arrest Maulana Qasim Nanotvi (hmmm right) they asked where is Moulvi Muhammad Qasim was? So he took a step forward and looked at his foot behind (and then whilst intending to lift it) he said, “He was just here” and then carried on walking!!! This is how brave they were and how they were HOLDING IT DOWN, he could not even speak the truth</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the British Colonial Government because apprehensive and vigilant with regards to the revolts post 1857 they kept a close eye on everyone and in this regard they went looking for Maulana Rasheed Ahmed Gangohi to question him. So Maulana Rasheed Ahmed Gangohi wrote,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“When in reality I have been obedient to the government, the false accusation (of revolt,opposition or disloyalty) will not harm me at all and even if I was to be executed, the government is the master and can do what it likes.”(Tazkiratul Rasheed (1/80)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i1.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/t3.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2173" src="https://i1.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/t3.jpg?resize=525%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="t3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furtheremore Tazkiratul Rasheed is riddled with the idea of waging Jihad against the renegades, those who were revolting against the British Government, to the extent they even said the one fighting the renegades and those revolting in favour of the British Government will die as martyrs. There is further reference to Maulana Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi and his spiritual guide Hafiz Zamin fighting with these renegades and those who were actually Holding it down!!! (Tazkiratul Rasheed (1/74-75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Moving on, the scavenging deceptive Deo-Kats have always had a close loving relationship with the colonial British Raj. In the 1912, then the viceroy of British India was Charles Hardinge who was attacked by a group of Hindu revolutionaries who threw a home made bomb at him in New Delhi. The viceroy was injured but escaped with flesh wounds. The Deobandi scholars issued the following statement in their monthly journal, the editor was Habeeb ur Rehmaan but what he says is utterly shocking and this shows the reality of the Deo-Kats having mango kulfis and how they were holding it down,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“An Attack on HIS EXCELLENCY THE VICEROY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(after some waffle……..  unfortunately with the progression of western education in India, bomb (making and or throwing) is also progressing. A number of incidents have occurred in the last few years but the one most worthy to be hated from them all and the one that disturbed the peace was the tragedy in which HIS EXCELLENCY Lord Hardinge, such a compassionate and merciful viceroy(!!!) was injured when an unknown assailant threw a bomb at him when he was making his imperial entrance into Delhi (whilst changing the capital of the British rule from Kolkatta to Delhi) on the 23rd Decenber 1912 (Which was the first day of the new era of India). HIS EXCELLENCY VICEROY was severely injured.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Shura, the teachers, the current students and the old students (ie Jamiat Ulama Hind [India]) of Dar al-Uloom (deoband) all feel the affect of this tragedy. Maulana Muhammad Ahmed (the son of Maulana Qasim Nanotvi) the rector (in charge) of Dar al-Uloom Deoband has on behalf of all of the friends has expressed his sympathy and his anger and hate for such an act. Which was answered with great thanks (by the british government)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>All Praise be to Allaah that HIS EXCELLENCY VICEROY’s life was not harmed and Lady Hardinge was also safe and with the blessing of Allaah the Most High the health of the respected Viceroy is improving on a daily basis. We hope very near HIS EXCELLENCY opens his council in Delhi.” (al-Qasim vol.3 issue 6, 1331 Muharram, the title page even says printed from Madrassah Deoband!!!)</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So i bet now silence, the cat got the Deo-Kats tongue. Making bold statements and feebly attempting to attack the salafis and the Ahlul Hadeeth. So tell us who was having mango kulfis and not holding it down at all!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore when there were</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">internal politics in Dar al-Uloom Deoband and with another modern hanafi educational institute (set up and promoted by the colonial British Empirial Raj) ie Aligarh. 2 well known and prominent deobandi hanafi scholars, namely Maulana Mahmood al-Hasan (the first student of Deoband) and Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi attempted to create an atmosphere of unity between the two whilst both institutes were building up fervour against the british. However the leaders of Deoband and Aligarh were not in favour of this and did not want to upset the government. Hafiz Muhammad Ahmad who was the rector of Deoband (and the son of Maulana Qasim Nanotvi) had already accepted a title of recognition from the British.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is said he would keep the British government rule in Uttar Pradesh (northen India) happy and would also inform them of the activities of Maulana Mahmood al-Hasan (who was getting a little rebellious and bare in mind he was the only one and there was also a reason behind this). He would have good relations with the governor of the area and would often inform them of their activities with the aim of saving Dar al-Uloom from British reprimand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This relationship is further presented when the Governor of U.P. was invited to Deoband and words of praise were presented for him which included the following,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Thanking his honour and the ruler of India, his excellency the viceroy for the title given to Maulana Muhammad Ahmad as being the Light of the Ulama (Shams al-Ulama) their sincere heartly thanks. The action of the government does not only establish that they respect the muslims leaders and guides who are worthy of it but it also answers the objection of the claimants of independence (from the british) that honour and dignity is given to those worthy of it. It is correct and we accept this reality that it is not our natural inclination to gain materialistic or worldly gains nor a part of of our religious obligation. However due to the will of Allaah if our current rulers and government give us any honour or dignity then why should we not accept it…… </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(some waffle) Your Honour today we have gathered here for a special thanking of (your) benevolence and favour not only on the rector but on all of the group and similarly we have in front of us your favours and (Financial) courtesy on the Dar al-Uloom Deoband which the rector (ie Hafidh Muhammad Ahmed  – Son of Maulana Qasim Nanotvi) tells us about regularly. Similarly due to these favourable terms the muslim public will trust on Dar al-Uloom Deoband and our policy will be strengthened which major (army) officers of europe have been praising us about. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>We only have one intentions and only one intention alone and that is the preservation of religious freedom (hmmmm) and nothing but just the preservation of religious freedom. Therefore anything outside this ie rejecting any political movement or accepting it is out of our established unchangeable ideology.” (Refer to Rasheed Ahmed Jalandhari’s journal al-Ma’arif Lahore 1996 Jul-Dec, pg.71-73, also Rasheed Ahmed Jalandhari’s The Teaching Curriculum in British India – Dar al-Uloom Deoband (1/247-248) Islamabad 1989  Edn. National Book Foundation, also The Indian Muslims – A Historical Record (5/51-54) of Shaan Muhammad, also ‘The Expulsion of Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi from Dar al-Uloom Deoband’ in the al-Wali Journal (Vol.15 issue 2 &amp; 3 (pgs.30-32) 1991) by Abu Salmaan Shah Jahanpuri)   </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such words show you the close connection and link between the British and the Deobandi School of Thought. Maulana Sayyid Asad Madani the son of Maulana Hussain Ahmed also says Maulana Mahmood al-Hasan was carelessly inviting the danger of the British government.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dr Barbara Daly Metcalf writes in her book as follows about Rashid Ahmad Gangohi and the Deobandis:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“The Deobandis made sure that they conformed in every way to a posture of loyalty. Rashid Ahmad, for this reason, refused to accept a grant of 5000 Rupees a year from the Shah of Afghanistan for fear that a political link might be suspected. And the school celebrated ceremonial occasions like coronations with appropriate pomp, and observed times of crises, like Queen Victoria’s last illness, with fitting prayers and messages.”</strong> <strong>(<i>Islamic Revival in British India, 1860-1900</i>, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1982) (pages 154-155)</strong></span></p>
