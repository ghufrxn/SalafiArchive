				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated by</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
[Translated in 2001, but published for the first time now]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Anas RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Straighten your rows as straightening the rows is part of establishing of the prayer.” </em>(Sahih al-Bukhari no.723).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The wording of the hadith through another chain of transmission is,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Straighten your rows, as the straightening of rows is from perfecting the prayer”</em> (Sahih Muslim no.124/433, Abu Dawud no.688, Ibn Majah no. 993, Musnad Abu Awanah 2/38, Sunan ad-Darimi no.1266, Musnad Ahmad 3/177, 253, 273, 279, 291).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We learn from this hadith straightening the rows is from establishing and the completion of the prayer. This would mean uneven rows or rows that are not straight would lead to deficiency of the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“</em><em>Straighten the rows in the prayer, as the straightening of the rows is from the perfection of the prayer.”</em> (Sahih al-Bukhari no. 723, Abdur-Razzaq no.2424).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu also narrates Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Perfect the straightening of the rows in prayer.”</em> (Musnad Ahmad 2/485). The narrators of this hadith are of the Sahihayn. Allaamah al-Albani graded it authentic (Sahih at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib 1/271 no.496, Sahih Ibn Hibban, Mawarid no.384, Majma’ az-Zawa’id 2/92).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We learn from these hadith straightening the rows is from perfecting and beautifying the prayer and this is what Allah’s Messenger ﷺ ordered. If the rows are not straight, it will lead to deficiency in the prayer. The straightening of the rows applies when standing and when in ruku and it is obligatory. In fact Allah’s Messenger ﷺ would first perfect the straightening of the rows and then commence the prayer. If the rows were not straight he would straighten them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Nu’man b. Bashir RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“The Messenger of Allah </em><em>ﷺ used to straighten the rows until he made them like a spear or an arrow. Once he saw a man’s chest (sticking out) so Allah’s Messenger </em><em>ﷺ said, make your rows straight or Allah will create division among you.”</em> (Ibn Majah no.994, Abu Dawud no.663, Sahih Muslim no.128/436, Sahih al-Bukhari no.717 summarised)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Bara b. A’zib RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Allah’s Messenger ﷺ used to pass through the row from one side to the other; he used to set out chests and shoulders in order, and say, and do not differ in case your hearts also differ.. And he would say: Allah and His angels bless those who are near the first rows.”</em> (Abu Dawud no.664, Nasa’i no.810, Ibn Majah no.997. Zawa’id Ibn Majah mentions the chain is authentic and its narrators are trustworthy).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We learn from these authentic hadith, the rows should be straightened before the prayer. We also learn another duty of the Imam is to straighten the rows and to correct any shortcomings. It is a shame the Imams nowadays do not dispense this duty and they begin the prayer as soon as the iqamah is announced.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Worshippers should stand in the rows ensuring their feet and shoulders touch the feet and shoulders of those praying next to them without any gaps between them. Allah’s Messenger ﷺ ordered to fil the gaps in the row.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abdullah Ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhum said The Prophet ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Straighten the rows, stand shoulder to shoulder, fill the gaps, be gentle in the hands of your brothers, and do not leave gaps for shaytan. If anyone connects a row, Allah will connect him, but if anyone breaks a row, Allah will cut him off.”</em> (Abu Dawud no.666, Nasa’i no. 818, summarised, al-Bayhaqi 3/101, Ibn Khuzaimah no.1549, Mustadrak al-Hakim 1/213. Iman Hakım and adh-Dhahabi authenticated it according to the conditions of Imam Muslim. Allamah Al-Albani authenticated it in Sahih Targhib wa’t Tarhib no. 492, Musnad Ahmad 2/98).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Mundhiri explained the word ‘Farjat’, <em>“It is the plural of farjah and it refers to the gap and space between two people.”</em> We learn from this hadith we should close the gaps in the rows and there should be no space of gap between two worshippers who are praying. The action of the people who leave a gap of four fingers or more is incorrect and they should rectify this.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Anas RadhiAllahu Anhu RadhiAllahu Anhu,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“I saw each of us joining our shoulder with the shoulder of our companion and our feet with their feet, but if you were to practice this today, a person would flee from you like a restless mule.”</em> (Ibn Abi Shaybah 3/308 no. 3524, Dar al-Taj, Beirut, Fath al-Bari 2/211, Umdah al-Qari 5/260).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Nu’man b. Bashir RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“The Messenger of Allah </em><em>ﷺ</em> <em>turned to the people and said three times; straighten your rows, by Allah, you must straighten your rows, or else Allah will create disagreement between your hearts. I saw each man join shoulder to shoulder with that of his companion, knee to knee with that of his companion, and ankle bone to ankle bone with that of his [companion]”.</em> (Abu Dawud no.662, Sahih al-Bukhari in note form, Musnad Ahmad 4/276, Ibn Hibban no.396, ad-Daraqutni 1/282-283, al-Bayhaqi 3/100-101).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Uthman an-Nahdi said</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>&#8220;I was from the people whose feet Umar RadhiAllahu Anhu hit in order to straighten the row”</em> (al-Muhalla of Ibn Hazm 4/58, Mawsu’ah Fiqh Umar b. al-Khattab, p.445, Ibn Abi Shaybah 1/30 no.3530, Fath al-Bari, 2/210).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Salih b. Kaysan narrates Abdullah b. Umar RadhiAllahu Anhum said</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s more beloved to me that two of my teeth break that I see a gap in the row and I don’t fill it.&#8221;</em> (Abdur-Razzaq 2/57 no.2473, Ibn Abi Shaybah 1/333, al-Muhalla 4/59).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So, we learn from these authentic hadith that we should straighten the rows before we start praying and to close any gaps in the row, and this is an obligation. Every worshipper should join shoulder to shoulder and feet to feet with his brother in a gentle way. The Imam should begin the prayer once the row is straight in the beginning. Similarly, the row should be not be straightened once in ruku but rather before when everyone stands to commence the prayer. Similarly, the complete feet should join and not just a one toe as the Companions did and no one should run like a restless mule. The worshippers who fill the gaps will receive reward from Allah. May Allah give us tawfiq to do righteous actions and save us from exaggeration and leniency. Amin  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled and Translated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>First published in leaflet form in 2000ce</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim. May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon his Final Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1.The authors brings a quote from Imam Tirmidhi on <span style="color: #000000;">page 83</span> of his book concerning Imam Tirmidhi’s opinion on where to place the hands in the salah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer:</strong> This is not proof unless it is sustained from the Quran or Authentic ahadith: it is only the opinion of the Imam. Authentic chains of narrations must be bought to prove the Imam’s point that sine if the Sahabah placed their hands below the navel. Until proof is brought this remains an opinion which can either be right or wrong and in this case it is wrong because no authentic chain exists to this effect. The burden of proof lies with the author of Salah of a believer: he has yet to produce any authentic narration. It is noteworthy that above the navel also means on the chest as most people chests are above their navels.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The author then brings three narrations from Ibn Abi Shaybah, the first from Wail ibn Hujr (RadhiAllahu Anhu) to the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the last two from Ali (RadhiAllahu Anhu) and Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu)</span></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author then admits that the hadith of Wail ibn Hujr (RadhiAllahu Anhu) is not in current printed edition of Ibn Abi Shaybah. The reason it is not in any printed copy is because Ibn Abi Shaybah did not originally put it in with this fabricated additional wording: ‘below the navel’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the fathers of deoband and greatly loved and adored (in most circumstances) Anwar Shah Kashmiri confirms in his book, ‘Faidh al-Bari Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari (2/26) that such a narration has no basis for its existence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh and Imam of the Sunnah, Badi ud din Shah ar-Rashidi as-Sindhi set a challenge in his lifetime to the Hanafis to produce one authentic narration on this topic and they could not even until the day he died. He wrote.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“as for the narration that is mentioned in Ibn Abi Shaybah, that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) placed his hands below his navel, then this narration does not even have a basis for its existence. All praise is due to Allah, we have both the original manuscripts and the printed edition of the book but neither  of them has this narration recorded within in. So the liars have been caught out.”</em></span> (The position of the hands in the Salah of the Prophet English edition <strong>page 17</strong>.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is note worthy that the Salafi Scholars are Ahlul Hadith and they have the original manuscripts of Ibn Abi Shaybah. So all of the claims on <strong>page 84</strong> of the Salah of the believer are only claims of the hanafis and nothing more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the narration from Ali (RadhiAllahu Anhu) and Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) then these are very weak because they contain the narrator Abdur Rahman bin Ishaq al-Kufi. As the Shaikh and Imam of the Sunnah Badi ud din Shah ar-Rashidi as-Sindhi writes, on <strong>page 15</strong> of his aforementioned book, <em><span style="color: #000080;">“To take any narration from him is haram.”</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">See <strong>page 15</strong> of Shaih Badi ud dins book and <strong>page 102</strong> of Shaikh Imam Muhammad Nasir ud din al-Albani’s book, ‘The Prophets Prayer Described’ for a full and detailed explanation of why narrations should not be taken from Abdur Rahman al-Kufi. If you are still unconvinced read it again.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for what Shaikh Ahmad Uthmani Thanwi Hanafi mentions (as recorded on <strong>page 85 and 86</strong> of Salah of the believer) about Abdur Rahman not being accused of lying, then no attention should be paid to that, as it is commonly known that Mawlana Ahmad Uthmani Thanwi Hanafi stretches things to fit his madhab. It is sufficient a refutation that Allamah Ibn Ajmi in his book <em>‘al-Kashf al-Hathith’</em> has mentioned Abdur Rahman under the categories of those who would fabricate hadith and no Muslims can rely on the narrations of such a man.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even the hanafi scholar Shaikh Zaila’i in his Nasb ur-Ra’yah (1/314) and Shaikh Abdul Hay Lucknowi in his Hashiyah Hidayah (2/102) quote Imam Nawawi that this narration is weak by consensus, likewise Shaikh Ibn Humam in his Fath ul-Qadir explanation of Hidayah (1/102) mentions the same.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Imam Tirmidhi making Abdur Rahmans narrations Hasan, then in light of the aforementioned, this needs no further clarification as this is Imam Tirmidhis opinion ans it has been superseded by the evidence that we have against Abdur Rahman al-Kufi al-Wasiti. We follow evidence not opinion and we are not blind followers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the action of Ali (RadhiAllahu Anhu) then he used to place his hands on his chest, as was the Sunnah of Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) (refer to Tarikh al-Kabir of Imam Bukhari)</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The narrations from Abul Mijlaz and Ibrahim Nakhai on <span style="color: #000000;">page 86 and 87</span> of Salah of the Believer and also the opinions of the four madhabs mentioned on <span style="color: #000000;">page 87 to page 89</span> of the same book</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Aside from the authenticity of this narrations you may act on them if you wish but we shall act on the Sunnah of the Final Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) as the actions of the aforementioned Imams were their opinions but what we shall act on came from Allah who revealed it to Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is one of the differences between the blind followers and the Salafi and Suuni from Ahlus Sunnah Wal-Jama’ah, where the latter act upon the proof where as the blind follower relies upon opinion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also note worthy that scholars from all four madhabs placed their hands on their chests in Salah. (Refer to The Prophets Prayer Described by Shaikh al-Albani and Positions of the hands in the Salah of the Prophet of Shaikh Badi ud din for further clarifications)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Ibn Qayyim then see his Kitab as-Salah (pg.87) he states that Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) would place his right hand upon his left elbow upon his chest.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">As for the authenticity of the narration for placing the hands on the chest in ‘Salah of the Believer’ from <span style="color: #000000;">pages 88 to 89</span> then:</span></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is as Imam of Hadith al-Albani stated in his book, ‘The Prophets Prayer Described on <strong>page 103,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“So there are three ahadith which show that the Sunnah is to place the hands on the chest, and one who comes across them will not doubt that together they are sufficient to prove this.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Shaikh Badi ud din mentions the Hanafi scholars, especially Amir Haj who is seen to be close in rank to his teacher Ibn Humam Hanafi. We can understand the following important points from these sayings:</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is authentically proven to place the hands on the chest in prayer.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is obligatory to follow this hadith.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ali (RadhiAllahu Anhu) has explained the part of the ayah, <em>‘Wanhar’</em> to mean placing the hands on the chest.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The verification of the action of Ali (RadhiAllahu Anhu) as mentioned in various narrations.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is also proven from the Quran to place the hands on the chest.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">There is no authentic narration stating the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) placed his hands below the in the prayer. Rather, All those narrations which are mentioned in this regard are weak and unacceptable.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our Hanafi brothers should learn a lesson from these statements and should abandon following a matter which is not proven from any authentic source but is merely speculative.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The challenge still stands. Bring one authentic hadith that Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) placed his hands below his navel in the prayer and we shall publicly give you one thousand pounds. Make sure you also present it with the chain of narration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Oh yes and furthermore, <strong><em>above the navel</em></strong> does not mean below the navel.</span></p>
