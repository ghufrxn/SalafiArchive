<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ḥibbān, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Rumaiṣah &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</span></strong></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993366;">[Taken from the introduction of the Forthcoming SRI Publication,</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"><em>With What Reasoning and Religion Can Bombings and Destruction Be Considered as Jihād?</em></span></strong> <span style="color: #993366;">– Shaykh ʿAbd al-Muḥsin b. Ḥamad al-ʿAbbād al-Badr and an overview of Jessica Stern &amp; J.M Berger&#8217;s</span>, <strong><span style="color: #000080;"><em>ISIS, The State of Terror</em></span></strong><span style="color: #993366;">]</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>ʿAudhu Billāhi min ash-shayṭān al-rajīm, Bismillāh al-Raḥmān al-Raḥīm. </em><em>Alḥamdullilāhi Rabbil ʿalamīn, waṣalatu wassalām ʿala Rasūlillahil karīm, wa ʿala alihī wa aṣḥābī wa man tabiʿahum bi-iḥsān ilāʾ yawm al-dīn</em>; wa baʿḍ. All Praise belongs and is directed to the <em>Rabb</em> of everything that exists, praise and salutations be upon His final beloved Messenger, Muḥammad Salallahu alayhi wasallam, his revered family and his noble Companions and upon all those who follow them in good, until the end of times, to proceed,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Modern writers have directed multifaceted attacks on Saudi Arabia by spreading a calculated smear campaign and all sorts of malicious allegations, ranging from; Saudi Arabia promotes terror and violence, it harbours extremists, sponsors militant Islam worldwide and is responsible for the global threat against humanity through radicalisation and terrorism. This is and are, indisputably shameless lies that only emanate due to a lack of knowledge and a deliberate concerted effort to malign Saudi Arabia and ultimately Salafiyyah, whereas the concise truth and reality could not be furthest from the truth in relation to these baseless allegations. Cdr Youseff H. Aboul-Enein writes:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Saudi Kingdom as a government has tamed Militant Islamists and settled back to Salafi Islamists trends, spreading its peculiar and intolerant brands of Islam through <em>dawa</em> and not violence.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This contradicts the views and claims of other writers, that Saudi Arabia promotes violence, this in of itself shows the fallacy of their arguments. Some writers have expanded on this discourse while explaining key facts associated with Saudi Arabia. They say Saudi Arabia is known to spread Salafism and according to the definition of Salafism, which I must add, is self concocted and a fabrication, in order to justify their narrative and an understanding that conforms to their falsehood. In reality, all such terms related to Salafism are false as there is only one type of Salafism. I am referring to terms like ‘Quietist Salafism,’ ‘Political Salafism’ and Jihadi Salafism,’<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> which, undoubtedly apart from minor fact of being conjured up to categorise modern trends, is outright erroneous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We can deliberate on this later, but when Jessica Stern; a research professor out of Boston University and who also served on the Clinton administrations National Security Council Staff and J.M Berger; a fellow with George Washington University’s programme on extremism, explained these terms,<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> whilst borrowing them from Quintan Wiktorowitz.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> According to their definition of ‘Quietist Salafism’ they say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The quietist faction is, in a sense, the strain of Salafism that has responded the least to the world events of the twentieth century. Individuals in this group understand their central project to be the purification of Islam and do not participate in politics.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Though there are quietists Salafis across the Muslim world, the center of gravity for this movement is the existing religious establishment in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is somewhat atypical for a country in the Muslim world, but the very things that make it unique have made is hospitable to the quietists.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On one hand, many like J. Stern and J.M. Berger, the example here; argue that Saudi Arabia has been an influential champion of Salafism, and we know from the first principles of Salafism; that it vehemently denounces, rejects, refutes and openly warns against terrorism, extremism and militancy. However, both writers, naively allude to:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It suggests, in a sense, that Saudi Arabia is responsible for movements such as ISIS because of the role that the Saudi Arabian government played in facilitating the spread of Salafism across the region.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As injudicious and untruthful as it sounds, which is undoubtedly the case, this diatribe would have been just ridiculed and brazenly dismissed as a very poor judgement of error, but to add insult to injury, they quote an article of Ed Hussain as evidence!<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> This article is a culmination of half truths and some rudimentary information, spun to give a repulsive intent; the authors quote it to suggest a colossal claim, this has but except caused them stern embarrassment. Furthermore, both writers have themselves defined Salafism as:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Salafism is a loosely organised movement within Sunni Islam…but there are core features to the movement. Salafism is call for a return to the beliefs, practises and sincerity of early Islam. In fact, the term “Salafism” is a direct reference to these early years, and refers to the first few generations of Muslims, known as the <em>salaf</em>. Salafis prefer the Islam of these early Muslims and believe that centuries of human interpretation – influenced by pre-existing religious traditions, cultural biases, political agendas and individual self-interests – have corrupted Islam and led to decline across the Muslim world.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, should it not be the case for anyone who <em>“suggests,”</em> that at the very least they look at the teaching, ideology and methodology of the Salaf, who the Salafis ascribe to, with regards to the modern trends and themes and labelling Salafism and thus Saudi Arabia being responsible for the terrorist group, ISIS?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is this not a huge leap over clear facts and perhaps total disregard for the truth while ignoring fundamentals precepts of Salafism. We find further contradictions in the understanding of these modern writers, and this is the case with most of them. They, Cdr Youseff H. Aboul-Enein argue that Saudi Arabia spread Islam through daʿwah and not violence, where as Stern and Berger argue Saudi Arabia exported their brand of Salafism which ultimately and by default led to the formation of ISIS and their activities. However, when have ISIS ever been at the forefront of giving daʿwah and in a non violent manner, in fact the total opposite. ISIS have killed Muslims openly, is this the daʿwah that is being referred to? These basic points are indeed sufficiently adequate to show the intelligent mind – the fallacy of these points suggested and hypothesized by these writers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some writers have focussed on the Wahhabīs as a movement and have also obviously projected a vivid view of the association between them and Salafism. Malise Ruthven labels the Wahhabīs as fundamentalists and asserts they formed close ideological ties with the Muslim Brotherhood from around circa 1960 to spread Wahhabī fundamentalism.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> This is also a gross error chronologically and also false because their ideology and the ideology of the Wahhabis and Salafis is poles apart, in doctrine and in methodology (<em>Manhaj</em>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even in recent times, when Saudi Arabia has continued its efforts in curbing radicalisation and fighting terrorism, ISIS continues its campaign of terror in the Kingdom and there have been at least Nine separate incidences of violence and terror attacks carried out with ISIS claiming responsibility. So much so that even the holy sanctuary of Madīnah and the Prophet H‘s mosque was not spared by these mindless terrorists, while the people were preparing to pray and break their fast in the Holy month of Ramaḍhān.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Saudi Arabia has seen terrorism and violence in its Kingdom prior to 9/11, from around 2000, with an increase in the violent terrorist attacks year by year, with the most recent being July 2018. Does a country subject its citizens and its visitors, who are protected and under the safety of the sovereign state; to violent terrorism, suicide bombings, destruction of property and life, indiscriminate senseless killings? Of course not! Then how do these modern writers, without any regard for the truth and respect for the dead, hurl baseless and false allegations at Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism and Salafism for the spread of violent terrorism. Foreign secret services although implicated, were surprising cleared by the police of their country, very conveniently of any involvement, but the allegations of foreign involvement in destabilising Saudi Arabia with a relentless campaign of terror are very much still on the table.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This short treatise of the Saudi Arabian Salafī scholar, Shaykh ʿAbd al-Muḥsin b. Ḥamad al-ʿAbbād al-Badr is a repudiation of the people whose ideology is to cause corruption and chaos throughout the lands. They cause destruction and devastation physically; to life and property as well as emotional and psychological trauma to all those affected by their reckless killing, suicide bombings and indiscriminate killing under the satanic principle of ‘collateral damage’. In current times various groups and organisations have arisen, whose intent is to kill innocent civilians, Muslims and non-Muslim, the elderly, women and children. Such heinous crimes are severely reprimanded in Islam and they also oppose its pristine teachings based on divine scriptures. These wicked and evil people distort and manipulate the scriptural texts, so that they conform to their whims and desires.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treatise, <em>‘</em><em>With What Reasoning and Religion Can Bombings and Destruction Be Considered as Jiḥād?’</em> of Shaykh ʿAbd al-Muḥsin addresses the important issues of killing innocent people, suicide bombings and senseless destruction, which was authored after the Riyadh bombings in 2003. This treatise also clarifies the Salafist view on the unlawfulness of suicide bombings, violent terror, the killing of innocent people and the sanctity of human life, which the Salafis have always advocated. Let this treatise also serve as a reminder to the detractors, who exert considerable effort to discredit the teachings of Salafiyyah, which is free from the so called brands of Salafism. We pray that individuals affected with the ideas of the Khawārij and extremists, benefit from this treatise while reading it with an open and sincere mind.  </span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Taken from: <strong><span style="color: #000080;">al-Barelwiyyah; Their History and Beliefs Volume 2, <em>Expounding The Belief of the Pious Ancestors and Ahl al-Sunnah w’al Jama’ah</em><em> </em><em>&amp; </em><em>What Opposes it from the Wicked Deviation of the Barelwi Renegades</em></span></strong></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Historical Overview &#8211; Sufi Barelwi Renegades &amp; Their Origins in Extreme Terror and Kharijism; The Barelwi Ancestry and Lineage</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We begin by looking at the Barelwi Ash’arite and Sufi Churchfathers and their affect on the muslim society. It is common knowledge and a specific and particular hallmark of the Barelwi underlings and global sufi sympathisers that the Saudi Wahabis are government funded, they rebel and murder people, Khawarij and all sorts of fallacious delusional points.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will show how the Barelwi forefathers were themselves upon the methodology of killing innocent Muslims and how they colluded against the Muslims. We will also show how some of them were renegades themselves,  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the lineage of Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Naqi Ali Khan son of</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’adat Yar Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’idullah Khan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Zafar al-Din Qadri Bihari, <em>Hayat A’la Hazrat</em>, (Karachi: Maqtabah Rizviyya, 1:2 Muhammad Sabir al-Qadiri Nasim al-Bastawi, <em>Ahwal wa Athar Hazrat Mujaddid Islam</em> (Lahore: Raza Academy, 1998) p.34 </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Sa’idullah Khan</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He hailed from Kandahar which in present day Afghanistan, he was a pathan belonging to the Barech tribe. He eventually migrated to Lahore with Sultan Muhammad Nadir Shah as part of his war expeditions. He was given prestigious and high ranking positions within Nadir Shahs Safavid Dynasty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then moved to Delhi whilst he was minister of a department. He received the accolade and title of ‘Bravery of war,’ an official title from the Ruler, ie Muhammad Nadir Shah for his bravery and ardent loyalty (Muhammad Sabir al-Qadiri Nasim al-Bastawi, <em>Ahwal wa Athar Hazrat Mujaddid Islam</em>, p.34) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Nadir Shah (d.1747) was the ruler or Iran of the Safavid Dynasty and had the title The Shah of Iran. He was, naturally of Iranian descent belonging to the Afshar tribe hailing from Khurasan. He was born a Shi’i as an Itha Ashari and was an ardent follower of the Jafari school of thought. Due to the political turmoil at the time he would often say to people he was also sunni in order to keep his cohorts to support him and also to keep the opposing Ottoman empire from fighting him. In fact, numerous people serving and working with him failed to highlight whether he was sunni or shi’i, such was his deception</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He attempted to mix the two and made his own madhab called the jafari madhab so that the ottomans would accept him. His aim was to allow the persians to perform Hajj which was under Ottoman control and administration, and his only aim behind this was to make this a revenue stream. (Michael Axworthy&#8217;s, <em>The Sword of Persia</em> (I.B. Tauris, 2006), Tucker, Ernest, &#8220;Nadir Shah and the Ja&#8217;fari Mazhab reconsidered&#8221;, in <em>Iranian Studies</em>, vol. 27, 1-4 (1994), pp,163-179.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He continued to fight for the Safavid dynasty which was in decline at the period and thus Nadir Shah seized the opportunity to launch his own house. Nadir Shah continued to lead numerous military expeditions throughout the lands, which he was successful in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the time Ghilzai Afghans had control of the southeast regions, namely Kandahar. This was later controlled by the Hotaki dynasty. Nadir Shah defeated the Hotaki dynasty in approximately 1738 and took control of Kandahar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is where Sa’idullah Khan joined Nadir Shah and became a part of his dynasty war campaign for domination. Nadir Shah then went onto fight the Mughals and their empire and in the process captured cities like Ghazni, Kabul, Peshawar, parts of Sindh and Lahore.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Nadir Shah’s history and campaign were a far cry from innocence, one only needs to read the annals of history and they will come to know the wicked and evil nature of his deviation, theologically and socially.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The aim is not to present a reading into the evil actions of certain individuals or a history lesson but to show if one makes erroneous and fabricated claims against Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and al-Saud family, the closet will yield some home truths! (For further reading on the generosity and life of Muhammad Nadir Shah Read, Michael Axworthy&#8217;s, <em>The Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from Tribal Warrior to Conquering Tyrant</em>. (I.B. Tauris, 2006), Ernest Tucker, <em>Nadir Shah&#8217;s Quest for Legitimacy in Post-Safavid Iran</em> (Florida, University Press, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the likes of whom the forefathers of Ahmad Raza Khan colluded with, to cause havoc and rampage in muslim territories, the atrocities, genocide, pillaging land, and philandering of wealth and woman of unprecedented levels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to ask the barelwi sympathisers what do they make of the claim, which they often hurl at Ahl al-Sunnah, petrol dollars, the illegal al-Saud state, corroborating with the British, killing innocent muslims, mass murdering and declaring Muslims to be disbelievers. Of course this is sheer nonsense which has been answered in great detail, however the ignorant wandering mind will always have difficulty focusing on the truth and facts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This said, Barelwi Sufi narrow mindedness and genius level of reasoning fails to see and acknowledge how the forefathers of their Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan were part of such acts which were absolutely heinous and catastrophically evil.  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A bomb goes off in a marketplace in Jerusalem. A suicide bomber launches himself into a bus full of women and children in Tel Aviv. Foreign tourists get massacred at a holiday resort in Luxor, Egypt. Villages upon villages get annihilated in Algeria. The list of events worldwide which have come to symbolise the ‘Islamic terror’ are endless. From the times in the 70’s and 80’s when Pan Am and TWA aeroplanes would be highjacked, to the mid 80’s in war torn Lebanon where Americans and Europeans would be held as hostages for years; all such incidents have come to be identified with the religion of Islam. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such incidents from past and present have undoubtedly affected Muslims worldwide and more so in the West. Any Muslim, who wants to practice his/her religion and expresses the pious desire to live under the banner of Islam, is labelled a fundamentalist or extremist. Any Muslim man who walks down a busy street in London or Paris (and Paris moreso) with a beard and a scarf on his head, is looked upon as being a terrorist who’s probably got an AK47 stashed somewhere on his person. Muslim women who are veiled can’t go anywhere in the Western world without being taunted as being oppressed or being mad (for covering up). However, are such beliefs and opinions about Islam really justified?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>Exploding the myth</b></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the many short comings which has arisen in the West, is judging Islam by the conduct of a minority of its people. By doing this, segments of Western society have deliberately played off the desperate actions of many Muslims, and have given it the name of Islam. Such behaviour is clearly not objective and seeks to distort the reality of Islam. For if such a thing was done Judge a religion by the conduct of its people) then we too could say that all Christianity is about is child molesting and homosexuality [1] whilst Hinduism was all about looting and breaking up mosques [2]. Generalising in such a manner is not seen as being objective, yet we find that the Western world is foremost in propagating this outlook on Islam. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So what is the reality of Islam? How does one dispel the myths which have been created and spread so viciously? The only way to examine Islam is to simply examine its belief system. Look at its sources, the Qur’an and Sunna, and see what they have to say. This is the way to find the truth about what Islam says about terror, terrorism and terrorists. One who is sincerely searching for the truth, will do it no other way. The very name Islam comes from the Arabic root word ‘salama’ which means peace. Islam is a religion which is based upon achieving peace through the submission to the will of Allaah. Thus, by this very simple linguistic definition, one can ascertain as to what the nature of this religion is. If such a religion is based on the notion of peace, then how is it that so many acts done by its adherents are contrary to peace? The answer is simple. Such actions, if not sanctioned by the religion, have no place with it. They are not Islamic and should not be thought of as Islamic.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>Jihad</b></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The word jihad sends shivers down the spines of many Westerners. They readily equate this term with violence and oppression. However, it must be said that the meaning of jihad, as a ‘holy war’, is something which is totally foreign and not from Islam. If anything, such a description belongs more so to Christianity and its adherents. It was terms like this which were used to justify the slaughter and pillage of towns and cities during the crusades by the Christians. By simply looking into the sources of Islam, one is able to know that the true meaning of jihad is to <i>strive/make effort in the way of Allaah. </i>Thus striving in the way of Allaah can be both peaceful and physical. The Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>“The best jihad is (by) the one who strives against his own self for Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic” [3].</i>In the Qur’an, Allaah also says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>So obey not the disbelievers, but make a great jihad </b>(effort)<b> against them </b>(by preaching)<b> with it</b> (the Qur’an)” </span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Furqan 25:52).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By controlling and fighting against ones desires, the Muslims can then also physically exert themselves in the path of Allaah. It is this physical or combative jihad which receives so much criticism. Because of the sheer ignorance of this type of jihad Islam is regarded as terror, and Muslims are regarded as terrorists. However, the very purpose of this physical jihad is to raise the word of Allaah uppermost. By doing this, it liberates and emancipates all those who are crying out for freedom all over the world. If the likes of the pacifists of this world had their way, then the world would indeed be full of anarchy and mischief. The combative jihad seeks to correct this as Allaah says in the Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of another, the Earth would be full of mischief. But Allaah is full of bounty to the worlds</b>“ </span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:251).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such would be the corruption on this Earth if there had never been a combative jihad that Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>For had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques, wherein the name of Allaah is mentioned much, would surely have been pulled down. Indeed Allaah will help those who help His</b> (cause). <b>Truly Allaah is All strong, All mighty</b>“ </span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Hajj 22:40).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This combative jihad being both defensive and offensive, is something which is commanded by Allaah upon the Muslims. Through this command the oppressed and weak are rescued from the tyranny of the world:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>And what is the matter with you that you do not fight in the cause of Allaah and for those weak, ill treated and oppressed among men, women and children whose only cry is; ‘Our Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors and raise for us from you one who will protect and raise for us from you one who will help</b>“‘ </span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah An-Nisa 4:75).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Anyone who knows the early history of Islam, will know that all those nations and empires which came under the fold of Islam were indeed previously oppressed. When the companions of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) went out for the offensive jihad against the Egyptians, the Persians and the Romans, we find that the people did not resist against them at all. Rather, they accepted Islam on such a scale, that it is inconceivable that the jihad of Islam could be anything other then a liberation for these people; a liberation from centuries of tyranny. In fact, with the Byzantine Egyptians and the people of Spain, the Muslims were even beckoned to come and liberate these lands from the oppression of their kings. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the glorious track record of the Muslim jihad Compare this with the brutal track record of warfare in the Western world over the centuries. From the crusades against the Muslims to the days of colonial warfare, the Western world has killed, destroyed and plundered everything which has come in its way. Even today this merciless killing goes on by the Western nations. While claiming to be about world peace and security, Western nations are ready to bomb innocent civilians at the drop of a hat. The classic example of this is the recent bombings of Sudan and Afghanistan. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst claiming that Sudan and Afghanistan were havens for Islamic terrorists, the bombings of these two nations could not have come at a better time for the American president Bill Clinton. The destruction of innocent lives which were a result of these bombings clearly seem to have been an attempt by Clinton to avert attention away from his sexual misdemeanours; [4] something which he so often gets caught up in. Without doubt this was the reason for such terror from the American military upon innocent people. This is the same American military which claims to enter the worlds trouble spots under the guise of being peace keepers. But</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>…</b> <b>when it is said to them; ‘Make not mischief on the Earth’, they say; ‘We are only peace makers’. Indeed they are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive it not</b>“</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:11-12)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>The hypocrisy of the West is indeed astounding.</b></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By looking at the rules and regulations of this combative jihad it will be clear to any sincere person that this is indeed the religion of truth. When fighting an unjust enemy, no matter how unjust they are, it is forbidden by Islam that their retreating forces are mutilated, tortured or slaughtered. The treacherous violation of treaties and carrying out assassinations after a cease fire, are also prohibited. Allaah says in the Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you. But do not transgress the limits. Truly Allaah loves not the transgressors</b>“</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:190).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Not transgressing the limits means not to kill women and children, for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) <i>“forbade the killing of women and children</i>” [5]. Not transgressing the limits means that the elderly, the sick, monks, worshippers and hired labourers are not attacked. Not transgressing the limits means not killing animals wantonly, burning crops and vegetation, polluting waters and destroying homes, monasteries, churches and synagogues:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion, nor drove you out of your homes. Indeed, Allaah loves those who deal with equity</b>“</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Mumtahinah 60:8).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After reading such passages from the Qur’an and knowing about what Islam commands and prohibits in jihad, the rules of warfare are given a new meaning; a meaning of justice. How sad it is then, that whilst Islam is condemned for striking terror into the hearts of the people, the likes of the Serbs, the Indian army in Kashmir and the Israeli soldiers in Palestine are left untarnished for the atrocities they have committed in the name of warfare.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So what about suicide bombing, is this too a part of jihad in Allaah’s path? From what has already been stated above, it can be deduced that this is not from the religion. However, unfortunately many Muslims have taken suicide bombing as being a virtuous act by which one receives reward. This could not be further from the truth. The Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>“Those who go to extremes are destroyed” </i>[6]. Suicide bombing is undoubtedly an extremity which has reached the ranks of the Muslims. In the rules of warfare, we find no sanction for such an act from the behaviour and words of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) and his companions. Unfortunately, today (some misguided) Muslims believe that such acts are paving the way for an Islamic revival and a return to the rule of Islam’s glorious law. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, we fail to bear in mind that the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>“Do not be delighted by the action of anyone, until you see how he ends up”</i> [7]. So, for example what is the end of a suicide bomber in Palestine?, a leg here, an arm there. Massive retaliation by the Israeli’s in the West Bank and Gaza. More Muslims killed and persecuted. How can we be delighted with such an end? What really hammers the final nail in the coffin of this act, is that it is suicide; something which is clearly forbidden in Islam. The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>“He who kills himself with anything, Allaah will torment him with that in the fire of Hell” </i>[8]. Some are under the misconception that by killing oneself for an Islamic cause, one commits an act which deserves Paradise. Once when a man killed himself, the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>“He is a dweller of the Fire”. </i>When the people were surprised at this, the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>“A person performs the deeds which to the people appears to be the deeds befitting the dweller of Paradise, but he is in fact one of the dwellers of the Fire” </i>[9]. The taking of ones life which Allaah has given as a trust to the human, is a great sin. Likewise the taking of other lives (which is so often the case with suicide bombing) is also forbidden, as human life is indeed precious:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>…If anyone killed a person not in retaliation for murder or to spread mischief in the land, it would be as if he killed the whole of mankind. And (likewise) if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the whole of mankind</b>“</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Maaida 5:32).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, all other types of extremities such as hostage taking, hijacking and planting bombs in public places, are clearly forbidden in Islam.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>The Media</b></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By going through the teachings of Islam, it is clear that such a religion has only come to benefit mankind -not to destroy it. So why is there so much hatred for this noble religion in the West? The answer is simple, the media. It is the Jewish influenced media of the West which has portrayed Islam to be something that it is not. During the 70’s and 80’s when the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organisation) were carrying out daring highjacks on the worlds airways, the media in the West portrayed it as being Islamic. When the Shi’ite suicide bombers of the 80’s were causing so much havoc in the Lebanon and in the Gulf region, the media in the West portrayed it as a part of Islam. However, it is known by the heads of the media that the likes of the PLO were not an Islamic organisation, and that according to Islam, Shi’ites are outside the fold of Islam [10]. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet such facts are never portrayed by a media which seeks to cover the truth of this religion. A number of years ago, when the Oklahoma City bomb went off, a headline in one of the newspapers, ‘The Today’ [11], summed up this attitude. With a picture of a fire fighter holding a dead child in his arms, the headline read: <b>“In The Name of Islam” </b>Time has of course proven that this bigoted assumption was incorrect, as Timothy McVeigh, a right wing radical now faces the death penalty for the crime [12]. Likewise the bombs which went off in the Paris metro in 1995, were also blamed on Muslim fanatics. It has now emerged that the Algerian secret service who having routinely bribed many European journalists and MPs, were actually behind it. The desire to throw a veil over Islam is immense by these people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>They intend to put out the light of Allaah with their mouths, but Allaah will complete His light even though the disbelievers hate</b> (it)”</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah As-Saff 61:8).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst trying to destroy Islam through this instrument of the media, the Jews clearly try to portray an image of themselves as being the oppressed people. Every year, we are reminded as to how many Jews perished under the Nazis in World War II. We are made to feel sorry for these same people who have gone on to commit so many crimes upon the Palestinian people. Some may say that this is a racist and biased viewpoint. But we say; If this media was not run and orchestrated by the Jews and was truly neutral, then why are Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, two former Israeli prime ministers, not held aloft as being terrorists? Anyone who knows about the history of the Palestinian occupation will tell you that these two men were members of the Stem Gang and Irgun, two notorious Jewish terror groups who killed many innocent people [13]. If this media was truly impartial, then why does it not tell about the extent of the Israeli bombardment and illegal occupation of Southern Lebanon and its people? [14] And if this media really had nothing against the religion of Allaah, then why does it not inform the people that every day hundreds are entering the religion of Islam? Such things will never be highlighted in the Western media, simply because to do so would be against their very interests.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With such immense pressure against it, it is indeed a blessing from Allaah that Islam goes from strength to strength. It continues to grow faster then any other religion in the Western world, conquering the hearts and minds of thousands. All this should not even surprise us though, for Allaah has promised us that this religion will prevail:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, so that He may make it victorious over all other religions, even though the disbelievers detest it</b>“</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah As-Saff 61:9).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a must that humanity comes towards the religion of Islam. Without it, we will continue to slip down the road of inequity and darkness. With it we can establish a society of justice and peace. Religion of terror? … no. The way forward? … yes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<b>There is no compulsion in religion. The right path has indeed become distinct from the wrong. So whoever rejects false worship and believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing</b>“</span><span style="color: #000000;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:256)</span></p>
