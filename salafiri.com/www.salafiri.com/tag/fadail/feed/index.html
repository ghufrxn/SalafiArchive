				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from Fatawa &#8216;Ilmiyyah (1/493-497)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Question:</strong> The Tahqiq (research) regarding the following narration is desired: &#8220;The person that recites Surah Ya-Sin every morning will have all the needs of his day fulfilled.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Answer:</strong> This narration is present in the Sunan of Ad-Darimi <em>(2/457 #3421)</em> with the following chain of narration: <strong>&#8220;&#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah (Tabi&#8217;i) said: It has reached me that the Messenger of Allah </strong>ﷺ <strong>said&#8230;&#8221;<em> &#8211; </em></strong>and the author of Mishkat [Al-Masabih] <em>(#2177)</em> narrated it from Ad-Darimi. This narration is weak on account of it being Mursal¹, and the person that informed [&#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah] is unknown. The following Marfu&#8217;² narrations pertaining to the virtues of Surah Ya-Sin are also weak and rejected:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify">
<li style="text-align: left"><strong>&#8220;Verily everything has a heart, and the heart of the Qur&#8217;an is Ya-Sin, and whomsoever recites Ya-Sin, Allah will write for him [the reward of] the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an ten times.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Jami&#8217; At-Tirmidhi #2887 from the Hadith of Qatadah from Anas [may Allah be pleased with him], Tablighi Nisab p.292, Fadha&#8217;il Al-Qur&#8217;an p.58)</em></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam At-Tirmidhi said regarding one of the narrators [of this Hadith], <strong>&#8220;Harun Abu Muhammad is an unknown Shaykh.&#8221; </strong>Due to Harun being unknown, this narration is weak &#8211; Shaykh Al-Albani declared it to be Mawdu&#8217; (Fabricated). <em>(Silsilah Ahadith Ad-Da&#8217;ifa 1/202 #169)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu Hatim Ar-Razi claimed that the narrator of this Hadith [in reality] is Muqatil bin Sulayman, who is a liar <em>(&#8216;Ilal Al-Hadith 2/56 #1652).</em> Whereas in the Sunan of At-Tirmidhi, Sunan of Ad-Darimi (2/456 #3419), and Tarikh Baghdad (4/267), the narrator is Muqatil bin Hayyan, who is truthful &#8211; and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">2. In this same chapter, regarding the [same Hadith] narrated on the authority of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him), Imam At-Tirmidhi wrote, <strong>&#8220;And it is no more authentic than the previous chain of narration, and its chain of narration is weak.&#8221; </strong><em>(Jami&#8217; At-Tirmidhi #2887)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">3. <strong>&#8220;Verily everything has a heart, and the heart of the Qur&#8217;an is Ya-Sin.&#8221; </strong><em>(Kashf Al-Astar &#8216;an Zawa&#8217;id Al-Bazzar 3/87 #2304 from the Hadith of &#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Al-Albani wrote regarding this Hadith, <strong>&#8220;&#8230;and this Humayd (narrator) is unknown, just as Al-Hafidh said in Al-Taqrib, and I do not know &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Fadhl, the Shaykh of Al-Bazzar.&#8221;</strong><em> </em><em>(Silsilah Ahadith Ad-Da&#8217;ifa 1/204)</em> &#8211; Meaning this narrator Humayd Al-Makki, Mawla of Aal &#8216;Alqamah <em>(Tafsir Ibn Kathir 3/570) </em>is unknown just as Hafidh Ibn Hajr said in Taqrib Al-Tadhib, and that he does not know the teacher of Al-Bazzar: &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Fadhl. It is now understood that this narration is weak on account of two narrators being unknown.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">4. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night will be forgiven in the morning.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Musnad Abi Ya&#8217;la 11/93,94 #4324, and other than him from the path of Hisham bin Ziyad from Al-Hasan [Al-Basri] who said: I heard Abu Hurayrah&#8230;)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration is severely weak, Hisham bin Ziyad is an abandoned narrator. <em>(Al-Taqrib p.364 #7292)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">5. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night, seeking the Face of Allah, he will be forgiven in that night.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan Ad-Darimi #3420, and other than him)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration is weak on account of a disconnection, it is not established that Al-Hasan Al-Basri ever met Abu Hurayrah. Additionally, [Al-Hasan] was a Mudallis, and he is narrating with &#8216;An.³</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">6.  <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night, seeking the Face of Allah, will be forgiven.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Ibn Hibban, Marawid Adh-Dhaman #665, and other than him from Al-Hasan Al-Basri from Jundub)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration if weak on account of a disconnection, Abu Hatim Ar-Razi said, <strong>&#8220;It is not correct that Al-Hasan heard from Jundub.&#8221; </strong><em>(Al-Marasil p. 42)</em>, Also see the previous Hadith.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">7. <strong> &#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night, seeking the Face of Allah (Most High), will be forgiven for what has preceded from his sins, so recite it over your dead.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Bayhaqi in Shu&#8217;b Al-Iman #2458, from the Hadith of Ma&#8217;qil bin Yasar)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration is weak on account of an unknown narrator: Abu &#8216;Uthman and his father, who is also unknown. This Hadith is present in a shortened form in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad <em>(5/26,27)</em>, Mustadarak of Al-Hakim <em>(1/565)</em>, Sahih Ibn Hibban <em>(Al-Ihsan 7/269 #2991</em><em>)</em>, Sunan Abi Dawud <em>(#3121)</em> and Sunan Ibn Majah <em>(#1448)</em>, and Imam Ad-Daraqutni declared this Hadith to be weak. It has one weak supporting Hadith in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad <em>(4/105)</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">8.  &#8220;<strong>Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night will be forgiven in the morning.&#8221; </strong><em>(Hilyat Al-Awliya 4/130 form the Hadith of &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud, may Allah be pleased with him.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is considered fabricated due to the narrator &#8216;Abu Maryam &#8216;Abdul-Ghaffar bin Al-Qasim Al-Kufi&#8217;, who is a liar and a fabricator. <em>(Lisan Al-Mizan 4/50,51)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">9. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin will have the equivalent of twenty Hajj&#8217;s, and whosoever writes it then drinks it will have one thousand certainties and one thousand mercies enter his heart, and will have rancour and disease removed from it.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Hilyat Al-Awliya 7/136 from the Hadith of Al-Harith Al-A&#8217;war from &#8216;Ali)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is severely weak due to Al-Harith Al-A&#8217;war and the Tadlis of Abu Ishaq.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">10. <strong>&#8220;I wish that it were in the heart of every person from my Ummah (meaning Ya-Sin).&#8221;</strong> <em>(Kashf Al-Astar 3/87 #2305 from the Hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbas)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The narrator of this Hadith, Ibrahim bin Al-Hakim bin Aban, is weak. <em>(At-Taqrib #166)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">11. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Surah Ya-Sin whilst he is experiencing the agonies of death, or he is close to it, the Treasurer of Paradise will come to him with a drink from the drinks of Paradise, and he will give it to him to drink whilst he is on his bed, so he will drink it then die, and he will not be in need of a Basin (Hawdh) from the Basins of the Prophets.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Wasit of Al-Wahidi 3/509)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is fabricated &#8211; Yusuf bin &#8216;Atiyyah is an abandoned narrator <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #7872) </em>and Harun bin Kathir is unknown <em>(Lisan Al-Mizan 6/218)</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">12. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin, then it is as if he recited the [entire] Qur&#8217;an ten times.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is Mursal due to Hayyan b. &#8216;Atiyyah.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">13. <strong>&#8220;Surah Ya-Sin is called Al-Muni&#8217;mah in the Torah [&#8230;].&#8221;<em> </em></strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">(</span>Shu&#8217;b Al-Iman of Al-Bayhaqi #2465, Ad-Du&#8217;afa of Al-&#8216;Uqayli 1/347, Tablighi Nisab p.292,293, Fadha&#8217;il Al-Qur&#8217;an p.58, 59)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is Mawdu&#8217; (Fabricated), [the narrator] &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr Al-Jad is abandoned in Hadith, and another narrator is unknown. Imam Bayhaqi said regarding this Hadith, <strong>&#8220;It is rejected.&#8221;<em> </em></strong>Imam Al-&#8216;Uqayli also rejected this narration. This Hadith also comes through a second chain of narration in Tarikh Baghdad and in Al-Mawdu&#8217;at of Ibn Al-Jawzi, the narrator [in this chain], Muhammad bin Abd bin &#8216;Amir As-Samarqandi, is a liar and abandoned.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">14. <strong>&#8220;Verily I have made the recitation of Ya-Sin every night obligatory upon my Ummah, so whomsoever persists upon its recitation every night, then dies, will die the death of a Martyr.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Imam Ash-Shajri 1/118)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is fabricated, not a single one of its narrators is known, for example &#8216;Umar bin Sa&#8217;d Al-Waqas, Abu Hafs bin &#8216;Umar bin Hafs and Abu &#8216;Amir bin Abdur-Rahim. To summarise &#8211; every Marfu&#8217; narration on the virtues of Surah Ya-Sin is weak and rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Ad-Darimi, may Allah have mercy upon him, narrated: <strong>&#8220;&#8216;Amr bin Zurarah narrated to me: &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab narrated to me: Rashid Abu Muhammad Al-Hamani narrated to me from Shahr bin Hawshab who said: &#8216;Ibn Abbas said, &#8216;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the morning will be given an easy day until the evening, and whomsoever recites it in the middle of the night will be given an easy night until the morning.'&#8221; </strong><em>(Sunan Ad-Darimi 1/257 #3422, and its chain is Hasan</em><em>)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">A summarised biography of these narrators is as follows:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>&#8216;Umar bin Zurarah: Trustworthy. <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #5032)</em></li>
<li>&#8216;Abdul-Wahhab Ath-Thaqafi: Trustworthy, used to change (i.e., mix up Hadith) before his death for 3 years, however, this does not harm his Hadiths as he did not narrate Hadith in this period of time. <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #4261)</em></li>
<li>Rashid bin Nujayh Al-Hamani: Truthful and perhaps he made mistakes. <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #1857) &#8211; </em>He was a Hasan Al-Hadith narrator.</li>
<li>Shahr bin Hawshab: The [Scholars of Hadith] differed on him as a narrator, the majority of the Muhaddithin declared him trustworthy. <em>(As I have researched in my book: Takhrij An-Nihayah fi&#8217;l-Fitan w&#8217;al-Malahim p.119,120) &#8211; </em>Hafidh Ibn Kathir declared one of his narrations to be &#8216;Hasan&#8217;. <em>(Musnad Al-Faruq 1/228) </em>In my research, this narrator is Hasan Al-Hadith.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">The summary of this research is that this chain of narration is Hasan, and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> A Mursal narration is that which is narrated by a Tabi&#8217;i (student of a Sahabi) from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ without mentioning who he had taken it from, Shaykh Zubayr &#8216;Aliza&#8217;i said, <strong>&#8220;The position of the majority of the Scholars of Hadith is that the Mursal narration of a Tabi&#8217;i is rejected.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Fatawa &#8216;Ilmiyyah 2/290)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:] </strong>Hafidh Ibn Kathir wrote regarding Marfu&#8217;, <strong>&#8220;That which is attributed to the Prophet ﷺ, whether it is speech or action&#8230;&#8221; </strong><em>(Ikhtisar &#8216;Ulum Al-Hadith with the annotations of Shaykh Zubayr &#8216;Aliza&#8217;i p.33)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">³ <strong>[TN:]</strong>  <span class="fontstyle0">Tadlis: </span><span class="fontstyle2">Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i wrote, </span><strong><span class="fontstyle0">“If a narrator transmits a narration from his Shaykh (with whom it is established that he met and heard from) using terms such as ‘An </span></strong><span class="fontstyle0">([ </span><span class="fontstyle3">عن </span><span class="fontstyle0">from], this is an ambiguous form of narrating in Arabic which can imply that one </span><span class="fontstyle0">heard it directly or indirectly from someone else)</span><strong><span class="fontstyle0"> while he heard that narration from someone else (other than his Shaykh) – and those whom he narrates this to think that is likely that he heard it from his Shaykh, then this is known as ‘Tadlis’.” </span></strong><span class="fontstyle2">– see the Maqalat of Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i, Volume 1, Page 252. In summary, Tadlis is a hidden weakness in a chain of narration caused by a narrator concealing whom he had actually heard the narration from by using ambiguous terms such as ‘An (عن).</span><span class="fontstyle4"> </span><span class="fontstyle2">Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i explains, </span><strong><span class="fontstyle0">“It is a famous and well-known issue in the Principles of Hadith (i.e., Hadith Sciences) that the narrations of the Mudallis (a narrator that practises Tadlis) that narrates by ‘An ( )</span><span class="fontstyle3">عن</span></strong><span class="fontstyle0"><strong>is rejected and not a proof, meaning it is weak.”</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle2">He further quoted from Imam Ash-Shafi’i who wrote, </span><strong><span class="fontstyle0">“So we say: We do not accept a Hadith from a Mudallis until he says ‘Hadathani (So-and-so narrated to me)’ or ‘Sami’tu (I heard directly, i.e., an explicit term used for transmitting directly)’.” </span></strong><span class="fontstyle2">[Ar-Risalah with the Tahqiq of Ahmad Shakir #1035] – see the Maqalat of Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i, Volume 4, Page 151.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from ‘Fadail As-Sahabah Sahih Riwayat Ki Roshni Mein’  (p.40-43)<br />
Tahqiq and Takhrij by Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said on the Day of Khaybar, <strong>&#8220;Tomorrow, I will surely give this flag to a man by whose hands Allah will grant victory, he loves Allah and His Messenger, and Allah and His Messenger love him.&#8221;</strong> So [the Companions] stood up, hoping that they would be granted that flag. So the next day came and all of them were hoping that they would be granted [the flag] &#8211; then [the Messenger of Allah ﷺ] said, <strong>&#8220;Where is &#8216;Ali?&#8221;</strong> So it was said to him that he was suffering from pain in his eyes, so he ordered and he (&#8216;Ali) was called for him. Then, [the Messenger of Allah ﷺ] spat in his eyes, and he became cured from his ailment until it was as if he had never been afflicted by anything. &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said, &#8220;<strong>We will fight them until they become like us (i.e., accept Islam).&#8221;</strong> So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ replied, <strong>&#8220;Slowly, until you reach their battlefield, then call them to Islam, and inform them of what is obligatory upon them, for by Allah! That one man is guided is guided through you is better for you than the red camels.&#8221;</strong> (Sahih Al-Bukhari #2942, Sahih Muslim #2406)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Allah (The Most High) granted victory to the Muslims by the hands of Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) during the Battle of Khaybar &#8211; what a lofty status it is for Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali that Allah and His Messenger love him!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Famous Companion of a great rank, the Conquerer of Al-Qadisiyyah<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, Sayyiduna Sa&#8217;d bin Abi Waqas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to &#8216;Ali, <strong>&#8220;You are, to me, in the position Harun was to Musa, except that there is no Prophet after me.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3706, Sahih Muslim #2404)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">From this Hadith, a great position is established for Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), however, one must remember that this has no relation to the Caliphate. Additionally, it is proven from this Hadith that after the Noble Prophet ﷺ until the Day of Ressurection, no Prophet will be born.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated, <strong>&#8220;By The One Who split the seed, and created the breathing, verily the Unlettered Prophet ﷺ gave me a promise that no one will love me except for the believer, and no one will hate me except for the hypocrite.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #78)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It has now become apparent that the Believers love Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali, and those that hate him are Hypocrites &#8211; all of Ahlus Sunnah love Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali and have affection towards him. [However], one must remember that to love him does not mean that a man raises the status of Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali to the likes of &#8216;Mushkil Khusa (The Solver of Difficulties)&#8217; or &#8216;Hajat Rawa (Fulfiller of Needs)&#8217;, or that he starts attacking the rest of the Noble Companions due to his great status, rather Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali has already spoken about these types of people:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>&#8220;Two [types of] men are destroyed [in regards to me]: The one who goes to extremes in exaggeration (in his love), and the one who is hateful in his speech.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Fadha&#8217;il As-Sahabah of Imam Ahmad 2/571 #964 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In another narration, Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali said, <strong>&#8220;Surely a group of people will love me until they enter The Fire due to their love for me, and surely a group of people will hate me until they enter The Fire due to their hatred for me.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Fadha&#8217;il As-Sahabah of Imam Ahmad 2/565 #952 and its chain is Sahih, Kitab As-Sunnah of Ibn Abi &#8216;Asim #983, and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Due to these statements being related to the Knowledge of the Unseen, they take the ruling of raf’ (being attributed directly to the Prophet ﷺ) – i.e., that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ informed ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) about these matters, and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is now known that two groups of people are headed for destruction:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>Those who inadvertently, out of their [extreme] love, take Sayyiduna ‘Ali to be a deity, ‘Mushkil Khusa’, ‘Hajat Rawa’, and other than these, or those that insult others from the Noble Companions, such as the extreme Rawafidh.</li>
<li>Those who insult Sayyiduna ‘Ali, such as the Khawarij and the Nawasib, and other than them.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">Note: The Ahlul-Hadith are completely free from Hakim Faiz Alam Siddiqui (the Nasibi) and other than him that attack the status of Sayyiduna ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), the Ahlul-Hadith have no connection whatsoever to the Nawasib or the Rawafidh. The way of the Ahlul-Hadith is the Kitab (Qur’an) and Sunnah and this is the way of Ahlus-Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Amir Al-Mu’minin (Chief of the Believers) ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said [as part of a lengthier narration], <strong>“I do not find anyone more deserving of this matter (leadership) than this group with whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was pleased with when he passed away.”</strong> He then named ‘Ali, ‘Uthman, Az-Zubayr, Talha, Sa’d and ‘Abdur-Rahman. <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3700)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Sa’d bin Abi Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that when the following Ayah was revealed:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">نَدْعُ أَبْنَاءَنَا وَأَبْنَاءَكُمْ</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“Let us summon our children and your children.”</strong> (Surah Ali &#8216;Imran, 3:61)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>“The Messenger of Allah ﷺ called for ‘Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn, then said, ‘Oh Allah! This is my family.’”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #2404, Darussalam Edn. #6220)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyida ‘A’isha Siddiqa (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ went out one morning whilst wearing a striped cloak made from black [camel] hear, then Hasan bin ‘Ali came and he wrapped him under it, then Al-Husayn came and he wrapped him under it with [Al-Hasan], then Fatima came and he wrapped her under it, then ‘Ali came and he wrapped him under it, then he ﷺ recited:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيُذْهِبَ عَنْكُمُ الرِّجْسَ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ وَيُطَهِّرَكُمْ تَطْهِيرًا‏</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“Allah only wishes to remove Ar-Rijs from you, O Ahlul-Bayt, and to purify you with a thorough purification.”</strong> (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:33)<br />
<em>(Sahih Muslim #2424)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The great virtues of Sayyiduna ‘Ali have been established through these Authentic Ahadith – [It should be noted that] the Mothers of the Believers (the wives of the Prophet ﷺ) also enter into ‘Ahlul-Bayt’, Sayyiduna Zayd bin Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>“His wives are from his Ahlul-Bayt.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #2408, Darussalam Edn. #6225)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Imran bin Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said [as part of a lengthier narration], <strong>“Verily ‘Ali is from me and I am from him, and he is the ally of every believer.”</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3712 and its chain is Hasan)</em>, meaning that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ loved ‘Ali and ‘Ali loved him, and every believer loves ‘Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Zayd bin Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“For whosoever I am his Mawla, ‘Ali is his Mawla.”</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3713 and its chain is Sahih)</em>, in the [Arabic] language, a special friend can also be referred to as a ‘Mawla’ <em>(Al-Qamus Al-Wahid p. 1900) </em>– the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Sayyiduna Zayd bin Harith (may Allah be pleased with him), <strong>“You are our brother and our Mawla.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #2699), </em>and he ﷺ also said regarding Sayyiduna Julaybib (may Allah be pleased with him), <strong>“He is from me and I am from him.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #2472, Darussalam Edn. #6358)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Some of the Rafidha use the Hadith of Wilayat as evidence for the Caliphate of Sayyiduna ‘Ali (i.e., that he had the most right to leadership) and propagate this, however, on account of the previous and upcoming evidences (which will be discussed later on), their argument is invalidated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On one occasion, Sayyiduna ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was in a state of illness when the Noble Prophet ﷺ passed by and supplicated for him, <strong>“Oh Allah! Restore his health”</strong> or<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> <strong>“Oh Allah! Cure him”</strong>, and Sayyiduna ‘Ali said, <strong>“So I did not suffer from my ailment again.”</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3564 and he (Abu ‘Isa At-Tirmidhi) said, ‘This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith.’, and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Famous Tabi’i Abu Ishaq As-Sabi’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said, <strong>“I saw Amir Al-Mu’minin (meaning ‘Ali) on the pulpit, and his head [hair] and beard were white.”</strong> <em>(Kitab Al-Ma’rifah wa’t-Tarikh of Al-Farisi 2/621 and its chain is Sahih, Tarikh Dimashq 45/17, Musannaf ‘Abdur-Razzaq 3/188-189 #5267)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is now known from this narration that to apply hennah or to dye the hair (when it turns white) is not obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>“Show reverence to Muhammad ﷺ by looking after his family.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3713)</em>, meaning whoever has love for Sayyiduna ‘Ali, Hasan, Husayn and the entirety of the Noble Companions will be gathered with the Noble Prophet ﷺ on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Zayd bin Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) said,<strong> “The first to accept Islam was ‘Ali.”</strong> ‘Amr bin Murrah (one of the narrators) mentioned this to Ibrahim An-Nakha’i (a junior Tabi’i), who rejected it and said, <strong>“The first to accept Islam was Abu Bakr As-Siddiq.”</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3735, and he [Abu ‘Isa At-Tirmidhi] said, ‘This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith.’, and its chain is Sahih)</em>, meaning the first to accept Islam from the children was Sayyiduna ‘Ali, and the first to accept Islam from the men was Sayyiduna Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with them both), and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>“The first to accept Islam was ‘Ali, may Allah be pleased with him.”</strong> <em>(Mu’jam As-Sahabah of Al-Baghawi 4/357 #1810 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">‘Urwah bin Az-Zubayr (may Allah have mercy on him) said that ‘Ali accepted Islam at the age of eight. <em>(Mu’jam As-Sahabah of Al-Baghawi 4/357 #1810 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Abdullah bin Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “<strong>We used to say that the most virtuous of the People of Madinah was ‘Ali bin Abi Talib.”</strong> <em>(Fadha’il As-Sahabah of Imam Ahmad 2/602 #1033 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">During the Battle of Khaybar, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib answered the call of Marhab the Jew (i.e., in battle), saying, <strong>“I am the one whose mother named him Haydar (Lion).”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #1807) </em>Thereafter, he killed Marhab and victory at Khaybar was achieved through his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was upon [Mount] Hira’, and so were Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, ‘Ali, Talha and Zubayr – then the mountain moved (i.e., started trembling), so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“Be calm! For there is no one upon you except for a Prophet, or a Siddiq (truthful one) or a Martyr.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #2417)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“Whosoever hurts ‘Ali has hurt me.”</strong> <em>(Fadha’il As-Sahabah of Al-Qati’i #1078 and its chain is Hasan, and it has supporting evidence with Ibn Hibban in Al-Mawarid #2202, and Al-Hakim 3/123 who authenticated it, and Adh-Dhahabi agreed with him)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated, <strong>“The people were complaining about ‘Ali, so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up amongst us to deliver a sermon, then I heard him saying, ‘O People! Do not complain about ‘Ali, for by Allah, he is the toughest (i.e., he does not make concessions for anyone) regarding Allah or in the path of Allah (Jihad).”</strong> <em>(Musnad Ahmad 3/86, Mustadarak Al-Hakim 3/134 and he authenticated it, and Adh-Dhahabi agreed, and its chain is Hasan.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>“Verily I hope that I, ‘Uthman, Talha and Zubayr are from those that Allah, Mighty and Majestic, said [regarding]:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِمْ مِنْ غِلٍّ إِخْوَانًا عَلَىٰ سُرُرٍ مُتَقَابِلِينَ</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>‘And We shall remove any bitterness from their hearts, [so they will be like] brothers facing each other on thrones.’ [Al-Hijr, 15:47]”</strong><br />
<em>(Fadha’il As-Sahabah of Imam Ahmad #1057, and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Abu Ishaq As-Sabi’i narrated, <strong>“I saw ‘Ali, so my father said to me, ‘Stand and look at Amir Al-Mu’minin (the Chief of the Believers)!’ So I stood up and I did not see him dye his beard, his beard was large and great.”</strong> <em>(Tabaqat Al-Kubra of Ibn Sa’d 3/25, and its chain is Sahih, Yunus bin Abi Ishaq is innocent from Tadlis)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Imam of Ahlus-Sunnah, Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal (may Allah have mercy on him), said,<strong> “No number of virtues has been narrated for anyone from the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ as has been narrated for ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him.”</strong> <em>(Mustadarak Al-Hakim 3/107,108 #4572 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In summary, Sayyiduna ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was a veteran of Badr, from the Sabiqun Al-Awwalun (the foremost to embrace Islam), Amir Al-Mu’minin (Chief of the Believers), a Rightly-Guided Caliph, his virtues are endless and this short article is incapable of covering all of them, Imam Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Al-Husayn Al-Ajurri (d. 360H, may Allah have mercy on him) said, <strong>“So know, may Allah have mercy upon us and you, that Allah Al-Karim has honoured Amir Al-Mu’minin ‘Ali bin Abi Talib with the most lofty eminence, his precedence’s in goodness are great, his virtues are many, his merit is immense, his importance is revered and his rank is noble. He is the brother of the Messenger ﷺ, the son of his uncle, the husband of Fatimah, the father of Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, the Knight of the Muslims, the one that would remove anguish from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, the killer of the enemies, the just and ascetic Imam in this worldly life longing for the next, the follower of the truth fleeing from falsehood, and the one that possesses every noble character. Allah (Mighty and Majestic) and his Messenger ﷺ both love him, and he loves Allah and the Messenger, he is the one who is not loved except by a pious believer and is not hated except by a miserable hypocrite, [he is] a treasure of intellect, knowledge, gentleness, and manners, may Allah be pleased with him.”</strong> <em>(Kitab Ash-Shari’ah p. 714, 715) </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">O Allah! Fill our hearts with a complete love for Sayyiduna Abu Bakr, Sayyiduna ‘Umar, Sayyiduna ‘Uthman, Sayyiduna ‘Ali, and the rest of the Noble Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all)! Amin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> The Battle of Al-Qadisiyyah occurred in the 14<sup>th</sup> Hijri year, according to the most correct opinion chosen by Ibn Jarir At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him), and it occurred in Al-Qadisiyyah, near ‘Iraq. Sa’d bin Abi Waqas (may Allah be pleased with him) was the Commander of the Muslim Army, and with him were more than 30,000 soldiers. The Commander of the opposing army was Rustam, who had 120,000 soldiers with him, including 33 elephants, and the battle was a victory for the Muslims – see Tarikh At-Tabari 3/479.</p>
