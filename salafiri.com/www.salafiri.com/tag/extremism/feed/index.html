<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Raza Ali Khan and Naqi Ali Khan (The grandfather and father of Ahmad Raza Khan, respectively)</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us look at the father of Ahmad Raza Khan, Naqi Ali Khan and his views. He was of course an ardent Sufi and had ijazah from the infamous Zaini Dahlan (see al-Ijazat al-Mutayinah p.67, Usul al-rashad liqamah mabani al-fasad p.19)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">a baralvi researcher, Muhammad Hanif Khn Rizvi Barelvi, writes in the introduction to one of Naqi Ali Khan&#8217;s book,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>&#8220;He despised the british rule and always opposed the british all his life. He continued efforts in uprooting british rule and pushed his efforts in writing to liberate the motherland from british rulership. In this regard Chanda Shah Hussaini writes, &#8220;Mawlana Raza Ali Khan had become famous for his Jihad against the british with his speech and pen, the british feared the efforts and fervour of the Mawlana. His son, Mawlana Naqi Ali Khan was also active in jihad against the britishers and the Mawlana had a high status amongst the scholars, furthermore, in this regard he had extensive and virtuous efforts against the british.&#8221;</em> (Shams al-Tawarikh, Usul al-rashad liqamah mabani al-fasad p.22)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">In order to expel the british out of India, the scholars of India formulated a Jihad Committee and issued a Fatwa of Jihad against the britishers and their rule. At the head and the first and foremost who issued the fatwa was Mawlana Raza Ali Khan, (a few other names) and Mawlana Naqi Ali Khan&#8230;&#8221; (Mish&#8217;al Rah &#8211; The Story of the Brtish Oppressors by Abd al-Hakim Akhtar Shahjanapuri, First chapter, the affect of the Clashes of 1857c p.126, Usul al-rashad liqamah mabani al-fasad p.23)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Mawlana Naqi Ali Khan would send horses to the mujahidin, who were wajing jihad against the british. In his speeches and sermons he would incite the people to wage war and jihad against the british. The people of Bareli were successful in their jihad against the british, who had to flee Bareli without choice. (Hayat Mufti Azam, Usul al-rashad liqamah mabani al-fasad p.23) </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course we are not here to debate and scrutinise the realities of these claims and how accurate they are based on historical records, but the point is how have the Sufi Barelvis of England overlooked the views and positions of the Sufi Barelwi elders and Churchfathers. On one hand we have the calamitous absurdities one could ever put on paper i.e. the dismantled report from the Henry Jackson society, who not only were falling short on payday but are also a shamble to academic research, who raised fallacious allegations against Ahl al-Sunnah, while on the other hand they outrightly ignored historical facts embodied within the Sufi Barelwi renegades. These people have places of worship in their droves in the United Kingdom and they preach the same points as their forefathers did, so why are the likes of Henry Jackson society silent on such findings?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well this obviously leaves us with two possible realities which are perhaps closest to the truth, 1. The Henry Jackson Society are either intellectually challenged and have the most despicably shoddiest research on the face of this planet or 2. They act as a front for the neo-con and new world oder agenda. The fact of the matter and reality dictates that both are true in synchrony, we will inshAllah address their disastrous culminations at a later date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We find dear readers, on on hand these Sufi Barelwis hurl allegations against the &#8216;Wahhabis&#8217; and Saudi Arabia while their on forefathers were at the forefront of Terrorism and extremism against the britisher rule. The irony and the most funny thing about these treacherous lying individuals is that they promote these teachings behind closed door in private gatherings and circles and then show another face of peace their with placards of peace and unity to the british public. We are in no doubt if these people had any real power and authority they would take active physical steps  against the Salafi&#8217;s and Ah al-Hadith.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu az-Zubayr Harrison</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A Comparison between Those Obsessed with Takfīr &amp; Bombings and Those Who Call for Peace &amp; Well- Being1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Today, many non-Muslims have entered the Arabian Peninsula for a specific set time (jobs, etc.). And many people from this country have also begun telling them about Islam, spreading offices throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia called “Taw’iyyah al-Jāliyāt” or “Community Enlightenment” offices. This has been going on for a long time now, and because of it, many people have accepted Islam. According to a comprehensive report by the “Community Enlightenment” office in Buraidah, Qaseem (a city near Riyadh) for example, as many as fifteen thousand people entered Islam between 1407 (C.E. 1986) and the beginning of 1424 (C.E. 2003). And the completion of such people’s guidance, after Allāh guided them to Islam, is that they meet sincere and righteous callers to peace and well-being, those who teach them the understanding of the religion according to the righteous predecessors, those far removed from evil innovations and issues foreign to Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, beginning in the year 1424 (C.E. 2003), some young people in this country (Saudi Arabia) were afflicted with the trials of renouncing obedience to the leaders and government and the audacity to kill non-Muslims who’ve entered our country and were promised safety and security. They claim they are “ridding the Arabian Peninsula of the disbelievers.” By doing that, they’ve brought evil upon themselves, their religion and its people, and their nation. In the “al-Qabas al-Muwaytiyyah” newspaper (no. 11137) dated the 23rd of Rabī’ al-Ākhir, 1425 (C.E. 2004), an article by Dr. Ḥamad Ibn Ibrāhīm al-‘Uthmān was published by the title: “The Ideology of Bombing in the Spotlight”. Within this article were many statements from such misguided youth (the terrorists) that have been published on a well-known internet site. The fifth reported statement says:</span></p>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Everyone must know that if they want to make us leave our ideology, the very ideology for which we were created, with which we were commanded, because of which we’ve spilled our own blood – if they want us to leave this, then let them dig up Muhammad from his grave and let him say to us, ‘Do not expel the disbelievers from the Arabian Peninsula!’ Dig him up to tell us, ‘Do not make Jihād against the disbelievers from the Arabian Peninsula!’ Dig him up to tell us, ‘You are all sinners, extremists, terrorists! You should instead renounce  ( this and repent from it.’ Only then will we listen and obey, and only to him ”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Anyone who reflects on these statements full of utmost wickedness, the extreme, harsh- heartedness of these people becomes apparent as does their blunt, discourteous manners, and their petrified, intolerant ideology. I do not even think many of the misguided youth bent on destruction within this country would approve of such speech that calls to nothing but an evil end. These people should repent and return to guidance and pay no attention to the likes of such vile statements that only show the filth, evil, meanness and shamelessness of whoever said it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The following is a summarized comparison between the actions of these misguided youth and the actions of sincere callers to peace and righteousness:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided youth accept and approve of disbelief from a nonbeliever and therefore rush him to the Fire (by killing him). They bring him out of darkness into darkness, from torture to torture. As for the sincere callers to well-being, they work to bring a nonbeliever out of darkness and into light, so that he may triumph, thereby gaining happiness and contentment in this life and the next.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided youth, by killing a nonbeliever (residing in this land) send him back to his family in a coffin so that they may be filled with hatred and resentment towards Islam and Muslims, so they may attribute to Islam what it is actually free and innocent of – all because of these misguided people. As for the sincere callers to righteousness, by inviting others to Islam, a person may return to his family as a Muslim. He becomes a member of Islam, inviting his own family and others to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided youth subject themselves to the punishment reported in the statement  of the Prophet</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Whoever kills a Muā’hid (a non-Muslim promised safety) will not even smell the fragrance of paradise even though its scent can be smelled from forty years away.”2</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As for the sincere callers, by their invitation (to Islam), they hope for rewards  promised in the statement of the Prophet</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Whoever calls to guidance, there is for him a reward for anyone who follows him without diminishing their own rewards at all.”3</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 3">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided ones, their family and relatives live in grief, distress, worry, and sadness; they regret the condition of their wicked children. The sincere callers, their family and relatives live in happiness, delight, and approval with the condition of their noble children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided ones, by their disgraceful actions, prevent people from entering Islam, damaging the reputation of the pure monotheistic religion. The sincere callers, by</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">their noble actions and their enthusiasm for Islam, work to bring nonbelievers out of darkness and into light.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided youth are a threatened people by Allāh’s statement: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>إنَّ اللّهَ َلا ُي ْصِلحُ َعمَ َل الْمُفْسِدِين </strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Certainly, Allāh does not amend the work of corruptors.[Sūrah Yūnus, 10:81]</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4"></div>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5; color: #000000;"> The misguided people were not even able to perform Jihād against their own (evil) inclinations. And they ruined themselves and others in that they’ve fallen into a form of corruption they call “Jihād”. As for the sincere callers, they perform Jihād against their own inclinations and perform a form of Jihād (struggle) with others by inviting them to Islam.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The misguided ones, by their horrible actions, become keys opening the doors to evil, locking the doors to all good. The sincere callers, by their noble actions, become keys opening the doors to all good, locking the doors to evil. In “Sunan Ibn Mājah” Anas said that Allāh’s Messenger said:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Certainly, among people are those who are keys to (the doors of) good, locking (the doors of) evil. And certainly, among people are those who are keys to (the doors of) evil, locking (the doors of) good. So, Ṭūbá (a rewarding tree in paradise) is for whomever Allāh places the keys to good upon his hands, and woe (beware or a pit in Hell) to those Allāh places the keys to evil upon his hands.”4</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And the sincere callers are a promised people by Allāh’s statement:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ينِِإَّنا َلا نُضِيعُ َأجْرَ الْمُ ْصلِح </strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Certainly, We will not allow to be lost the reward of the good-doers. [Sūrah Al-‘Arāf, 7:170]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> The misguided ones can expect a portion of what’s come in the prophet’s statement</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Whoever rebels against my nation, killing both the righteous and wicked (indiscriminately), not even sparing the devout believers, and not fulfilling the obligation towards those given a pledge (of security) – then he is not from me and I am not from him.”5</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And the sincere callers can expect a portion of what’s come in the prophet’s statement </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There are three traits a Muslim’s heart never resents: sincerity in doing actions for Allāh, offering sincere advise to those in authority, and sticking to the mainstream community (of Muslims) because certainly their supplication encompasses all around them.”6</em></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul-Azīz ar-Rājihī (1) on Suicidal Acts of “Martyrdom”(2)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Question:</strong></span> </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many people talk about acts of “martyrdom” that are carried out in Palestine and other places. So what is the ruling of actions like these? </span></p>
