<h5 style="text-align: justify"></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span><strong style="color: #000080">[60] </strong><strong><span style="color: #000080">And from the same chain of narration that from Malik from Ibn Shihab from Salim Ibn Abdullah that Abdullah Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr as-Sidiq told Abdullah Ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) from A&#8217;isha (RadhiAllahu Anha), that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see (do you not know) that when your people (the Quraysh of Makah) built the Ka’bah they fell short of the foundations of Ibrahim (Alayhisalam)?&#8221; A&#8217;isha (RadhiAllahu Anha) said, &#8220;Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam), won&#8217;t you return it to the foundations of Ibrahim (Alayhisalam)?&#8221; and the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, &#8220;If it were not that your people have only recently left kufr (disbelief) (and become Muslims), I would have done so.&#8221; </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Salim Ibn Abdullah said that Abdullah Ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) said (After he heard this that), &#8220;If A&#8217;isha (RadhiAllahu Anha) heard this from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) then I consider that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) only refrained from greeting the two corners (in tawaf) which are adjacent to the Hijr (Hatim) because the House had not been completed on the foundations of Ibrahim (Alayhisalam).&#8221; (i.e. the corners he did not touch were not the original corners of the Ka’bah) . </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri (did) anana in what I know and he narrated from Nafi’ the mawla of Ibn Umar from Abdullah Ibn Abu Bakr as-Sidiq and the hadith has many routes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta ((Yahya’s narration) 1/363, 364 hadith no.824, book 20, chapter 33, hadith no.104 and with it: he did not complement (lam yutamam)) at-Tamhid (10/26) al-Istidhkar: (no.772)    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.4484) and Muslim (399/1333) from the hadith of Malik. From Yahya Ibn Yahya’s narration and in the original: Qalaj, mistake from the publisher.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) If two matters are allowed and are established from the Qur’an and Sunnah, then in order to be safe from evil and corruption one of them does not have to be performed and can be left (temporarily).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) The Mother of the believers A’isha (RadhiAllahu Anha) said, “I find no difference if I was to pray in the Hijr (Hatim) or pray inside the House of Allah (Ka’bah) ” (al-Muwatta Yahya’s narration 1/364 hadith no.825 and its chain is [Sahih] authentic) Meaning (that) praying inside the Hatim is the same as praying inside the House of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) According to the most correct saying, whoever performs tawaf inside the Hatim that person’s tawaf is not valid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) Ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) not having knowledge of this [Sahih] authentic hadith is clear proof that some Ahadith can be unknown to even the biggest scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) It is not correct for anyone to think they have complete knowledge of all the evidences of the Shar’iah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) There is a difference of opinion regarding who built the House of Allah first. It is established from the Majestic Qur’an that the person who built the foundations of the House of Allah was Ibrahim (Alayhisalam). The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was asked which Masjid was built first? So he replied: Masjid Haram, then it was asked: what Masjid was built after that? So he replied: Masjid Aqsa, then it was asked: how long was it between the construction of these two? So he replied: 40 (years). Sahih Bukhari (hadith (no.3425)) and Sahih Muslim (hadith (no.520))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) A summarised saying of Ali (RadiAllahu Anhu) is that the people of Nuh (Alayhisalam) and the people of Ibrahim (Alayhisalam) used to live in houses however, the House of Allah is the first place of worship. Al-Mukhtar of al-Dhiya al-Maqdisi (2/60 hadith (no.438)) and al-Mustadrak of al-Hakim (2/292, 293) and its chain is [Hasan] good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) People should not be tested without necessity (when there is no need to and it can be avoided).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Publishers foreword</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alhamdullilahi Rabbil A’lamīn, Wasalatu Wasalam Ala Rasūlillahil Karīm,  Wa Ba’d</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is another translated work of Imām Badiʿ ud din Shāh ar-Rāshidī Sindhī [1416H]which had been gathering dust on the shelves and is now being presented to the reader, there are numerous other works, we pray that Allāh aids their publication, insha’Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author, the great Allāmah and Imām who was given the title of Shaikh al-Arab Wal-Ajam used to deliver lectures and lessons in the blessed sanctuary of Makkah whilst sitting in front of the Kaʿaba. He delivered this particular lecture on the 17<sup>th</sup> of Rabī al-Awwal in the year 1398 after Hijrah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Imām delivered the lecture in front of everyone in Baitullāh, Masjid al-Harām and it was considered a historical lecture. The reader will see how this great Allāmah elucidates and expounds the Prophetic Methodology in calling to Tawhīd and how he reverts the issue of Milād back to this fundamental and pivotal message.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reader will also see the phenomenal deductions of this illustrious Salafī and Ahl al-Ḥadīth multi disciplinary mountain of knowledge and how he only resorts to the Qurān. He does this so that the average listener has no choice but to reflect, ponder, accept and agree with the Qurān.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treatise aside from others is unique in the sense that it deals with the issue from the perspective of Usūl as well as debates and presents logical thought provoking arguments, which are no match even for the most progressive of the intellectuals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is essentially a transcription and translation of the original lecture, the translators have further added notes and references where needed and thus none of the footnotes are from the author himself, Rahimahullāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Last but not least the Shaikh set a challenge for anyone to prove the validity and permissibility of celebrating the Mawlid and offered a sum of 100,000 Pākistānī Rupees, bearing in mind this was approximately 38-39 years ago. This challenge of Allāmah Badīʿ ud din’s still remains and while extending it we are now offering 200,000 Pākistānī Rupees as reward.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">England.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Verily] all praise is for Allāh, we seek His help and His forgiveness. We seek refuge with Allāh from the evil of our own souls [and from our bad deeds]. Whomsoever Allāh guides will never be led astray, and whomsoever Allāh leaves astray, no one can guide. I bear witness that there is no Deity worthy of worship but Allāh, [alone and without any partner] and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allāhumma! Send blessings upon (Holy Prophet) Muhammad and upon the Progeny of (Holy Prophet) Muhammad as You sent blessings upon Ibrāhīm and upon the Progeny of Ibrāhīm; indeed, You are praiseworthy and glorious. Allāhumma! Bless (Holy Prophet) Muḥammad and the Progeny of (Holy Prophet) Muḥammad as You blessed Ibrāhīm and the Progeny of Ibrāhīm; indeed, You are praise worthy and glorious.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>O you who have believed, obey Allāh and obey the Messenger and do not invalidate your deeds. Indeed, those who disbelieved and averted [people] from the path of Allāh and then died while they were disbelievers &#8211; never will Allāh forgive them.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear friends, the beloved Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam conveyed the Dīn of Allāh to us and the methodology of every Prophet was to convey the Dīn of Allāh to their respective nations. The Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was the last of the Prophets to be sent and so he presented the complete final Dīn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Say, [O Muhammad], &#8220;O mankind, indeed I am the Messenger of Allāh to you all,”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> “And We have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><strong>[3]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Qurān continued to be revealed and likewise legal rulings of the Sharīʿah continued to be explained and expounded. The companions May Allāh be pleased with them, mentioned 10 Ayahs would be revealed and we would act upon them before the next 10 were revealed. In this way the Qurān was completely revealed and the actions (of the companions) were also complete. The Qurān was complete as well the actions.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whatever was good and beneficial for us, was made apparent and clear to us. Similarly, we were informed and warned from whatever was harmful and necessitated Allāhs anger. Thus, there is nothing that was held back from us, which we could benefit from or seek closeness to Allāh or that would benefit us in the hereafter. On the contrary, everything was explained and made clear to us, this is also the command of Allāh,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“O Messenger, announce that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, and if you do not, then you have not conveyed His message.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><strong>[5]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE DĪN WAS ALREADY COMPLETE DURING THE TIME OF THE MESSENGER OF ALLĀH (SALLALAHU ALAYHI WASALLAM)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the time for the farewell Hajj came the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam delivered his last sermon and the following ayah of the Qurān was revealed</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><strong>[6]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear friends, the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam at the time asked the companions what they would say on the Day of Judgement whether if he had conveyed the Dīn of Allāh completely. The companions replied in unity and said indeed you have truly conveyed the Dīn and guided the Ummah to goodness.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This proves whatever the Dīn entailed; all of it was conveyed and propagated. Allāh described an attribute of this revelation and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“as clarification for</strong> <strong>all things&#8230;”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><strong>[8]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> “and as a detailed explanation of all things&#8230;”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><strong>[9]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And </strong><strong>never is your</strong><strong> Lord forgetful&#8230;”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If we consult the Qurān and Sunnah, we will have knowledge of all of the issue of the Dīn. In the end the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam left this world and revelations stopped and thus, there are no new commands or prohibitions after this. Do you understand this point?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So when this is the affair and any new affair (in the Dīn) after the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam which he did not order, it was not practised during his era nor was it practised, we ask, can that be considered to be the Dīn?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have to accept that from the two possible scenarios there is only one reality, either one is incorrect, wrong, contrary to the Sharī‘ah, worthy of Allāhs punishment and an innovation in the Sharīʿah or we have to say the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam failed to convey the Dīn completely. Which essentially leads to saying the Dīn was deficient in this way and our venerated elders completed it. There is no third possibility that comes to mind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by permission of Allāh.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><strong>[11]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When we know The Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam is the final Messenger and obeying him is obligatory, it necessitates the Dīn should be complete otherwise, the people will be in need of following and obeying someone else. Furthermore Allāh encompassed the Sharīʿah in two points,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And whatever the Messenger has given you &#8211; take; and what he has forbidden you &#8211; refrain from”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><strong>[12]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After his demise there is no one who can formulate and issue legal command and rulings nor is there anyone who can prohibit or forbid any specific action. So this is the true reality and affair however we have changed the Sharīʿah; there are numerous examples for this and without mentioning all of them I can but mention a few.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We should pay attention and reflect in how much we have altered and changed the Dīn. We have totally altered the Dīn Allāh sent the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam with, the Dīn, which the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam conveyed, to us, the Dīn he practically showed us and how to practise it and he eventually left us after completing it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>SOME EXAMPLES OF ALTERATIONS IN THE DĪN</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the manners of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam that have been explained to us, one such etiquette is to recite the salutation upon hearing the name of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. We should send blessings upon hearing the name of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and similarly he informed us of the following,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The miserly person is the one who hears my name and fails to send blessings upon me.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have altered and distorted this and innovated a new method and instead of reciting and sending salutations upon the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam we have started to kiss our thumbs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask them, where did this innovated practice emanate from, is there any evidence or basis for it? Is there a ruling in the Qurān, any evidence from the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam or did the companions or anyone else practise this after the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam? Where was practise taken from? Who started this practise?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mu&#8217;adhin pronounces the Adhān, all of which is being neglected and because when he says Allāhu Akbar Allāhu Akbar which means Allāh is the greatest (there are no actions by the one who hears these words.) Have we not venerated the dead superior over and beyond Allāh. Is this not a form of rejection and denial.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>WHY ARE THE TOMBS VENERATED MORE THAN THE MASĀJID.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example a thief is caught or he is accused of stealing, however he denies these allegations. So he is told if you are truly innocent of stealing then, swear, and tell the truth? Therefore, he replies and says he is willing to swear. So he performs his ablution and then enters the masjid and whilst placing the Qurān on his head,<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> he says I swear by Allāh whilst making him my witness I did not steal nor did I see anything.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What can be more convincing than this that he swears by Allāh whilst placing the Qurān on his head inside a masjid. So whilst all of this is going on a person says I do not believe him, whereas a Muslim should accept another Muslims testimony. The person says we will only believe and accept his testimony when he does this at the grave of a holy Saint.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So if he is from Punjab he will go to the tomb ‘Alī Hujwairī, who you people have named Dhata Ganj Baksh. If he is from Multan he will go to the tomb of Baha al-Haq. If he is a Sindhi he will go to the tomb of ‘Abdul latīf Bhatai and if he is an Indian he will go to the tomb of Nizam ud Dīn Ajmeri.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, the thief should go to one of the tombs and then swear that he never stole. So then, this thief will say I feel embarrassed as I really did steal. So we ask did such a person venerate Allāh or the dead person in the grave? Did he respect the masjid more or the tomb?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So in the same way these people have negated and rejected the call, Allāh is the greatest ie Allāhu Akbar in the Adhān. The Mu&#8217;adhin says I bear witness there is no deity save Allāhs, this individual (who kisses his thumbs) also rejects this statement and establishes taghut.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allāh ordered and commanded you to visit Arafah on these specific days and you people have established specific dates in a year to visit these tombs and mausoleums. All of these visits you people undertake to these tombs and shrines are like performing Hajj and just as you perform Tawāf of the house of Allāh you people also perform Tawāf of these graves. So here also there is no Imān in the testimony, there is no deity except Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>KISSING THE THUMBS IS AN INNOVATION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mu&#8217;adhin then says I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, you people are not even willing to accept this. They say we will only do as our holy saints and Pirs say whereas we have been commanded to send salutations and blessings on the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam but we begin to kiss our thumbs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask whose Sunnah is this? There is no answer from them, I mean what answer can they even give? They will not present any Hadīth, any ayah of the Qurān nor the action of a single companion as evidence. However they inevitably always say in answer, what do you know about loving the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, this is a great action because these thumbs have nūr ie divine light hence we kiss them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask them, who even told you this? Does the Qurān or Hadīth say this? We ask them, who have you seen doing this or whose statement or opinion is it to do this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, further, there is no need for it because as you claim the nūr of Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam is in the thumbs, so here we ask what do you perform your cleanliness with? Is it with this same nūr? The same nūr on the eyes, the same nūr on your lips and the same nūr on your backsides when you are doing istinja? This is your reality, right!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>LAZINESS WITH THE PRAYER.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mu&#8217;adhin says come to prayer, do we respond and go and pray, of course we do not. The Mu&#8217;adhin says come to success, do we respond, no of course we do not. The reality is that success lies with the prayer and on the contrary we people have totally altered and changed the Sharīʿah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE RIGHTS OF THE MESSENGER OF ALLĀH SALLALAHU ALAYHI WASALLAM</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophets were sent by Allāh</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by permission of Allāh.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><strong>[15]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The right of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam is that he is followed and obeyed. Allāh explained this major principle in a few words that he Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam should be obeyed and followed and every action should be acted upon according to his way and method. This is his right yet we have changed this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>WHY SINGLE OUT ONE MONTH FOR HIS LOVE AND VENERATION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have numerous months in a year, 12 months to be precise. Do we not remember his rights in the remaining 11 months? The Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam conveyed the Dīn and Sharīʿah to us, he showed us the path of guidance, he informed us of the path of misguidance and destruction and warned us against it, so we do not remember all these things in the remaining 11 months.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people only remember the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam in this one specific month. We ask how do they even remember this month, they do so only for food, by making dishes and feeding the people (ie in festivity) and organise gatherings which they call Milād nowadays.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say ask them, where have they got this Milād from? Did Allāh order this? Did the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam command this? Did this (Milād) happen during the khilāfah of Abū Bakr as-Siddiq RadiAllāhu Anhu? Did it happen during the khilāfah of &#8216;Umar Al-Khattab RadiAllāhu Anhu? Did it happen during the khilāfah of Uthman RadiAllāhu Anhu, Ali RadiAllāhu Anhu or even during the era of Mu&#8217;awiyyah RadiAllāhu Anhu?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Did a single one of them adopt and practise this during their lifetime? It would be surprising if they themselves even knew where the Milād came from. I know where this Milād originated from, it came via parcel and I will explain this in detail.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>NOT A SINGLE PROPHET ALAYHIS SALAM CELEBRATED HIS OWN MILĀD [BIRTHDAY]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We need to see if it is permissible to celebrate this day in Islām. These people celebrate everyone&#8217;s birthday. I say, go and ask these Moulvis<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> if the birthday of a single Prophet from Ādam Alayhis Salām to Muhammad the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was celebrated, ask them is this mentioned in the Qurān, of course not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Blind Taqlīd has destroyed these people to the end of realms and the enemies overpowered them. The Islamic elements were taken away from them and replaced by this Milād in order to make them happy. Where have you got this Milād from?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ādam Alayhis Salām, who is the father of everyone was created by Allāh himself with his two hands, so it is obvious that he also has a birthday. The 12 months have always existed</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Indeed, the number of months with Allāh is twelve [lunar] months in the register of Allāh [from] the day He created the heavens and the earth;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><strong>[17]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The 12 months existed from the time Allāh created the heavens and earths, man was created later. This proves the months existed from the beginning and thus there must be a birth date for Ādam Alayhis Salām. Therefore, there must be a Milād date, when it was celebrated by either him or his offspring. Is Ādam Alayhis Salām not more deserving of his birthday being celebrated after all he is the father of the human race?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then further his wife was created from him</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“&#8230;and created from it its mate&#8230;”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><strong>[18]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, the day she was created is another day that can be celebrated (but it is not).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then it was the Messenger Nūh Alayhis Salām who was ordered by Allāh to make a ship to save himself from the storm. However, these oppressive people oppressed him so such an extent that Nūh Alayhis Salām said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“So he invoked his Lord, &#8220;Indeed, I am overpowered, so help.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><strong>[19]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He endured 950 years of their oppression, abuse and hardship. Therefore, if there was such a thing as Milād in Islām then the Milād of Nūh Alayhis Salām should be celebrated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then came Ibrāhīm Alayhis Salām who was subjected to specific favours by the people and he passed every test levied against him, Allāh said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham was tried by his Lord with commands and he fulfilled them. [ Allāh ] said, &#8220;Indeed, I will make you a leader for the people.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><strong>[20]</strong></a> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Ibrāhīm Alayhis Salām was tested and put through trials and he remained steadfast and patient and Allāh declared him to be the Imām of the world. So should not have this Milād been for the Imām of the world.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Did the people of Ibrāhīm Alayhis Salām celebrate his birthday, can even anyone tell us? The one who offered numerous sacrifices and was willing to sacrifice his son when Allāh ordered him. He left his wife and young child in the desolate land where there was no one, no residents, there was no water, and there was nothing to eat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was ordered to leave them there and he obeyed. When he left them, he was ordered not to look back and he obeyed. His wife said to him are you leaving us due to your own accord or due to the command of Allāh. He replied and says due to Allāhs command. His father asks him to leave his house and the whole nation is ardent in tormenting and opposing him, they say</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“They said, &#8220;Burn him and support your gods..”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><strong>[21]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the answer of Abraham&#8217;s people was not but that they said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;Kill him or burn him,&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><strong>[22]</strong></a> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then from Allāhs infinite mercy the fire in unable to burn him. We ask is this something that is well established or not? Is this person not worthy that his birthday be celebrated ie his Milād be celebrated or that he be remembered?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>REMEMBRANCE IS BY ACTIONS AND NOT BY CELEBRATING MILĀD.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Remembrance is an action and birth is something common and so remembering or remembrance is an action, are you understanding what I am saying? So remembering someone is by an action. Ibrāhīm offered a sacrifice and Allāh made it a Sunnah for us, he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And when they had both submitted and he put him down upon his forehead, We called to him, &#8220;O Abraham, You have fulfilled the vision.&#8221; Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good. Indeed, this was the clear trial. And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice, And We left for him [favorable mention] among later generati</strong><strong>ons:”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><strong>[23]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Allāh kept the Sunnah of Ibrāhīm Alayhis Salām continuous and not his Milād or birthday. This practice and example is of the Jews and Christians who abandon the actions but remember the birthdays or Milād. Do you understand this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allāh kept the Sunnah ie the action of Ibrāhīm Alayhis Salām alive and continuous and not his birthday or Milād and now millions of people offer this sacrifice here in Makkah (and around the world). This is the real meaning and intent of remembering someone that they are remembered through their actions. This is what they did and we shall also do the same.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So now if we need to look at anyone&#8217;s actions then let us look at the actions of Ismā‘īl Alayhis Salām who was ready to be sacrificed,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“He said, &#8220;O my father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if Allāh wills, of the steadfast.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><strong>[24]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Ismā‘īl Alayhis Salām is someone who should be remembered in this way and his birth day or Milād should be celebrated as his birth was indeed a great and magnificent one. Ibrāhīm Alayhis Salām while praising and glorifying Allāh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Praise to Allāh, who has granted to me in old age Ismā</strong><strong>ʿ</strong><strong>īl</strong><strong>l and Ishāq. Indeed, my Lord is the Hearer of sup</strong><strong>plications.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"><strong>[25]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, if there was this concept of Milād or celebrating birthdays then the Milād of these two Prophets should have been celebrated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So now, let&#8217;s mention Yaḥya Alayhis Salām and how Allāh bestowed him upon Zakariyyah Alayhis Salām. Zakariyyah Alayhis Salām supplicates to Allāh in his old age and Allāh grants him a child. When the Angels come to give him the glad tidings, what does he say?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“He said, &#8220;My Lord, how will I have a boy when my wife has been barren and I have reached extreme old age?”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"><strong>[26]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> “[An angel] said, &#8220;Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, &#8216;It is easy for Me”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"><strong>[27]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then Allāh granted him a child with the following attributes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“So the angels called him while he was standing in prayer in the chamber, &#8220;Indeed, Allāh gives you good tidings of Yahya, confirming a word from Allāh and [who will be] honorable, abstaining </strong><strong>and a prophet from among the righteous.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"><strong>[28]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And dutiful to his parents, and he was not a disobedient tyrant. And peace be upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is raised alive.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"><strong>[29]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So was this Prophet Alayhis Salām not worthy that his Milād be celebrated if Milād was permissible? I say tell me, I say go and ask the people (who celebrate Mawlid) how many years did Zakariyyah Alayhis Salām celebrate his son’s birthday? Yaḥya Alayhis Salām did not even celebrate his own Milād and there is no evidence whatsoever that he ever did.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now let us move onto Mūsa Alayhis Salām who was an honourable Messenger of Allāh and the one who Allāh spoke to and he said specifically,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And Allāh spoke to Moses with [direct] speech.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><strong>[30]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“[Allāh] said, &#8220;O Moses, I have chosen you over the people with My messages and My words [to you].”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"><strong>[31]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a most memorable person, the Mūsa Alayhis Salām via which Allāh saved and freed an oppressed nation whose sons would be slaughtered and their daughters would be taken away. Allāh said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>slaughtering their [newborn] sons and keeping their females alive.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"><strong>[32]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Were they freed from slavery or not? How was this possible? It was through the efforts of Mūsa Alayhis Salām, his dawah and call. His dawah and continuous effort was rewarded and Allāh freed his nation who had no honour. He said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And We caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit the eastern regions of the land and the western ones, which We had blessed. And the good word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of what they had patiently endured. And We destroyed [all] that Pharaoh and his people were producing and what they had been building.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"><strong>[33]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Firaun would continuously oppress them, he would slaughter their children and weaken them wherever they went intending to render them insignificant. Allāh changed this and eventually made this nation wealthy and prosperous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mūsa Alayhis Salām was not a normal personality to the extent the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said on the Day of Dudgement the earth will open for me first and I will see Mūsa Alayhis Salām holding onto the ʿArsh.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is not a normal personality, did anyone celebrate his Milād or did his nation celebrate his Milād? Did his brother Harūn Alayhis Salām celebrate his Milād? Of course not and neither is there a shred of evidence for it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now the turn of Isa Alayhis Salām who was miracle in himself as Allāh created him without a father and his birth has been mentioned in the Qurān as follows,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said, &#8220;O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented. O sister of Harūn, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"><strong>[35]</strong></a> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maryam Alayhis Salām was pregnant and when the people saw an unmarried woman was pregnant, they questioned her. She was unmarried and they said to her she had dishonoured the families and her parents were not like this nor had they raised her to be like this. Where did the child come from. So Maryam Alayhis Salām,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“So she pointed to him.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36"><strong>[36]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">She said ask the child, they replied how can we speak to this child,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“They said, &#8220;How can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child?”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37"><strong>[37]</strong></a> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They said to her, first you bear a child without a husband and then you are asking us to speak to the child, when Allāh at that very moment gave Isa Alayhis Salām speech and he said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“[Isa] said, &#8220;Indeed, I am the servant of Allāh. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet. And He has made me blessed wherever I am and has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah as long as I remain alive And [made me] dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me a wretched tyrant. And peace is on me the day I was born and the day I will die and the day I am raised alive.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38"><strong>[38]</strong></a> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What a great Prophet he was but did the Muslims celebrate his Milād? Did our Prophet celebrate it? Of course he did not and that is because there is no such concept of Milād in Islām.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This custom and new practise was formulated by the Europeans and Christians so that the true Dīn is abandoned and the Muslims act on fabricated customs. They had two motives, the first being to engage the Muslims into innovations and evil practices and to cause dissension and disunity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You know the Islamic calendar is Hijrī and we are in 1398H, why is it called Hijrah? Meaning that Hijrī began after the Hijrah or migration and so if Milād was permissible the Islamic calendar should have started from his birthday. Having Imān on the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam became obligatory upon us after he reached the age of 40 when he received his Prophethood. Therefore we were not commanded to have Imān in him before the age of 40 and nor did the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam know about his Prophethood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And you were not expecting that the Book would be conveyed to you.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"><strong>[39]</strong></a> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And thus We have revealed to you an inspiration of Our command. You did not know what is the Book or [what is] faith,”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"><strong>[40]</strong></a> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE PROPHET MESSENGER OF ALLĀH SALLALAHU ALAYHI WASALLAM HAS TWO STATUS&#8217;S</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first is Muhammad Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam bin ‘Abdullah and the second as Muhammad the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. These people accept the first status only and not the second because if they did, they would have accepted and adopted his way as well as the Dīn he conveyed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, they would not have formulated and fabricated their own Dīn and set up their Sūfī patrons, which they adopted as the Dīn. All of this points to the fact that these people do not accept the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam but only accept Muhammad bin Abdullah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. The companions believed and accepted the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and made Hijrah with him from Makkah to Madīnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the Hijrah the Islamic laws were implemented and the Islamic state was set up. If he wanted, he could have started the Islamic calendar from his birth date but rather he began it from the date of Hijrah where the Islamic rulings and laws were implemented.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, for the Muslims the date of Hijrah was important and monumental. They ask what the date is and we say today is the 17th of Rabi ul-Awwal 1398H and where did this date start from? It started from the Hijrah when the Islamic government was established. When the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was born, even the Mushriks were not against him, nor were the Jews.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The idol worshipping mushriks were not against him and in fact they used to praise him. However when Islām came they opposed him and abandoned him. You people are also opposing the true Islām and want to join the opposers of Islām.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If Milād was something permissible in Islām the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam would have celebrated it himself. He lived for another 23 years after Prophethood of which 13 years were in Makkah, did he once celebrate his own Milād?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then he lived in Madīnah for another 10 years; did he celebrate his Milād once? Then it was the khilāfah of Abū Bakr RadiAllāhu Anhu and Umar RadiAllāhu Anhu which lasted for 2 and 10 years respectively; did they celebrate the Milād of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. Then it was the khilāfah of Uthmān RadiAllāhu Anhu and Ali RadiAllāhu Anhu who was a close relative; did they celebrate his Milād?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They boldly claim this is our love for the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, this is not love but rather it is deception as this is not the criteria for loving the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. One must remember this method of love originates from the Christians and this is not the way the Muslims show love.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE CRITERIA OF LOVING</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The criteria for loving the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam is following and obeying him as the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam himself said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Whosoever loves my Sunnah indeed loves me and whoever loves me will be with me in Jannah.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, whoever loves the Sunnah truly loves the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, however these people dislike and hate the Sunnah and it frustrates them. The Sunnah causes these people anxiety, they get angry with the Sunnah, they get annoyed at it and yet they claim they are Muslims upon the Sunnah and they have no shame.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people should die of shame who fabricate their own madhabs. If you people truly loved the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, you would not need to innovate nor fabricate a madhab other than the way and madhab of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. These people have set up Taghuts and yet they claim love for the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and after great difficulty their love for the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam is apparent for only one month.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE SUNNAH (WAY) OF ABŪ LAHAB</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you ask them, where they got the Milād celebration from, organising gatherings and distributing food? If you ask them, is this permissible in Islām? They will say, Oh Abū Lahab, who was an open enemy of Islām did such and such.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They say after his death someone had a dream, look at their evidences and please think about this, so they say in the dream they saw Abū Lahab and he had milk and honey on his fingers which he was eating (licking). So they asked him how this blessing came about? He replied that when the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was born I freed a slave in celebration and happiness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Glory be to Allāh, is a dream the Sharī‘ah now? Who says this, Abū Lahab (does he have a VIP status in hell licking milk and honey of his fingers- we seek refuge in Allāh) the Qurān says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he. His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained. He will [enter to] burn in a Fire of [blazing] flame And his wife [as well] &#8211; the carrier of firewood. Around her neck is a rope of [twisted] fiber.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42"><strong>[42]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the Qurān is a lie and Abū Lahab is truthful? We seek great refuge in Allāh. Abū Lahab and his wealth were destroyed, his wealth did not benefit him in the slightest. The female slave was a part of his wealth and the Qurān says nothing will benefit him and you people are saying he benefited.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So shall we believe you people or the Qurān? It is clear that you people are liars, as are those you imitate. You have also admitted this is Abū Lahabs Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>AN OPEN CHALLENGE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I will tell you the truth but tell us where is the evidence in Islām for this. It is not established or proven from a single companion, successor and their successors. You people formulated 4 or 5 madhabs, Hanafī, Shāf‘ī, Mālikī, Hanbalī and Ja‘farī, did a single one of them celebrate Milād and if you prove a single one of them celebrated Milād. in challenge I will give you 100,000 rupees as reward, even if you prove it from a single Imām from amongst the five.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people have no basis at all. Then the period of the third century started which was the period of the scholars of Hadīth and Fiqh and celebrating Milād is not established from them. Neither is anything established from the 4th century. Then the fifth century started in which there were tribulations but this innovation was still unheard of. So we ask them, tell us if any Muslim celebrated the Milād in the fifth century?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>WHEN DID CELEBRATING THIS CUSTOMARY MILĀD BEGIN</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This innovation started in the sixth century when a king started this practice. Suyūti writes in al-Hāwī that a king started this custom of Milād. A Moulvi thought he could personally benefit from it and hence wrote a small treatise on the subject and sent it to the king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He informed him that celebrating Milād would be beneficial as gatherings will be organised remembering and venerating the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, there will be dhikr, numerous poor orphans will be fed and the people will think the king has organised something praiseworthy. Therefore, the Moulvi sent the treatise to the king. The King sent 2,000 gold coins to the Moulvi.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As a result this satanic Moulvi set himself up for the year with the gift money and this innovation became prevalent in every household which neither Allāh or his Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam ordained. So this is the true affair which you people have changed to the Dīn. Whoever does or accept this celebrating of the Milād you people excommunicate and declare them to be unbelievers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE SUNNAH OF FIRAUN</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Where did the King get this Bidʿah from, I think this should also be clarified. He first looked at the bible and read the birthday of Firaun was celebrated and even until this day, the bible mentions his birthday was celebrated in the third year. So, this Milād and celebrating the birthday is Firauns Sunnah. During the same era Mūsa and Harūn Alayhis Salām were Prophets. The Qurān says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance and light. The prophets who submitted [to Allāh ] judged by it for the Jews, as did the rabbis and scholars by that with which they were entrusted of the Scripture of Allāh , and they were witnesses thereto&#8230;”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44"><strong>[44]</strong></a> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There were numerous Prophets during that era and these people would kill the Prophets, which is mentioned in the Qurān. The orientalists also mention this, that one day they killed numerous prophets, this is all well documented in the books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Do any of these books mention that they celebrated the Milād of these prophets? It only mentions Firaun as the person whose birthday was celebrated but not of the prophets. Thus, it is a Sunnah of Firaun and not the Sunnah of the Prophets. In later years, the Christians adopted this practise and they continue to celebrate their prophets birthday, which is his Milād.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A well known Christian Priest who was also a debator, whose name was baraktullah who authored a book called &#8216;Tumi Rasūl&#8217;. Tumi was probably a prophet according to them and this priest authored his biography. He writes, that as long as we were at his grave (ie of Tumi) we would celebrate his birthday or make Milād. The people would gather and a huge number of tents would set up because there were thousands of people. Later when the Muslims increased in number our celebrations, festivities and Milād stopped. We ask now, is celebrating Milād the religion of the Muslims or the Christians?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam your Pirs have set up numerous Sūfī tariqahs like for example Suharwardī, Naqshbandī, Chistī and numerous others and so did Abdul Qādir al-Jilānī celebrate the Milād of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Where will you people get the evidence from, even he was from the fifth century. So, this is the affair of your Islām. The main issue was obeying, loving and following the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and these are things, which have been abandoned and neglected. Instead, we have been given one day in the whole year to make sweet dishes in order to show our great and immense love for the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask, was this the belief of the companions and successors? All the righteous people who have passed, was this their belief? Of course it was not as this is totally wrong! What we will rather find is you people saying oh such and such person said this or such and such person said that etc&#8230; Let me remind you, the statement of any righteous or holy Saint does not constitute Sharī‘ah as this is only the statement of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>DEAR FRIENDS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no such thing as celebrating the Milād of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, from the time of Ādam Alayhis Salām till the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam himself, no one celebrated Milād. What you will rather find is that this is from the Firaunis and the Christians as this is their Sunnah which has no basis with the Muslims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If this was a sign and a characteristic of loving the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam then who was more loving of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam than the companions? We say prove celebrating Milād from a single companion? We are willing to accept the celebrations of the Milād even if you show evidence from Ali, Fatima, Hasan, Hussain and the mother of the believers RaḍiAllāhu Anhum Ajmaʿīn that they celebrated it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How can something be a part of the Sharī‘ah when it has no evidence whatsoever, dear readers these are our thoughts and situation!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A STRANGE DECEPTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Today we have totally altered the Shariah, which has paved the way for numerous other issues. For example in the Milād gatherings, the men and women freely mix.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At some stage in their festivities, they are asked to stand up because the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam has come! Oh slaves of Allāh, the Milād is celebrated by thousands of people in various places so how can the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam be present everywhere in every gathering! How did you invite the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam in the first place and when? What a deception and what sheer treachery.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They further fabricated the belief that whoever celebrates Milād will be saved from Allāhs wrath and the torment of the fire of hell!!! This is totally false and absolute nonsense, no one can be saved except through actions. Allāh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>Paradise is not [obtained] by your wishful thinking nor by that of the People of the Scripture. Whoever does a wrong will be recompensed for it, and he will not find besides Allāh a protector or a helper</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, while being a believer &#8211; those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged, [even as much as] the speck on a date seed.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"><strong>[46]</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If someone does evil deeds it will not benefit him and if however a person does righteous deeds, it will benefit him and lead him to paradise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>EXPRESSING LOVE IS DECISIVE BY ACTIONS, NOT MERE CLAIMS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If celebrating the Milād were permissible and praiseworthy, the companions would have most definitely celebrated it and expressed their love for the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. They loved the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and this is why some of them left their families, wives and children. The Qurān says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties, seeking bounty from Allāh and [His] approval and supporting Allāh and His Messenger, [there is also a share]. Those are the truthful.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47"><strong>[47]</strong></a> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What love do these people have as they can not even accept one Sunnah of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. As soon as a Hadīth is mentioned, these people remember their grandfathers or their Pirs. The companions were a group of people that whenever they heard a command of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam they would immediately act upon it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE EXAMPLE OF THE COMPANIONS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A question was posed to Abdullah Ibn Abbas RadiAllāhu Anhu and normally in our community you will hear someone often say oh Haji so and so said, I say what status do these people have. Anyway an issue was presented and he replied the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said such and such. The man replied but Abū Bakr and Umar RadiAllāhu Anhu said something else. Ibn Abbas replied, do you not fear the punishment of Allāh, if not that the earth will swallow you or the heavens unleash on you, I am telling you the statement of Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and your telling me so and so said.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a> What can show more love than this for the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another incident was regarding the leaders of the hypocrites, Abdullāh bin Ubayy bin Salūl. He had a son named Abdullāh who was an honest and true Muslim. One day a person filled his ears and said to him the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam wants to murder your father. The aim of the person was to cause enmity and animosity between Abdullāh and the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and thus leave him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Abdullāh went to the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam directly and said, oh Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam I have heard this and if it is true I wish that you give me this order only to me and I will bring you his head. I fear if you were to give the command to anyone else, I would end up fighting them and if I was to kill him I&#8217;ll be destined for the fire of Hell for the sake of a disbeliever. The Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam replied, I did not It issue any such order and this is nothing but a false thought.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Dīn is only correct by obeying and following the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and this is what salvation lies in. Supplicate to Allāh that he keeps us on the straight path. Amin</span></p>

Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Your Message to them?&#8217; &#8221; Ibn </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Abbās added, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the following was his will (Prophet&#8217;s will) to his followers:&#8211;It is incumbent upon those who are present to convey this information to those who are absent Beware don&#8217;t renegade (as) disbelievers (turn into infidels) after me, Striking the necks (cutting the throats) of one another.”</em> [Bukhārī no.1739]. A variation also occurs in Ṣaḥiḥ Muslim via the Ḥadīth of Abd Allāh ibn Jābir RaḍiAllāhu Anhu <em>“</em><em>I have left among you the Book of Allāh, and if you hold fast to it you would never go astray. And you would be asked about me what would you say? They said: &#8220;We bear witness that you have conveyed (the message), discharged (the ministry of Prophethood) and given wise (sincere) counsel.&#8221; He (the narrator) said: &#8220;He (the Prophet) then raised his forefinger toward the sky and pointed it at the people (and said): &#8220;O Allāh, bear witness, O Allāh, bear witness.”</em> [Muslim, [4:38-43].</span></p>

The Shaikh mentions it here for the average person to be able to relate to the common practice and thus understand the point. We say although this practise is bāṭil it weighs much more than the ignorant Ashʿarī’s who say Allāh’s Kalām ie speech is internal where as the average person believes the Qurān is the Speech of Allāh and hence the reason why they hold it over their heads!!! </span></p>
