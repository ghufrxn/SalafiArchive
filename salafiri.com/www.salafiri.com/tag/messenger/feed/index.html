				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the greatest blessings and favours of Allaah upon his creation is that he instils a lot of love in their heart for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). The people of iman have a great desire and fervour to know and understand the ways and means they can achieve the love of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and that it remains continuous</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With the aid of Allaah, the attempt is to know such means and ways in loving Allah and then to convey this to others, so that they benefit from them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One should not forget the obligation of loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). It is obligatory upon every Muslim that he loves the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) more than anything from amongst his love for anything from the creation. An evidence for this is what we find from the hadith which Imam Bukhari has transmitted from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;Verily the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, &#8220;I swear by the one in whose hand my soul is in, none of you is a believer up until I am more beloved to you than your father and child.&#8221; </i>(Sahih al-Bukhari, The Book of Iman, Chapter Loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is part of Iman no.14 1/58)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith which elucidates this point is what Imaam Muslim has transmitted from Anas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><i>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, &#8220;No one is a believer until I am more beloved to him than his family, wealth and the whole of mankind.&#8221; </i>(Sahih Muslim, The Book of Iman, Chapter The obligation of loving the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) more than ones family, father, child and more than mankind, no.69 (44) 1/68)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the Quran warns us of the punishment for every individual who loves his father, child, brothers, wives, tribe, wealth, business or houses more than jihad and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). Allaah the most high said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>&#8220;Say, [O Muhammad], &#8220;If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jihad in His cause, then wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.&#8221; (Soorah at-Taubah:24)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafidh Ibn Kathir said in explanation of this ayah, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;If these things are more beloved to you, more than Allah, the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and doing jihad in the way of Allah, then await for the type of punishment that will befall you.&#8221; (Tafsir Ibn Kathir 2/378)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Qurtubi said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;This ayah elucidates the obligation of loving Allah and his Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and there is no difference of opinion in that, furthermore this love has precedence over loving anything else.&#8221; (Tafsir Qurtubi 8/95)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When a person understands this and he places before him the reality that his iman will be incomplete up until he loves the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) more than anything from the creation. In such an instance with the aid of Allah love and passion for the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will increase further in its intensity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This reality is clearly proven from a Hadith which Imam Bukhari has transmitted from Abdullah.Â </span><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to always remember Allah and also seek the fruits and merits of loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is not in need of our love at all. Allaah the most merciful has excluded him and exalted him from this. We attain and achieve great blessings and fruits in this world and in the hereafter by loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). Loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is from the means of tasting the sweetness of Imam in this world.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim have transmitted a narration from Anas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;There are three things which if a person possesses are from the sweetness of Iman, that one loves Allaah and his Messenger more than anything, whoever he loves he does so for the sake of Allaah and he dislikes returning to disbelief just as he would dislike be thrown in the fire.&#8221;</i> (Sahih al-Bukhari 1/60 no.16, Sahih Muslim 1/66 no.67 (43)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore from the mercy of Allaah is that the one who loves the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will achieve a great reward due to being neighbour in Paradise which has everlasting and eternal bounties.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim have transmitted a narration from Abdullah ibn Mas&#8217;ood (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;A man came to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and said, &#8220;Oh Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) what do you say about a man who loves a nation but he is not able to meet them?&#8221; The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) replied, &#8220;A person will be with who he loves.&#8221; (Sahih al-Bukhari 10/557 no.6169, Saheeh Muslim 4/2034 no.165 (2640)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The saying of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;will be with who he loves.&#8221; means he will be with him in Paradise.</i> (Refer to Umdah tul-Qari 22/197)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When a person is aware and knows the great benefits and blessing of loving the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) he will always remember him and never forget him. With the grace of Allaah, showers of love for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will emanate from his heart which will expand and increase because the human disposition is such that it loves beneficial things and so it will attempt to attain and achieve this as much as possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One should never neglect the favours of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).</span>Â <span style="color: #000000;">It has been instilled in a humans nature that he loves the individual who shares his times of sadness, sorrow, and pain and who also tries to help him in this regard and also tries to benefit him with good. It is famous from olden times that, &#8216;Love has been instilled in the hearts for those who do favours.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in attempting to inform and highlight every beneficial and good thing to the Muslim Ummah he would emphatically struggle. Allaah the most high himself has testified to this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>&#8220;Th</b></span><span style="color: #000000;"><b>ere has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. Grievous to him is what you suffer; [he is] concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful.&#8221; (Soorah at-Taubah:128)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) wishing good and looking out for the Ummah was to such an extent that he would be sad and upset due to the people not accepting the truth (about Islaam) and he would be so engrossed in this it was feared he would end up losing his life. The Lord of all knowing himself said about this</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>&#8220;Then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them, [O Muhammad], if they do not believe in this message, [and] out of sorrow.&#8221; (Soorah al-Kahf:6)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to this Allaah has also prohibited us from being severely upset over someone not accepting Islaam, he said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Then is one to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive so he considers it good [like one rightly guided]? For indeed, Allah sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So do not let yourself perish over them in regret. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what they do.&#8221; (Soorah al-Faatir:8)</span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now that we know the Message of the Prophets was Tawheed it follows that it is such an important issue that all the Prophets and Messengers where sent to explain this message, Allah the most high said<span id="more-808"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Accordingly, we sent to every community a Messenger, saying,Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âWorship Allah and keep away from the taghut.Â  After that Allah showed guidance to some of them, while deviation took hold of others.Â  So, roam about in the earth and behold what has been the end of the rejectors of the Messengers (Soorah an-Nahl 16:36)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To propagate this message, sacred Books and Scrolls were revealed and the final book, the Quraan was revealed to the final Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). Its purpose was to spread the message and call of Tawheed and to make it manifest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Most High says,Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âThis [Quraan] is notification for the people that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that He is but one God and that those of understanding will be reminded.â (Soorah Ibraheem 14:52)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather every verse clearly or indirectly establishes and manifests Tawheed and this is what Shaikh-ul-Islaam Abul Wafaa Thanaullah Amristsari said in this treatise Kalimah Tayyibah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the most high says,Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âAlif, Lam, Ra. [This is] a Book whose verses are perfected and then presented in detail from [one who is] Wise and Acquainted. Through a messenger, saying, âDo not worship except Allah. Indeed, I am to you from Him a warner and a bringer of good tidings.â (Soorah Hud 11:1-2)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The prophets had to endure many trials and tribulations and this was due to the call to Tawheed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the most high says,Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âSimilarly, there came not to those before them any messenger except that they said, âA magician or a madman.â (Soorah adh-Dhariyat 51:52)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">AndÂ </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âIndeed, We are sufficient for you against theÂ  mockers. Who make [equal] with Allah another deity. But they are going to know.â (Soorah al-Hijr 15:95-96)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And his saying,Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âAnd they resented them not except because they believed in Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy.â (Soorah Al-Buruj 85:8)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right â only because they say, âOur Lord is Allah.â And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of Allah is much mentioned. And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might. (Soorah Al-Haj 22:40)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And ,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Â <strong>âIt is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion. And sufficient is Allah as Witness.â (Soorah Al-Fath 48:28)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same happened with the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam),Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âAnd they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves. And the disbelievers say, âThis is a magician and a liar.â (Soorah Sad 38:4)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Â <strong>âWe have not heard of this in the latest religion. This is not but a fabrication.â (Soorah Sad 38:7)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) had to face many troubles from those who opposed him as Allah informs us,Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âYou will surely be tested in your possessions and in yourselves. And you will surely hear from those who were given the Scripture before you and from those who associate others with Allah much abuse. But if you are patient and fear Allah â indeed, that is of the matters [worthy] of determination.â (Soorah Ale-Imraan 3:186)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There were many wars at different places and in approximately a period of nine years, the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) participated in 24 wars, examples are Uhud, Badr Hunain and Tabook. These where all for the sake of Tawheed of Allah (his oneness and to establish it)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the most high says,Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âAnd fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah. And if they cease â then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do.â (Soorah Al âAnfal 8:39)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During the Makkan period the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) had to face harm and problems. Examples included verbal abuse, insults, being hit and beaten, he was abandoned socially and all association with him was prohibited. He faced days of isolation in Shuab Abee Taallib and finally he had to migrate to Madeenah, and upon leaving he saidÂ </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>âI swear by Allah for verily you are the best land of Allah and the most beloved land of Allah from Allahâs land and if I was not expelled from you I would not leaveâ</em>Â (Tirmidhee and Ibn Majah)Â Â Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The whole reason for these troubles and problems was the call to Tawheed and whenever the Messenger ofÂ  Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) sentÂ  any callers to Islam to any place he would tell them to call to Tawheed first. Hence when he sent Muadh Ibn Jabal to Yemen he said to him,Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>âLet the first thing you call to be Tawheed (Oneness of Allah)â</em>Â (Bukhaari no. 7372)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As this is the basis for all actions to be accepted Allaah the most high said,Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âAnd it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allah, your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers.â (Soorah Az-Zumar 39:65)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is in fact Tawheed which inclines you towards doing righteous actions as this leads to believing and having faith in Allah and this is what expels all fear of other things and those entities with whom hope is associated with. It is these two things i.e. hope and fear which incline the heart to do righteous deeds. The people who have difficulty understanding this as Allah himself and the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) have mentioned therefore have a problem in distinguishing between Allah and other than him who are falsely worshipped.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the same manner the people who ask other than Allah for help and seek their assistance, do so because they seek salvation and redemption by asking them to intercede for them to solve their problems or illnesses and they hold this as their Aqeedah, they become totally lost and oblivious of the fear of Allah. They constantly think of their false deities and intermediateries and think of them when in need and hope for their intercession.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The doors of bad deeds and sins remain open for them and they distance themselves from the truth. It is the greatness of Tawheed by which a believer can remain firm and steadfast on good and righteous deeds, good manners and Eeman.Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âThere shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.â (Soorah Baqarah 2:256)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âAnd whoever submits his face to Allah while he is a doer of good â then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold. And to Allah will be the outcome of [all] matters.â (Soorah Luqman 31:22)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tawheed can make mankind remain firm in this life. Allah says,Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âYou worship not besides Him except [mere] names you have named them, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. Legislation is not but for Allah. He has commanded that you worship not except Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.â (Soorah Yusuf 12:40)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And with this the Muslim Ummah (nation) can remain unified and firm upon. Allah says,Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âHe has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus â to establish the religion and not be divided therein. Difficult for those who associate others with Allah is that to which you invite them. Allah chooses for Himself whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him].â (42:13)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With the greatness of Tawheed the disheartened heart will unite and will be purified of jealously and hatred. Allah says,Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âNever will your relatives or your children benefit you; the Day of Resurrection He will judge between you. And Allah, of what you do, is Seeing.â (Soorah Al-Mumtahanah 60:3)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Calling to Tawheed and spreading its message is the norm and is a sign of the followers of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and they are the true inheritors in spreading and propagating this message, Allah says, Say,Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>âThis is my way; I invite to Allah with insight, I and those who follow me. And exalted is Allah; and I am not of those who associate others with Him. (Soorah Yusuf 12:108)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Tawheed sits firmly in the hearts of the people every tribulation to befall them will become easy. For example the proclaiming of Allah is One. An example of this is when Bilaal al-Habshee(RadhiAllaah Anhu) was made to lie in the blazing heat on top of burning coals and rocks, Khabeeb Juaânee (RadhiAllaah Anhu) requesting to read two rakah (units) of prayer before being martyred, the crying of Khalid bin Waleed (RadhiAllaah Anhu) at the time of his death for the longing of martyrdom when his body was riddled with pain, similarly having patience when food and sustenance was scarceÂ  at the battle of Tabook, the patience of the female companions upon the slaying of their children and we find many examples like this in the history of Islaam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of this shows and indicates these people understood Tawheed from the depths of their hearts and believed in it firmly and this is that sweetness of Eeman (faith) which is mentioned in authentic ahadeeth, that the one who will taste the sweetness of Eemaan is he who possesses three attributes, It is reported on the authority of Anas (RadhiAllaah Anhu) that the Prophet of Allaah said:Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>âThere are three qualities for which anyone who is characterised by them will relish the sweetness of faith: he to whom Allaah and His Messenger are dearer than all else; he who loves a man for Allaahâs sake alone; and he who has as great an abhorrence of returning to unbelief after Allaah has rescued him from it as he has of being cast into Hell.â</em>Â (Saheeh MuslimÂ <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.67</span>)</span></p>
