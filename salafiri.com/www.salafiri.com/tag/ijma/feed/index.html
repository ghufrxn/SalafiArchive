				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Setting the Foundations</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hamza Yusuf</strong></span> in a youtube video attempts to misue the hadith, &#8220;<strong>Verily you shall conquer Constantinople. What a wonderful leader will her (army) leader be, and what a wonderful army will that army be</strong>&#8221; to claim Allah&#8217;s Messenger Prophecised this blessed leader will be Sultan Muhammad Fatih (Mehmed II) and since he was a Maturidi, Allah&#8217;s Messenger ﷺ blessed the Maturidiyyah!!! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hamza Yusuf </strong></span>begins by stating the Muslims had no councils to determine what orthodoxy is and isn’t, this sets the foundations for his later claim that the Ummah agreed upon 3 schools of Aqidah (Ash’ariyyah, Maturidiyyah, Athariyyah), and all praise is for Allah who gave us proofs to follow the Salaf in his Majestic Book:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>And the foremost to embrace Islâm of the Muhâjirûn (those who migrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and the Ansâr (the citizens of Al-Madinah who helped and gave aid to the Muhâjirûn) and also those who followed them exactly (in Faith). Allâh is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success. [At-Tawbah : 100]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">And as has come in the <strong>Sunnah</strong> regarding the excellence of the Salaf:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">A man asked the Prophet ﷺ which of the people are best, He ﷺ said, “The generation I am in, then the second (after) then the third (after them).” (<strong>Sahih Muslim</strong> no.2536)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">So once the superiority of the Salaf has been established, we can return to the works of the Salaf and their students who wrote <strong>Ijma’ (consensus)</strong> works establishing the true Aqidah of Ahlus-Sunnah and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>compare this to the Aqidah of the latecomers of the Asha’irah and Maturidis who followed their forefathers from the Jahmiyyah in the Sifat of Allah (attributes)</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Abu Hatim and Abu Zur’ah (Ar-Raziyayn)</strong> said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“We reached the scholars of all the cities of <strong>Hijaz, Iraq, Egypt, Sham, and Yemen, and this was from their madhab (position)</strong>: Iman is speech and action, increasing and decreasing….And they also prohibited from joining the sittings of Ahlul-Kalam and looking into the books of the Mutakallimin, and they both would say: “Sahibul Kalam will not be successful, ever.” (<strong>Aqidah ar-Raziyayn: Sharh Usool Al-I&#8217;tiqad Ahlus Sunnah</strong> of Lalaka&#8217;i 1:137, (Dar Al-Hadith: Cairo, 1420H/2003CE)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">This shows agreement of the Salaf on matters of belief and the fundamentals of Islam; this was the orthodoxy of the Muslims and what they unanimously agreed upon on matters of belief.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">And <strong>Imam</strong> <strong>Harb b. Isma’il</strong>, the Scholar of Kirman, companion of Imam Ahmad, said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“This is the madhab of Imams of knowledge and the people of athar and Ahlus Sunnah who are known to hold onto it and who are followed in it from the Companions of the Prophet Sallalahu alayhi Wasallam until our time. And I met whoever I was able to meet from the scholars of <strong>Iraq, Hijaz, Sham</strong> and other lands and whoever opposed anything from these Madhahib or critices them or faults those who adopt it then he is an opposer, an innovator who leaves the Jama’ah and deviated from the Manhaj of the Sunnah and the path of truth…” (Harb b. Isma’il al-Kirmani, <strong>Ijma’ As-Salaf Fil I’tiqad</strong> of (p.33-34), Dar Al-Imam Ahmad, 2nd Edition, 1433H/2012CE)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">He continued and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“Al-Iman is in speech, deeds, intention, and holding onto the Sunnah.” And “Whoever claims that ma’rifah (i.e. acknowledgment of iman) in the heart benefits even if he does not speak with it then he is a Jahmi” (<strong>Ijma As-Salaf fil I&#8217;tiqad</strong>, (p.35-39)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">This book by <strong>Imam</strong> <strong>al-Kirmani</strong> who died in <strong>280H</strong> was authored as based on the consensus of the Salaf on matters of Aqidah or Creed, which again shows the Salaf and Ahlus Sunnah had an established, clear and well outlined belief system which nullifies the need to have some Christian equivalent counsel!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">And <strong>Imam Al-Bukhari</strong> says in his <strong>Sahih,</strong> a book which has been accepted by the entire Ummah, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“And it [Iman] is Speech and action, and it increases and decreases.” (<strong>Sahih Al-Bukhari, Kitab ul-Iman</strong>, (1:193), Dar At-Ta&#8217;seel, 1433H/2012CE)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #333300;"> And <strong>Abu Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Sallam</strong> wrote, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">“And I looked into the ikhtilaf of the two groups (on the matter of Iman), then I found that the Kitab and Sunnah both confirm the group that deemed Iman to be Niyyah and Speech and Action, entirely.” (Abu Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Sallam: <strong>Kitab ul-Iman</strong> of (p.10), Maktabah Al-Islami, 2nd Edition, 1403H/1983CE)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">And verily this work of his (<strong>Kitab Al-Iman</strong>) was authored before Al-Maturidi was even born.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #003300;"><img class=" wp-image-9377 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1.png?resize=384%2C576" alt="Picture 1" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1.png?resize=200%2C300 200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1.png?resize=768%2C1153 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1.png?resize=682%2C1024 682w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1.png?w=818 818w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;"><img class="wp-image-9378 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-2.png?resize=427%2C641" alt="Picture 2" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-2.png?resize=200%2C300 200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-2.png?resize=768%2C1152 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-2.png?resize=683%2C1024 683w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-2.png?w=1145 1145w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">And <strong>Abu Mansur Al-Maturidi</strong> in his<strong> Kitab At-Tawhid</strong> discussing Iman, says it is ‘Tasdeeq’ i.e. belief of the heart, and it is clear that the Maturidis are in agreement with the Jahmiyyah that Iman is a matter of the heart alone, with slight differing (i.e. Ma’rifah or Tasdeeq), and from these points it is evident that the Maturidis (along with their Ash’ari counterparts) are most definitely not from some sort of 3 standardised schools of Ahlus-Sunnah as the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sufi Hamza Yusuf</span></strong> tries to claim, rather they are from the extreme murji’ah and directly went against the consensus of the Salaf in many matters pertaining to Aqidah. Now we have established that the Salaf and their students indeed did pen down works on what is Orthodox Islamic Creed, and the latecomers from Ahlul-Kalam were in clear opposition to this creed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Imam al-Bukhari</strong> in on record for saying,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"> “I met more than <strong>1000 men</strong> from the people of knowledge, from the people of <strong>Hijaz, Makkah, Madinah, Kufah, Basrah, Wasit, Baghdad, Sham and Misr</strong>…..and not a single one of them differed regarding these affairs….” (Al-Lalaka’i, <strong>Sharh Usul I’tiqad</strong>, 1:361+ (Riyadh/Madinah, an-Nashiral-Mutamayyiz/ Dar un-Nasihah, 1436H/2015CE)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Imam al-Bukhari</strong> mentions some of the names of the great scholars he met and took Aqidah from and details his visitation to the various Muslims lands, even the number of times he visited the vast Muslim cities, all to show the unanimous agreement of the Muslims on aspects of belief or what Hamza Yusuf refers to as orthodoxy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Imam Al-Lalaka’i</strong> himself in his book <strong>Sharh Usul al-I’tiqad</strong> sets out to establish the clear belief the Companions and Successors were upon with clear and precise evidence and he has entries for numerous scholars and their orthodox beliefs and he died in <strong>418H</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">From the time before <strong>Imam al-A’jurri</strong> was from <strong>360H</strong> and he clarifies in his book <strong>ash-Shari&#8217;ah</strong> the deviation of the misguided sects and the group or the Jama’ah upon the correct belief system, way before the structured formation of the Ash’ari or Maturidi creedal systems.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">There are a plethora of books that establish and clarify the agreed and ratified belief system of Ahlus Sunnah, much earlier and before the Ash’ari or Maturidi schools were established!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hamza Yusuf</span></strong> further contradicts himself when he said in the introduction of his translation of <strong>The Creed of Imam al-Tahawi</strong> where he said, <strong>“For centuries, Muslims followed simple, concise doctrinal texts that unified them and prevented from falling prey to those who would challenge the central tenets of faith.”</strong> (The Creed of Imam al-Tahahwi, (p.8)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hamza Yusuf</span> </strong>continues and says,<span style="color: #ff0000;">“So, the Prophet was praising a Hanafi, Maturidi, Naqshbandi…” Verily, you shall conquer Constantinople. What a wonderful army that army will be, and what a wonderful commander that commander will be. [The narration used]</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">It is not uncommon to see <strong>Ahlul Kalam – Ash’ari and Maturidis</strong> desperately citing this narration as the Prophet ﷺ praising a Maturidi, and thus evidence the Maturidi creed is upon the truth and an acceptable school of Aqidah. Those that possess any intellect would be able to see through this faulty appeal on multiple levels. In reality this has become somewhat of a compulsive and repugnant behaviour with them which is ultimately the result of bigoted partisanship and blind following<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>A Look at the Sanad</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">The narration transmitted in Al-Bukhari’s, <strong>at-Tarikh al-Kabir</strong> (2:441 no.1754) (an-Nashir al-Mutamayyiz: Riyadh:1440H/2019) and in <strong>Musnad Ahmad</strong> (31:287 no.18957) (ar-Risalah al-A’lamiyyah: Dimashq, 1436H/2015CE) is with the following chain</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: right;"><span style="color: #333300;">قَالَ لِي مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ الْعَلاءِ ، قَالَ : حَدَّثَنَا زَيْدُ بْنُ حُبَابٍ ، حَدَّثَنَا الْوَلِيدُ بْنُ الْمُغِيرَةِ الْمَعَافِرِيُّ ، عَنْ عُبَيْدِ بْنِ بِشْرٍ الْغَنَوِيِّ ، عَنْ أَبِيهِ ، سَمِعَ النَّبِيَّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ يَقُولُ : &#8221; لَتُفْتَحَنَّ القسطنطينية فَلَنِعْمَ الأَمِيرُ أَمِيرُهَا وَلَنِعْمَ الْجَيْشُ ذَلِكَ الْجَيْشُ  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Zayd b. Hubab </strong>(Trustworthy, Kufan)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;"><em>from</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Walid b. Mughira </strong>(Trustworthy, Egyptian)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;"><em>from</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Ubayd b. Bishr </strong>(Majhool, Kufan)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">One can immediately see that a Kufan is narrating from an Egyptian, from a Kufan again, the first point we can ponder on. Furthermore, Zayd b. Hubab is alone in narrating this from Walid, i.e., he is the exclusive narrator. Furthermore, Walid b. Mughira is exclusively narrating from Ubayd or Abdullah b. Bishr, who is <strong>Majhool</strong>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #333399;">Shaykh Shu&#8217;ayb Arna&#8217;ut in his Tahqiq of Musnad Ahmad (31:287 no.18957) (ar-Risalah al-A’lamiyyah: Dimashq, 1436H/2015CE)</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Considering these factors, the narration has been weakened by <strong>Shaykh Al-Albani</strong>, <strong>Shaykh Arna’ut</strong>, and <strong>Shaykh Ahmed Shakir</strong>. Nothing more than <strong>Ahlul-Bid’ah</strong> clutching straws to find ways to defend their beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">The narrations authenticity is doubtful and at the very most it is questionable. Although some people like <strong>Muhammad Hamud at-Tasamani</strong> said the hadith was Hasan in <strong>al-Fawa’id as-Saniyyah Min al-Hadith al-Waridah Fi al-Qustantiniyyah</strong> (p.72), Shirkah Dar ul-Basha’ir al-Islamiyyah: Beirut, 1440H/2019CE). He further repeats the claim of this prophecy is for Sultan Muhammad Fatih al-Uthmani who conquered Constantinople   </span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Other narrations regarding the Conquest of Constantinople </strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Abu Hurairah</strong> Radhi Alahu Anhu reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam saying:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">You have heard about a city, one side of which is on land and the other is in the sea (Constantinople). They said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, yes. Thereupon he said: The Last Hour would not come unless seventy thousand persons from Bani lshaq would attack it. When they would land there, they will neither fight with weapons nor would shower arrows but would only say: &#8220;There is no god but Allah and Allah is the Greatest,&#8221; and one side of it would fall. Thaur (one of the narrators) said: I think that he said: The part by the side of the ocean. Then they would say for the second time: &#8220;There is no god but Allah and Allah is the Greatest&#8221; and the second side would also fall, and they would say: &#8220;There is no god but Allah and Allah is the Greatest,&#8221; and the gates would be opened for them and they would enter therein and, they would be collecting spoils of war and distributing them amongst themselves when a noise would be heard saying: Verily, Dajjal has come. And thus they would leave everything there and go back. (<strong>Sahih Muslim</strong> (no.2920)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">This authentic narration regarding the conquest of Constantinople can be found in Sahih Muslim, and this narration establishes that that the conquest will be during end-times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Another authentic narration from <strong>Anas b. Malik:</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">&#8220;Constantinople will be conquered with the coming of the Hour.&#8221; (<strong>Jami at-Tirmidhi</strong> (no.2239), Sahih in Mawqoof form)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Shaikh Zubair Ali Za’i</strong> was asked,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Question:</strong> Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said, “The first army from my Ummah that wages jihad on the sea, Paradise is guaranteed for them”. (<strong>Sahih al-Bukhari</strong> (no.2924). Was Mu’awiyyah (Raḍi Allāhū ʾAnhū) the first to wage Jihad on the ocean (/sea)?</span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Khalid b. Madan: That Umayr b. Al-Aswad Al-Anasi told him that he went to Ubadah b. As-Samit while he was staying in his house at the sea-shore of Hims with (his wife) Umm Haram. Umayr said. Umm Haram informed us that she heard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, &#8220;Paradise is granted to the first group of my followers who will undertake a naval expedition.&#8221; Umm Haram added, I said, &#8216;Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)! Will I be amongst them?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;You are amongst them.&#8217; The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, &#8216;The first army amongst&#8217; my followers who will invade Caesar&#8217;s City (Constantinople) will be forgiven their sins.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Will I be one of them, Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)?&#8217; He replied in the negative.&#8221; (<strong>Sahih al-Bukhari</strong> (no.2924)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">There were attacks on Caesars city (i.e. Constantinople) during the era of the <strong>Companions.</strong> Historically we find the following expeditions,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">He led an expedition in 32H (<strong>Tarikh Tabari</strong> (4/304), <strong>al-Ibar</strong> of al-Dhahabi (1/24), <strong>al-Muntazam</strong> of Ibn al-Jawzi (5/19), <strong>al-Bidayah</strong> (7/166).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">We also learn that he attacked the Constantinople and other Roman lands 16 times between the years 48H and 52H. (<strong>Al-Bidayah</strong> 8/133).</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong> 2. Sufyan b. Awf RadhiAllahu Anhu</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">In 48H (<strong>al-Isabah</strong> 2/56). This view was also mentioned by <strong>Muhammad al-Khudayri</strong> in his book <strong>Muhadharat al-Umam al-Islamiyyah</strong> (2/114). He was sent by Mu&#8217;awiyyah RadhiAllahu Anhu.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong> 3. Abd al-Rahman b. Khalid b. Al-Walid</strong></span></h5>

<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Aslam Abu Imran said: We went out on an expedition from Medina with the intention of (attacking) Constantinople. AbdurRahman ibn Khalid ibn al-Walid was the leader of the company. The Romans were just keeping their backs to the walls of the city. A man (suddenly) attacked the enemy. Thereupon the people said: Stop! Stop! There is no god but Allah. He is putting himself into danger. Abu Ayyub said: This ayah was revealed about us, the group of the Ansar (the Helpers). When Allah helped His Prophet (ﷺ) and gave Islam dominance, we said (i.e. thought): Come on! Let us stay in our property and improve it. Thereupon Allah, the Exalted, revealed, &#8220;And spend of your substance in the cause of Allah, and make not your hands contribute to (your destruction)&#8221;. To put oneself into danger means that we stay in our property and commit ourselves to its improvement and abandon fighting. Abu Imran said: Abu Ayyub continued to strive in the cause of Allah until he (died and) was buried in Constantinople.&#8221; (<strong>Sunan Abi Dawud</strong> (no.2512), authenticated by Shaykh al-Albani. It has also been cited in <strong>al-Mustadrak</strong> of al-Hakim (2/84-85), <strong>Tafsir al-Tabari</strong>, (2/118-119), <strong>Tafsir Ibn Abi Hatim</strong> (1/330-331), <strong>Ahkam al-Quran</strong> of al-Jassas (1/326-327)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Another Hadith in <strong>Abu Dawud</strong> (no.2687), which although has weakness in it, establishes the expedition of Abd al-Rahman and Abu Ayub RadhiAllahu Anhu.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">These hadith and reports show Constantinople was conquered during the era of the <strong>Companions</strong> and therefore <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hamza Yusuf’s</strong></span> warping the true narrative to fit the maturidi belief system is disingenuous. Those who are truly deserving of these glad tidings are the <strong>noble Companions</strong>.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sehsawani (1326H)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Siyanatul Insan An Waswas al-Shaikh Dahlan </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>(Protecting The Human From The Satanic Whisperings of Shaikh Dahlan)</em></strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Subki&#8217;s saying, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;It is rejecting the legislative evidences on the basis of bad thoughts.&#8221; </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sehsawani answers this and says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By Subki saying this he has suppressed the truth but rather confused it. He has left the prophetic texts, the legislative principles, decisive and specific texts for the unrestricted, general and unclear ones, just as the people of desires always do and we shall clarify this with the permission of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are prohibited from venerating the grave of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) which leads to shirk or if it is shirk itself. For example praying near the grave, making it a place of prostration and lighting candles near it, undertaking a journey to it and organising gatherings and events near it. Such prohibitions are well established in the authentic, clear and decisive narrations. Such prohibitions with the specific reasons, which are elucidated in the texts are also applicable to the graves of pious people. They are also included in the affairs which have been prohibited and an impetus in spreading shirk</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How is it possible for the narrations pertaining to the visitation of the grave to be contradictory, narrations which are not even authentic that allegedly evidence visitation of the grave of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). We know the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) did not instruct us concerning such visitation and in addition to the fact that we have clear, precise and authentic texts prohibiting this. All of the scholars of Hadith (Muhadithin) and the Hadith specialists did not declare a single narration to be authentic or even used a single one as evidence. On the contrary they declared every narration to be weak due to fabrication and lies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This also renders Subki&#8217;s claim of ijma of the Salaf and Khalaf to be null and void. This is because if he meant by Salaf, the companions, the muhajirin, the ansar and the tabi&#8217;in, then without a doubt his claim is an absolute lie. We have mentioned before that it is not established from any companion besides Ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhuma), that they would not visit the Prophets (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) grave and offer Salam after returning from a journey. This is not proven or established from the four rightly guided khulafa and neither did anyone support the practise of Ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) .</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abd al-Razzaq transmitted this report from Ibn Umar in his Musannaf from Mu&#8217;ammar from Ubaidullah from Ibn Umar and then says we do not know from any of the companions to have practised this except Ibn Umar&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sehsawani goes onto say</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise Sa&#8217;d bin Ibrahim bin Abd Al-Rahman bin Auf Zuhri was an Imam and the Qadi of Madinah during the era of the Tabi&#8217;in, his son Ibrahim said his father would never go near the grave and he would dislike doing this. So can it be said concerning such Imams that they also opposed the ijma? And or abandoned venerating the moa and grossly failed to raise his rank and station? If they say such is the case then this is nothing except something which makes ones hair stand on end.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The grave worshippers have no ijma with them except what the general masses are doing and this was from the time when there was little knowledge and din. This was from a time when the Sunnah had become weak and righteous actions were deemed to be bad and vice versa. For example making the prophets grave celebratory and making Hajj towards it, supplication towards it and making it a pillar of Hajj to visit his grave just like other places are visited as part of the ritual of Hajj like Arafah, Muzdalifah, Jamarat and the places around the Kabah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is still instilled in the hearts of the grave worshippers which they do not censure nor prohibit but rather they call to and encourage such practises. Whoever opposes them in this, they label as those who do not venerate and respect the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). This is what we call changing the Din and distorting it, if Allah had not taken the responsibility of preserving the Zikr and that a group of people would always remain upon the truth and that those who attempt to distort the Din will not be able to harm them, then the same would have happened just as the affair was with the people of the book. This is all due to following inauthentic ahadith and abandoning the clear authentic and definitive ahadith.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Kitāb al-Aṭʿimah &#8211; [The Book of Eating]</span></strong></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated Abu Ubaydah</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Checked &amp; Additional Notes</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Permissibility of Eating Locusts</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[374] Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abu `Aufa (Radi Allahu Anhu):<br />
We participated with the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) in seven Ghazawat (battles), and we used to eat locusts with him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[GRADING]</span> <span style="color: #000000;">– [NARRATED BY MUSLIM]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;">[REFERENCES]</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bukhari, Book of Hunting, Slaughtering, Chapter: The eating of locusts [no.5495]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Muslim, Book of The Book of Hunting, Slaughter, and what may be Eaten, Chapter: The permissibility of eating Locusts [no.1952]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Dawud [no.3812], Tirmidhi [no.1821-1822], Nasai [7:210], Ahmad [4:380], Darimi [no.2010], Musnad Humaidi [no.713]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[RULINGS FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) This hadith establishes that locusts are halal. You eat them by frying (boiling, grilling, cooking etc.) them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) Shaikh Abdullah Bassam mentions there is ijma of the Muslims on the lawfulness of eating locusts. [Tawḍih al-Aḥkam [7:10] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Two kinds of dead meat and two kinds of blood have been permitted to us. The two kinds of dead meat are fish and locusts, and the two kinds of blood are the liver and spleen” (Sunan Ibn Majah, Book of Food, [no.3218, Ahmad [2:97 no.5690]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4)   This is one of the best diets (rations) to have whilst being in battle because:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Readily available and you don’t need to look after them like other animals such as cows, chicken etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Plenty of them available when they (typically) come in swarms</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">They mature within weeks and reproduce in large numbers</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Easy to cook</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">High in protein and good fats</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Lightweight to carry</span></li>
</ol>

<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Abdul Hamid Ibn Abdurahman: One Hadith</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[63] From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Abdulhamid Ibn Abdurahman Ibn Zayd Ibn al-Khatab from Abdullah Ibn Abdullah Ibn al-Harith Ibn Nawfal from Abdullah Ibn Abas that Umar Ibn al-Khatab (Radi Allahu Anhu) set out for ash-Sham and when he was at Sargh, near Tabuk, the commanders of the army, Abu Ubaydah Ibn al-Jarah (Radi Allahu Anhu) and his companions, met him and told him that the plague had broken out in ash-Sham. Ibn Abas (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8220;Umar Ibn al-Khatab (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8216;(Call) all the first Muhajir unto me.&#8217; He assembled them and asked them for advice, informing them that the plague had broken out in ash-Sham. They disagreed (had a difference of opinion). Some said, &#8216;You have set out for something, and we do not think that you should leave it.&#8217; Others said, &#8216;You have the companions of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) and the rest of the people with you, and we do not think that you should send them towards this plague.&#8217; Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8216;Leave me.&#8217; Then he said, &#8216;(Call) Summon the Ansar to me.&#8217; They were summoned and he asked them for advice. They acted as the Muhajirun had and disagreed (had a difference of opinion) as they had disagreed. He said, &#8216;Leave me.&#8217; &#8220;Then he said, &#8216;Summon to me whoever is here of the aged men of Quraysh from the Muhajirun of the conquest.&#8217; He summoned them and not one of them differed (had a difference of opinion). They said, &#8216;We think that you should withdraw the people and not send them towards the plague.&#8217; Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) called out to the people, &#8216;I am leaving by camel in the morning,&#8217; so they set out. Abu Ubaydah (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8216;Is it flight from the decree of Allah?&#8217; Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, &#8216;Better that someone other than you had said it, Abu Ubaydah. Yes. We flee from the decree of Allah to the decree of Allah. What would you think if these camels had gone down into a valley which had two slopes, one of them fertile, and the other barren. If you pastured in the fertile part, wouldn&#8217;t you pasture them by the decree of Allah? If you pastured them in the barren part, wouldn&#8217;t you pasture them by the decree of Allah?&#8217; &#8221;(then Ibn Abas (Radi Allahu Anhu) said) Abd ar-Rahman Ibn Awf (Radi Allahu Anhu) arrived and he had been off doing something and he said, &#8216;I have some knowledge of this. I heard the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) say, &#8220;If you hear about it (a plague) in a land, do not go forward to it. If it comes upon a land and you are in it, then do not depart in flight from it.&#8221; (Ibn Abas (Radi Allahu Anhu) said) &#8216;So Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) praised Allah and then set off.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Abdul Hamid Ibn Abd ur-Rahman) in Bayhaqi (7/217, 218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 2/894- 896 hadith no.1720, book 45, chapter 7, hadith no.22, and in it: (the words) fadaaw tahum (is present) instead of fadaaw hum) at-Tamhid (8/361 &#8211; 363) al-Istidhkar: (no.1652)          </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.5729) and Muslim (no.2219) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) There are some points of wisdom in people not going to the place where a plague (epidemic) has broken out and occurred in that area and for the people to not run away from there who live in that area where the plague has occurred (and stay there instead) for example: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">a. If this illness (plague) spreads and affects someone who is outside the affected area then his aqidah can become corrupt that this illness is infectious and has the capability to cause many people to become ill. This situation is the same for the person who gets infected by coming into the area where the plague is, therefore this prevents bad and corrupt aqidah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">b. Chaos, turmoil and fear is not spread.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Even if an authentic hadith is a Khabar Wahid, it is a proof because Umar (RadiAllahu Anhu) acted upon the hadith narrated by one companion Abd ur-Rahman Ibn Awf (RadiAllahu Anhu). See hadith (no.9)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) Those who are in power should act upon the advice of the people of solution and agreement in ijtihadi affairs (matters).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The general Muslims should consult their reliable and upright brothers in important matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) If there is no clear proof for an issue in the Qur’an, Sunnah or Ijma then a general proof can be used as evidence or ijtihad can be done.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) The real knowledge is the Qur’an and hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) It is possible that a smaller scholar has knowledge of a proof which a bigger scholar doesn’t have.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani (the false Prophet) writes in contradiction to this authentic hadith that, “And I know that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said when a plague occurs in any place then the people of that city should leave the city without stopping otherwise they will be amongst those who fight against Allah the Most High.” (Majmu&#8217;ah Ishtiharat vol.2 pg.713) Mirza’s explanation here is a complete and utter lie.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">9) After acquiring knowledge of the Hadith of the Messenger’s (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) one should submit and accept it immediately instead of saying he said and such and such said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">10) In the blessed era of the noble companions there was nothing called taqlid (blind following).</span></p>
