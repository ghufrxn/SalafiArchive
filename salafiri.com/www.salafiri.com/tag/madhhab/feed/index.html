				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">By</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Aqeel al-Hindi</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the charges against the people of hadith is that their role within Islamic scholastics is one of compilation and transcription of the Sunnah for its benefit as a legislative source for those with the tools who fully understand it and can use it. Those who follow this line of thought argue that the one-dimensional role of the scholars of Hadith can be juxtaposed with the more complex, intricate and cognitive role of the Fuqaha. While it is true that it <em>can</em> be the case that a memoriser of Ahadith may not have complete understanding of what they convey<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, to tar the people of hadith in their entirety with such a brush is an injustice at best and libellous at worst. As will be demonstrated in this article, the well-known scholars of Hadith were individuals whose faculties for memorisation <em>and</em> understanding of the narrations they conveyed were gifts from Allah, as their works attest to.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another result of this fallacy is the assertion that the books of Ahadith are purportedly too complex for anyone other than a scholar of fiqh to benefit from and the layperson is to be warned against reading them, for fear of misunderstanding and going astray. This categorisation of the books of the Sunnah as such lowers their status to one of repositories of information, to be accessed by the elite few who have understanding. While it is true that the people of knowledge will appreciate and gain more from the books of hadith than the layperson, the success that Allah has granted the scholars of hadith in their works, in terms of their practical abilities to compile their works, as well as the thought that went in to their works, means that their books are far more than stores of Ahadith and that the layperson can pick up one of these books and learn about the religion of Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As demonstrated in the article in issue no.4, &gt;&gt;&gt; <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/imam-al-bukhari-was-a-muwahhid-salafi-athari-not-a-muqallid-partisan-or-blind-follower-of-any-madhhab-he-was-upon-the-madhhab-of-ahlul-hadith/">Imam al-Bukhari was a Muwahhid and Salafi in his Aqidah and Manhaj</a></strong></span>. One of the sources of his Aqidah is his book, the Sahih. The oft-cited principle when reading the Sahih of Imam Bukhari is that his fiqh is understood through his chapter headings. So chapter headings and the titles of books within the Sahih give an understanding as relates to his Aqidah, which he based upon the Athar. Al-Mustamla narrated in his report of the Sahih adds to the chapter heading of the book of Tawhid, <em>‘The Book of Tawhid; a Rebuttal of the Jahmiyyah and other than them’.</em> Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar comments, under the chapter heading of Tawhid:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The intent behind the narration of al-Mustamla: and other than them” is the Qadariyyah. As for the Khawarij, that which relates to them proceeded in the Book of Fitan and the Rafidah in the Book of Ahkam. And these four groups are the heads of innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Hafiz’s words show that the Sahih of Imam al-Bukhari is rich in terms of its Aqidah-based content that rebuts the fundamentals of the major groups of deviation. This richness is not, however, restricted to Aqidah. Matters relating to the relaying of Ahadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, fiqh<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, the virtues of righteous actions<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> and other than this can be derived from the Sahih. Some of the scholars have taken this a step further by compiling works that that have been derived from the two Sahihs, al-Bukhari and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The books of Sunan, particularly Abu Dawud’s and at Tirmidhi’s, also demonstrate the understanding and the compiler’s had of the implications Ahadith carried, their relevance to the sciences of fiqh and the relative stances of the people of knowledge relating to them. Abu Dawud, for example, states in his <em>Sunan</em> after reporting the Hadith of Uthman relating the wudhu of the Prophet ﷺ,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The authentic Ahadith of Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, all indicate that wiping over the head is done once, for they (the narrators) mentioned the actions of wudhu thrice and mentioned the wiping of the head without mentioning the number of times, as they did for the other actions.</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also clarifies some meanings contained in Ahadith; <em>‘…give her food when you eat, clothe her when clothe yourself, do not strike her on the face, do not revile her or leave her except in the house’</em> Abu Dawud stated:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The meaning of ‘Do not revile her’ is to say [to her] ‘May Allah revile you.’</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to fiqh-based intricacies and clarifying meanings, he also explains the meanings of terminology that is not often used in Arabic (Ghara’ib) in numerous Ahadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholastic weight of Imam at Tirmidhi is equally evident in his Jam’i, as attested to by Ibn al-Athir, where he mentions its distinguishing features among the books of Ahadith, namely: its ordering and lack of repetition; mentioning the views of the fiqhi Madhahib and how they respectively deduce rulings; explanation of the Ahadith, in terms of their grade of authentic, sound, weak, gharib and mu’alal; explaining the names of the narrators, their monikers and kunyas, and additional points of benefit that pertain to the sciences of rijal and the book of Ellal at the end of the Jami<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Having established the richness of the books of Hadith, we can now focus on how to benefit from them. This has been outlined by countless scholars when discussing the Manhaj of the student of knowledge in acquiring knowledge. A fitting example here would be the Muhaddith of Yemen, Shaykh Muqbil b. Hadi al-Wadi’, a scholar whose call to the Quran and the Sunnah, and particular emphasis on Ahadith, caused changes on a societal level in his native lands. He states:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fact that some beginner seekers of knowledge in the field of Ahadith err [in their endeavours] is taken up by their antagonists, who use the errors to justify driving them away from their Manhaj [that of the people of hadith]. However, I advise my brothers to acquire what they can from the books of Ahadith and dedicate themselves to reading them – and as for the one who says that whoever’s Shaykh is a book will err more than they are correct, this is only if they do not choose the most fitting book and do not refer to the statements of the scholars relating to the hadith – and acting upon knowledge that has been found [al-Wijadah] is permissible. They should refer to the explanations that the people of the Sunnah have given and if they see in the books of Hadith something that contradicts what the people around them are upon, they should look to see what the people of knowledge have said about the Ahadith in terms of its authenticity and in terms of its meanings. If the Hadith is authentic and the meaning has been understood correctly, it has not been abrogated and you have checked in the explanations that it is not a general hadith that has been made specific elsewhere, or an unrestricted hadith that has been restricted elsewhere, do so if you can. If they are in an environment in which the community have an acceptance of the Sunnah and have trust in them, they should teach them with statements and actions. If they are in an environment in which the community do not have acceptance of the Sunnah, nor do they have trust in them, they should strive to encourage them to act in accordance to the Sunnah and request evidences [for practices].<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Compiled by</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Abu Hibban</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Many claim that Imām Bukhārī was an Ashʿarī, Ṣūfī, or a fanatic to a particular Madhhab, or … and the claims continue! Yet the most authentic book accepted by all the Muslims after the Quran Imam Bukhārī’s ‘Ṣaḥīḥ’ completely contradicts what the claimant’s state. What follows is merely an aerial view of some of Bukhārī’s beliefs as put forward in his ‘Ṣaḥīḥ’ set out as elementary level for easy understanding. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>READINGS FROM SAHIH BUKHARĪ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Book: Oneness, Uniqueness of Allāh (Tawḥīd)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Chapter: The Prophet (</strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>) inviting his followers to Tawḥīd of Allāh</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Ibn ʿAbbās: When the Prophet (ﷺ) sent Muʿādh to Yemen, he said to him, &#8220;You are going to a nation from the people of the Scripture, so let the first thing to which you will invite them, be the Tawḥīd of Allāh. If they learn that, tell them that Allāh has enjoined on them, five prayers to be offered in one day and one night. And if they pray, tell them that Allāh has enjoined on them Zakat of their properties and it is to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor. And if they agree to that, then take from them Zakat but avoid the best property of the people.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Our Noble Prophet began with Tawḥīd and he obligated it upon others to also do the same as one can clearly see from the ḥadīth of the noble Companion Muʿādh. For it is the belief in Tawḥīd and a warning from shirk for which all the messengers were sent <strong>[16:36] </strong>and Allāh will not forgive Shirk and may only do so if one repents before he dies <strong>[4:48]. </strong>Therefore, we can see why it is vital and obligatory to start with Tawḥīd, as it is the foundation upon which all other aspects of worship are built.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">It is a travesty that we have sects today who claim to follow the way of our Prophet but totally make up their own rules of giving daʿwah and what daʿwah should be given to. Some sects such as Ikhwān al-Muslimīn start their daʿwah by calling people to politics and to join the struggle to overthrow rulers, which is itself against the Sunnah! The Jamāt at-Tablīgh are another example, they call to their invented charter and the Tablighī Niṣāb with the call of ‘as long as you establish Salah then this is the most important thing’, clearly this is not true for Shirk nullifies all good deeds<strong> [6:88]</strong> and it is against the Sunnah of the methodology of our prophet in calling people to Allāh as per the ḥadīth of Muʿādh and the call of all the prophets as stated in the Qurʾān. Therefore, it’s an obligation that we don’t go beyond the Sunnah of the Prophet in any affair and abandon all these innovated sects and methodologies and stick to the truth.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">The Tablighī responds and says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">We make the people repent from sin the details Tawḥīd and shirk can follow later.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">[as argued by modern day leader of Tablighi’s, Mawlāna Ṭāriq Jamīl in a pre-recorded lecture broadcast on PTV 2013. In other words, the individual is left upon his Shirk and Bidʿah and may never be corrected by them! Then this argument by the head of Bidʿah in the religion Ṭāriq Jamīl was actually responded to by Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah hundreds of years earlier wherein he debated with a Sufi who made a similar claim [to that of Ṭāriq Jamīl] to which Ibn Taymiyyah responded:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">And some of them [the Ṣūfis] have said: we make people repent. I [Shaykh ul-Islam] said: you make them repent from what? He [the Ṣūfī] said: from thievery, highway robbery and so forth. I [Shaykh ul-Islam] said: their condition before you make them repent is better than their condition after you made them repent; verily, they were transgressors and they used to believe that what they were upon is unlawful, they were hoping for the mercy of Allāh and repenting to Him or intending to repent. By having them repenting, you made them misguided, polytheists who have deserted from the divine Islamic law, who love what Allāh hates and hate what Allāh loves. And I [Shaykh ul-Islam] have clarified that these innovations that them and others are upon are worse than sins.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Chapter: “(He Alone is) the All-Knower of the Unseen, and He reveals to none His Unseen.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Ibn ʿUmar: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The keys of the unseen are five and none knows them but Allāh: (1) None knows (the sex) what is in the womb, but Allāh: (2) None knows what will happen tomorrow, but Allāh; (3) None knows when it will rain, but Allāh; (4) None knows where he will die, but Allāh (knows that); (5) and none knows when the Hour will be established, but Allāh.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Masruq: ʿAiʿshah said, “If anyone tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord, he is a liar, for Allāh says: <strong>“No vision can grasp Him.” (6.103)</strong> And if anyone tells you that Muhammad has seen the Unseen, he is a liar, for Allāh says: <strong>“None has the knowledge of the Unseen but Allāh.”</strong><a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">We can see the clear, precise and concise words collected by the Imām of Imām ul-Anbiyā and his noble wife, our Mother Aisha concerning the fact that it is only Allāh that has the knowledge of the unseen, that is ‘Ilm ul Ghayb’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Consider the words carefully, for the noble prophet is saying “The keys of the unseen are five and none knows them but Allāh,” this excludes all of creation, including our Noble prophet from having knowledge of these matters. Yet the Ṣūfī Qubūrī lies against the Nabī and gives him that which only belongs to Allāh alone all in the name of ‘loving the prophet’! such ‘love’ was not the belief of the prophet or his companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Furthermore, our Mother Aiʿshah calls the person a ‘liar’ who says the prophet has Ilm ul-Ghayb. What then of Aḥmad Raza Khān Barailwī who states:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">The Prophet has knowledge of all the unseen including that which has been, will be, even down to how many turns the leaf shall take before touching the ground.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">What then of Ashraf ʿAlī Thanwī who said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">The prophets knowledge of the unseen is something that is established beyond any doubt and such knowledge of the unseen was even given to Allāhs friends Awliyā who knew what was inside the womb.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Truthful or liars? For those who have a sickness in their heart they may say this was merely the opinion of Aisha then they should know that she substantiated what she said with the verse of the Quran <strong>“None has the knowledge of the Unseen but Allāh.&#8221;</strong> Alḥamdulillāh, sufficient for us is the belief of our Prophet and noble mother.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Walillahil Hamd Imam Bukharī was not a Muqallid, Partisan, Blind Follower of any Madhhab but was upon the Madhhab of the Salaf!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Many who are fanatics [but they may not know or acknowledge this] towards there Madhhab oft repeat the mantra that <em>‘There is Ijma/consensus that the ummah blindly followed one of the four Madhhabs’</em> and that ‘<em>The scholars of Islam such as Imam Bukhari and others were all blind followers of a Madhhab’</em>. This short article is a result of notes for lessons, presented to my students, May Allah bless them, taken from notes when we covered the subject area of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">The article shall illustrate that Imam Bukhari was not a fanatic towards the Madhhabs or a blind follower as opined by the Madhhabists but instead his belief and methodology was to accept the Sunnah even if that was in opposition to the fatwa or verdict of any Imam, his own teachers or the Madhhabs!! From amongst 100 plus examples studied, a few are illustrated below:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>[1] &#8211; </strong>It is established within the Hanafi Madhhab in particular by Imam Abu Hanifa and Abu Yusuf that the water that remains unused in a tumbler after wudhu is impure.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> Imam Bukhari responded to this by placing the hadith chapter heading as:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Chapter: The using of the remaining water after ablution</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">He then followed up his chapter heading with the following authentic hadith:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Abu Juhaifa: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) came to us at noon and water for ablution was brought to him. After he had performed ablution, the remaining water was taken by the people and they started smearing their bodies with it (as a blessed thing). The Prophet (ﷺ) offered two rak`at of the Zuhr prayer and then two rak’at of the Asr prayer while a short spear (or stick) was there (as a Sutra) in front of him.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong><em>Comment:</em></strong> This illustrates that the way and Manhaj of Imam Bukhari was to present and follow the Sunnah and sayings of the Salaf, regardless of whom may have opposed them! The blind followers of Madhhabs will have such flowery titles before their names but will seldom, rather never, leave their Madhhab for any evidence or narration that may oppose it!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>[2] &#8211; </strong>Imam Sufyan al-Thawri and the people of Kufah held the view that the Women folk are not to attend the eclipse prayer in congregation<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>. Imam Bukhari challenged this view and opposed it by bringing the following chapter heading and narration:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Chapter: Offering of Eclipse prayer by women along with men</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Fatima bint Al-Mundhir: Asma&#8217; bint Abi Bakr said: I came to Aisha the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) during the solar eclipse. The people were standing and offering the prayer and she was also praying too. I asked her, &#8216;What has happened to the people?&#8217; … to the end of the narration.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong><em>Comment:</em></strong> No matter how esteemed or renowned an Imam may have been if they opposed the traditions and evidence Imam Bukhari rejected their standpoint giving precedence to the Sunnah! The narration also exemplifies the status and position of our Mother Aisha () in being a scholar and one from whom verdicts and Fatawa were taken despite the detractors!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>[3] &#8211; </strong>The illustrious trustworthy Tabi’, Imam Mujahid held the position that the one performing the Hajj should wear the Ihram and thereafter mark out his sacrifice.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> Imam Bukhari refuted this with the following chapter and narration:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Chapter: Marking and garlanding (the Hadi) at Dhul-Hulaifa and then assuming Ihram</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan: The Prophet (ﷺ) set out from Medina with over one thousand of his companions (at the time of the Treaty of Hudaibiya) and when they reached Dhul-Hulaifa, the Prophet (ﷺ)  garlanded his Hadi and marked it and assumed Ihram for Umrah.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Aisha: I twisted with my own hands the garlands for the Budn of the Prophet (ﷺ) who garlanded and marked them, and then made them proceed to Makkah; Yet no permissible thing was regarded as illegal for him then.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong><em>Comment:</em></strong> Hafiz Ibn Hajar in his <em>Fath</em> comments that Imam Bukharī has refuted the position of Imam Mujahid by formulating the chapter heading and providing his evidence in support.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Also ironically the words related to modern day blind following <em>‘Taqlid’</em> [Qala’id] have been mentioned in the Hadith and chapter heading above in relation to animals and the reality is that in the book and Sunnah such words have never been used in a praiseworthy way for humans but mostly for other things such as this hadith illustrates. Yet, those who call to <em>‘Taqlid’ </em>make it obligatory for the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Also in the isnad/chain of the Hadith is present Imam al-Zuhri and many modernists<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> who reject hadith have attempted to vilify and attack the reliability and memory of Imam al-Zuhri simply because he narrated some narration which forbid music and musical instruments from our prophet. To serve their own purposes they attacked the Imams of the Sunnah yet they themselves are not even worth a full stop in a footnote in some book! Imam Bukhari who is the Imam of Hadith clearly thought the narrations of Imam al-Zuhri are acceptable despite what many of the rejectionists claim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>[4] &#8211; </strong>Imam Ahmad held the view that the Jumu’ah prayer can be offered before the midday. Imam Bukhari responded by rejecting the position by the following chapter heading and narration:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Chapter: The time for the Jumu&#8217;ah (prayer) is after midday</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Anas bin Malik: The Prophet (ﷺ) used to offer the Jumu’ah prayer immediately after midday.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong><em>Comment:</em></strong> Imam Ibn Battal the explainer of Bukhari states that Imam Bukhari refuted Imam Ahmad and Imam Mujahid by writing the chapter heading that he did.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">This is also a response to those who say that the Salafis are actually Hanbalis, blind followers of Imam Ahmad’s Madhhab. Evidently, this viewpoint is misconceived as the Salafis of the past, such as Imam Bukhari nor the Salafis of today are bigoted and partisan blind followers of the Hanbali Madhhab, Walillahil Hamd.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[4]</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Imam Ibn Hazm</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>384H-456H</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>(994c-1064c)</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Name, Genealogy &amp; Ancestry</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His kunyah is Abū Muḥammad and his full name and lineage is ʿAlī bin Aḥmad bin Saʿīd bin Ḥazm bin Ghālib bin Ṣāliḥ bin Khalaf bin Maʿdān bin Sufyān bin Yazīd, the freed slave of Yazīd bin Abū Sufyān bin Ḥarb bin Umayyah, al-Fārisī in origin al-Amawī al-Yazīdī al-Qurṭubī al-Ẓāhirī.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His forefather, Yazīd was a freed slave of Yazīd bin Abū Sufyān and thus he had Persian ancestry.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> His forefather, Khalaf was the first from the family who entered al-Andalus<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> while his grandfather, Saʿīd bin Ḥazm moved to Qurṭuba from Labla.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> His father, Aḥmad bin Saʿīd was considered to be learned and an honest man, with expertise in language and served as a minister for the grand vizier al-Manṣūr Muḥammad bin Abī ʿĀmir and his son, al-Muẓaffar.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ḥazm takes his name from his great grandfather Ḥazm. It is well known that Ibn Ḥazm was born in Qurṭuba ie Cordoba, however, some authors have given him the attribution of Lablī due to his ancestral home of Labla.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> Labla is the Arabic name given to the town of Niebla which is in the Spanish province of Huelva of Andalus. Ibn Ḥazm was born on the 30<sup>th</sup> of Ramaḍān 384/994 which he had wrote himself and gave to his student, Ṣāʿid bin Aḥmad, Abuʾl Qāsim.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Childhood and a Brief Sketch of his Early Life </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imām Ibn Ḥazm spent almost all his life exclusively in al-Andalus while spending a few months in al-Qayrawān in North Africa. He had intentions to venture east to Baghdad and other centres of learning, however this dream was never achieved. He was bought up in an affluent family since his father, who was also learned – served as a Wazīr to the Umayyad representative in al-Andalus until their fall from power. Initially his father’s ministerial position bought wealth and stability in the life of young Ibn Ḥazm but later it caused trouble and suffering with various trials.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Later, Ibn Ḥazm was also to serve the Umayyads as a minister a few times, which were short engagements, when they gained and lost power. With the troubles and trials associated with his tenure, Ibn Ḥazm dedicated himself and focused on learning the sacred Islamic sciences, writing, and teaching. He was famed for his deep and extensive knowledge all over Andalus, as such the Ẓāhirī Madhhab spread all over al-Andalus. His critique and superior debating skills made him more famous during his life and his verbal altercations with the state backed Mālikī Madhhab, which was dominant at the time also faced a challenge from him and at times his wrath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was skilled interlocutor and while having mastered various sciences – including non-religious sciences, he was a formidable and prolific writer and debater. His mastery over argumentation and disputation on a whole array of genres made him a feared adversary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By 399H/1009 the viceroy, al-Manṣūr and al-Muẓaffar was displaced from power and Ibn Ḥazm’s father, Aḥmad was discharged from his position which led him to leave his palatine residence located in the outskirts of the austere city of Madīnah al-Zahīra when Ibn Ḥazm was approximately 15 years old.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> His family left their quarter, which were specifically for the civil servants and moved back to his childhood residence in Balaṭ Mughīth. Balaṭ Mughith was situated in eastern side of Qurṭuba.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These were troubling times for Ibn Ḥazm and his family, having lived a life of peace and tranquility which was followed by a period of trials and persecution. There had been successive changes in rulers with a period of civil unrest and turmoil, which led to Ibn Ḥazm and his family facing tribulations, oppression, imprisonment, exile and burden able official fines. Ibn Ḥazm’s father Aḥmad bin Saʿīd was imprisoned with his all of his possession confiscated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to these trouble and adverse times, the years proved further sorrowful for Ibn Ḥazm, his older brother Abū Bakr died in 401H due to plague<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> and in the following year his father, Ahmad bin Saʿīd also died in 402H, when Ibn Ḥazm was just a teenager of 18.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> Ibn Ḥazm was yet again faced with another extremely difficult year in 403H when his first wife died – who he loved dearly, which Ibn Ḥazm alludes to himself.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 403H, the Berbers ransacked Qurṭuba, burnt it, destroyed, and slaughtered its inhabitants for two consecutive months. Ibn Ḥazm’s family home in Balaṭ Mughīth was destroyed<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> which eventually led Ibn Ḥazm to leave his birthplace for Almeria in the beginning of 404H, while an orphan.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He learnt and taught the Islamic sciences while in Almeria, living there discreetly in peace. He also travelled to Malaga for a short period of time and had a debate with a jewish scholar which led him to write a book. The ruler of Almeria at the time began questioning the political motives of Ibn Ḥazm and accused him of plotting a political insurgency. Ibn Ḥazm was imprisoned for this for a few months and then he was eventually exiled in 407H.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> Thereafter, he sought refuge in the castle of Ḥiṣn al-Qaṣr, where he remained for a short while. He was respected and looked after by the King of the Castle, Ibn Mughaffal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ḥazm then travelled to Valencia and remained there for approximately two years<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>, at the same time Murtaḍā ʿAbd al-Raḥmān bin Muḥammad announced his succession to rule while he was also in Valencia. azm then travelled to Vallencia thenIbn Ḥazm was in favour and harboured sympathy for the Umayyad’s and thus joined an expedition to regain Qurṭuba, however they were defeated in Granada and Ibn Ḥazm was imprisoned by the Berbers.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After being released by the Berbers, Ibn Ḥazm entered Qurṭuba once again around 409H during the reign of Qāsim bin Ḥamūd al-Mamūn, and thereafter wrote is famous book, The Ring of the Dove while in Qurṭuba. <a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>After this troubled period when the young ruler ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Mustaẓhir rose to power he appointed Ibn Ḥazm as a minister around 414H<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>, this was a short appointment perhaps lasting a month or so after which Ibn Ḥazm was imprisoned again by the new ruler while al-Mustaẓhir was murdered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After his brief ministerial stints around the age of 30 Ibn Ḥazm was increasing disillusioned with the return and sustained rule of the Ummayyds nonetheless he continued to be optimistic. After a few years he was reinstated as a minister under the grand vizier at the time.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> During such roles Ibn Ḥazm passionately dedicated himself to intellectual writing and learning, his pursuit of knowledge as well clarifying matters of the Dīn. He eventually concluded that he was created for other things and left ministerial and advisory roles and focused on the Sunnah and Athār.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 429H, Ibn Ḥazm was imprisoned again by the Berbers.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> After his release he travelled through different areas, having religious disputation with different antagonists and frequent periods of imprisonment. If Ibn Ḥazm was not in prison, he was in hiding from the authorities. Thereafter in 430H he reached Majorca when he was around 45 years old. Ibn Ḥazm again during these years devoted most of his time to writing and composing his works but it was not before long that he was in trouble with the authorities again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While in Majorca, Ibn Ḥazm was forced to issue legal edicts based on the Mālikī Madhhab and not the Ẓāhirī, in return for sanctuary in Majorca by its secretary Abuʾl Abbās ibn Rashiq. Majorca’s inhabitants and prior to this the, inhabitants of Almeria complained to their respective Qāḍī’s and rulers and Ibn Ḥazm was yet again faced with more trials and persecution. In Majorca Ibn Ḥazm also had debates with the foremost Ashʿarite of his era, Abuʾl Walīd al-Bājī on many theological issues, who was asked to help by the antagonists in desperation after they were unable to halt the intellectual juggernaut, Ibn Ḥazm.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In around 440H, Ibn Ḥazm had to leave Majorca when he was approximately 55 years old, he travelled to Denia, Almeria, Seville – which is known as Ishbīl in Arabic and then finally to his ancestral home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ḥazm had to face another great trial and test during his lifetime, which was probably after 445H and before his death, the king of Seville, al-Muʿtaqid ordered the public burning of his books.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a> After Seville and the public burning and destruction of his book, Ibn Ḥazm was eventually coerced and exiled from the trials he faced to return to his native ancestral home in Montija, in Huelva on the orders of al-Muʿtaqid. He remained there until his death where he continued to write and teach. Al-Muʿtaqid also prevented people from studying with him and banned Ibn Ḥazm from teaching – he threatened anyone who approached him for studies.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During this last period Ibn Ḥazm focused on his writing and teaching, while some students did manage to study with him. These students were young as most of the older ones were well aware of the wrath and expected punishment of the ruler. Some of his family members perhaps also studied with him.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Pursuit and Quest for Knowledge</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most well-known and oft repeated accounts in how Ibn Ḥazm began seeking knowledge is what his student Abū Muḥammad ibn al-ʿArabī mentions. This account is disputed, and some biographers have failed to accept it, while offering plausible explanations and reasons. One of the main arguments against this is that Ibn Ḥazm was already studying with the local teachers in the grand mosque. The incident however is that one day when a friend of Ibn Ḥazm’s father died he went to pray his funeral prayer at midday. When he entered the masjid he sat down, so one of his teachers signaled to him to pray the Taḥḥayatul masjid, which Ibn Ḥazm was unfamiliar with and the people said to him how can you not know about this prayer at your age, Ibn Ḥazm was approximately 25-26 at the time of the alleged incident. There is another incident, that he was about to pray the Taḥḥayatul masjid after the Asr prayer, when he was told to sit down.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion this left Ibn Ḥazm embarrassed and humiliated and so he asked his teacher to direct him to the house of the most learned jurist of the city – Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Daḥḥun. He began reading the Muwaṭṭāʾ of Imām Mālik to him as well as other books for approximately three years.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many explanations have been put forward which challenge this account. We know that Ibn Ḥazm began seeking knowledge and taking ḥadīth studies at the tender age of 16, around late 399H early 400H<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a> with his teacher, Abū ʿUmar Aḥmad bin Muḥammad al-Jasūr<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a> and was thus well acquainted with the understanding of ḥadīth.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Teachers</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the teachers he heard ḥadīth and studied Islamic sciences include the likes of Abū ʿUmar Aḥmad bin al-Jasūr, as mentioned above, Yaḥya bin Masʿūd known as Wajh al-Jannah, Qāḍī Yunus bin ʿAbd Allāh, Qāḍī Abū Bakr Ḥumām bin Aḥmad, Abū Muḥammad bin Yūnus, Qāḍī Yūsuf bin ʿAbd Allāh, Abū Saʿīd al-Fattā al-Jaʿfarī, Muḥammad bin Saʿīd, Muḥammad bin Saʿīd bin Nubāt, Abuʾl Qāsim ʿAbd al-Raḥmān bin Abī Yazīd al-Miṣrī, ʿAbd Allāh bin Rabʿi al-Tamimī, ʿAbd Allāh bin Muḥammad bin Uthmān, Abū ʿUmar al-Ṭalmanakī, ʿAbd al- Raḥmān ibn ʿAbd Allāh bin Khālid, ʿAbd Allāh bin Yūsuf bin Nāmī, Ibn al-Kharrāz, Ibn al-Kattānī, Abuʿl Walīd bin al-Farḍī and Abū ʿUmar bin ʿAbd al-Barr al-Nimari,. He also studied with Abū ʿAbd Allāh bin Daḥḥūn and ʿAlī bin Saʿīd al-ʿAbdarī al-Mayurqī (Majorca) and focused on fiqh with them.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abuʾl Khiyār Masʿūd bin Sulaymān bin Muflit was from his famous and well-known teachers – Ibn Ḥazm learnt the various views of fiqh from him and he is also credited for instilling the inclination of the Ẓāhirī Madhhab in him.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a> He studied ḥadīth, fiqh and other sciences from numerous other scholars and they’re too many to mention.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ḥazm first studied the Mālikī Madhhab in general from the clergy of Qurṭuba and then specifically with Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Dahḥḥun for three years and thereafter he began to debate with the people.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>  He then moved to the Shāfiʿī Madhhab and then eventually to the Ẓāhirī Madhhab.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a> In around 418-420H he began teaching the Ẓāhirī Madhhab with his teacher, Abuʾl Khiyār or Ibn Khiyār in the grand mosque of Qurṭuba. The Mālikīs were infuriated and lodged a complaint with the ruler, who ordered a royal decree for both of them to be banned from teaching.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is no secret that Ibn Ḥazm al-Ẓāhirī championed the Ẓāhirī Madhhab, he codified it, taught it, and spread it. Such was the case that it reached unprecedented levels all over al-Andalus and the Maghrib that when Abū Bakr ibn al-ʿArabī returned from his studies in the east he said, “When I returned, I found that the whole of the Maghrib had been filled with the Ẓāhirī Madhhab.”<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> Ibn Ḥazm’s view was very simple, that only divine texts had legislative authority and constituted evidence, and that all matters must be referred back to these two sources generally, and specifically when differences arose. He rejected views based qiyās and stuck to the general views and core evidences.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a> He spent the remainder of his life, spreading and defending the Ẓāhirī Madhhab all over al-Andalus.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This credit goes to the prodigious traditionalist and ḥadīth master, the Muḥaddith, Imām Baqī bin Makhlad (201-276H), who had over two hundred and eighty teachers, who travelled the east and west over two decades in the question of knowledge and ḥadīth and thus amassed a vast and extensive collection of ḥadīth which he took back to Qurṭuba, the city of his birth. For well over a quarter of a century the illustrious Imām Baqī bin Makhlad served the cause of ḥadīth, producing numerous students and established a school of ḥadīth in Qurṭuba. He died in Qurṭuba in 276H and left behind a cultured, cultivated and established school of ḥadīth in Spain which was reduced to a Dār al-Ḥadīth.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a> It is such a spring that Ibn Ḥazm grew up in and essentially drank from it.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His students and those who narrated from him include, Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Ḥumaydī who benefited a lot from him, he was also an acclaimed historian and wrote, <em>Jadhwah al-muqtabis fī dhikr wulāt al-andalus.</em> Another student, Ṣāʿid bin Aḥmad al-Andalusi was also an established historian and geographer and authored the well-known <em>Ṭabaqāt al-umam</em>. His son, Abū Rāfʿe al-Faḍal and a whole group of people benefitted from him. The last person to narrate – who also had ijāzah from him was Abuʾl Ḥasan Shurayḥ bin Muḥammad. Also, the likes of Abū Muḥammad ibn al-ʿArabī – the father of the well-known Abū Bakr ibn al-ʿArabi, studied all of his works with him except the last volume of his <em>Kitāb al-Fiṣal</em> for seven years.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Works</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ḥazm had numerous works, we have it on numerous authorities that he compiled, collated and wrote around 400 volumes, compromising 80,000 pages as his son Abū Rāfʿe al-Faḍal transmitted,<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a> the most prolific author in the history of Islām, on par or close to Ibn Jarīr al-Ṭabarī.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a> These books varied in their type, most of them were written works while others were explanations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also know that there was a public burning of his books by the state. This was not a few isolated detractors or antagonists or even a group, but rather a state backed public burning. This highlights three important aspects, the first that public burning of books was not a few books but it was all of his books, the second; books of the author were forever lost due to this and third anyone who even had any of Ibn Ḥazm’s books and disagreed with the burning would never volunteer information they possessed his books and hence were hidden and concealed in fear of reprisal</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inevitably such events caused fear and disillusioned the people from reading or even looking at the works of Ibn Ḥazm. If this fact is coupled with the official banning of Ibn Ḥazm teaching, this had a further adverse effect on the works of Ibn Ḥazm. It is well known know that teachers would teach and have reading sessions of their books, which they would teach and explain. So when Ibn Ḥazm was banned, his books burnt there was very little hope of ever having his works available to us or even after the immediate centuries after his death. We know about the books of Ibn Ḥazm from the ones he mentioned himself or his companions or students mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From records we find the names of around 180<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a> or so, with some researchers mentioning 160 or so works authored by Ibn Ḥazm and only 40 of them approximately have ever been published. This in of itself is incredible, that the virtue and stature of Ibn Ḥazm are professed through limited works. Some scholars like al-Dhahabī mention only 74 works.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Listing all of the works of Ibn Ḥazm would be too lengthy, as a summarised version we shall mention some of them.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">ʿIzz al-Dīn bin ʿAbd al-Salām said, &#8220;I have not seen the likes of any books on Islamic sciences likes Ibn Ḥazm&#8217;s <em>al-Muḥallā</em> nor the likes Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Din’s <em>al-Mughnī.&#8221;</em> Al-Dhahabī comments: &#8220;Shaykh ʿIzz al-Dīn is right, and the third is al-Bayhaqī&#8217;s <em>al-Sunan al-Kubrā</em>, and the fourth Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr&#8217;s <em>al-Tamhīd</em>. Whoever obtains these volumes, if he is one of the intelligent muftis and perseveres in reading them &#8211; he is truly a ʿālim.&#8221;<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Praise of the Ulamāʾ</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Ḥumaydī said, “I have not seen anyone of the likes of him; who had combined in him intelligence with an agile memory, generousness, and the most devout in the Dīn.”<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Ḥumaydī further praises his teacher Ibn Ḥazm and says in the introduction of his book <em>Jadhwah </em>while elevating the status of his teacher, “These historical records and its respective science – I acquired most of them from my teacher, Ḥāfiẓ Abū Muḥammad ʿAlī bin Aḥmad bin Ḥazm.”<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a> Al-Ḥumaydī praises Ibn Ḥazm in numerous places in the aforementioned work.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Qāḍī, Abuʾl Qāsim Ṣāʿid bin Aḥmad commented on the stature and status of Ibn Ḥazm on history and genealogy and said, “In the whole of al-Andalus, he was the most perceptive, comprehensive expert and accomplished scholar with regards to Islamic sciences and had the final word and extensive knowledge on language, rhetoric, poetry biography, the Sunnah reports and genealogy.”<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Dhahabī lauds him with the following titles, “al-Imām al-ʿAllāmah al-Ḥāfiẓ al-Faqih al-Mujtahid…”<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a> and “The Imam, one ad only, the ocean of knowledge, the possessor of sciences and knowledge..”<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Khāqān defended him against some of the allegations of Ibn Ḥayyān and said about Ibn Ḥazm, “He was a unique faqih who was not a muqallid, he did not fall into innovations or new ideas… he devoted himself to the different sciences of knowledge and their respective studies, he was honest in his expressions and observations.”<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Dhahabī said about him, “He was extremely intelligent with a prolific memory such that his knowledge of the sciences was very extensive.”<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Khalikān said, “He was humble yet possessed all the virtues and had numerous works.”<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah said, “He had faith, religious commitment and a great deal of knowledge, that no one can deny except one who is stubborn, and the content of his books highlights his deep knowledge of various views and different circumstances, as well as his respect for the fundamentals of Islam and for the Messenger, which is a combination that cannot be found with anyone else.”<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ḥajr quotes al-Ḥumaydī who said, “He was a Ḥāfiẓ of ḥadīth and the Sunan with their understanding, deducing rulings from the Qurʾān and Sunnah, he was dedicated to the great sciences, and was devout upon his knowledge.”<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Dhahabī said, “He was an expert of the various sciences; a multidisciplinary in the Dīn, he was truthful, pious and devout.”<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was even praised and honoured by his adversaries like Abū Marwān bin Ḥayyān.<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Family</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most authors mention that Ibn Ḥazm had only one son, the scholar, Abū Rāfʿe al-Faḍal. However some biographers mention that he also had other sons and one daughter, Abū ʿUsāmah Yaʿqūb, Saʿīd, Abū Sulaymān Muṣʿab.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a> However such findings are under scrutiny and are to be researched further.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The great polymath and phenomenon, Imām Ibn Ḥazm died on his estate in Montija, Manta Lisham, in his native ancestral home located in the west of Andalus, on the 28<sup>th</sup> of Shaʿbān  in 456/1064 at the age of 71,<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a> he left behind a lasting legacy for the Muslim Ummah.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> To proceed</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The &#8216;reality&#8217; of the position the Deobandīs toward the Ṣaḥābah and their riwāyāt, including their abuse and attacks on the Ṣaḥābah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, we say that the Ḥanafīs-Deobandīs have been at the forefront of speaking ill of the Ṣaḥābah, and thus not only resembling the Shīʿah but effectively being a support of the Shīʿah. They did this all to safeguard their Maḏhab as the Ṣaḥābī&#8217;s riwāyah may have opposed it.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Deobandī Maḥmūd al-Ḥasan, writes in this book Taqārīr Shaykh al-Hind, page: 133, that the Ḥanafīs say concerning Fātimah that: </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;She was a woman who was argumentative and lose with her tongue.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Hanafi books of usul Nūr al-Anwār, page: 183 and Uṣūl al-Shāshī page: 85, state:</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abū Huraīrah </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>that he was not a Faqīh, and that his riwāyah should be abandoned if it&#8217;s in contradiction to qiyās” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ḥanafīs have hurled this abuse at Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه due to the ḥadīth narrated by him known as the ḥadīth of Muṣarrā. This ḥadīth is muttafaq ʿalaīhi and in essence states that a person when selling an animal should not stop its milk so to make it seem to the buyer that its udders shall produce more milk than its true reality. Should this have been done once the buyer has milked the animal then the buyer has a right to return the animal together with a saah of dates or he can keep the animal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For the Ḥanafīs for well over a thousand years they could not see the logic or analogical reasoning behind Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه stating that along with giving back the animal one should also give a saa of dates to the seller. Thus they had to find an avenue to abandon his authentic ḥadīth and this could only be done by attacking teh being and person of the Imām of ḥadīth and Ṣaḥābī Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه so that there Maḏhabs position could be safeguarded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They forget that Ibn Masūd رضي الله عنه also gave the same verdict as Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه. Read this in line the hoodwinking they performed as stated above. Dare we ask if Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه was not a faqīh and would speak in opposition to sound logical reasoning and qiyās then how can Imām Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله or anyone else be a faqīh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is for this reason that these principles in the books of the Ḥanafī Maḏhab and jurisprudence, remain till today in edition after edition reprints and continue to be taught in their universities and colleges to those who are learning the Maḏhab of the Ḥanafīs. There has been no omission or retraction from such statements which have been made hundreds of years ago. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our Shaykh, Ḥāfiẓ Sanaʾ Allāh Zāhidī ibn Imām al-Dīn حفظه الله in his naqd and critique of Nūr al-Anwār has made detailed footnotes upon the text, and in page: 245-246, volume: 3, he has quoted around eighteen ʿĀʾimmah and Fuqahā of the aḥanāf who held this opinion concerning the Ṣaḥābī Abū Huraīrah رضي الله عنه not being a Faqīh, walī ʾAʿūḏhubillāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, one can refer to our Shaykh Zubāir ʿAlī Zaʾī رحمه الله (d.1435 Ah) writings where he has gathered in one place at least forty-one statements of the Ṣaḥābah where the Deobandīs have clearly opposed the Ṣaḥābah, just to defend their own Maḏhab, that is, the Maḏhab of Imām Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله. We hope to record some such instances in a later part to this paper. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The aḥanāf have not stopped in criticising Abū Huraīrah </strong><strong>رضي الله عنه </strong><strong>they&#8217;ve criticised others alongside him also for example, concerning the riwāyah of joining foot to foot, ankle to ankle which is narrated by Anas ibn Mālik </strong><strong>رضي الله عنه </strong><strong> </strong><strong>then ʾAmīn Ṣaftar Okarvī Deobandī (d.1421 Ah) writes in his book, Ḥāshyah [</strong><strong>حَاشِية</strong><strong>] Tafhīm al-Bukhārī ʿala Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, page: 380, volume: 1, that:</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Anas in the time of Rasūlullāh </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> was a boy who have not reached puberty and would stand in the back rows&#8221;. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʾAmīn Okarvī further writes: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Anas </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>and that which he done was in his infant age with the other children he has simply just narrated, however when he became older than the other Ṣaḥābah and the Tābiʿīn were upset at the actions of Anas of when he was a infant&#8221;. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> Here, we see once again that a riwāyah in Bukhārī from a Ṣaḥābī which no other Ṣaḥābah challenged is being explained away and belittled by saying that the rawī is a child, thus to be rejected. Yet, this riwāyah and those similar to it have been narrated by other than Anas رضي الله عنه  including the Ṣaḥābī Abū ʿAbd Allāh Nuʿmān ibn Bashīr رضي الله عنهما  in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, once again the precision and trustworthiness, Ḍabṭ and ʿAdālah of the Ṣaḥābah is being attacked as their position is ‘supposedly’ against the Maḏhab of Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله. The hoodwinking continues to be unravelled.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The ḥadīth which is narrated by ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar </strong><strong>رضي الله عنه </strong><strong>in Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī concerning the rafʿ al-yadayn, the raising of the hands of Rasūlullāh </strong><strong>‎</strong><strong>ﷺ</strong> <strong>in rukūʿ and out of rukūʿ, then in relation to this ʾAmīn Okarvī, once again writes in Ḥāshyah Tafhīm al-Bukhārī ʿala Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, page 385, volume 1, that: </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;However, Imām Bukhārī under this chapter has not brought a ḥadīth from any Muhājir or Anṣārī. He has brought a riwāyah from ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em> </em><em>who was a young child, or a ṣighār Ṣahābī, a small Ṣahābī and would stand in the back rows. And he had brought a riwāyah from Mālik ibn al-Khuwayrith who had only spent twenty nights with Rasūlullāh </em><em>‎</em><em>ﷺ</em><em>&#8220;. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Futhermore Okarvī writes in his book Tajallīyāt -e- Ṣaftar [تجلیات صفدر], page: 94, volume: 7, that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Likewise, Imām Bukhārī has not narrated anything from any Badrī Ṣahābī, a Ṣaḥābah who had participated at the battle of Badr rather he narrates from a childlike ibn ʿUmar and from who only spent twenty nights as a guest [Mālik ibn al-Khuwayrith] who narrates the Ḥadīth of rafʿ al-yadayn at nine different places, incomplete&#8221;. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is concerning Wāʾil ibn Ḥujr رضي الله عنه ʾAmīn Okarvī writes in his book Tajallīyāt -e- Ṣaftar, page: 94, volume: 7, that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Imām Muslim went one step further and with these two (Mālik ibn al-Khuwayrith and ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar) he also added a third Ṣahābī who was just a traveller by the name of Wāʾil ibn Ḥujr.  </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the hatred of the Deobandī Imām, not only for Imām Bukhārī رحمه الله and his Jāmiʾ al-Ṣaḥiḥ, but the Ṣaḥābah, he mocks them, he talks about them being merely children, he talks about them not reporting correctly and accurately, and for him the fact that the Muḥaddithīn such as Imām al-Bukhārī and Imām Muslim رحمهما الله were just picking and choosing aḥādīth from youngsters, walī ʾAʿūḏhubillāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask, if the Ṣaḥābah did not report correctly, or were merely travellers who spent little time with Rasūlullāh ‎ﷺ then did Imām Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله  spend any more time with the Nabī ‎ﷺ? Further, these very same Ṣaḥābah maintained their positions in adulthood and taught their students the rafʿ al-yadayn whilst continuing to act upon it, what will the blind following Ḥanafīs do with these facts?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, what were the ages of the &#8216;golden committee&#8217; of the forty scholars which the Ḥanafīs claim formed the backbone of the Ḥanafī Maḏhab? Some were around three and some five yet they are taken as giving verdicts at that age as well as formulating a Maḏhab!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Were Abū Ḥanīfa رحمه الله  or his students &#8216;Badrī Ṣaḥābah&#8217;</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Concerning Anas ibn Mālik </strong><strong>رضي الله عنه</strong><strong>, the Ḥanafī Imām Badr al-Dīn ʿAynī (d.855 Ah) the explainer of Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī writes in his book ʿUmdat al-Qāri Sharḥ Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī [</strong><strong>عمدة</strong><strong>القاري</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>شرح</strong><strong> </strong><strong>صحيح</strong><strong> </strong><strong>البخاري</strong> <strong>chapter: What should be said after the takbir, page: 291, volume: 5, that: </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;ويحتمل يكون أنس نسى في تلك الحال لكبر سنه وقد وقع مثل هذا كثيرا&#8221;. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;There is a possibility that Anas </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em> </em><em>in this condition became old and because of his old age he forgot, and such things have happened many times&#8221;. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> So it should be noted that for the Deobandīs to explain away the riwāyāt authentically reported from the Ṣaḥābah they not only call them children, the ones who stood in the back rows but the memory of Ṣaḥābah is challenged by calling them forgetful. Yet Imām Muḥammad Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī رحمه الله (d.1420 Ah) is attacked for critiquing a rawī in the isnād to a ḥadīth in Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī, Yaḥya ibn Sulaīm, who was not a Ṣaḥābah but from Aḥmad Ibn Ḥanbals رحمه الله  (d.241 Ah) period!  </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Barelwī Shaykh al-Ḥadīth Ghulām Rasūl Saʿīdī writes in his book, Sharḥ Ṣaḥiḥ Muslim, page: 1154, volume: 1 that: </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>&#8220;It is possible that Imām Dāraquṭnī </em><em>رحمه الله </em><em> </em><em>(d.385 Ah) brought the narration from Anas ibn Mālik </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>when Anas was in his old age and no doubt a person in his old age is prone to forget fullness&#8221;. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So in order to refute the ḥadīth from Anas رضي الله عنه  which goes against the Ḥanafī Maḏhab.  The Ḥanafī ʿulamaʾ are not only challenging their ʿAdālah but also challenging their Ḍabṭ of the Ṣaḥābah just to preserve their own Maḏhab. If this is not the abuse of the Ṣaḥābah then what is? </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Again, concerning Anas ibn Mālik </strong><strong>رضي الله عنه</strong><strong>, the famous personality from Ahl al-Bidʿah, Zāhid Ḥasan al-Kawthrī (d.1371 Ah) writes in his book, Taʿnīb al-Khatīb, page: 80, and also in the book, The upright defence of Abū Ḥanīfa by ʿAbd Allāh Quddūs Khān Qārān Deobandī, page: 213 that:  </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Furthermore concerning the narration of the head being squashed then the rawī is Anas ibn Mālik </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>alone and he narrated this when he was in his old age, similarly the narration of the Ṣaḥābah drinking the urine of the camels is narrated by him alone, and it is the position of Abū Ḥanīfa </em><em>رحمه الله </em><em>that no doubt the Ṣaḥābah are Just [ʿĀdl (</em><em>عادل</em><em>)], however despite this they are human beings and general laymen and sometimes because of old age they fell short in their precision of what they had heard and from this angle they are not free from mistake. In an instance where their narration contradicts the scholars of Fiqh then the scholar of Fiqh will be given preference and similarly in a instance where we have to remove the misunderstanding of that person when he narrated when he was in his old age then we take the narration of the one who contradicts him and who is younger&#8221;. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So here we have the Ḥanafī not only attacking the precision of the Ṣaḥābah who gave us our Dīn but they go further in saying that the Ṣaḥābah saying will be abandoned if it &#8216;contradicts a scholar of fiqh&#8217;. There is not much more to say on this point as it speaks volumes.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Ḥanafī Imām of jurisprudence Mulla Jīwan (d.1130 Ah) writes and quoted by ʾAmīn Ṣaftar Okarvī in his book, Futuhāt -e- Ṣaftar, page: 382, volume: 3, that:</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning Anas ibn Mālik رضي الله عنه </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;غير معرف ولاجتهاد&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He Anas </em><em>رضي الله عنه </em><em>was not known for his Fiqh his understanding of the dīn or his ijtihād&#8221;.</em> walī ʾAʿūḏhu billāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The irony of Mulla Jīwan quote as referenced by ʾAmīn Ṣaftar Okarvī Deobandī is after quoting this even though he it&#8217;s from his own books of jurisprudence he says that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This quote has been utilised by those who advocate that the Nabī </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> has passed away and cannot hear us and by a certain Mawlānā Younus Nuʿmānī Deobandī (d.1434 Ah) would he himself stand on the minbar and announce he has no Fiqh or call himself a person who is not upright or has no ijtihād then why would you say that about a Ṣahābī.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The irony continues further where Younus Nuʿmānī who advocated the Nabī ﷺ passed away and does not hear responses to his Deobandī contemporary ʾAmīn Ṣaftar Okarvī Ḥayātī who believed the Nabī ﷺ is alive and can hear, in Futuhāt -e- Ṣaftar, page: 382-383, volume: 3, the following words that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Dear brothers in this speech Mawlānā [Ṣaftar Okarvī] has done a great wrong. He has ascribed to me that I have said a Ṣahābī is not ʿādl rather a Fāsiq. I have merely quoted from the book Nūr al-Anwār and Uṣūl al-Shāshī, I have pointed what they have written, what Mawlānā should have done was asked me where these are written and I would have shown him but instead he has tried to beguile and fool the masses by ascribing these sayings to me, the irony is that if a ghair muqallid, salafī had done this then it would be a different thing but this is being done by someone who ascribe himself to Ḥanafīyyah and is a clear to the Ḥanafī Maḏhab, and he has said I have said about this Ṣahābī that he was not known for his Fiqh and ijtihād, then I ask are these books of Ḥanafī Fiqh not also accepted by you? Then let it be known if this is written in there that if the narration of Anas [ibn Mālik] contradicts qiyās then the analogy will be given precedence this is written clearly in our books Nūr al-Anwār and Uṣūl al-Shāshī, so why am I being blamed?&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Subḥān Allāh, pay close attention to teh above spat between the two Ḥanafī-Deobandīs scholars and see how they have abused the Ṣaḥābah. In fact, pay heed to how their books of the madhab abuse the Ṣaḥābah!! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, one can see the internal fighting and the abuse that the Ḥanafī-Deobandīs have levied towards the Ṣaḥābah. Then they accuse the Ahl al-Ḥadīth of being the worst perpetrators of abuse against the Sunnah by allegedly weakening reports in Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet they themselves not only have they put aside many aḥādīth from Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī as has been mentioned above, they have criticised the actual Ṣaḥābah رضوان الله عليهم أجمعين   who are the narrators of the aḥādīth of Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī and furthermore they have ridiculed both Imām al-Bukhārī and Imām Muslim رحمهما الله  as scholars of ḥadīth. So this is the case of the Deobandīs not being honest with the public about their reality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How one can attack the likes of Imām Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī رحمه الله   after such nonsense is beyond comprehension!! A lot more can be said but it will turn into a large book rather than a short and brief paper. Further, evidences shall follow on how the Deobandīs truly see the Ṣaḥābah, رضوان الله عليهم أجمعين, Allāhu ʾAʿlam</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst the Ḥanafīs are putting up a smoke screen and attacking the likes of Imām Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānīرحمهالله  for making certain non marfūʿ muallaq riwāyāt in Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī daʿif, then much can be said in regards to this. However, this short treatise is designed as a response to show the actuality of the Ḥanafī Maḏhab and what they say about the aḥādīth of Rasūlullāh ﷺ and those that reported them and carried them to us, that is the Ṣaḥābah. Why al-Albānīرحمهالله  felt that certain riwāyāt where not connected back to Rasūlullāh ﷺ in Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī then this is a different a discussion for which he had a Salaf whether we agree or disagree with that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many of our ʿulamaʾ have disagreed with Imām al-Albānīرحمهالله  on his position concerning this. But why is it that the Deobandīs have decided highlighted this now? We say it is only because the reality of what the Deobandīs believe concerning Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī and other than that is hidden from the people and it is becoming apparent to them only now what they actually believe about Bukhārī and the aḥādīth that go back to Rasūlullāh ﷺ and the Ṣaḥābah in order to hide this they&#8217;ve now decided to counter attack by attacking Imām al-Albānī رحمهالله. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, what is it that the Ḥanafīs believe about the Ṣaḥābah? Below are just a few quotes concerning the Ḥanafīs and the belief concerning the Ṣaḥābah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author Pīr Syed Mushtāq ʿAlī Shāh Deobandī writes in his book, Tarjamah al-Aḥanāf, page: 119, says concerning the female Ṣahābī, Fāṭmah bint Qay that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Allāh knows whether she was truthful in her speech or she was lying&#8221;.</em></span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ʾAʿūḏhubillāh. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If this is not attack on the ʿAdālah and trustworthiness of the Ṣaḥābah in favour of the likes of the Shīʿah, the Qādiyānī and other than that what else can it be seen as? The scholar of Ḥadīth and master debater of the Deobandīs ʾAmīn Ṣaftar Okarvī Deobandī, writes in his book, Tajallīyāt -e- Ṣaftar, page: 152, volume: 3, which has been published by Ishāt al-ʿulūm al-Ḥanafīyyah in Faisalabad, Pakistan, and also in his book, Juz al-Qirraʿat bī Ḥāshyah, with the Ḥāshyah of ʾAmīn Okarvī, page: 131, he said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;And this ʿUbādah is majhūl al-ḥāl, Mīzān al-Iʿtidāl &#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Comment:</strong> ʾAmīnOkarvī is referring to ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit RadiAllahu Anhu the Ṣahābī who narrates the riwāyah, there is no Ṣalāh without the Fātiḥah in Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here ʾAmīn Okarvī is calling a Ṣahābī of Rasūlullāh ﷺ unknown whereas the Ahl al-Sunnah have Ijmāʿ that every single Ṣaḥābah is upright and just. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">أهْلُ السُّنَّةِ والْجَمَاعَة عَلَى أنَّهُم كُلّهم عُدُو</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whether the condition (حال) is known to us or not it is irrelevant and does not matter whatsoever, because they are assumed and presumed to be all upright and just, but here in order to explain the ḥadīth in a way as it contradicts the Ḥanafī Maḏhab this individual has called the Ṣahābī ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit majhūl al-ḥāl, we do not know his biography to the extent we do not know about him and his trustworthiness, ʾAʿūḏhubillāh. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our Shaykh ZubāirʿAlī Zaʾī رحمهالله  writes in his book, Masāʾalah Fātiḥah Khalf al-Imām, page: 26, whilst commenting on this quote of the DeobandīʾAmīnṢaftarOkarvī, he says the following: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It should be noted that the reference which this Deobandī, ʾAmīnOkarvī has given concerning the Ṣahābī, ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit</em> <em>being majhūl al-ḥāl from Mizān al-Iʿtidāl is a complete and utter fabrication and lie, we can say without a doubt that there is no reference in Mīzān al-Iʿtidāl of ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit being called majhūl al-ḥāl and All Praise belongs to Allāh </em><em>ﷻ</em><em>.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another particularly famous Deobandī, Ḥussain Aḥmad Tāndwī Deobandī writes in his book, Tawḍiḥ al-Tirmidhī page: 436, printed by Madanī mission book depot in Madanī Nagar, Calcutta, India, he writes: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;And this ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit is making anʿana and he is a mudallis and the anʿana of a mudallis not accepted.&#8221;</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">WalīʾAʿūḏhubillāh, this ignoramus Deobandī is calling a Ṣahābī a mudallis and no one on the face of this earth has ever said anything about the Ṣaḥābah from amongst the Muslims except that all of them upright and just and their ʿAdālah and Ḍabṭ of the Dīn and relaying it is unquestionable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here he is calling him a mudallis meaning effectively a man would narrate from the Nabī ﷺ put not in the correct manner and it&#8217;s from principles of ḥadīth that the anʿanah of a mudallis is not accepted unless he shows he&#8217;s heard directly from the one that he narrates from. This station cannot be levied upon ʿUbādah the Ṣahābī for he was a Ṣahābī of Rasūlullāh ﷺ and we cannot question the uprightness of any Ṣahābī let allow ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit who was from the major Ṣaḥāba.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We therefore say as it was by our teacher that this is not only a abuse of the Ṣahābī ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit but a clear fabrication and lie concerning him so that the Maḏhab of the Ḥanafī can be preserved in not praying Fātiḥah behind the Imām. Will the muqallid not stop at nothing even the abuse of the Ṣaḥābahin order to safe guard and preserve his Maḏhab? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholar of the Deobandīs, Faz al-Raḥman Ganj Murādabādī (d.1323 Ah), writes in his book, Malfūzat -e- Thānwī, page: 254, volume: 24, that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;In the night in my dream I met Fāṭima and she hugged me close, next to her chest and I became better&#8221;.</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, this Deobandī scholar claimed to have met Fāṭima and claims she hugged him, walīʾAʿūḏhubillāh, can you imagine if someone said to this Deobandī scholar that I met your sister or mother in my dream and she hugged me, what would he say? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, the Deobandī Imām Taqī ʿUthmānī, writes in his book, Dars -e- Tirmidhī Maktabah Dar al-ʿulūm Karachi, page: 455, volume: 1, whilst talking about a statement in the classical Ḥanafī book Hidāyah, that: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;However, the author of hidāyah has alluded to the fact that he believed Abū Maḥḏhūrah that his understanding was weak and based upon suspicion, then this is not something that is correct&#8221;.</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence Taqīʿ Uthmānī is accepting that the author of hidāyah which is a classical text taught to every Ḥanafī student of knowledge, authored by Mulla Murghaīnān īḤanafī is talking ill of Sayyīd Abū Maḥḏhūra and this is something which is incorrect. </span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We know the ḥadīth of Anas ibn Mālik from Ṣaḥiḥ al-Bukhārī, Book: Call to prayer, Ḥadīth: 725,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Imām al-Bukhārī titled the chapter heading as:</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>إِلْزَاقِ</em><em> </em><em>الْمَنْكِبِ</em><em> </em><em>بِالْمَنْكِبِ</em><em> </em><em>وَالْقَدَمِ</em><em> </em><em>بِالْقَدَمِ</em><em> </em><em>فِي</em><em> </em><em>الصَّفِّ</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;And we joined in the rows our shoulders to each other&#8217;s shoulders and our foot to foot in a row&#8221;</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then making fun and levelling fun and mocking this riwāyah, the DeobandīʾAmīn Okarvī writes in this book, Ḥāshyah Tafhīm al-Bukhārīʿ ala Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, page: 380, volume: 1, published by: Maktabah Madīna, Lahore, he states that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Imām al-Bukhārī</em><em> </em><em>رحمهالله </em><em> </em><em>quotes the riwāyah from Anas, and Anas had not reached the age of puberty at the time of the Rasūlullāh </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> and would stand in the back rows. And Bukhārī has not even quoted the entire quote from Anas. Anas&#8217;s teacher Abū Bakr ibn Abī Shaybah (d.235 Ah) says that:</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It was said to Anas that you will see that if today you join your feet like you have previously been doing, then the people, meaning the Ṣaḥābah and the Tābiʿīn will run away from you like wild mules. Therefore, it is apparent that when a person becomes older he begins to develop some intellect and leaves off what he was doing when he was young. That which Anas done when he was young he done whilst he was around children however when he became older the Ṣaḥābah and the Tābiʿīn became upset at this habit of Anas. Therefore,it is clear that to him the feet is not the Sunnah of the Rasūlullāh </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> nor the Sunnah of the Ṣaḥābah and if it was a Sunnah or recommended to do this then the Ṣaḥābah and the Tābiʿīn would never be upset from such a habit or a Sunnah.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, we know what ʾAmīnOkarvī has said has opposed by Anas ibn Mālik myself in Ṣaḥiḥ Muslim, Book: The book of drinks, Chapter: It is recommended to pass water and milk etc, to the right of the one who drinks first, Ḥadīth: 2029(b), who said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;</em><em>قَدِمَ</em><em> </em><em>النَّبِيُّ</em><em> </em><em>صلى</em><em> </em><em>الله</em><em> </em><em>عليه</em><em> </em><em>وسلم</em><em> </em><em>الْمَدِينَةَ</em><em> </em><em>وَأَنَا</em><em> </em><em>ابْنُ</em><em> </em><em>عَشْرٍ</em><em> </em><em>وَمَاتَ</em><em> </em><em>وَأَنَا</em><em> </em><em>ابْنُ</em><em> </em><em>عِشْرِينَ</em><em>&#8220;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When the Nabī </em><em>ﷺ</em><em> came to Medina when I was ten years old and he died when I was twenty years old.</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, Okarvī calling Anas a young infant child who hadn&#8217;t reach puberty in the time of Rasūlullāh ﷺ is a utter fabrication and lie because we know at the death of Rasūlullāh ﷺ he was a twenty year old man, and Okarvī has lied upon him [Anas ibn Mālik] and opposed the aḥādīth in Ṣaḥiḥ Muslim and he has only done this so he can preserve his own Maḏhab of keeping the space of four handspans between each people in ṣalāh, as stipulated in the Ḥanafī Maḏhab without any bases whatsoever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is what he is saying in the previous quote that the Ṣaḥābah if it was done in his time, Anas was told by the other Ṣaḥābah and the Tābiʿīn if you do this today, meaning if you do this now after the death of Rasūlullāh ﷺ and now that you&#8217;ve grown up we&#8217;d run away from you like mules runaway from each other than this is without evidence and there is not authentic riwāyah going back to Anas ibn Mālik or other than that for this. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One can also refer to the acceptance of ʾAmīn Okarvī, who writes in his book, Tajallīyāt -e- Ṣaftar, page: 466, volume: 3, and, Futuhāt -e- Ṣaftar, page: 80, volume: 2, he states that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Nūr al-Anwār the famous book Ḥanafī of jurisprudence has called the Ṣahābī Muʿāwiya</em> <em>ignorant&#8221;.</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There will be a lot more said about the Ṣaḥābah and the Ḥanafīs but it suffices at this stage just to know that the Ḥanafīs have not left the Ṣaḥābah unscathed in order to defend their own Maḏhab yet they attack the Ahl al-Ḥadīth scholars for talking about the aḥādīth concerning Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">by the two weak slaves of Allāh</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Hanafi Fiqh Channel have produced two videos showing that Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani weakened ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari. As I mentioned in the previous part, we will address the issues a little later In Shāʿ Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Following on from the previous part where I showed the position and outlook of Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah and his understanding of Sahih Muslim-the authenticity of the hadith contained therein, it showed his blind fanaticism for the hanafi madhab and his true position of the hadith in Sahih Muslim. This was an answer to the second video produced by the Hanafi Fiqh channel wherein the speaker talks about Sahih Muslim. (please refer to part 2)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both speakers in their respective parts digress to mention some comical points throughout their videos. They contained cheap shots and immature presentation of points. For example, they said we know the Salafi group attacks the four Imams, we did not know they would attack Sahih al-Bukhari and other such illiterate type of points. We assure you, do not worry, since you have opened this closet your hanafi skeletons will most certainly come to haunt you. More on this In Shāʿ Allāh in the forthcoming parts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will however overlook these points and not stoop to their level, whereas our intent is to bring clarity to these matters and the mindset, these young brothers wish to portray of Shaikh Allamah Rabbani Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here is another example how juvenile and childish these people are. When they mention Shaikh al-Albani’s name they say Nasir ud Din, when we all know the Shaikhs full name is Muhammad Nasir ud Din. This is the level of these people, such is their hatred and animosity that they can not even bring themselves to say the name Muhammad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Anyway, Shaikh al-Albani talks about the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and he looked at how some of the hadith which did not fulfill the criteria. He talks about Imams before him, like Imam Daraqutni, Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Hafiz Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, Hafiz Ibn Hajr and Hafiz al-Mundhiri, who also spoke about some of the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and their wording.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani gives three examples to highlight what he refers to when he did a generic gloss of the Sahihayn, and it is not as the detractors make out, that he scrutinized and analysed the whole of Sahih al-Bukhari. Shaikh al-Albani clearly says his contention is with just about 10 ahadith and that Imam Daraqutni questions 12 or so hadith from the Sahih of Imam Bukhari.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani clearly said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Therefore, it is not wisdom or knowledge for me to focus on critiquing the Sahihayn and abandon the hadith in the 4 sunans.” (watch video)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If a person questions my judgements of some of the hadiths, then they can look at Fath al-Bari and they will find many many things that are criticized by Hafiz Ahmad bin Hajr al-Asqalani.” (watch video)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“This Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani clarified in his Sharh (Fath al-Bar) many mistakes in the ahadith of Bukhari…” (watch video)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the three examples Shaikh al-Albani talks about is the hadith of Ibn Abbas radiAllahu Anhuma concerning the marriage of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to Maymunah radhiallahu anha while he was in ihram, he said the hadith is authentic in terms of its chains but the interpretation is of Ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhuma. Other ahadith that are critiqued are based on the narrators in the chain, this is the second type. With the third type being additional words added to the hadith to indicate a meaning that were not actually transmitted, like the hadith of the limbs radiating light due to being frequently washed in Wudu.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These are just some of the points that relate to this intricate science, and it is most certainly not for every individual to delve into it. This is more applicable and pertinent to those who proudly claim and openly attest they are hanafi muqallids ie in other words, they are strikingly ignorant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This being said, other modern day writers in academia have also alluded to Shaikh al-Albani weakening hadith in Bukhari, at least three different writers. Yet the same writers have strangely overlooked and ignored the criticism and views of Hafiz Ibn Hajr in his al-Fath and Imam Daraqutni’s queries. One of the aforementioned writers, in all fairness did look at Daraqutni’s queries and presented his arguments. Interestingly a fourth writer asserts Sahih al-Bukhari is the backbone of Salafi Islam, as the writer suggests. This is not far from the truth as Shaikh al-Albani was one of the most famous proponents of Salafiyyah, since when have the modern day Hanafi Ash’arites shown any care or love for Sahih al-Bukhari, except they worked on it to defend their Madhhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such writers and others like Hamza Malyabari and of his ilk suggest Shaikh al-Albani’s critical analysis of hadith was not in line with the methods of the earlier scholars. This is another farcical allegation which has been rebutted by many writers. The following book, being just one example dismantles and dismisses this embarrassing claim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-8087 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=386%2C685" alt="DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=169%2C300 169w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=768%2C1365 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=576%2C1024 576w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?w=1152 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zakariyyah bin Ghulam Qadir Pakistani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">(pp.280, Riyadh: Maktabah al-Ma&#8217;arif Lil-Nashr wal-Tawzi&#8217;a, 1431H/2010ce) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being, such matter are based of Ijtihad in relation to understanding the intricacies of this magnificent science, and only those who are free from the shackles of extreme blind partisanship and destructive fanaticism can look at such matters objectively. This excludes the extreme muqallids who vehemently acknowledge they are ignorant and are obligated to perform taqlid, yet they are the ones making youtube videos, reading the ahadith from Bukhari to show the inconsistencies and approach of the Salafi’s but they themselves reject the hadith in Bukhari when it is time to accept and act on them. This is most reprehensible!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Low and behold, here is the clarification from Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani when he was asked if he graded hadith in Bukhari weak and if the Scholars before him preceded him in it. Please watch it and be sincere without bigotry or sectarian partisanship.</span></p>
