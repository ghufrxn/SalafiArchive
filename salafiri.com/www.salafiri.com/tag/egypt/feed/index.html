<span class="bold">His Kunya</span>: Abu Saeed (1).<br />

He lived in Herat, and traveled many regions, he traveled to Hijaz, Iraq, Sham (3), Egypt, and other countries. He stayed in Jurjan (4) in 273 H. (5)</p>
<p>He met in those lands the prominant Huffadh (scholars of hadith) and Imams, the ones that he learned from:</p>

&#8211; Ishaq bin Rahwaih<br />
&#8211; Yahya bin Ma&#8217;een<br />
&#8211; Ali bin al Madini<br />
And others.</p>
<p>He studied Fiqh under Al-Buwaiti, the companion of Imam Shafi&#8217;i, and Arabic linguistics from Abu Abdullah Ibn Al-A`rabi. (7)</p>
<p><span class="bold">His Students:</span><br />
&#8211; His son: Muhammad bin Uthman. (8)<br />
&#8211; Al Mu&#8217;ammal bin Al-Hasan bin Isaa.<br />
&#8211; Abul Abbas Ahmad bin Al-Azhar.<br />
&#8211; Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Abdoos At-Tara&#8217;ifi.<br />
&#8211; Hamed Ar-Rafa&#8217;<br />
And others. (9)</p>
<p><span class="artRedTitle">His Life And Scholars&#8217; views of Him:</span></p>
<p>&#8211; <span class="artBlue">Ibn Hibban</span> mentioned him in Thiqat (Trustworthy ones), and said: &#8220;One of the Imams of the world, he narrates from Abu al Waleed and the people of Iraq.&#8221; (10)<br />
&#8211; <span class="artBlue">Ya&#8217;qub al Qarrab</span> said: &#8220;I have not seen the like of Uthman b. Sa`id neither has he seen the like of himself. He studied Literature under Ibn Al-A&#8217;rabi, Fiqh under Abu Ya&#8217;qub al-Buwaiti, and Hadith from Yahya bin Ma&#8217;een and Ali bin al Madini. He was leading in these sciences, may Allah have mercy on him.&#8221;<br />
&#8211; Muhammad bin al Mundhir said: &#8220;I heard <span class="artBlue">Abu Zur&#8217;ah Ar-Razi</span>, and I asked him about Uthman bin Saeed, so he said:&#8217; He has been gifted in authoring fine works.&#8217; &#8221;<br />
&#8211; <span class="artBlue">Abul-Fadl al-Jarudi</span> said: &#8220;He was an Imam to be followed in his lifetime and after his death.&#8221;<br />
<span class="artBlue">Al-Hasan bin Saheb Ash-Shashi</span> said: &#8220;I asked Abu Dawud As-Sijistani (11) about Uthman bin Saeed, so he said: &#8216; From him we learned Hadith.&#8217; &#8221; (12)<br />
<span class="artBlue">Abu Hamid Al-A&#8217;mashi said:</span> &#8220;I have not seen from the Muhaditheen anyone like Muhammad bin Yahya, Uthman bin Saeed <span class="artTakhrij">[Ad-Darimi]</span>, and Ya&#8217;qbu bin Sufyan.&#8221; (13)</p>
<p>Abu Uthman As-Sabuni narrated with his own chain that Imam Qutaibah bin Saeed said at the end of his book &#8220;al Iman&#8221;:<br />
&#8220;If you see a man loving Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Malik bin Anas, Al-Awza&#8217;i&#8230;&#8221; and he mentioned a number of Imams, then he said: &#8220;Then know that He is upon the Sunnah.&#8221; Then <span class="artBlue">Abu Uthman As-Sabuni</span> said: &#8220;And I added to those that Qutaibah rahimahulllah mentioned: That whomever loves them, he is upon the Sunnah, from the Imam of Hadith whom are to be followed, and to be upon their guidance&#8230; from them are: Muhammad bin Idrees Ash-Shafi&#8217;i&#8230;&#8221; and he mentioned a number of scholars, from them was: Uthman bin Saeed Ad-Darimi. (14)</p>
<p><span class="artBlue">Adh-Dhahabi</span> said about him: &#8220;The Imam, Allamah, the Hafidh, the Critic &#8230; he was persevere upon the Sunnah, and well-versed in debating.&#8221;<br />
He also said: &#8220;Uthman ad-Darimi was like a tree trunk in the eyes of the innovators&#8217; (15), and it was said that he is the one who stood up against Muhammad bin Karram &#8211; whom the sect al-Karramiyah are attributed to &#8211; and exiled him from Herat.&#8221; (16)</p>
<p><span class="artBlue">Taj Ad-Deen As-Subki</span> said about him: &#8220;One of the Trustworthy scholars, and whom was mentioned by Al-Abbadi in his &#8220;Tabaqat&#8221; saying: &#8216; The Imam of Hadith and Fiqh&#8230;) (17)</p>
<p><span class="artBlue">Al-Hasan Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Abdoos</span> said:<br />
&#8220;When I wanted to travel to Uthman bin Saeed Ad-Darmi, I came to Abu Bakr Muhammad b. Ishaq b. Khuzaimah, and I asked him to write to him for me, so he wrote to him. I entered Herat in Rabee&#8217; al Awwal, 280 H. I went to Uthman bin Saeed, and delivered the letter to him. He read it and welcomed me, and asked me how Abu Bakr Ibn Khuzaimah was doing, then he said to me: &#8216;When did you arrive?&#8217;<br />
I said: Tomorrow.<br />
He said: &#8216;My son, go back to them, for you haven&#8217;t come yet.&#8217;<br />
so I got embarrassed.<br />
Then he said: &#8216; Don&#8217;t be shy my son, for I have resided in your country for two years, and your shaikhs at that time were able to bear from me things like this.&#8217; &#8221; (18)</p>
<p><span class="bold">His Works:</span><br />
&#8211; A large Musnad (19)<br />
&#8211; Ar-Rad ala al-Jahmiya (Refuting Jahmiya)<br />
&#8211; Naqd or Ar-Rad ala Bishr al Mirrisi (Replying to the heretic Bishr al Mirrisi d. 218 H.) (20)</p>
<p><span class="bold">His Death:</span><br />
He passed away in Dhul Hijjah, 280 Hijri.</p>
<p><span class="artRedTitle">His Statments in Some Matters of Belief (Aqeedah)</span> :</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">&#8211; Tawheed:</span><br />
Uthman Ad-Darimi said: &#8220;And the meaning of Tawheed in the Ummah is saying: &#8216;La Ilaha Illa Allah Wahdahu La Sharika Lahu&#8217; (21).&#8221; (22)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">&#8211; Istiwa and Allah&#8217;s Elevation:</span><br />
He said:<br />
&#8220;And the Muslims have agreed that Allah is above His Throne, above His Heavens.&#8221; (23)<br />
&#8220;And we knew, with no doubt, that Allah is above His Throne, above His Heavens, like He described Himself, separate from His creation.&#8221; (24)<br />
&#8220;For Allah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;la is above His Throne, above His Heavens, separate from His creation, so whoever doesn&#8217;t know Him like this, then he doesn&#8217;t know His God Whom he worships.&#8221; (25)<br />
He said in regards to Allah&#8217;s saying -translation of the meaning-: <span class="artAya">{And Pharoah said, &#8220;O Haman, construct for me a tower that I might reach the ways * The ways of the heavens, so that I may look at the God (Ilah) of Moses, but indeed, I think he is a liar.&#8221;}</span> <span class="artTakhrij">[40:36-37]</span> :<br />
&#8220;In these ayat is a clear explanation, and an obvious indicator that Musa was calling Fir&#8217;awn (Pharoah) to know that Allah is above the heaven, and because of that, he (Fir&#8217;awn) ordered to build a big tower, and wanted to see Him (Allah Ta&#8217;ala).&#8221; (26)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">Allah being with His creation -Ma`iyyah-</span>:<br />
He said: «Some of them said: Let&#8217;s put aside the interpretation of scholars, we only depended on the Quran for evidence, so bring the Book of Allah. We said: ‘yes … however, you are ignorant of its meaning, so strayed from the straight path, and you clung to the middle of the ayah, and deliberately overlooked its beginning and its ending, because Allah –Azza wa Jal- began the verse with His knowledge of them, and ended it with that, He said: <span class="artAya">{Have you not seen that Allah knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth? There is no Najwa (secret counsel) of three, but He is their fourth&#8230;}</span> until His saying: <span class="artAya">{and afterwards on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they did. Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of everything}</span>, so this is evidence that He meant His knowledge of them and their deeds, not that He Himself is in every place with them as you claim.» (27)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">On Tashbih in Allah&#8217;s Attributes</span>:<br />
He said:<br />
<span class="artAthar">«As there is nothing like Him (Allah), thus there is no hand like His Hand.»</span> (28)<br />
<span class="artAthar">«As there is nothing like Him, there is no hearing like His Hearing, nor sight like His Sight, and there is nothing in creation that they can be compared, or likened or resembled to.»</span> (29)<br />
<span class="artAthar">«All of these ahadeeth, and even more than it, mention the descending of the Lord, Most High; and the people of Fiqh and knowledge from our scholarly teachers are upon believing in them; none of them deny any of these ahadeeth or refrained from narrating them until this group (i.e. jahmiyyah) appeared, who then opposed the ahadeeth of the Messenger of Allah and expended great effort to oppose them, so they questioned: ‘How does He descend?’, to which we replied: ‘We were not commanded to know how He descends in our Religion, and our minds cannot comprehend/grasp it, and there is no creation that is equal to Him that we may equate His acts or attributes with.»</span> (30)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">On Seeing Allah in the Hereafter</span>:<br />
«When Allah put a restriction for seeing Him in the Hereafter with His saying: <span class="artAya">{Looking (ila) at their Lord (Allâh)}</span> (i.e. with the preposition “ila” which means to/towards), we knew that it is the seeing of the eyes.» (31)</p>

And here, Hafidh Adh-Dhahabi used the &#8220;tree trunk&#8221; instead of the &#8220;speck&#8221; as an exaggeration, to show how much pain he was to the people of innovation, because he stood up to them strongly, and was severe against their innovations.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already mentioned the authentic narration of Ibrāhīm bin Maisarah that the narration was regarding Muʿawīyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥafiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-Asqalānī cites from ʿUmar bin ʿAbdul ʿAzīz that when the name of Yazīd would be mentioned he would seek Allāhs mercy on him ie meaning he would say Rahimahullāh [Lisān al-Mīzān [6/294]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah has denied the report of 20 lashes which has already been mentioned in the previous paper. [Refer to Sārim al-Maslūl ʿAla Shātim ar-Rasūl [pg.574].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ignorant people like Aquilani Ahmed and others like him object as to why is Rahimahullāh said after his name and how can he be the Amīr al-Muʿminīn. The answer is quite simple as some Companions were alive at the time as well as senior Tabiʿeen and no doubt they were believers so how does can this title be denied for him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, some of the following illustrious and noble individuals referred to him as Amīr al-Muʿminīn just to name a few</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Nuʿmān bin Bashīr RadhiAllahu Anhu [64H]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">(2) Alī bin Ḥussain [93-100H]</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All sorts of lies and fabrications are levied against Yazīd in order to discredit him. They also lie based on a deep rooted sentiment that Yazīd must be blamed for the death of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu. These slanderous and treacherous accusations were concocted by none other than the Rāfiḍah Shīʿa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The undercover Ḥanafī Aquilani (Aqeel Ahmed) cited a few reports which elucidated that Yazīd was responsible for the death of companions, we will inshaAllāh address this point later. Just a basic rebound for this is there were numerous companions who were with Yazīd at the time and supported him, so will the same be levied against them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also alleged against that he killed hundreds of people and desecrated the Prophets Masjid and his resting place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah refutes this claim and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“10,000 people were not killed and nor was blood spilled at the Prophets Masjid and grave and neither was there any fighting in the Prophets Masjid.”</em> [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/253]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah went on to say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“None of the Muslims rulers from amongst Banī Umayyah or Banī </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Abbās travelled to the K</em><em>ʿ</em><em>abah with the intention of desecrating it. The representative of Yazīd nor Hajjāj bin Yūsuf the representative of Abdul Mālik did this, in fact all of the Muslims respected the K</em><em>ʿ</em><em>abah.”</em> [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/254]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Aquilani Ahmed the deceptive undercover Ḥanafī boldly threw a hideous accusation of, “you cannot digest the criticism against Yazīd” and this individual based his foolish accusation on a number of narrations. From among the narrations he presented was that a person mentioned Yazīds bin Muʿawīyyahs name and said Amīr al-Muʿminīn whereupon Umar bin ʿAbdul ʿAzīz [101H] ordered for the man to be lashed 20 times. [Siyār ʿAlām an-Nabulā 4/35-40] as Aquilani Ahmed quoted</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, the authentic narration is as transmitted by Ibrāhīm bin Maisarah where he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have never seen Umar bin </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Abdul </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Azīz hit anyone except the man who cursed and abused Mu</em><em>ʿ</em><em>awīyyah and he (Umar bin </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Abdul </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Aziz) lashed him.”</em> [Sārim al-Maslūl ʿAla Shātim ar-Rasūl [pg.574], al-Bidāyah Wan-Nihāyah [8/139], Ṣawāʿiq Mehrqah [pg.221] and Nibrās [pg.551] of ʿAllāmah ʿAbdul ʿAziz Farhārwī [d.1239H], see also Nāhīyah ʿAnn Dham Muʿawīyyah [pg.20]</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: justify;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After cursing and hurling abuse at Yazīd, the Shīʿa Rāfiḍah then begin to abuse the governor of Kūfah, Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād who died in the year 64H. They allege that when he came to Kūfah at the behest of Yazīd he was ordered to capture Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu and to kill him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A few days ago it was relayed to us by the admin of <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.Salafiri.com">www.Salafiri.com</a> Facebook account that an undercover Ḥanafī and neo-Jahmī whilst posing as an Ahle Ḥadīth was vehemently arguing in declaring Yazīd a fāsiq and a drunkard and thus someone to be shunned etc etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This undercover person is known to troll and give the false idea that he is an Ahle Ḥadīth when in actual fact from this language as well as other reasons that he is as an ardent Ḥanafī. The readers may know him as Aquilani Ahmed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After seeing the screen shots of his conversation with the admin he ignorantly claims after retracting his initial position that although Yazīd may have been free of the murder of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu he is still responsible and accountable for not bringing the culprits to justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What this mischief maker and ignorant person Aquilani Ahmed (an alias for Aqeel Ahmed) failed to realise is that he did take account of the culprits who were none other than the Rāfiḍah Shīʿa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Secondly we find from the books of Ahlus Sunnah and the Shīʿa that Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād was clearly instructed on the contrary ie to only secure Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ṭabarī and Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Kathīr mention that Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu does not intend to come to us then we do not have any concern.” </em>(meaning coming to Kūfah to see the treacherous and deceptive Rāfiḍah Shīʿa) [Tārīkh al-Umam Wal Malūk [4/282], Al-Bidāyah Wan Nihayah [8/157]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shīʿa authors Mullā Bāqir Majlīsī, Muḥsin Amīn Āmālī and Shaikh Mufīd all mention,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“As for </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu does not intend to come to us then we also will not have any concern.”</em> [Kitāb al-Irshād [pg.251], Lūwaʿij al-Ashjān [pg.57] and Jalā al-ʿAyūn [pg.366]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the instructions and guidance which Yazīd sent to Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād was clear and specific and both the books of Ahlus Sunnah and the Shīʿa mention this, which was,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I (meaning Yazīd) have been informed that </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu has left for </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Irāq therefore place watchers at the frontiers. Keep a watch over the people you suspect (ie those who sent letters to </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu inviting him to Kūfah) and arrest those who have been blamed and have allegations levied against them. However, do not fight anyone that does not fight you and continue updating me with whatever happens. Wasalam.”</em> [al-Umam Wal Malūk [4/286],  Al-Bidāyah Wan Nihayah [8/165], Akhbār at-Tawāl [pg.242] and Maqtil Ḥussain [1/214] of Akhtab Khawārazimī  Shīʿa]</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></em></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">History has seen whenever a group of people is responsible for a heinous crime they always attempt to blame others, at the same time they deny and reject any responsibility.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Rāfiḍah Shīʿa are so corrupt and deceptive in their portrayal of the true affair of Karbala that one begs a question that if Yazīd was so bad and evil which made him responsible for the death and killing of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu, why do the Shīʿa mourn, lament and act this false drama of beating themselves up. The fact of the matter is there can only be one truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They blame Yazīd but they also beat themselves up for being responsible. This shows the Shīʿas need to have a reality check and ask themselves what kind of religion encourages such violent behaviour to the extent that young children to adults are made to suffer in pain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a true reality that the Shīʿas themselves were responsible for the death and the slaughter of the family of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu, May Allāh raise their rank, Amīn.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, in scape goating others the Shīʿa have fabricated and concocted all sorts of lies, slander and centuries of a smear campaign against Yazīd Rahimahullāh and Mūʿawiyyah RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu and a vicious and brutal onslaught of their character and personalities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The actual facts and realities are totally contrary to what Shīʿa speakers and story tellers have been inaccurately regurgitating from their repugnant books   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example the Shīʿa say from their fabrications that when the head of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu was taken to Yazīd Rahimahullah he his teeth and face with hit a stick.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is indeed one of the worst lies the Shīʿa can fabricate, Imām Ibn Taymīyyah repudiates this lie and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This is not established as the narration itself contains the reason it is lie and that is when this incident allegedly and supposed happened, the companions were not in Sh</em><em>ā</em><em>m but rather they were in Iraq.”</em> (Minhāj as-Sunnah (2/249)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They further add to this and say the head of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu was paraded around in the cities and in Sham. Then this is also an arch lie and the head of Hussain RadhiAllahu Anhu was not paraded at all as the Rāfiḍah Shīʿa claim. (Refer to Farsī Ṣharh Qasīdah Amālī (pg.23) and Minhāj as-Sunnah (2/249)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With this is the false allegation that Yazīd was responsible for Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu’s death. Which again is totally incorrect that Yazīd was responsible for the death of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu, that he gave the order or that he was happy with it. (Refer to Fatāwa (4/486). Wafyāt al-ʿAyān (1/328) Mir’ah al-Janān (3/176), al-Bidāyah Wan-Nihāyah (12/173), Ṣharh Fiqh ul-Akbar (pg.88), Nibrās (pg.544), Ḍhu’a al-Mʿālī (pg.50), Minhāj as-Sunnah (4/179), Sawāʿiq al-Meḥrqah (pg.223).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is further cited that Yazīd did not order the killing of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu and the people of texts are in agreement in this. (al-Muntaqa Min Minhāj al-ʿE’tidāl (pg.292), Minhāj as-Sunnah (2/225)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yazīd had no intention of killing Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu but rather he just wanted him to be kept away from the Khilāfah and control any further support and uprising against his rule.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah clearly said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“More than one scholar has said that Yazid did not order the killing of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu nor was this his intention. In fact Yazīd respected and honoured him as his father Mu</em><em>ʿ</em><em>āwiyyah instructed him. Yazīd wanted to control and prevent Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu from forming a Khilāfah and rebelling against him.” </em>[Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/249]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is also the reason why some of the leaders of the armies were very respectful of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu and his family just as Yazīd had instructed Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād when he sent him from Shām. He said to him to prevent Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu from reaching the outposts of the Islamic kingdom. [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/225]  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another lie the Rāfiḍah Shī’a utter is that the head of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu was taken to Shām and presented to Yazīd. Their aim here is to deceive the people and emotionally coerce them into thinking of the oppression which was forced on Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu so much so that his head was severed from his body???</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah clearly said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The head of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu was not brought to Sh</em><em>ā</em><em>m at all.”</em> [Majmūʿa al-Fatāwa [3/412 and 27/490]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu head being bought to Yaz</em><em>ī</em><em>d is B</em><em>ā</em><em>ṭil ie false and the chain for this is disconnected ie weak.”</em> [Majmūʿa al-Fatāwa [27/470], Minhāj as-Sunnah [4/179]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Taymīyyah further refutes this deceptive notion and says,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“As for the head of </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu the scholars are agreed that it was not taken to Egypt or Sh</em><em>ā</em><em>m.”</em> [Majmūʿa al-Fatāwa [3/412 and 27/490]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Kathīr said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I say, that which is correct is that the head of </em><em>Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Anhu was not taken to Sh</em><em>ā</em><em>m.”</em> [al-Bidāyah Wan Nihāyah [8/165]</span></p>
