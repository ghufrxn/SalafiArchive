				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated by</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All forms of worship, whether they be prayers, obligatory or optional; fasts, obligatory or optional, giving charity, umrah and hajj and every type of worship will only be accepted up until your Aqeedah (belief) is sound and correct. If your belief is incorrect you will not benefit from any of these actions no matter how long you have been practising them for. If someone believes in shirk and at the same time believes Allaah is the creator, the owner and sustainer of the universe but yet due to his shirk he still worships others besides Allaah, then all of his actions will not be accepted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If someone asks holy saints for help, seeks intercession through the dead, asks the Prophets and Angels for help and seeks assistance from them, supplicates to them and other holy people, pleas to them, asks such entities to remove his or her calamity, going to graves and asking them for help, or goes to a darbar, shrine or tomb and makes dua to them then all of this is committing shirk with Allaah and the greatest crime and sin anyone could ever commit. All of these actions will nullify all of your good deeds no matter how long you have been doing them for and you will have no benefit of any of your actions from your prayers, fasting, Salah, hajj, umrah, dua, Dhikr, sadaqah, sacrifices, nothing will be left of any of your actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These actions will only be accepted and will benefit you when your Aqeedah is correct. The basis of Aqeedah revolves around 2 aspects the first being to believe in Allaah and declaring that He alone is worthy to be worshipped, without associating any false deities with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The second aspect is the prophethood of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and the understanding of this is to make no one equal to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in his prophethood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You must remember no action will ever be accepted if your Aqeedah is incorrect and not only will you be wasting your actions of worship but you will also be wasting all that time you exerted into your worship, all the wealth spent for the sake of Allaah as well as all the good deeds ever done in your life time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imagine on the day of judgement after all your years of worship and all the effort you exerted in your Ibadah and your righteous actions, you are informed that you have nothing to show by the way of actions after a lifetime of worship, how hard done by will you feel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The example of Aqeedah is like a foundation so no matter how big or tall the structure or building is, if it’s foundation are not correct then the building will also be weak and unstable and it will eventually fall. Similarly in the same way no matter how high a structure you create pertaining to worship but if your Aqeedah is not correct then there is no benefit of the worship you have done, not in this world and nor in the hereafter. This is what Allaah the most high said after mentioning the prophets whilst addressing them,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Bit if they had associated others with Allaah, then worthless for them would be whatever they were doing.” (Soorah al-An’aam 6:88)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Allaah is saying that even if the prophets like Ibraaheem the friend of Allaah, Ismaa’eel the one sacrificed for Allaah, Moosaa the one who spoke to Allaah or Eesaa the spirit of Allaah committed shirk then even all of their actions would be wasted and end in vain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the same way Allaah addressed Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and said to him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allah , your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers.” (Soorah az-Zumar 39:65)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So here Allaah is warning Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) that even if he committed shirk his actions would be wasted. So after Allaah warned all the prophets including Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam), then what status do we have. This shows the seriousness of this reprimand and highlights no matter who the person is, a prophet, a holy soofee saint, a Walee or an Imaam anyone who commits shirk will have all of his actions and worship all wasted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When we talk about certain people being engrossed in aspects of shirk like seeking help from people in the graves, using the deceased as intermediateries or sacrificing food in the name of other than Allaah like Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee or Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and the general people say about them, “even though they do these things they still pray and fast.” Then we say there is no benefit of them praying or fasting as the one who commits shirk will have all of his actions and the reward wiped away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The polytheists of Makkah and Abu Jahl used to fast, pray and perform pilgrimage of the house of Allaah, they would give charity. They lived around the Ka’abah and were even custodians and guardians of the Ka’abah but Allaah said none of their actions will benefit them due to shirk and their abode will be the hellfire. Allaah the most high said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination.” (Soorah at-Taubah 9:73)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So for any action to be accepted Allaah alone is to be worshipped without associating partners with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The second aspect in having good and sound Aqeedah is to know that no statement in opposition to the word of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) can be accepted under any circumstance. We believe if all of the statements of mankind were collected and collated and put to one side and on the other side was the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) then without doubt all of the statements of mankind will be rejected and the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will be taken above and beyond anyones statement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Everyone claims to be upon this and maybe they are but only in terms of it’s wording, however with regards to understanding and acting upon it, it’s a different story. People who have not fully understood this point have made their own little groups, sects and parties and this is what they follow. When the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) comes to them they say, “but our Imaam said this or our peer (holy saint) said this and our Maulana said something different, how can they be wrong? Are you saying they never had knowledge? Etc” However the people of Hadeeth and Ahlus Sunnah say when the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) statements comes to us we reject and abandon everything else and just follow and obey his words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reality is all the Prophets and Messengers Allaah sent to mankind from amongst the different nations all informed their respective nations to abandon the worship of everything and worship one Allaah alone without any partners. However the people would say we do not deny what you say but we never found our forefathers doing this and so were they wrong in what they taught us? So are you truthful and our forefathers liars. Allaah the most high said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And when it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger,” they say, “Sufficient for us is that upon which we found our fathers.” Even though their fathers knew nothing, nor were they guided?” (Soorah al-Ma’idah 5:104)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Today in our time the greatest excuse and the major obstacle is exactly this excuse with regards to the destruction and misguidance of this great Ummah. How does shaytaan misguide man! So they say the Hadeeth is wrong or incorrect but our Imaams and Moulvees/Maulanas/Sidis/Peer/Shaikh are correct in what they say and they can’t make mistakes, they are so learned and they studied with so and so and they have this many ijazahs (permission to narrate). So they all claim to love and follow the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) but in actions and understanding they really don’t.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This also shows how these people think, so they say Allaah is one and we don’t associate partners with him ie we don’t do shirk with him but yet at the same time they say, but these holy saints must have some status so they make them intermediaries. In the same way they have made people equal to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in his status and acknowledge with their actions and understanding that others can be equal to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in terms of his status and statements.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The correct understanding is as mentioned before all the statements of mankind on one side and the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) on one side, all the statement of mankind can be rejected but the statement of the son of Aminah, Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) cannot be rejected. The Quraan mentions the methodology of the people upon the truth and that is the Messenger of Allaah cannot ever make a mistake. Oh people rectify your beliefs and know you cannot take anyone&#8217;s word over the word of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong style="color: #000080;line-height: 1.5">Abu at-Tufail: One hadith</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[108] From Malik from Abu az-Zubair (Muhamad Ibn Muslim Ibn Tadrus) al-Makki from Abu at-Tufail Amir Ibn Wathila that Mu&#8217;adh Ibn Jabal (Radi Allahu Anhu) reported that he went along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) in the year of the expedition of Tabuk (for Jihad) and the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) combined the noon (Dhuhr) and afternoon (Asr) prayers together and the sunset (Magrib) and night (Esha) prayers together. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Then he (Mu&#8217;adh Ibn Jabal (Radi Allahu Anhu)) said, on the other day he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) deferred the prayers; he then came out (of his tent) and offered the noon (Dhuhr) and afternoon (Asr) prayers together. He then went in (the tent) and (later on) came out and then after that offered the sunset (Magrib) and night (Esha) prayers together and then he (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said &#8220;Allah willing, you will reach the fountain of  Tabuk by tomorrow and you will not be able to come to that until it is dawn, and he who happens to reach there should not touch its water until I come.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Mu&#8217;adh Ibn Jabal (Radi Allahu Anhu) then said, &#8220;We came to that and two persons (amongst) us reached that fountain before us and it was a thin flow of water like the shoelace. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) asked them both, &#8220;Have any of you touched the water from this fountain?&#8221; They said: Yes. So Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) scolded them, and he said to them what Allah wanted him to say. The people then took water of the fountain in their palms until it became somewhat significant and filled it into some container. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) washed his hands and his face too in it, and then, took that water and put it in that (fountain) and there gushed forth abundant water from that fountain, until all the people drank to their fill. He (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) then said, &#8220;O Mu&#8217;adh, it is hoped that if you live long you would see its water irrigating  the gardens in this area well.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [MUSLIM]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (1/143, 144 hadith no.326, book 9, chapter 1, hadith no.2), at-Tamhid (12/193, 194) and he said,&#8221;this hadith is established as being <em>[Sahih]</em> authentic.&#8221; and al-Istidhkar (no.296) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Muslim (10/706 after hadith no.2281) from the hadith of Malik and Abu az-Zubair clarified hearing this hadith from Abu at-Tufail Amir Ibn Wathila in Musnad Ahmad (5/229) and Ibn Khuzaima (no.966) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) It is allowed to combine the prayers whilst travelling as follows, Dhuhr and Asr (two rak&#8217;ah + two rak&#8217;ah) and Magrib and Esha (three rak&#8217;ah and two rak&#8217;ah). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) The Khalifa can participate in the battle with his soldiers and army against the disbelievers.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) The battle of Tabuk was against the Christians of Sham who wanted to attack the Muslims. Some people of knowledge have said that this occurred in the month of Rajab in the ninth year of Hijra. See at-Tamhid (12/196)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) From this hadith it is known that the traveler can combine prayers whilst he is lodging during his journey. See at-Tamhid (12/196)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) The meaning of combining early is to pray Asr at the time of Dhuhr time and to pray Esha at the time of Magrib. The meaning of combining late is to pray the Dhuhr at the time of Asr and to pray the Magrib at the time of Esha. The meaning of combining formally is to pray the Dhuhr at the end time of Dhuhr and to pray the Asr at the beginning time of Asr and combine this. Likewise to pray the Magrib at the end time of Magrib and to pray the Esha at the beginning time of Esha. These are the three types of combinations which are allowed for combining prayers. Accepting only one of these types and rejecting the other two is incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) This hadith mentions a great miracle of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). The miracle was that Allah made an active fountain of water occur due to the blessed wudhu water of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Centuries later Muhamad Ibn Wadah saw this fountain. See at-Tamhid (12/208 and its chain is <em>[Sahih]</em> authentic) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) used to inform about the unseen matters through the revelation of Allah. Ibn Abdul Bar said, &#8220;And in this is that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) used to inform about the unseen things (through revelation) which would occur after him and this is not strange and neither was this an unknown due to his status.  May Allah elevate his (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) remembrance. &#8221; at-Tamhid (12/208) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Remember that the One who knows the unseen is a specific attribute of Allah alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) It is never allowed to go against the guidance and command of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">9) Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri asked Salim Ibn Abdullah Ibn Umar, Can you join Dhuhr and Asr when travelling?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, there is no harm in that. Haven&#8217;t you seen the people (combine and) pray on Arafah?&#8221; (Muwatta Imam Malik 1/145 hadith no.330 and its chain is <em>[Sahih]</em> authentic) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">10) Also see hadith no.109 and no.199</span></p>
