<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Publishers foreword</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Biography was originally compiled by Shaikh Abdul Jabbars grandson, the great Allamah and Hadith Master from the sub continent, Shaikh Abdul Ghaffr Hasan Rehmani [1428H]. We first translated it in 1997ce and it remained dormant, until now with the aid of Allah it is being presented to the readers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The original biography appeared in the compilation of articles and treaties in defence of the authenticity and authority of hadith, it was indeed awe-inspiring. Reliasing the tremendous benefit of the treatise (approximately 350 pages) we began translating it and insha’Allah in due course snippets will be uploaded to the website.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As mentioned Allamah Abdul Ghafar Hasan Rehmani was the main contributor to the aforementioned book titled, <em>‘Azmat Hadith’</em> Edn. 1st, 1409H/1989 ed. Shaikh Abdul Ghafar Hasan Rehmani, Dar ul-Ilm, Islamabad, Pakistan). This has been recently reprinted in 1436H. Shaikh Abdul Ghafar Hasan Rehmani compiled a brief biography of Shaikh Abdul Jabbar Amrpuri and from reading it it seems evident it was written from memory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 2010ce, Shaikh Abdul Ghafar Hasan Rehmani’s two sons, Shaikh Suhaib Hasan and Shaikh Suhail Hasan published a detailed biography of their father, the Allamah. In this Biography they also included the same biography of Shaikh Abdul Jabbar from Azmat Hadith with some additions and further clarifications.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Utilising the above as well the 1<sup>st</sup> Edition of Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hind 1938ce and Nuzahatul Khawatir of Mawlana Abdul Hay al-Hasani as well as other notes from 1997ce we have collated what follows of the Allamahs biography. Without having full access to some other notes we initially made that are now in storage, we decided it was time to share this biography and in due course any updates will be added later. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an E-Book publication, it can be downloaded in PDF format or alternatively read online.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>al-Allamah ash-Shaikh </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abdul Jabbar Amrpuri</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[1277H -1344H]</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is ash-Shaikh al-Fazil Abdul Jabbar Amrpuri, the Muhadith Kabir. His lineage is Abdul Jabbar bin ash-Shaikh Munshi Badr ud din bin Muhammad Afzal bin Abdullah bin Muhammad Akram. He was born in Jamada ul-Akhira in the year 1277H in Amrpur, a town near Muzafarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, India. (See also Nuzatul Khawatir (8/217 no.203, of Mawlana Abdul Hay al-Hasani, Edn. 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1402H / 1981ce, Da’iratul Ma’arif al-Uthmaniyyah, Hyderabad, India)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had taqwa and was from amongst the well known Scholars. He was extremely intelligent and versatile in his knowledge. He was brave and bold and succinctly to the point. During the end of his life his eyesight became weak but yet he continued to teach and propagate the Quran and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a prolific orator and his speeches would captivate the audiences as well as being very effective. He reached 57 years of age when he died. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hind (1/165-166)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Teachers</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Qari Abdul A’la </strong>of Amritsar as well as other Scholars of Amritsar</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Ghulam Ali Qasuri</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Ibrahim Pani Pati</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Jabbar Amrpuri studied books of Nahw, Sarf, Balagha and some treatise on Mantaq with the latter three.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Mazhar Nanautvi</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He studied Fiqh, Usul al-Fiqh and some books of Hadith with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Ahmad Ali Saharanpuri</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He studied Fiqh, Usul al-Fiqh and again some books of hadith with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Faidh al-Hasan Saharanpuri</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He studied, Arabic and the knowledge of Balagha</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Ahmad Hasan (or Hasan Ahmad)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He studied Philosophy and Mantaq with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhadith Dehlavi</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He studied for a very long time with Shaikh Nazir Hussain Dehlavi, he studied the books of Tafsir and Hadith for example Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai and Ibn Majah. He also obtained ijazah for hadith from him in the year 1297H. (Refer to Azmat Hadith (pg.10), Edn. 1st, 1409H/1989 ed. Shaikh Abdul Ghafar Hasan Rehmani, Dar ul-Ilm, Islamabad, Pakistan), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hind (1/166), Edn. 1<sup>st</sup>, 1938 Delhi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Allamah and Muhaqiq, the orator Abdul Aziz Memoni</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great Alim and Muhadith, Shaikh Abdul Jabbar Khandiyalvi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His son and al-Allamah Hafidh Abdus Sattar Hasan Amrpuri</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Efforts in Dawah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He established a teaching institute called Madrassah Dar al-Huda in Delhi where he taught for a short while. He would have lessons on explanation of the Quran every day after Fajr and he would also read the translation of the Quran to the worshippers without fail.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He established a monthly journal called Dhiya as-Sunnah, which at its height was considered to be from amongst the most respectable and knowledge based journals. It was a journal that was at the forefront and led the defence of the Sunnah, propagating and making the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah widespread and readily available. It reprehended and refuted the misguidance of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani and the absurdities of Abdullah Chakrawali.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Primarily it refuted the ideas and dangerous thoughts of Moulvi Abdullah Chakralawi and his thoughts were that the Quran contains everything from the Principles of Islam down to the basic details hence there is no need for the Sunnah. Shaikh Abdul Jabbar refuted and rebuked this false and erroneous notion over a series of articles in this journal. These articles were well liked, received and appreciated amongst the religious communities across the sub-continent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the title page of the Journal it says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>1) This journal is being published to rectify the affairs of the nation and expressing the truth with actions and it will be published on the first date of every Arabic month, InshaAllah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>2) It will contain and will be based upon the benefits of virtues of Tawhid and the Sunnah, (reprimanding) the evil effects of Shirk and Innovations, answering the opponents of Islam, authentic biography of Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallm) and the biographies of the Rightly Guided Khulafa of Islam, legal edicts to questions, research on issues of the din as well news from around the Islamic world. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The back of the journal would usually publish information and news from around the Islamic world. Once the journal published information about one of the first british reverts ie Abdullah William Quillam who was a journalist and barrister from Liverpool which could not be found in any English sources.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The journal continued to be published for approximately 3 years. It lasted for approximately 13 months from Dhul Qa’dah 1319H / February 1902 until Dhul Hujjah 1320H / March 1903. It then restarted in Muharram 1323H / March 1905 until 1324H / 1906, when it eventually stopped. Shaikh Abdul Jabbar’s brother, Shaikh Dhiya ur-Rehman was in charge of the affairs of the journal from collating it, organising it as well as printing it from Kolkata.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The journal would publish articles and pieces on a wide range of subjects and sciences from illustrious authors and major Scholars. Such topics would include, The Islamic Khilafah, Issues of Children and Birth, The Sending of the Messenger of Allah (SalAllahu alayhi Wasallam), poetry, well known poets of the Arabic language, refutation of the Qadiyanis, Prophethood and Khilafah, opinions and decisions on issues, Language, the infallibility of the Prophet, the Prophets miracles, the virtues of the Arabic Language and its superiority, Days of sacrifice, Fatawa, the unlawfulness of mu’ta and tasawuf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The following illustrious scholars and people of knowledge contributed articles</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Imam of the era Shaikh Abdur Rahman Mubarakpuri the author of Tuhfatul Ahwadhi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The major Scholar, Abdus Salam Mubarakpuri, the author of Siratul Bukhari.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ubaid ur-Rehman Amrpuri, the editor of the monthly journal Riyadh at-Tawhid</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hafidh Abu Yahya Muhammad Shah Jahanpuri</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Nu’man A’zamghari</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Dhiya ur-Rehman Amrpuri Shaikh Abdul Jabbar’s brother</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Jabbar Amrpuri also established another monthly journal thereafter. Shaikh Suhail Hasan (The great grandson of Shaikh Abdul Jabbar Amrpuri) adds that Shaikh Abdul Jabbar also published a monthly journal on the 15<sup>th</sup> May 1893 corresponding to 28<sup>th</sup> Shawwal 1310H from Jabalpur which is in Madhya Pradesh, India.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was called Tabligh and it was initially published on a monthly basis and then in January 1894 /Jumada ath-Thani 1311H it became a weekly Journal. Its chief was Haji Abdul Ghafur and Shaikh Abdul Jabbar Amrpuri was its editor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is not known how long the journal continued for. (Cited from Tarikh Sahafat Urdu (3/587) of Imdad Sabiri from Mawlana Abdul Ghafar Hasan, Hayat Wa Khidmat (pg.20) Compiled, Suhaib and Suhail Hasan, Edn. 1<sup>st</sup>, 2010, Maktabah Islamiyyah, Lahore, Pakistan)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Writings and Works</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He published numerous articles in the aforementioned journal (some of which have been translated and are due to be published on <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com">www.salafiri.com</a> &#8211; InshaAllah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His books include</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>1) Samsam at-Tawhid Fi Radd at-Taqlid.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treatise a refutation of Taqlid and is 32 pages.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2) Irshad as-Sa’ilin Ila Masa’il ath-Thalathin.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a brief compilation of Fatawa which compromises answers to 30 issues of fiqh. It was first published in 1902 from Kolkata.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>3) Tazkir al-Ikhwan Fi Khutbah al-Jumu’ah Bi Kulli Lisan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treatise overwhelmingly proves the permissibility, in fact it obligates to recite the Jumu’ah Khutbah in Arabic and then translating into the language of the worshippers in order to advise and explain to them. It also answers the evidences of those who oppose this. It is 20 pages and was printed from Khadim as-Sunnah in Kolkata.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4) Irshad al-Anam Bi Faridah al-Jumu’ah Fi Kulli Maqam </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an answer to a Hanafi scholar, Mawlana Nizam ud din Mufti’s treatise titled ‘<em>Tanbiyyah al-Anam’</em> about the issue of the obligation of the Jumu’ah prayer and the obligation of reciting Fatihah behind the Imam. It is 30 pages and was printed in Lahore by Matba’a Siddiqi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Ghafar Hasan Rehmani titled the book as <em>‘Irshad al-Anam Fi Faridah al-Fatihah Khalf al-Imam.’</em> In his short biography of his grandfather Shaikh Abdul Jabbar Amrpuri.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>5) Tabsarah al-Anam Bi Rad Mughlatat Siyanatul Anam</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The latter, Maulana Nizam ud din answered <em>‘Irshad al-Anam’ </em>of Shaikh Abdul Jabbar and titled it <em>‘Siyantul Anam.’</em> This treatise ie <em>‘Tabsarah al-Anam…’</em> is an answer to the aforementioned book. It is 112 pages and was printed in Banaras in the year 1318H by Sa’id al-Matab’a, the printing press of Shaikh Abul Qasim Saif Banarasi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Ghafar Hasan Rehmani titled this book as <em>‘Tabsarah al-Anam Fi Faridah al-Jumu’ah Fi Kulli Maqam.’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is possible Shaikh Abdul Ghafar Rehmani titled the books based on the main content of the book or he might have mentioned them from memory and hence the slight variation. Thirdly the scribe of the book may have made a mistake in the titled due to them being very similar. We believe this is evident from his abbreviation of the first book, he mentions it just as <em>‘Samsam at-Tawhid’</em> and not the full title.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also worthy to note here, Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshaharwi also attributes these two books to Shaikh Abdul Jabbar as, <em>‘Irshad al-Anam Fi Faridah al-Fatihah Khalf al-Imam.’ </em>And<em> ‘Tabsarah al-Anam Fi Faridah al-Jumu’ah Fi Kulli Maqam.’ </em>(Refer to his Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hind (1/166), Edn. 1<sup>st</sup>, 1938 Delhi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>6) Nasihatul Ikhwan Fi Hijab an-Niswan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A (modern day) revivalist of Lahore Sayyid Mumtaz Ali Lahori authored a book titled, <em>‘Huquq an-Niswah’</em> on the issue of the Hijab in which he went beyond bounds. Shaikh Abdul Jabbar refuted his ideas in this book <em>‘Nasihatul Ikhwan.’</em> It is 32 pages and was printed by Rauzbazar from Amritsar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>7) al-Barahin al-Qat’iah Fi Rad al-Anwar as-Sati’ah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a refutation of the Barelvi Sufi Abdus Sami on the issue of the innovation of Milad. The book is 32 pages and was published in 1323H / 1905, by Matba’a Iftikhar, Delhi. Shaikh Suhaib Hasan added beneficial notes, translated the Arabic and Farisi quotes, added further references and published them in the longstanding Birmingham monthly journal, Siratal Mustaqim. It has been recently reprinted with Shaikh Suhaib Hasan’s work in 1430H / 2009 from Dar al-Khuld, Lahore and is approximately 80 pages.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have these articles that were printed in the monthly Birmingham journal Siratal Mustaqim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>8) Risalah Fi Inkar Majlis Mawlid Wal-Qiyam</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a refutation of the new innovation of Mawlid and the form it has taken. Mawlana Abdul Hay Hasani has mentioned this in Nuzahatul Khawatir (8/218 no.203)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is possible the latter two books are the same and Mawlana Abdul Hayy Hasani was referring to the al-Barahin when he mentioned book number 8 ie the Risalah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>9) Diwan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Abdul Hay Hasani has also mentioned this in Nuzahatul Khawatir (8/218 no.203). He cites some of the poetry Shaikh Abdul Jabbar Amrpuri recited at Nadwatul Ulama in 1318H (ibid)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>10) Kasauti</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a poem concerning holding on to the Kitab and Sunnah and a translation of some ayat and ahadith from the Quran and Hadith. It is 8 pages and was printed by Banjaleh, Lahore in 1292H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Abdul Hay al-Hasani says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He has some treatise on contentious issues and madhabs, some are on the reprehension of Majlis Mawlid, some are on the refutation of taqlid and some are on Arabic poetry.” (Nuzhatul Khawatir (8/218)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was also an established poet and would read poems in 3 languages, namely Arabic, Urdu and Farisi. He would also publish them in the monthly journal <em>Dhiya as-Sunnah</em>. He once recited Arabic poetry at an annual conference of Dar al-Ulum Nadwatul Ulama which were highly appreciated. Some of these poems were preserved with Shaikh Abdul Ghafar Hasan Rehmani.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;" align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;" align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Handhala</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Name</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the Al- Allamah, the Mujahid, the caller of Tawheed and Sunnah Muhammad Abdullah Ghaznawi bin Muhammad rahimahullah.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Birth</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was born in a pious family of Ghazni, Afghanistan. His father and grandfather were named Muhammad and they were known for their taqwa and righteousness in the area where they lived.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Education</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His main teacher was Shaykh Habeebullah Qandaharee who was renowned for piety and knowledge in Ghazni. Shaykh Abdullah Ghaznawi read hadith books under his tutelage. It was he who advised Shaykh Abdullah Ghaznawi to read “Taqwiyatul Eemaan” of Shah Ismaeel Shaheed Rahimullah. This book had a profound effect on him and motivated him to raise the call for tawheed and uproot shirk in his area. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Upon reading hadith books especially Saheeh Bukharee, he rejected the hanafi fiqh in issues which were against authentic ahadeeth. Then onwards he started praying in accordance with the Sunnah in that he started performing raful yadain regularly and offered prayer at its correct timings found in hadeeth books, contrary to the Hanafi timings which were a bit late.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Dawah Of Tawheed And Exile</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Most of his daroos and speeches revolved around Tawheed and the rejection of shirk, innovation and the blind following of madhabs. Hence, the majority of the people in his hometown and scholars went against him and started creating problems and hurdles in his dawah. Some people made complaints to the ruler of Kabul Dost Muhammad Khan. The prominent scholars who asked the ruler to punish him were Khan Mullah Durrani, Mullah Mashki and Mullah Nasrullah Lobani. All of them were staunch blind followers of the Hanafi madhab. Resultantly, the ameer of Kabul asked the Shaykh to leave his area.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh then left his home in Ghazni and traveled to many areas like Sawat, Hazara, Punjab, and finally reached Delhi. Upon reaching Delhi he found the Muhaddith of the era, the Imam of Dawah Tahweed and Sunnah, Shaykh-ul-Qul Allamah Syed Mian Nazeer Hussain Muhadith Dhelwee rahimullah. He read under him for some years and completed his studies and got an ijaazah of teaching hadith from him. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During his stay in Delhi, he was known for his taqwa and khushoo in prayer. Referring to him, Syed Mian Nazeer Hussain Dhelwee said, “Abdullah got the knowledge of hadith from us and he taught us how to pray.” This is because once he was praying in a mosque and suddenly a part of the ceiling collapsed, however, it didn’t disrupt his prayer and when he was asked about this his reply was that he wasn’t aware of what was happening in his surroundings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1857, he traveled to Punjab and stayed there for a few years before going back to Daira Ismaeel Khan thinking that ameer of Kabul might change his verdict. However, in a few days the ameer of Kabul sent him a letter asking him to leave the area. So he traveled to another location known as Nawa which was also under the control of the same ameer. The ameer didn’t let him stay there either so he left the area and migrated to mountains of Yagistan and started calling the local people to tawheed. The scholars of Nawa didn’t like this so they attacked the Shaykh’s house with an army . </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They burnt his home, caused injuries to the muwahideen and tried to kill the Shaykh. Nevertheless, some local people and those who accepted his call defended him. They let the Shaykh move from the area with his family. This was the most difficult period in his life. He traveled through the mountains with his family and wherever he stopped he would call the people towards tawheed. However, the blind followers always created problems for him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the mean time, the ruler of Kabul passed away and his son Sher Ali Khan became the ruler. Shaykh thought that the situation may have changed so he returned to his hometown Ghazni. The same scholars again forwarded their complaints to the new ameer. The ameer ordered the Shaykh to leave. Fortunately, a rebellion caused Sher Ali to flee from Kabul to Harat and afterwards Muhammad Afzal took control of Kabul. The scholars didn’t stop from their venomous attacks on the Shaykh and asked the new ameer to punish him. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the Shaykh and his sons got arrested by the warlord Muhammad Omar Khan. However, Omar Khan was very impressed by the manners and the upholding of Shariah by the Shaykh and his sons. So he asked the Shaykh as to why these people were against him and the Shaykh replied by saying, “How can I stop myself from calling people towards tawheed and sunnah. This impressed the warlord and he wrote a letter to the ameer of Kabul saying that, “I arrested this man and fulfilled your order. He seems to me to be a pious and upright man and detests dunya. What is your order now?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ameer asked the warlord to send the Shaykh to Kabul. So he sent him to Kabul with armed men. Mulla Mashki and Mulla Nasrullah who were primarily responsible for the exile of the Shaykh asked the ameer to punish him as his kufr was established and that there was no need to do new research. So the ameer and scholars issued a command for him to be flogged. The Shaykh and his sons were ruthlessly beaten in public and the ruler’s men would beat him by whips. They were made to sit on a donkey and sent around the streets of Kabul. The ameer then put him and his family in prison where they spent two years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In due time, Afzal Khan died and Azam Khan took over as the ameer of Kabul. He released the Shaykh but forced him to move to Peshawer. His two students accompanied him in this journey.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh stayed in Peshawer for quite some time and then moved to Amritsar where he</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> spent the rest of his life teaching ahaadith.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Death</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He died in Rabiul Awwal 1298H and was buried in Amritsar.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Sons</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He left behind twelve sons and most of them contributed significantly towards the Dawah of Ahlul Hadeeth especially his son Shaykh Dawood Ghaznawi who organized Dawah Ahlul Hadeeth in India and then Pakistan. His sons Shaykh Abdul Jabbar and Shaykh Muhammad were prominent scholars of their time.</span></p>
