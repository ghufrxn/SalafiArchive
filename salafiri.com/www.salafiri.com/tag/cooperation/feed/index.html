				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the traits of the people of innovation is that they limit and restrict their understanding of Islam to either a single individual, a city or even a region. Ahl al-Sunnah, the Salafis and the people of Hadith are free from this confined and dangerous restriction. With us, the understanding of Islam is with the great scholars of this ummah, of the past and present, whatever land they resided in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Why are the Deobandis, Barelwis, Ikhwan al-Muslimin, The followers of al-Qadiyani, Ghulam Ahmad Pervez, al-Mawdudi, Sayyid Qutb, Hasan al-Banna, Muhammad Surur, Javed Ghamidi, Hasan Turabi and all of the early deviated sects refuted and reprimanded, while their is an open door policy with those who distort and desecrate the Manhaj of Ahl al-Sunnah while feigning Atharism or claiming they are upon the way and Manhaj of Ahl al-Sunnah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us be clear and unequivocal, no Sunni or Salafi differs with cooperation with anyone so long that it is based on the Quran and Sunnah. This is further understood and applied to those issues and difficult masa&#8217;il that affect the everyday lives of the Muslims. For example in the non-Muslim lands, cooperating on issues related to the burial, post mortem, schools, education, social welfare, the Hijab, the unjust and unfair persecution of Muslims, religious profiling, discrimination at work, prayer and Wudu facilities at civic buildings, religious laws and the list is endless. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A real life example of this in the UK for example was when the fame seeking Salman Rushdie published his shambled book, where the Muslims cooperated in repelling its evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us also remind the readers, in these matters the Salafis and Ahl al-Hadith have worked effortlessly in attempting to bring ease and harmony to the lives of Muslims living in the west, however the people of innovation have always been treacherous and disloyal. For example when the UK Government, Gove and his cohorts were and are still targeting Salafi and Ahl al-Hadith orientated Schools and teaching institutes, did we see any help or cooperation by the people of innovation? Of course not!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The elder scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith in their respective countries, displayed a great level of understanding to navigate through the gauntlet of trials and obstacles placed by the people of innovation. It was this careful and thoughtful traversing based on deep insight that allowed the Da&#8217;wah of the Quran and Sunnah to flourish with Allah&#8217;s aid and assistance alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, as you will read Shaykh Ibn Baz explains (from al-ifta), the people of the Sunnah should clarify the correct creed of the salaf, the innovations and the Islamic law. What we find with the people who advocate unity and blind cooperation with the people of innovation and deviation is that they are absolutely silent, blind and deaf on the innovations and corrupt creed of the people they want to unify and cooperate with. What deception is this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Salafi scholars were and are never like this. It is this rich history of the Ahl al-Hadith which distinguishes it from the people of innovation and deviation, unlike those who are new to the pristine and established methodology of the Ahl al-Hadith, the Mutaqdimin and the Mutakharin, such that they have ignorantly convinced themselves and those around them of a new methodology and approach which not only is non-existant, but rather it opposes and contradicts a methodology that was understood, practised and propagated for almost 1400 years!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly, these matters should be understood based on the methodology of Ahl al-Sunnah, past and present, not just India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Turkey. We ask, show us this methodology of deaf and blind unity and cooperation with the people of deviation and heresy from the early Imams and the Salaf of this Ummah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abd al-Aziz bin Baz, Rahimahullah, who was the most well wishing to the Ummah was asked,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>QUESTION</strong>: </span></span><span style="color: #000000;">Is it permissible  to cooperate with the Islamic groups active in the field? To what extent is cooperation permissible? Please advise, may Allah reward you with the best!       </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong>:</span> It is permissible and even obligatory to cooperate with all Muslims in righteousness and piety as much as possible because Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221; (Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5:2) </strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;By Al-&#8216;Asr (the time). Verily, man is in loss, Except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth, and recommend one another to patience.&#8221; (Surah Al-&#8216;Asr, 103)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is cooperating in righteousness and piety and enjoining one another to adhere to the truth and showing patience to clarify the rulings of Shari&#8217;ah (Law) and warn against Bid&#8217;ah (innovations in Islam) and to make clear the sound creed followed by the Salaf (righteous predecessors of the Ummah (nation based on one creed), the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and those who followed them in righteousness. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Cooperation and recommendation is to enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and to abandon those worthy to be abandoned because Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The believers, men and women, are Awliya&#8217; of one another; they enjoin  Al-Ma&#8217;ruf , and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar ; they perform as-Salah, and give the Zakat, and obey Allaah and His Messenger. Allah will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.&#8221; (Surah At-Tawbah, 9:71) </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dawud (David) and &#8216;Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). That was because they disobeyed (Allaah and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds. They used not to forbid one another from Al-Munkar (wrong, evil-doing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which they committed. Vile indeed was what they used to do.&#8221; (Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 78) </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The similitude of believers in regard to mutual love, affection, fellow-feeling is that of one body; when any limb of it aches, the whole body aches, because of sleeplessness and fever. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) also said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Islam is based on advising one another. Upon this we said: For whom? He replied: For Allah, His Book, His Messenger and for the leaders and the general Muslims. (Related by Muslim in his book of Sahih (authentic) Hadith). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are many Ayahs and Hadiths to the same effect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Imam Ibn Baz, al-Fatawa, 28:248.</em></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ahl al-Hadith have always displayed a clear and pristine methodology, a methodology they acted upon, taught and passed down to their students. Let the reader not be confused with the two or three liner snippets which show a distorted representation of the methodology of our scholars. Such presentations show the deep understanding and the great insight our scholars possessed, which should not be conflated with a negligent and lenient approach to methodology. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholars of Ahl al-Hadith were fervent and unreserved when it came to matters of the Sunnah. Using oblique examples of the co-operation of the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafi Scholars with the people of innovation, based on national interests of the Muslims in a particular country or region is indeed the most negligent of examples to prove points of practise and methodology.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Someone asked Shaykh Ubaydullah Rehmani Mubarakpuri (d.1414H)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>QUESTION: </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">What is the ruling on acting on something that opposes the Sunnah, making the excuse that it is for the greater good (Maslaha) and unity while the general people and the Ahl al-Hadith remain silent on the matter, also what is the ruling on participating in it (i.e. such acts of unity that oppose the Sunnah)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER: </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">Acting on something that opposes the Sunnah, i.e. acting on innovations and participating in such things (events), remaining silent despite having the power (to rectify) on the basis of some worldly good or for the reason that unity remains intact between each other so that differences don&#8217;t arise, is a reprehensible thing and an evil act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Committing acts of innovation are tantamount to reckless sinning and remaining silent on such matters is compromising the Din, both of which are prohibited. It is indeed a great crime if the scholars and the general people have the ability and power to command the good and change evil but chose to remain silent. This is because commanding the good and forbidding the evil is an obligation of the Din.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, while giving daw&#8217;ah it is obligatory to act on:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">ادْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ وَجَادِلْهُم بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Invite (people) to the Way of your Rabb with wisdom and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better…”</strong> (Surah al-Nahl, 16:125)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">عَنْ جَرِيرٍ، قَالَ سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَقُولُ ‏مَا مِنْ رَجُلٍ يَكُونُ فِي قَوْمٍ يُعْمَلُ فِيهِمْ بِالْمَعَاصِي يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَى أَنْ يُغَيِّرُوا عَلَيْهِ فَلاَ يُغَيِّرُوا إِلاَّ أَصَابَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِعَذَابٍ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَمُوتُوا</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah RadhiAllahu Anhu: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If any man is among a people in whose midst he does acts of disobedience, and, though they are able to make him change (his acts), they do not change, Allah will smite them with punishment before they die. (Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah) (tr. Abu Dawud, no.4339)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, an individual should always exert effort in reviving and defending the Sunnah and extinguishing bid’ah in order to protect oneself from the punishment mentioned in this Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ‏ مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى كَانَ لَهُ مِنَ الأَجْرِ مِثْلُ أُجُورِ مَنْ تَبِعَهُ لاَ يَنْقُصُ ذَلِكَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurayrah RadiAllahu Anhu said that Allah’s Messenger said: He who called (people) to righteousness, there would be reward (assured) for him like the rewards of those who adhered to it, without their rewards being diminished in any respect. (Muslim) (tr. Muslim, no.2674)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ لِبِلاَلِ بْنِ الْحَارِثِ ‏&#8221;‏ اعْلَمْ ‏&#8221;‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ مَا أَعْلَمُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ قَالَ ‏&#8221;‏ اعْلَمْ يَا بِلاَلُ ‏&#8221;‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ مَا أَعْلَمُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ قَالَ ‏&#8221;‏ أَنَّهُ مَنْ أَحْيَا سُنَّةً مِنْ سُنَّتِي قَدْ أُمِيتَتْ بَعْدِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مِنَ الأَجْرِ مِثْلَ مَنْ عَمِلَ بِهَا مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (ﷺ) said to Bilal bin Al-Harith: &#8220;Know.&#8221; He said: &#8220;I am ready to know O Messenger of Allah!&#8221; He (ﷺ) said: &#8220;That indeed whoever revives a Sunnah from my Sunnah which has died after me, then for him is a reward similar to whoever acts upon it without diminishing anything from their rewards…. (al-Tirmidhi) (tr. Al-Tirmidhi, no.2677)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibrahim bin Maysarah said: Whoever honours an innovator then verily he has aided the destruction of Islām. (Transmitted by al-Bayhaqi in Shu’bal Iman in mursal form) (tr. al-Lalika’i, <em>Sharh Usul al-Ei</em><em>’</em><em>tiqad</em>, 1:139 no.267; al-Tabrizi, <em>Mishkat al-Masabih,</em> 1:189)</span></p>
