<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the dismal shenanigans and unprincipled debacle of the Sufi Barailwis let us return to the chains of Tahir ul-Qadiri to Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi as mentioned in PART 2, let us examine them in detail and unearth some stark, shocking and epiphany moments of the Sufi Barelwis. The chains of studentship direct to Ahmad Raza Khan were mentioned as</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Maulana Zia ud Din Madani who was a direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan Barailwi</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Maulana Syed Ahmad Abul Barkat Qadiri the son of Syed Didar Ali Qadiri, who was a direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan Barailwi</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Mawlana Abdul Ma’bud Jilani, who died at the age of 165, who was a direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>1. Mawlana Zia ud Din Madani (d.1401/1981)</strong></span></h5>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7500 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?resize=219%2C300" alt="zia-ud-din-madani" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?resize=219%2C300 219w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?resize=768%2C1053 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?resize=747%2C1024 747w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/zia-ud-din-madani.jpg?w=1106 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 219px) 100vw, 219px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a resident of Madinah and spent most of his life there, he received ijazah and Khalifa(ship) from Ahmad Raza Khan when he was in his teens, i.e. 18 years old. He also received Ijazah and Khalifaship from the Sufi Yusuf Nabahani (d.1350/1932), who is revered by both strains of the Hanafiyyah from the sub continent i.e. Deobaniyyah and of course the Barelwiyyah, both arch Sufi&#8217;s. (see <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.darultahqiq.com/qadi-yusuf-al-nabhani-d-1932-ce1350-ah-on-the-jala-al-aynayn-of-numan-al-alusi/">http://www.darultahqiq.com/qadi-yusuf-al-nabhani-d-1932-ce1350-ah-on-the-jala-al-aynayn-of-numan-al-alusi/</a>) </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">he also got ijaza and because the Khalif for the following Sufi&#8217;s (as stated by them)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wasi Ahmad Muhadith Surti, Syed Hussain Al-Hassani Al-Kurdi, Ahmad Al-Shamah Al-Malaki Al-Qadri Marakashi, Syed Abdul Rahman Seraj Makkahi, Badruddin al-Hassani Shami, Ahmad Sharif Asanousi Tarablasi, Abdul Baqi Farangi-Mahali, Ameen Qutabi, Shah Abdul Haq Muhajjar Alla Abadi, Shah Ali Hussain Ashrafi, Nour Yousaf Kachochavi, Abul Khair Meer Dad Makki, Syed Ahmad al-Hariri, Syed Sabbagi, Syed Alawi Bin Abbas Malaki (Father of Syed Muhamad Alawi Malaki Sahib)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Most of them were ardent fanatical Sufi&#8217;s and some of them are of importance, Wasi Ahmd Surti was an arch enemy of Ahl al-Sunnah in the subcontinent, Badr al-Din Hasani revered by both Deobandi&#8217;s and Barelwi&#8217;s, Syed Alawi bin Abbas, the father of the notorious Alawi Maliki who has demonstrated his extreme hatred for Tawhid and its people in his books. He has also been thoroughly refuted by the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama&#8217;ah. Dear readers we find this a web and matrix of deviation of these Deobandi and Barelwis holding the same beliefs in opposition to the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">another interesting link is the leader of these guys</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/green-hat.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7504 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/green-hat.jpg?resize=300%2C183" alt="green-hat" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/green-hat.jpg?resize=300%2C183 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/green-hat.jpg?w=502 502w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ilyas-atari.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7505 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ilyas-atari.jpg?resize=236%2C238" alt="ilyas-atari" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ilyas-atari.jpg?w=236 236w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ilyas-atari.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He has ijazah and Khalifship from the grandson of Zia ud Din Madani, Rizwan Qadiri. Yet again another intertwined link between these brothers in faith. Also we find some refutations of Ilyas Attari Qadiri on his fellow Qadiri Fraternity brother which are accessible via the internet and also Tahir ul-Qadiri&#8217;s comebacks in his usual frantic rants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;">2. <strong>Syed Ahmad Maulana Abul Barkat Qadiri (d.1398/1978)</strong></span></h5>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abul-barkat.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7506 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abul-barkat.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="abul-barkat" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abul-barkat.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abul-barkat.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abul-barkat.jpg?resize=200%2C200 200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abul-barkat.jpg?w=400 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">He was the son of Syed Didar Ali Qadiri who inturn was a direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan and took ijazah from him. Abul Barkat also attended Jamia Naeemia of Naeem ud Din Muradabadi and gained an ijazah in Dars Nizami from him. Naeem ud Din Muradabadi was also a direct student of Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi. in 1915c he travelled to Bareli and studied directly under Ahmad Raza Khan and after a year or so Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan gave him an ijazah for all of his books and islamic sciences and wrote the ijazah with his own hand. (Shahansha Baghdad p.89-91, Fadhail Mustafa p.6+)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #333300;">In this way Abul Barkat Syed Ahmad was a student of the students of Ahmad Raza Khan via 2 routes and also had direct ijazah from Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi himself, it obviously does not get any closer than that. So Tahir ul-Qadiri has again direct chain to Ahmad Raza Khan via one person. Dear readers this shows how</span> the fighting between the Barelwis despite their close ties to each other and being direct students of Ahmad Raza. You see, its very easy throwing allegations and making points of confusion all day long against the Salafi&#8217;s and the Ahl al-Hadith but the fact of the matter is the differences between the Sufi Barailwi&#8217;s is of precedent levels. Also remember the very same students of Abul Barkat are the ones refuting and issuing fatawa&#8217;s against Tahir ul-Qadiri and vice versa. This is their reality due to their Sufi Tariqahs and factionalism. The students Abul Barkat are known as Barkati&#8217;s, yet another group and tariqah to disunite and separate the Muslims.</span></p>
