				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi says in Ma&#8217;yar al-Haq, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Taqlid for the layman which is wajib is taqlid mutlaq i.e. the taqlid of a mujtahid from amongst Ahl al-Sunnah without specification&#8230;&#8221; Then he goes onto to say the second form of taqlid; Qism thani, Mubah (permissible) which is taqlid of a specific madhab.&#8221; </em>(p.75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a huge difference between this and Taqlid Shakhsi which is taqlid of a specific individual unrestrictedly whether an Imam or a mujtahid this is the first thing to be noted. Shaikh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi in his Fatwa answers for both the first and second type because taqlid Shaksi is encompassed both what which he declared wajib and mubah. this was the first indicating factor. Let us assume his retraction was for the second type and let us also assume this was and is taqlid shakhsi.  However we presented the first question from the chapter from Kitab al-Taqlid wal-Ijtihad where in Shaykh Muhaddih Mian Nazir Hussain was asked,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Question: Some scholars says taqlid is FARDH and they present the ayah Fasalau Ahl al-Zikr&#8230; and he replied this statement is incorrect also due to their understanding of the ayah. He further said, some of the scholars using this ayah to mean the Imams and proving taqlid is FARDH from this ayah is is EXTREMELY WRONG and a GROSS ERROR</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here is where it gets interesting, the very same people who promote taqlid of the mujtahid of Imam use this very ayah Fasalau Ahl al-Zikr for the layman to make taqlid of an Alim, but here Shaikh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi is categorically saying it is wrong. Furthermore, he says these scholars using the ayah Ulil Amr to mean MUJTAHIDS and saying taqlid of the mujtahidin is FARDH is totally incorrect (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So he refute both types of Qism Awwal and Qism Thani, specifically using the word mujtahid of Ahl al-Sunnah in Qism al-Awwal!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we cited the conclusion of Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain to this answer wherein he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In summary taqlid is not evidenced from any ayah of the Quran nor from any hadith and neither did any Imam permit anyone from doing taqlid of them. Numerous beneficial treatises have been authored in the censure and rebuking of taqlid and if anyone wishes to refer to the reasons of its futility in detail, then they can refer to these treatise.”</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Upon reading the words of the Shaykh he refutes taqlid and saying it is not evidenced. How can it be claimed that he said one form of taqlid was wajib. We also mentioned the language of the people of taqlid was used to explained to them as the example cited in the first Qism is in actual fact Ittiba as Shaykh Muhammad Nazir himself refutes the notion of taqlid being wajib due to it being evidenced from the ayah Fasalu Ahl al-Zikr. Then he goes onto a cite a beautiful passage from Shaikh Abd al-Aziz Dehlawi from his Tafsir Azizi refuting taqlid and their deductions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The taqlid he says is wajib,  he cites the words of Shaikh Shah Waliullah from Iqd al-Jid are essentially ittiba i.e. ittiba or the narrations, but he uses the word taqlid to define this method, which was again the common language as we know very well that asking a scholar a question or a fatwa etc is not understood or considered taqlid of the scholar, and it is therefore sometimes of utmost importance to have lateral understanding based on the overall view of the scholars of hadith. It is like Imam Juwayni defining taqlid to follow the reports from the Prophet being taqlid in his Waraqat!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh further defines this taqlid mutual which is wajib that if the ruling conforms to the Sunnah it is accepted and if it opposes it, it will be rejected, then is precisely what the Ahl al-Hadith do even in this day and age and none of the Scholars of hadith have called this taqlid? As for the Shaykh&#8217;s statement on (1:179) that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The ignorant and the one who does not know, the shariah has made it obligatory and mandatory upon him to ask and learn the issues, meaning that he should ask Ahl al-Zikr, whether the scholar is well learned, whether he is a graduate or an undergraduate because Ahl al-Zikr here is general. So when he has an issue he should ask, whether it is from one scholar or from two scholars from amongst Ahl al-Zikr, in summary he should ask the one who he is satisfied and content with. Then when he has asked one or two (scholars) he excludes himself from a problematic position which does not leave anything upon him from the shariah and there is absolute ijma on this.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is perfect where the Shaykh clearly explains a lay person can ask one or more scholars and this is contrary to taqlid Shakhsi, or Qism Mubah (for arguments sake) as this is proceeds from the recantation and then the Shaykh explains the above without saying it is the permissible or wajib form of taqlid. The Shaykh then quotes from Mussalim al-thabut and his saying a muqallid acting on the SAYING of a scholar has fulfilled his research. He goes onto explain and answer this himself. Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain avidly cites this as a proof adjacent the ardent muqallids who were engrossed in Taqlid Shakhsi and not Ittiba.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here is another point, if the recantation is not from the Qism Awwal i.e. taqlid of a mujtahid then what sense does it make for him to say on (1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Some of the scholars using this ayah to mean the imams and proving taqlid is FARDH from this ayah is is EXTREMELY WRONG and a GROSS ERROR&#8221;</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;and using this ayah to say taqlid of the Aimah Mujtahidin is FARDH is totally wrong.&#8221;</em> (1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">bearing in mind he has already recanted from the Mubah type i.e. of taqlid Shakhsi i.e. taqlid of a specific madhab, as there are Qism Awwal and Qism Thani???</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">lastly the last part of the answer the Shaykh left general i.e. taqlid as just taqlid without specifying it, if anyone attempts to specify this fatwa of the Shaykh Fatawa Naziriyyah they must do so with clear, precise words of the Shaykh and the general must be left general if unless specified and not fom before a recantation. as a reminder he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In summary taqlid is not evidenced from any ayah of the Quran nor from any hadith and neither did any Imam permit anyone from doing taqlid of them.”</em> (Fatawa Naziriyyah 1:164)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be noted we cited the view of the direct student of Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain denying any form of taqlid being wajib, quoting the view of people way later who are no where near the stature of the students of Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain is misrepresentation of the view of the Ahl al-Hadith, none of the major scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith say this form is taqlid and that it is wajib they simply call it Ittiba, they done so for centuries. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It would interesting to note what Shaykh Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi said in his other books, <em>Thabut Haq al-Haqiq, Daf&#8217;e al-Balwa </em>and<em> Falah al-Wali Ba-Ittiba al-Nabi</em> all three refuting the idea of taqlid and promoting Ittiba, inshAllah if time allows more discussions will be cited from them. There also some general words non specific in the sheikhs <em>Makatib Naziriyyah</em>, again not much direct significance to this discussion. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">more to follow inshAllah.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Abdullah Ghazipuri was born in 1260/1844 in Mau in Northern India. He studied with numerous Scholars. He was under the tutelage of the Indian Hadith Master, Shaikh Sayyid Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Delhi (1320H) who he also received Ijazah from and was considered to be from amongst his most notable students. He also gained ijazah in hadith from Shaikh Abbas bin and al-Rahman al-Yamani in 1297H, who was the direct student of Imam Shawkani. He died in 1337/1918 in Lucknow. (Nazhah al-Khawatir 8:305-307, Tarajim Ulama al-Hadith  (p.459)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question:</strong> Are mawlid gatherings permissible or impermissible?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer:</strong> It is impermissible to organise and participate in mawlid gatherings because the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam did not himself organise such mawlid gatherings during his time and neither did he instruct his Ummah to do likewise. The companions also did not organise or participate in such mawlid gatherings during his time. Furthermore, what is the legal status of such gatherings? Prophethood finished with the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and thus its legislation also finished with his prophethood, therefore how can these mawlid gatherings be permissible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hidayah mentions it is makruh i.e. prohibitively disliked to pray optional prayers other than the Sunnah prayers after Fajr and the reason cited for this is that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) despite being keen to offer prayers would not extend beyond the legislated number of rakahs (Hidayah 1:82)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hidayah further mentions that one should not pray any optional prayers before the Eid prayer at the Musallah and the reason for this despite the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) being keen to offer prayer never prayed any optional prayers before the Eid prayer. (Hidayah 1:155)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question</strong>: What do you say about the Mawlid gatherings that are organised in our times? Are they permissible or impermissible?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer:</strong> The Mawlid gatherings that are organised in our times are an innovation and it is not but except a bitter bid&#8217;ah. The gatherings that are organised are newly invented matters and every newly invented matter is an innovation. As for it being minor innovation then it is that such  gatherings did not exist during the Prophets Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallams time, nor during the times of the companions, the successors or during the time of the Imams of Ijtihad, May Allah be pleased with them all.  Likewise and similarly such Mawlid gatherings are a hub and a concoction of evil and open corruption and its permissibility cannot be deduced from the Book of Allah nor from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam nor from Ijma or correct Qiyas and therefore it (these Mawlid gatherings) are are newly invented matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for it being a major innovation then the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <em>&#8220;Beware of newly invented matters for verily every newly invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;</em> (Abu Dawud no.4607, Tirmidhi no.2676, Ibn Majah no.46, Ahmad 4:126,Mishkat 1:36)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said, <em>&#8220;The worst of the affairs are the newly invented matters and every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;</em> (Muslim no.867)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith have authored numerous works and treatises on the Mawlid gatherings and in warning and censuring against it. The avid reader who wishes to read amore about this issue may refer to them and Allah knows best.&#8221;</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Ma’ayar ul-Haq Fi Tanqid Tanwir ul-Haq</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh al-Kul al-Allamah Nazir Hussain Muhadith Dehlawi (1320H)</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Muqallid Excuse Of Not Being Able To Act On The Quran and Hadith</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence it is proven a scholar upon the way of Hadith (non muqallid) whilst making knowledge based deductions should not make Taqlid of a Mujtahid in the texts of an issue, even though the mujtahids statement is in accordance with the Hadith. Yet the people who prohibit us from acting upon ahadith and even though clear manifest truth does not concur with them, one of the lame excuses they put forth in their defence is that acting upon ahadith in current times is extremely difficult.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They say the Quran and Hadith is an ocean of knowledge without any shores and hence understanding and acting on them is the duty of a Mujtahid only (ie not the common people). They say it is not in their permit to understand the Quran and Hadith and even if they were to read and understand the literal translation, they would not know whether a particular Hadith was abrogated or not, what the actual meaning of a text is or if there were any conflicting ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we say we answer this excuse from two angles</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first angle is that the Quran and Hadith is not as difficult, such that no one other than a Mujtahid mutlaq can understand them. On the contrary it is indeed very easy and whoever knows arabic especially and particular the scholars, who will easily and compressively understand the intent and meaning of the Quran and Hadith as is the saying of Allah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And We have certainly made the Quran easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?” (Soorah al-Qamar:17)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His ayaat and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom – although they were before in clear error.” (Soorah al-Jumu’ah:2)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient.” (Soorah al-Baqarah:99)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So whoever says we do not understand the Quran and Hadith despite being a scholar will fall under the punishment mentioned in the aforementioned ayah just as Mawlana Muhammad Ismail Shahid (InshaAllah) has mentioned in the treatise ‘Taqwiyat ul-Iman’</span></p>
