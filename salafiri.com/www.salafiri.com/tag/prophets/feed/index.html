				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated by</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All forms of worship, whether they be prayers, obligatory or optional; fasts, obligatory or optional, giving charity, umrah and hajj and every type of worship will only be accepted up until your Aqeedah (belief) is sound and correct. If your belief is incorrect you will not benefit from any of these actions no matter how long you have been practising them for. If someone believes in shirk and at the same time believes Allaah is the creator, the owner and sustainer of the universe but yet due to his shirk he still worships others besides Allaah, then all of his actions will not be accepted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If someone asks holy saints for help, seeks intercession through the dead, asks the Prophets and Angels for help and seeks assistance from them, supplicates to them and other holy people, pleas to them, asks such entities to remove his or her calamity, going to graves and asking them for help, or goes to a darbar, shrine or tomb and makes dua to them then all of this is committing shirk with Allaah and the greatest crime and sin anyone could ever commit. All of these actions will nullify all of your good deeds no matter how long you have been doing them for and you will have no benefit of any of your actions from your prayers, fasting, Salah, hajj, umrah, dua, Dhikr, sadaqah, sacrifices, nothing will be left of any of your actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These actions will only be accepted and will benefit you when your Aqeedah is correct. The basis of Aqeedah revolves around 2 aspects the first being to believe in Allaah and declaring that He alone is worthy to be worshipped, without associating any false deities with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The second aspect is the prophethood of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and the understanding of this is to make no one equal to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in his prophethood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You must remember no action will ever be accepted if your Aqeedah is incorrect and not only will you be wasting your actions of worship but you will also be wasting all that time you exerted into your worship, all the wealth spent for the sake of Allaah as well as all the good deeds ever done in your life time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imagine on the day of judgement after all your years of worship and all the effort you exerted in your Ibadah and your righteous actions, you are informed that you have nothing to show by the way of actions after a lifetime of worship, how hard done by will you feel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The example of Aqeedah is like a foundation so no matter how big or tall the structure or building is, if it’s foundation are not correct then the building will also be weak and unstable and it will eventually fall. Similarly in the same way no matter how high a structure you create pertaining to worship but if your Aqeedah is not correct then there is no benefit of the worship you have done, not in this world and nor in the hereafter. This is what Allaah the most high said after mentioning the prophets whilst addressing them,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Bit if they had associated others with Allaah, then worthless for them would be whatever they were doing.” (Soorah al-An’aam 6:88)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Allaah is saying that even if the prophets like Ibraaheem the friend of Allaah, Ismaa’eel the one sacrificed for Allaah, Moosaa the one who spoke to Allaah or Eesaa the spirit of Allaah committed shirk then even all of their actions would be wasted and end in vain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the same way Allaah addressed Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and said to him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allah , your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers.” (Soorah az-Zumar 39:65)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So here Allaah is warning Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) that even if he committed shirk his actions would be wasted. So after Allaah warned all the prophets including Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam), then what status do we have. This shows the seriousness of this reprimand and highlights no matter who the person is, a prophet, a holy soofee saint, a Walee or an Imaam anyone who commits shirk will have all of his actions and worship all wasted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When we talk about certain people being engrossed in aspects of shirk like seeking help from people in the graves, using the deceased as intermediateries or sacrificing food in the name of other than Allaah like Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee or Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and the general people say about them, “even though they do these things they still pray and fast.” Then we say there is no benefit of them praying or fasting as the one who commits shirk will have all of his actions and the reward wiped away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The polytheists of Makkah and Abu Jahl used to fast, pray and perform pilgrimage of the house of Allaah, they would give charity. They lived around the Ka’abah and were even custodians and guardians of the Ka’abah but Allaah said none of their actions will benefit them due to shirk and their abode will be the hellfire. Allaah the most high said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination.” (Soorah at-Taubah 9:73)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So for any action to be accepted Allaah alone is to be worshipped without associating partners with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The second aspect in having good and sound Aqeedah is to know that no statement in opposition to the word of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) can be accepted under any circumstance. We believe if all of the statements of mankind were collected and collated and put to one side and on the other side was the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) then without doubt all of the statements of mankind will be rejected and the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will be taken above and beyond anyones statement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Everyone claims to be upon this and maybe they are but only in terms of it’s wording, however with regards to understanding and acting upon it, it’s a different story. People who have not fully understood this point have made their own little groups, sects and parties and this is what they follow. When the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) comes to them they say, “but our Imaam said this or our peer (holy saint) said this and our Maulana said something different, how can they be wrong? Are you saying they never had knowledge? Etc” However the people of Hadeeth and Ahlus Sunnah say when the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) statements comes to us we reject and abandon everything else and just follow and obey his words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reality is all the Prophets and Messengers Allaah sent to mankind from amongst the different nations all informed their respective nations to abandon the worship of everything and worship one Allaah alone without any partners. However the people would say we do not deny what you say but we never found our forefathers doing this and so were they wrong in what they taught us? So are you truthful and our forefathers liars. Allaah the most high said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And when it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger,” they say, “Sufficient for us is that upon which we found our fathers.” Even though their fathers knew nothing, nor were they guided?” (Soorah al-Ma’idah 5:104)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Today in our time the greatest excuse and the major obstacle is exactly this excuse with regards to the destruction and misguidance of this great Ummah. How does shaytaan misguide man! So they say the Hadeeth is wrong or incorrect but our Imaams and Moulvees/Maulanas/Sidis/Peer/Shaikh are correct in what they say and they can’t make mistakes, they are so learned and they studied with so and so and they have this many ijazahs (permission to narrate). So they all claim to love and follow the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) but in actions and understanding they really don’t.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This also shows how these people think, so they say Allaah is one and we don’t associate partners with him ie we don’t do shirk with him but yet at the same time they say, but these holy saints must have some status so they make them intermediaries. In the same way they have made people equal to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in his status and acknowledge with their actions and understanding that others can be equal to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in terms of his status and statements.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The correct understanding is as mentioned before all the statements of mankind on one side and the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) on one side, all the statement of mankind can be rejected but the statement of the son of Aminah, Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) cannot be rejected. The Quraan mentions the methodology of the people upon the truth and that is the Messenger of Allaah cannot ever make a mistake. Oh people rectify your beliefs and know you cannot take anyone&#8217;s word over the word of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).</span></p>

<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/956, 957 hadith no.1847, book 52, chapter 1, hadith no.2), at-Tamhid (1/313) al-Istidhkar (no.1783) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Abu Dawud (no.5017) from the hadith of Malik and al-Hakim authenticated it (4/390, 391) and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) There are 40 parts to Prophethood. After the death of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) only 1 part remains and that is the dream of a pious person which is to give glad tidings to that person. From this it is known that the doors to kashf and ilham have been closed until the day of judgment. Therefore now there will be no kashf or ilham to anyone from the Ummah. In one authentic narration it is mentioned that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa sallam) said, &#8220;The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, &#8220;Amongst the people preceding you there used to be &#8216;Muhaddithun&#8217; (i.e. persons who can guess things that come true later on, as if those persons have been inspired by a divine power), and if there are any such persons amongst my followers, it is `Umar bin Al-Khattab (Radi Allahu Anhu).&#8221; (Sahih Bukhari no.3469) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">From this hadith it is known that no one from this Ummah obtains obtain Ilham. Also see hadith no.121 and no.375</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) It can be asked to the people &#8220;Did any of you have a dream?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) The interpretation of dreams which the noble Messengers did are absolutely and definitely correct. The interpretation of dreams done by people from the Ummah is speculative and not definitely correct which cannot be fully trusted or relied upon. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) It is mubah to talk after the Fajr Salah before the sun rises. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) It is allowed for the teacher to educate people about a matter through questioning them himself. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) After the death of Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) the chain of Prophethood and Messengership been cut off forever therefore no more Messengers or Prophets will be born. </span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Compiled and Translated </span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(In reply to the allegation on the Ahlul Hadith that they believe the Prophets made mistakes in matters of the din.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have looked at the passage of the aforementioned book and I did not find the said passage, the author has made a slanderous accusation here. The words of the author are that all of the prophets were not free from error (in worldly affairs) and not in the din as the authored slanderously alleged.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the author cited this passage from Mawlana Abu Shakur Silmi’s <em>Kitab at-Tamhid Fil Ilm al-Aqa’id Wat Tawhid</em>. Raising further allegations is also pointless because most of the people of Sunnah hold the same belief.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu Hanifah has himself said in his book Fiqh al-Akbar, <em>“without doubt (the prophets) did make mistakes and errors.”</em> (Sharh Fiqh al-Akbar pg.69, Matba’a Hanafi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Haq Dehlawi Hanafi said, <em>“The prophets would also do ijtihad and they would sometimes make mistakes.”</em> (Sharh Futuh al-Ghayb pg.314)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and an established fact, from the time of Ādam Alayhis Salām to the time of Nūh Alayhis Salām for ten generations all the people were upon Tawḥīd, the Millah Waḥidah i.e the one nation i.e the one Dīn of Islām. Then the people became trapped in the deception of shayṭān, and slowly by slowly, they deviated from Tawḥīd and began to commit Shirk. A prophetic ḥadīth as narrated by Ayādh bin Humar Majashī that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said that Allāh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I created all of my servants upon Hunafā i.e clear and pure Dīn of Tawḥīd. Then shayṭān came to them and beguiled them, made them change their Dīn. They made ḥarām what I made ḥalāl for them and he made them equal to me in affairs for which I did not reveal any evidence for.”</em> [Reported in Muslim, Mishkāt al-Masābīḥ [2/460].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Ḥadtīh Qudsī indicates from the time of Ādam Alayhis Salām, all the people were upon Tawḥīd for a long time, until the time just before the time of Nūh Alayhis Salām. Some people became trapped in the plots of shayṭān and the people deviated from the creed of Tawḥīd and began to associate entities (ie partners) with Allāh (the most high), for which Allāh, the most high, did not legislate any proof or evidence. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Allāh, the Most High, sent his Prophets and Messengers to these people who deviated from Tawḥīd in order to rectify their affairs. When Nūh Alayhis Salām went to these mushriks, he informed them of many issues. From them one such point was:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“I do no say to you that I have treasures from Allāh nor do I have knowledge of the unseen.” [Sūrah Hūd: 31]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This clearly shows that Nūh being a great Messenger of Allāh, the most high, and His Prophet, He did not have any such share in the specific attribute of Allāh i.e knowledge of the unseen. Then, How is it possible that someone other than a Messenger can have such a share in this specific attribute of which only belongs to Allāh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nonetheless, it is a reality that from the beliefs of the mushrikīn is that they believed other than Allāh also had knowledge of the unseen, from this attribute of Allāh. Nūh very clearly advised such people who deviated from Tawḥīd that he did not have knowledge of the unseen and that no Messenger or Prophet was equal to Allāh in this attribute.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When our Prophet Muḥammed ﷺ the final messenger, prophecised that his Ummah will follow in the footsteps of the previous nations, in their misguidance and deviation, then at the same instance, He ﷺ also very clearly informed us that people from his Ummah will also worship idols and commit shirk and kufr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence, Thawbān (RaḍiAllāhu Anhu) narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The hour (of Judgement) will not be established up until tribes (groups of people) from my Ummah do not join the mushrikīn to the extent that tribes from my Ummah will worship idols”</em> [Narrated Abū Dawūd, Tirmidhī, Mishkāt [2/465]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ḥurairah (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) narrated the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“At the time of Jahilīyyah, people from my Ummah will also worship idols before the Day of Judgement”</em> [Agreed Upon, Mishkāt [2/481]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similar such reports have been transmitted from ʿĀishah (RaḍiAllāhu Anha) and other companions via numerous chains. Ziyād bin Lūbaid (RaḍiAllāhu Anhu) narrated that</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Messenger of Allāh </em>ﷺ<em> while mentioning that something of fear will occur, He said it will happen when knowledge will be taken away. So, Ziyād Bin Lūbaid (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) asked How will knowledge be taken away when we read the Qurān and teach our children and so on, and this will remain until the Day of Judgement? He </em>ﷺ<em> replied “I thought of you as a person with most understanding in the city of Madīnah, However, you did not understand my point. You see the Jews and Christians reading the Torah and the Injīl but they do not act upon them, and thus the same thing will happen to my Ummah” </em>[Aḥmad, Ibn Majāh, Ḥākim in mursal form, Tirmidhī from Abū Dawūd, Dārimī from Abu Umamāh, Mirʿāh al-Mafātih Sharḥ Mishkāt al-Masābih 1/362]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Taken from Tashih al-ʿAqā’id)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">JazakāAllāhu Khair to Abū Maryam for his help.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaah, the Lord of all that exists sent prophets and messengers to every nation and every Prophet and Messenger called to the most fundamental and central belief of all religions which is to worship Allaah alone without associating any partners with Him. <span id="more-720"></span> This was the first call of every prophet, to spread the message of Tawheed and to censure shirk i.e. associating partners with Allaah. Allaah the Most High said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And Verily, We have sent among every ummah (nation) a messenger (saying) “Worship Allah (alone) and avoid Taghut (false deities) (Soorah an-Nahl 16:36).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And He the Most High said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And we did not send any messenger before you (O Muhammad) but we inspired him (saying) La ilaaha illa Ana (none has the right to be worshipped but I (i.e. Allah)), so worship Me (alone and none else)” (Soorah al-Anbiya 21:25)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If we look at the prophets in the Quraan we will find all of them calling to Tawheed (the oneness of Allah) and reprimanding shirk (associating false partners with Allah).</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Message of Nuh (Noah) (Alayhis-Salaam)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“We had certainly sent Noah to his people, and he said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day.” (Soorah al-A’raaf 7:59)</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And We certainly sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them a thousand years minus fifty years, and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers.” (Soorah al-Ankaboot 29:14)</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Message of Hud (Alayhis-Salaam)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And to the ‘Aad [We sent] their brother Hud. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. Then will you not fear Him?” (Soorah al-A’raaf 7:65)</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Message of Saaleh (Alayhis-Salaam)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And to the Thamud [We sent] their brother Salih. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord. This is the she-camel of Allah [sent] to you as a sign. So leave her to eat within Allah’s land and do not touch her with harm, lest there seize you a painful punishment.” (Soorah al-A’raaf 7:73)</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Message of Shu’ayb (Alayhis-Salaam)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And to [the people of] Madyan [We sent] their brother Shu’ayb. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord. So fulfil the measure and weight and do not deprive people of their due and cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation. That is better for you, if you should be believers.” (Soorah al-A’raaf 7:85)</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Message of Ibrahim (Abraham) (Alayhis-Salaam)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>And [We sent] Abraham, when he said to his people, “Worship Allah and fear Him. That is best for you, if you should know.” (Soorah al-Ankaboot 29:16)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And whilst censuring shirk (associating false deities with Allah) he said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“You only worship, besides Allah, idols, and you produce a falsehood. Indeed, those you worship besides Allah do not possess for you [the power of] provision. So seek from Allah provision and worship Him and be grateful to Him. To Him you will be returned.” (Soorah al-Ankaboot 29:17)</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Message of Yusuf (Joseph) (Alayhis-Salaam)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“O [my] two companions of prison, are separate lords better or Allah, the One, the Prevailing? You worship not besides Him except [mere] names you have named them, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;Legislation is not but for Allah. He has commanded that you worship not except Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.” (Soorah Yusuf 12:39-40)</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Message of Eesa (Jesus) (Alayhis-Salaam)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“They have certainly disbelieved who say, “Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary” while the Messiah has said, “O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.” Indeed, he who associates others with Allah – Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers.” (Soorah al-Ma’idah 5:72)</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Message of the Leader Of The Prophets Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam)  </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly, Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) also made the call to this great message and it resonated in the Arab peninsula. He called the people to the worship of one eternal Allah alone without any partners and informed the people that associating partners with Allah was the greatest crime and oppression they could ever commit. He used different examples and methods to explain this important belief and the Soorah’s revealed in Makkah show this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has been reported in the hadeeth by Rabee’a bin E’baad (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said, <em>“I saw the Messenger of Allah with my eyesight in the market of Dhul-Majaaz saying, “Oh people, say: there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah so that you may achieve success.” He would enter market places and the people would gather around him and I never saw a single person say anything to him (i.e. answer him back) and he (i.e. the Messenger of Allah) would not remain silent and would say “Oh people, say there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah so that you are successful.” </em>(Ahmad 3/2-3, New edition 25/404 no 16023, Ahaad wal-Mathaanee 2/208 of Ibn Abee Aasim, Mu’ajam al-Kabeer 5/61 of Tabaraanee, Haakim 1/165, Majma’a az-Zawaa’id 6/125)</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Message of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and Teaching His Nation To Start With The Same Message</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first call and message to the people is the call of the Oneness of Allah and this is the same message to the Muslims today. This great message is so important and central to the Muslims belief, it is by default the first call and message people should be informed about.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbaas <em>(RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) </em>narrates, <em>“When the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) sent Muadh Ibn Jabal (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) to Yemen he said to him “You are going to the people of the book, so let the first thing you call them to be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah (and in another narration, that they should single Allah out with all worship)”</em> (Saheeh Bukhaari no. 7372)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another report it says, <em>“You are going to a nation of the people of the book, when you reach them call them to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah and Muhammad is his Messenger.”</em> (Saheeh Bukhaari <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.1469</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find the call and message of all the Prophets was Tawheed and it was the first message and this shows its importance and it being crucial as a fundamental and central belief. This is shown by the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) telling his companion to tell the people of the book the importance of Tawheed and to censure shirk. After accepting the call of Tawheed many years later these nations started to worship other deities such as the Jews saying Uzair is the son of Allah and the Christians saying Eesa is the son of Allah and so they started worshipping them whilst claiming to believe in the oneness of Allah and rejecting shirk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Most High says,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Say, “O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is just between us and you – that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah.” But if they turn away, then say, “Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].” (Soorah Ale-Imraan 3:64)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the saying “come to a word that is just between us and you” clearly shows that they claimed and uttered the belief of Tawheed i.e. the Jews and Christians would say we believe in one Allah and we censure shirk and do not associate partners with him but in practise they would associate partners with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the most high said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“They have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides Allah, and [also] the Messiah, the son of Mary. And they were not commanded except to worship one God; there is no deity except Him. Exalted is He above whatever they associate with Him.” (Soorah Taubah 9:31)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find even though they believed in Tawheed they were still engrossed in shirk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This article was abridged from Muhammad Siddique Radha’s work <em>“The Dangers of Shirk”</em></span></p>
