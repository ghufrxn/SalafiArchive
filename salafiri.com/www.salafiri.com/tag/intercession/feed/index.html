(Kauthar);<br />
</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> </span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (1/197, hadith no.464, book 14, chapter 5, hadith no.10), at-Tamhid (2/285) and al-Istidhkar (no.433) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Ahmad (2/465, 533) from the hadith of Malik with the same meaning and narrated by al-Bukhari (no.7335) from the hadith of Malik which is from Abu Hurairah (Radi Allahu Anhu) without any doubt. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Some people say that the meaning of Jannah in this hadith is that this area will be put into Jannah on the Day of Judgement and some other people say that this is where the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayi Wa Sallam) used to live. The people used to learn about the Quran, Iman and things about the religion from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and those who act upon this will end up reaching Jannah. Therefore this has been metaphorically called a garden from one of the gardens of Jannah just like it has been mentioned in a hadith that Jannah is under the shades of swords (Bukhari no.2818). Meaning that the sincere believer who fights in the path of Allah will go to Jannah. See at-Tamhid (2/287) and Allah knows best.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Some people use this hadith to try and establish that Madinah Munawarah is more virtuous than Makkah Mukaramah however this deduction is incorrect and neither have the pious predecessors understood this. In a hadith the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) declared that Makkah Mukaramah is the best part of Allah&#8217;s Earth. See Sunan Ibn Majah (no.3108, and it&#8217;s chain is Sahih and at-Tirmidhi authenticated it no.3925, and al-Hakim on the conditions of the two Shaikhs 3/7 and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him) and at-Tamhid (2/288). No one has the right to talk against this issue after the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) has made a decision. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) If a narrator of a narration has a doubt on which thiqah narrator he specified then this is not harmful rather this narration is Sahih on the condition that the rest of the chain is also Sahih. This is because all the companions are classified as being Udul (i.e. all of them are thiqah) therefore the exact companion not being specified in this chain does not cause it to be harmful. wal-Hamdullilah </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The Hawd Kawthar is a true reality which Allah specifically gave to His beloved (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Ibn Abdul Bar said that the Hawd Kawthar has been mentioned in the mutawatir hadith of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Ahlus Sunnah and the people of truth believe in this and affirm it. Similarly they believe in the hadith which mention the intercession (on the day of judgement) and the punishment of the grave and they affirm this. (at-Tamhid 2/309) </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">QUESTION</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people claim it is permissible to make tabarruk ie seek blessings from the relics of the scholars and righteous people; they present evidence and say the companions sought blessings from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, so what is the ruling concerning this affair? Also in the form that is deemed permissible, is not a non-Prophet being compared to the Prophet of Allah ﷺ? Also is it permissible to seek blessing from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ after his demise? And is it permissible to seek wasilah ie intercession of the blessings of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ?</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is impermissible to seek blessing from the relics of anyone other than the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, for example the water remaining after wudu, his hair, his sweat or any other part of the body. All of these things are specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and this is because Allah had blessed his body and anything else that he touched. This is the reason why no companion sought blessing or virtue from each other during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ or after his death, even to the extent that blessings or tabarruk was not sought from the four rightly guided Khulafa Rashidun or from the other virtuous companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, such actions and the understanding of the companions is a clear and manifest evidence they understood tabarruk ie blessings to be specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ which was impermissible for anyone else. It is also impermissible for anyone who is not a Prophet because it leads to and is a means to Shirk with Allah which is also the false worship of others. Likewise, and similarly it is not correct to make wasilah of the essence or selfness of Prophet ie dhat, his attributes, his blessings, his station and status because it lacks evidence. This is also due to the fact that it is a means and also leads to Shirk with Allah, this is extremism as well as exaggeration in the status and station of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the reasons is is impermissible is because none of the companions adopted or practiced this type of wasilah. If this was something good, they would have surely preceded us.  Another reason why it is impermissible is because it opposes evidence s from the Shari’ah. Allah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Allah has the most beautiful names, so call him by them.” (al-A’raf:180)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Apart from Allah&#8217;s name, it is permissible to make wasilah through his attributes like Honour, mercy and speech which is established and proven from the authentic hadith, in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would seek refuge in Allah through his Speech, Honour, Mercy and Power. (Muslim no.2202, 2708).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also by having Iman in Allah and his Messenger, it is a means of loving both. Hence it is permissible to seek nearness or closeness to Allah via his righteous good deeds. This is exemplified in the incidence of the people of the cave, who sought shelter in a cave from rain when eventually a rock covered the entrance and blocked it. The people did not have the power to remove the rock, so they began to figure out a way in how to deal with the calamity, and so they agreed to supplicate to Allah by mentioning the good deeds they had done, and would use them as interecessors. So one used his good conducts with is parents as a means to seek nearness to Allah, so the rock moved a little. The second person used his deed of abstaining from fornication as a means to seeking closeness to Allah despite having the ability to do so, so the rocked moved a little more. The third person sought means of closeness by mentioning his good deeds of being honest and trustworthy, eventually the rocked moved from the entrance of the cave and they were eventually able to leave. This is an incident of the people or nations before, so It contains admonition and guidance for us all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This answer has been further expounded by Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim in their respective books. Allamah Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan has also addressed it in his <em>Fath al-Majid Sharh Kitab al-Tawhid.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the hadith of the blind man who sought intercession through the Prophet ﷺ which also mentions the Prophet ﷺ interceded on his behalf, so Allah restored his sight (Ahmad 4:134, Tirmidhi no.3579, Ibn Majah 1404, see also Shaikh al-Albani’s al-Tawassul wal-Wasilah p.75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we should know, this hadith did not mention his station or status as a means of closeness or intercession but rather it was due to the supplication of the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, his intercession, using his own wasitah and wasilah as the hadith clearly states. Furthermore, the people will go to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for this type of intercession on the Day of Judgement so that Allah makes Judgement on them quickly (Bukhari 7410, Muslim 193).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, and similarly the people of Jannah will come to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and ask him to intercede with Allah on their behalf for them to enter Jannah quickly (Muslim 196).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the aforementioned forms of Wasilah, whether they are related to when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was living or the afterlife, all in all of them are related to the Wasilah or du’a of intercession and not due to his selfness, ie Dhat or due to the right of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Tuhfatul Ikhwan Bajwibah Muhimmah Tataluq Biarkan al-Islam</em> (Question 5 p.29), see also <em>Majmu’a Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawah</em> (7:67)   </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated by</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All forms of worship, whether they be prayers, obligatory or optional; fasts, obligatory or optional, giving charity, umrah and hajj and every type of worship will only be accepted up until your Aqeedah (belief) is sound and correct. If your belief is incorrect you will not benefit from any of these actions no matter how long you have been practising them for. If someone believes in shirk and at the same time believes Allaah is the creator, the owner and sustainer of the universe but yet due to his shirk he still worships others besides Allaah, then all of his actions will not be accepted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If someone asks holy saints for help, seeks intercession through the dead, asks the Prophets and Angels for help and seeks assistance from them, supplicates to them and other holy people, pleas to them, asks such entities to remove his or her calamity, going to graves and asking them for help, or goes to a darbar, shrine or tomb and makes dua to them then all of this is committing shirk with Allaah and the greatest crime and sin anyone could ever commit. All of these actions will nullify all of your good deeds no matter how long you have been doing them for and you will have no benefit of any of your actions from your prayers, fasting, Salah, hajj, umrah, dua, Dhikr, sadaqah, sacrifices, nothing will be left of any of your actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These actions will only be accepted and will benefit you when your Aqeedah is correct. The basis of Aqeedah revolves around 2 aspects the first being to believe in Allaah and declaring that He alone is worthy to be worshipped, without associating any false deities with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The second aspect is the prophethood of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and the understanding of this is to make no one equal to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in his prophethood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You must remember no action will ever be accepted if your Aqeedah is incorrect and not only will you be wasting your actions of worship but you will also be wasting all that time you exerted into your worship, all the wealth spent for the sake of Allaah as well as all the good deeds ever done in your life time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imagine on the day of judgement after all your years of worship and all the effort you exerted in your Ibadah and your righteous actions, you are informed that you have nothing to show by the way of actions after a lifetime of worship, how hard done by will you feel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The example of Aqeedah is like a foundation so no matter how big or tall the structure or building is, if it’s foundation are not correct then the building will also be weak and unstable and it will eventually fall. Similarly in the same way no matter how high a structure you create pertaining to worship but if your Aqeedah is not correct then there is no benefit of the worship you have done, not in this world and nor in the hereafter. This is what Allaah the most high said after mentioning the prophets whilst addressing them,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Bit if they had associated others with Allaah, then worthless for them would be whatever they were doing.” (Soorah al-An’aam 6:88)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Allaah is saying that even if the prophets like Ibraaheem the friend of Allaah, Ismaa’eel the one sacrificed for Allaah, Moosaa the one who spoke to Allaah or Eesaa the spirit of Allaah committed shirk then even all of their actions would be wasted and end in vain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the same way Allaah addressed Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and said to him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allah , your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers.” (Soorah az-Zumar 39:65)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So here Allaah is warning Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) that even if he committed shirk his actions would be wasted. So after Allaah warned all the prophets including Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam), then what status do we have. This shows the seriousness of this reprimand and highlights no matter who the person is, a prophet, a holy soofee saint, a Walee or an Imaam anyone who commits shirk will have all of his actions and worship all wasted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When we talk about certain people being engrossed in aspects of shirk like seeking help from people in the graves, using the deceased as intermediateries or sacrificing food in the name of other than Allaah like Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee or Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and the general people say about them, “even though they do these things they still pray and fast.” Then we say there is no benefit of them praying or fasting as the one who commits shirk will have all of his actions and the reward wiped away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The polytheists of Makkah and Abu Jahl used to fast, pray and perform pilgrimage of the house of Allaah, they would give charity. They lived around the Ka’abah and were even custodians and guardians of the Ka’abah but Allaah said none of their actions will benefit them due to shirk and their abode will be the hellfire. Allaah the most high said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination.” (Soorah at-Taubah 9:73)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So for any action to be accepted Allaah alone is to be worshipped without associating partners with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The second aspect in having good and sound Aqeedah is to know that no statement in opposition to the word of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) can be accepted under any circumstance. We believe if all of the statements of mankind were collected and collated and put to one side and on the other side was the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) then without doubt all of the statements of mankind will be rejected and the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) will be taken above and beyond anyones statement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Everyone claims to be upon this and maybe they are but only in terms of it’s wording, however with regards to understanding and acting upon it, it’s a different story. People who have not fully understood this point have made their own little groups, sects and parties and this is what they follow. When the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) comes to them they say, “but our Imaam said this or our peer (holy saint) said this and our Maulana said something different, how can they be wrong? Are you saying they never had knowledge? Etc” However the people of Hadeeth and Ahlus Sunnah say when the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) statements comes to us we reject and abandon everything else and just follow and obey his words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reality is all the Prophets and Messengers Allaah sent to mankind from amongst the different nations all informed their respective nations to abandon the worship of everything and worship one Allaah alone without any partners. However the people would say we do not deny what you say but we never found our forefathers doing this and so were they wrong in what they taught us? So are you truthful and our forefathers liars. Allaah the most high said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And when it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger,” they say, “Sufficient for us is that upon which we found our fathers.” Even though their fathers knew nothing, nor were they guided?” (Soorah al-Ma’idah 5:104)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Today in our time the greatest excuse and the major obstacle is exactly this excuse with regards to the destruction and misguidance of this great Ummah. How does shaytaan misguide man! So they say the Hadeeth is wrong or incorrect but our Imaams and Moulvees/Maulanas/Sidis/Peer/Shaikh are correct in what they say and they can’t make mistakes, they are so learned and they studied with so and so and they have this many ijazahs (permission to narrate). So they all claim to love and follow the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) but in actions and understanding they really don’t.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This also shows how these people think, so they say Allaah is one and we don’t associate partners with him ie we don’t do shirk with him but yet at the same time they say, but these holy saints must have some status so they make them intermediaries. In the same way they have made people equal to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in his status and acknowledge with their actions and understanding that others can be equal to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in terms of his status and statements.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The correct understanding is as mentioned before all the statements of mankind on one side and the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) on one side, all the statement of mankind can be rejected but the statement of the son of Aminah, Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) cannot be rejected. The Quraan mentions the methodology of the people upon the truth and that is the Messenger of Allaah cannot ever make a mistake. Oh people rectify your beliefs and know you cannot take anyone&#8217;s word over the word of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[77] F</strong><strong>rom Malik from Ibn Shihab from Ata ibn Yazid al-Laythi from Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri (Radi Allahu Anhu) that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, &#8220;When you hear the adhan, repeat what the mu’adhdhin says.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/67 hadith no.145, book 3, chapter 1, hadith no.2), at-Tamhid (10/134), al-Istidhkar: (no.124)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.611) and Muslim (no.383) from the hadith of Malik</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong style="color: #000080;line-height: 1.5">[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, “When the Mu&#8217;adhdhin says: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, and one of you should make this response: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest; (and when the Mu&#8217;adhdhin) says: I testify that there is no one worthy of being worshiped in truth except Allah alone, one should respond: I testify that there is no one worthy of being worshiped in truth except Allah alone, and when he says: I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, one should make a response: I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. When he (the Mu&#8217;adhdhin) says: Come to prayer, one should make a response: There is no might and no power except with Allah. When he (the Mu&#8217;adhdhin) says: Come to salvation, one should respond: There is no might and no power except with Allah, and when he (the Mu&#8217;adhdhin) says: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, then make a response: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest. When he (the Mu&#8217;adhdhin) says: I testify that there is no one worthy of being worshiped in truth except Allah alone, and he who makes a response from the heart: I testify that there is no one worthy of being worshiped in truth except Allah alone, he will enter Paradise.&#8221; (Sahih Muslim 12/385) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) If the one who responds to the adhan says the durud after hearing ashadu ana muhamad rasul lullah in accordance to general proof then there is no problem in that. And if he sticks to doing the sunnah replies (as stated in point 1) and says the durud at the end then this is better because it is not established to specifically say the durud during the adhan. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) After the adhan the sunnah durud should be read and then you should say, “O Allah! Rab of this perfect call (perfect by not ascribing partners to You) and of the regular prayer which is going to be established, give Muhammad the right of intercession and illustriousness, and resurrect him to the best and the highest place in Paradise that You promised him (of)]&#8221;. Whoever says this then the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) will intercede for him on the day of Judgement with the permission of Allah. See Sahih Bukhari (no.614) and Sahih Muslim (11/384) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) From the general (understanding) of this hadith it is established that the same reply should be given for the Iqamah and as salatu khayru minanawm that the muadhin says (for the Fajr salah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) If there are a lot of adhans being given then (according to the people of truth) it is enough to reply to the first adhan (you hear). Allah knows best</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) It is not established from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam), companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) and Tabi’in that they kissed their fingers and said sadaqt wa barart during the adhan. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) Whoever says the mentioned words above (from the authentic sunnah) during the adhan and does dua afterwards then his dua will be (Insha Allah) accepted. See Sunan Abi Dawud (no.524 and its chain is <em>[Hasan]</em> good) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"> </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>QUESTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A narration mentions that Adam (Alayhis Salam) supplicated through the Wasilah of Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). (al-Mustadrak al-Hakim 2/615 no.4228, Dalail an-Nabuwwah 5/489 of Baihaqi).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After citing this narration Dr Tahir ul-Qadiri (Barailwi) wrote,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>“Imam Hakim graded this Hadeeth to have an authentic (Saheeh) chain. Imam Baihaqi also graded it Sahih” </em>(al-Arba’een Fee Fadhail an-Nabi al-Amin pg.55, 4th Edn 2002)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So did Imam Baihaqi really authenticate and grade this narration to be Sahih and is this narration actually Sahih. Abu Saqib Muhammad Safdar of Hazro.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">We say Imam Baihaqi did not grade this narration to be authentic (Sahih) at all, rather Imam Baihaqi, May Allaah have mercy on him said, <i>“This is a lone report from Abdur Rahman bin Zaid bin Aslam and he is weak.” </i>(Dalail an-Nabuwwah 5/489).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Mr Tahir ul-Qadiri also cites this report in another book and thereafter reports Imam Baihaqi and others as grading it to be Sahih. (Refer to his book Aqidah Tawhid Aur Haqiqat Shirk pg. 266, 5th Edn, June 2005)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Mr Tahir ul-Qadiri saying that Imam Baihaqi graded it to be authentic (Sahih) is a clear and manifest lie.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>NOTE</b></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Imam Hakim was corrected by Hafidh Dhahabi in Talkhis al-Mustadrak and said, <i>“Rather infact it is fabricated (Mawdoo).”</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The chain of this narration is Mawdoo ie fabricated due to Abdur Rahman bin Zaid bin Aslam and Abdullah bin Muslim al-Fahri. For further details refer to Silsilah al-Hadith ad-Da’ifah Wal-Mawdoo’ah (1/38,47 no.25) of Shaikh al-Albani, May Allah have mercy on him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Fatawa Ilmiyyah ie Tawdhih al-Ahkam (1/84-85 Monthly al-Hadith Magazine, Issue 22, both of Shaikh Zubair Ali Zai</span></p>
