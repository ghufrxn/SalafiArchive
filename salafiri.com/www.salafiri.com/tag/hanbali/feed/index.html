				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Certain brothers, mostly those ascribed to the Hanafee madhab, have recently began a campaign maligning the Ahlul Hadeeth, their heritage and methodology. In essence, these brothers have detracted from Ahlul Hadeeth, Ahl us Sunnah by having enmity in their positions towards the Ahlul Hadeeth. The detractors, it seems, when attacking the Ahlul Hadeeth seek to do so due the taqleed and tahazzub they have for their own madhab loosing the moral essence that any researcher and academic should have, that is, seeking the truth for the face of Allah azzawajal. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We seek Allah’s aid and assistance from such fanaticism for the sake of a madhab or Imaam at the expense of ikhlaas towards Allah. What follows is a very brief and summarised critique around the submissions and themes which often surface during supposed ‘academic’ discussions by the detractors and Allah’s help is sought.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If it is opined that the Ahlul Hadeeth are a new innovated madhab that had no existence during the first three centuries Hijri, then this is broadly responded to from many angles. Firstly, it must be understood that Ahlul Hadeeth is not a sect like the four madhabs, but, instead it is a methodology which advocates adhering to the book and sunnah with prophet Muhammad as its Imaam and the companions as his students. The way and essence of Ahlul Hadeeth as stated is not based on mere words or slogans but the salaf and Islamic texts have established this fact for us all. Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘We do not mean by Ahl al-Hadeeth only those who study it, write it down or narrate it, rather we mean anyone who takes care to memorize it, understand it and follow it, both inwardly and outwardly. The same may be said of “Ahl al-Qur’aan” (the people of the Qur’aan). The basic quality of these people is their love of the Qur’aan and hadeeth, referring to them and their meanings, and acting upon what they learn.&#8221;</em> (</span><span style="color: #000000;">Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 4:95)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ahmad also is reported to have said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“According to us<strong>, Ahlul hadeeth</strong> is a person that Acts upon a hadeeth”</em> [Manaaqib Al-Imam Ahmed Li Ibn Al Jawzi p.208 with an authentic Chain]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is not a single scholar in the first three centuries of Islaam that mentioned taqleed of the hanafee madhab or Abu Haneefah yet it can clearly be seen that the Ahlul Hadeeth were present and the Imaams and people were upon their way as it was only the Quran and sunnah that were followed and not the madhabs as we have them today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Secondly, one can also refer to all the books of Aqeedah authored in the first three or so centuries Hijri, they all refer to the methodology of the Sunni being so as to follow the book and sunnah, that is the way of Ahlul Hadeeth without a mention of taqleed of any madhab. Some books which we list below all promote and explain the way of Ahlul Hadeeth in the first three centuries, whilst some authors expressly mention Ahlul Hadeeth, Ahlul Athar, Firqatun Naajiyah, Ashaab ul Hadeeth and so on therein as being the people of truth, saved sect and the way to follow. Nowhere, in these texts will you find the mention of madhabs and blindly following them yet the detractors claim the Ahlul Hadeeth are a new phenomenon and that it is they whom existed at the time of the salaf, this is nothing but a bare faced lie the detractors’ concoct. Such texts are:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thirdly, Islamic texts and the scholars of Islaam indicate other than what the detractors claim and in fact what one very quickly realises is that it is the madhabist detractors who had no existence during the quruwn ul mufaadhala, whereas, the Ahlul Hadeeth did so.  For example, the prophet said          </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When Allah intends goodness for someone he gives them the understanding of the religion”</em> (Bukharee no:71)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No one from the first three centuries ever understood this to mean understanding of a particular madhab but there is consensus on the fact here that it means the understanding of the Quran and sunnah being mentioned as no other sources existed at that time. This is self explanatory as there was no Hanafee madhab or any of the four madhabs for that matter during the era of the companions. Instead, there was only the Book and the Sunnah, that is, the way of that Ahlul Hadeeth.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, we find Imams in the first three centuries who expressly mentioned and defended the Ahlul Hadeeth thus showing that Ahlul Hadeeth were not only in existence but it was only the Ahl ul Bidah who opposed and fought them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Abu Yusuf referred to the companions and their students as Ahlul Hadeeth. (Sharf Ashaabul Hadeeth p.25)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is one of the main Imaams and about whom the Hanafees say their madhab was handed down to them from so it would be wise to pay attention to his words. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam al-Haakim said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal did well when he commented on this report by saying that the victorious group who will prevail until the Hour begins is “ashaab al-hadeeth” (the people of hadeeth). Who is more deserving of this description than people who follow the way of the righteous and follow in the footsteps of the salaf who came before us, and exposed the falsehood of the people of bid’ah (innovation) by basing their arguments on the Sunnahs of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)?’ </em> (<em>Ma’rifat ‘Uloom al-Hadeeth</em>, by al-Haakim al-Nisaboori, pg. 2-3) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask if the Ahlul Hadeeth are an innovated madhab why did Ahamd Ibn Hanbal say these words? In fact, we ask where are the texts of the salaf from the first three centuries defending or promoting madhabs?  never mind stating that the Hanafi madhab is the saved sect. In actual fact even the Imaam which our Hanfee brothers have invented a madhab around, Numan Bin Thaabit, Abu Haneefah reportedly said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘When a hadeeth is found to be authentic then it is my madhab’</em> (Shaami p.18)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, even he acknowledged the way of Ahlul Hadeeth as being the truth. So who would it be other than the Ahlul Hadeeth who would verify the veracity and authenticity of a hadeeth? This clearly shows not only did the Ahlul Hadeeth exist in the first three centuries but the Imaams like Abu Haneefahh were in need of them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, we ask all the Hanafee brothers please produce a single evidence where Imaam Abu Haneefah said to make a madhab on his name?, to blindly follow him and promote it as one ought to promote only the Quran and Sunnah? There is no such statement as the Hanafees and madhabs did not exist during the first three centuries. This is something which Hanafees even a thousand years after the invention of there madhab have had to acknowledge. Mulla Ali Qari said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allah has not commanded anyone to become Hanafee, Maalikee, Shaafee or Hanbalee”</em> (Sharh Ayn ul-Ilm p.44)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact even the ardent Hanafee Deobandee Idrees Khan Dehlawee had to admit:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In the era of the companions the four madhabs, Hanafee, Malikee, Shaafee, Hanbalee did not exist”</em> (Ijtihaad and Taqleed p.11)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many people have authored articles and treatise with regards to this issue, namely of Isbal ie letting one’s garments fall below the ankles. Without the need the address the intricacies of the issue and the overwhelming clarity in the prohibition and unlawfulness of Isbal, we thought it was perhaps important to look at the most common argument often presented in defence of this prohibited action.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people claim it is mustahab ie recommended to raise the garments below the ankle and therefore it is permissible and lawful to let the garments dangle below the ankles, since it is only mustahab. This notion is often pushed by the neo-madhabists and all those on the ‘difference of opinion’ thinking which is later extended to the all inclusive Manhaj, more so in latter times. We are not referring to the view of early scholars who are generally agreed in its prohibition. This needs to be restricted to those who deliberately drag their garments out of sheer arrogance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This accommodation offered by some of the people of the madhabs and they often retort with the words this is the view of the majority in letting the garment fall below the ankles. We must remember, we are referring to this issue with the condition of without arrogance, for even they are agreed with arrogance is prohibited and unlawful, this is unanimous agreed upon by all quarters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We share three hadith which rebut the claim; it is lawful to let garments fall below the ankles if done without conceit or arrogance. It must be noted the hadith of Abu Hurairah RadhiAllahu Anhu in which he narrates the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whatever of the garment falls below the ankles is in the fire.”</em> (Bukhari no.5787)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is general and can only be restricted with clear authentic texts, this restriction has to be real or at least be a limiting factor. Some people claim the hadith which are general ie the hadith quoted above and the numerous other ahadith which talk about punishment and allude to prohibition, which do not mention the condition of arrogance ie Khuyala in letting the garments fall below the ankle are general and therefore should be specified and restricted by the hadith which do mention the condition of arrogance. This has been mentioned by Imam Ibn Abdul Barr and Imam Nawawi as well as others. (al-Tamhid (3:244), Sharh Sahih Muslim (1:71)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn al-Arabi answers this notion and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is not permissible for a person to let his garments fall below his ankles and say, “I do not have arrogance (in this ie when I let my garment below my ankles I do not do it out of arrogance) as the prohibition incorporates the generality of the wording as well as the reason (ie arrogance). So when such a word incorporates a command or ruling, it is impermissible for a person to say It does not refer to me because the reason does not apply to me (ie I am not arrogant). This opposes the Shari’ah while the claim is unacceptable. Rather is it is exactly due to his arrogance that he lets his clothes and lower garment fall below his ankles and hence his lying is established (ie his claim without arrogance).”</em> (A’ridah al-Ahwadhi (7:238)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr expands on this and further said that isbal (letting garments fall below the ankles) necessitates dragging clothes and dragging clothes necessitates arrogance despite the one wearing the garment does not intend arrogance. (Fath al-Bari (1:264)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>FIRST HADITH</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Juri Jabir bin Sulaym RadhiAllahu Anhu said the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Lift your lower garment to the middle of your shin and if you are unable to do so, then at least to your ankles (ie just above). Beware and be warned from lowering your garment (below your ankles) for verily this is arrogance and Allah does not love/like arrogance.”</em> (Abu Dawud (no.4084), al-Tirmidhi (no.2722) who graded the hadith Hasan-Sahih, al-Sunan al-Kubra (10:236) of Imam al-Baihaqi, al-Mu’ajam al-Kabir (no.6386) of Imam al-Tabarani, Shaikh al-Albani graded it Sahih in Sahih Abu Dawud (2:515-516) and Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi (3:88-89), Imam al-Hakim in his al-Mustadrak (4:186) who graded it Sahih and Imam al-Dhahabi concurred.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The wording of another hadith is,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Beware and be warned from lowering your garment (below the ankles), for verily it is arrogance (/conceit) and Allah does not love/like arrogance.”</em> (Musnad Ahmad (5:63), Sahih Ibn Hibban (1: 364-365 no.511, 1:369 no.522), Mu’ajam al-Shuyukh (no.1491) of Imam Ibn Asakir who said the hadith is Hasan-Gharib)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The authentic variations of this hadith clearly show lowering one’s garments below the ankles is in of itself arrogance and therefore the false notion of whether one does it out of pride or arrogance is dismissed. It is in fact a futile thought based on the words of this clear authentic hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The claim, one can lower his garment below the ankles if done without arrogance, pride or conceit is permissible and the understanding and line of argument of the prohibition, unlawfulness and punishment is only applicable when done out of arrogance and pride is therefore clearly rebutted. This leads onto the view of having the garments above the ankle as being mustahab or recommended, to be null and void but rather is is mandatory and obligatory as the scholars have explained.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #333399;">THE SECOND HADITH</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah Ibn &#8216;Umar narrates,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I happened to pass before Allah&#8217;s Messenger </em><em>ﷺ</em> <em>with my lower garment trailing (upon the ground). He said: &#8216;Abdullah, tug up your lower garment, I tugged it up, and he again said: Tug it still further, and I tugged it still further and I went on tugging it afterward, whereupon some of the people said: To what extent? Thereupon he said: To the middle of the shanks.”</em> (Muslim (no.2086)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another narration the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Abdullah ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Who is this? I said I Abdullah. He replied and said, “If you are Abdullah then lift your lower garment.”</em> (Musnad Ahmad (2:147), Musnad Abu Ya’la (5644) of Qadi Abu Ya’la, Shu’bal Iman (no.6119) of Imam al-Baihaqi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not ask Abdullah ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma his intention or reason with him, he did not ask him if he had lowered his garment due to pride or arrogance or just naturally. Rather he ordered him to raise his garment irrespective of his intent or whether it was done out of arrogance or conceit</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Husn al-Dhan indicates this illustrious companions Abdullah ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma would have always had his garments above his ankles. He was known for his fervor in following the Sunnah. Another possible explanation offered by the scholars is that Abdullah ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma had his garment above his ankles anyway but it was just above the ankles and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ considered this to be dragging and thus asked him to raise his garments further, up to the middle of his shin. Nonetheless the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had love for his companions and knew them like no one else, while being the most aware about them, ie he would have known if his companions had arrogance. Despite knowing Abdullah ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma and Husn al-Dhan dictates that he did not have arrogance, despite this he was commanded to raise his garment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Abdullah ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma would issue legal edicts to people who dragged their garments based on this, he would narrate the hadith from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He includes the words due to arrogance, see (Sahih Muslim (no.2085).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, in the main hadith he himself had his garment low, as the text of the hadith indicates, hence the Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked him to raise it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the hadith of Abu Bakr, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Abu Bakr you are not from the people who has arrogance, but despite this Abu Bakr RadhiAllahu anhu would position his garments above his ankles as the wording of the hadith indicates and it would only drop if he did not take care. (Bukhari no.5784)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">None of the Sahabah had their garments below their ankles, the ones who did, had a reason but despite this they still raised their garments. The evidence is the report of Shuraid bin Suwaid when the Thaqafi man was ordered to raise his garment by the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and the Thaqafi man had his garments above his ankles until his death. (Musnad al-Humaidi (no.810), Musnad Ahmad (no.19494)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also Umar bin al-Khattab advised a young companion to raise his garments while he was dying with an open wound on his abdomen (Bukhari (no.3700)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The successor ie Tabi’i, Abu Ishaq al-Sabi’i said he saw many companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who would have their lower garments to the middle of their calves and he mentions, Usamah bin Zayd, Ibn Umar, Zayd bin Arqam and Bara ibn A’zib. (Musannaf Ibn Abi shaybah (8:392-393)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad bin Sirin mentions from the companions he saw; they would all have their garments to the middle of their calves. (Musannaf ibn Abi Shaybah (8:389)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #333399;">THE THIRD HADITH</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah narrates</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“While a man was praying letting his lower garment trail, the Messenger of Allah (</em><em>ﷺ</em><em>) said to him: Go and perform ablution. He, therefore, went and performed ablution and then returned. He (the prophet) again said: Go and perform ablution. He again went, performed ablution and returned. A man said to him (the prophet): Messenger of Allah, why did you order him to perform ablution? He said: he was praying with lower garment trailing, and does not accept the prayer of a man who lets his lower garment trail.”</em> (Abu Dawud no’s 638, 4086, It is also transmitted by Imam Nasa’i in al-Sunan al-Kubra (no.9703), Sunan al-Kubra (2:241) of Imam al-Baihaqi, Sahih Ibn Hibban (2406), Musnad Ahmad (4:67), Riyadh al-Salihin (no.797).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani does grade this hadith to be weak in Da’if Sunan Abi Dawud (p.53 and p.331). Shaikh Salim al-Hilali mentions the reason as Abu Ja’afar, who is in this particular chain of Abu Dawud is unknown ie majhul. (Bahjah al-Nazirin (1:619)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair Ali Za’i graded the hadith as having a Hasan Chain and said it is transmitted by Ahmad (4:67), Abu Ja’afar al-Madani is Hasan (al-Hadith) according to Tirmidhi (no.3448), Ibn Hibban authenticated him in his Sahih (no.2406), Hafiz Ibn Hajr strengthened him in his Takhrij al-Azkar, as did Imam Nawawi in Riyadh al-Salihin, who authenticated his hadith (his words are to follow), Yahya bin Abi Kathir narrates it from Abu Ja’afar and he would only narrate from trustworthy people as Abu Hatim said. (Sunan Abi Dawud (1:496)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair Ali Za’i also indicated its authenticity by not including it in his <em>Anwar al-Sahifah Fil Ahadith al-Da’ifah Min al-Sunan al-Arb’a.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The statement of Imam Abu Hatim can be found in al-Jarh wa’t Ta’dil (9:142) and he adds the words, <em>“Imam.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Dhahabi agreed with this grading as can be seen from his al-Kaba’ir (p.179).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz al-Haithami went onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ahmad transmitted it and its narrators are the narrators of the Sahih.”</em> (MAjma’a al-Zawa’id (5:125)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same people who present Imam Nawawi’s statement that letting the garments below the ankles is makruh if done without conceit or arrogance forget that he authenticated this hadith. Essentially the people who put forward these arguments all agree themselves in the severe punishment as well as the general rule to have the garments above the ankle but at times due to this expansive manhaj and accommodating some of the views of the madhabs say it is only makruh and not prohibited if done for any other reason.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being, despite the fact that the grading of this hadith is disputed, where some have authenticated it based on the different variations of the chain while others have authenticated it. The detractors and hanbali madhab sympathisers present the statement of Imam Nawawi as mentioned above but he himself authenticates the aforementioned hadith, more specifically the chain in his Riyadh al-Salihin (no.797) where he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Transmitted by Abu Dawud with an authentic-Sahih chain on according to the conditions set forth by Imam Muslim.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shafi’i Asharite Muhammad bin E’lan al-Siddiqi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The prayer of the person who lovers his garment below his ankle is not accepted and he should seek forgiveness and repent.”</em> (Dalil al-Falihin (3:232)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, some of the scholars have said the meaning is authentic as it is supported by another hadith as transmitted by Abdullah ibn Mas’ud RadhiAllahu Anhu which states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“</em><em>I heard the Messenger of Allah (</em><em>ﷺ</em><em>) say: He who lets his garment trail during prayer out of pride, Allah, the Almighty, has nothing to do with pardoning him and protecting him from Hell.”</em> (Sunan Abu Dawud no.637), al-Kubra (no.9680) of Imam al-Nasa’i, Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi (no.351), Shaikh al-Albani graded it Sahih in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud (p.189-190)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows, Allah will not accept the prayer of the Musbil ie the one who lowers his garment below his ankles, Allah will not pardon him or protect him from Hell Let us assume for arguments sake, the people who claim it is acceptable if done without arrogance or conceit, then we ask why do they roll up their lower garments or trousers when they pray? Surely the conscious state of not being arrogant and conceited remains within and outside of the prayer!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It they say this last hadith again mentions pride, we say the hadith mentions trailing in prayer however we know no one walks and prays, so the trailing here is understood as general isbal. This means letting your garments fall below your ankles is considered trailing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This view of the prayer not being accepted was also the view held by the pious ancestors. Mujahid the Tabi’i said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It would be said (indicated the general majority view) the salah is not accepted of the one who lets his lower garment touch his ankles.”</em> (Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (8:388)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hussain bin Abdur Rahman, also a Tabi’i said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I heard Dharr bin Abdullah al-Hamdani say, “The Salah is not accepted of the one whose lower garment touches the ground.”</em> (Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (8:388)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn al-Qayyim said while explaining this hadith that</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allah knows best that lowering the garment below the ankles is a sin and whoever commits a sin, he will be ordered to perform wudu and pray because wudu extinguishes the fire of the sin.”</em> (Tahdhib Ala Sunan Abi Dawud (6:50).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn al-Arabi and Shaikh al-Taybi have also mentioned something similar in their respective books. In fact, Hafiz ibn al-Arabi said only the arrogant and conceited person lowers his garment below his ankle whereas when a person prays he is in a state of humility and thus both states are conflicting and contradictory. (A’ridah al-Ahwadhi (7:238) and Sharh al-Taybi (2:268)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers these ahadith especially the last one, of the prayer of the musbil not being accepted is a serious warning to all those who claim the permissibility of letting the garments fall below the ankles if done without arrogance and conceit. Also the severe warning that Allah will not pardon the musbil, how much more severe can it be for us to realise and pretend it is the majority view, which is often just limited to some out of context statements of the later scholars, and even they alluded to the clear cut prohibition of Isbal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are numerous other ahadith which make the heart tremble in the depravity of letting the garments fall below the ankles, the believer is reminded to be humble and lock away his alter ego while garbing himself with the fallacious notion that he is free from arrogance and conceit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, based on the numerous ahadith and the severe punishment which they mention as well as the dire consequences, one should always try to be safe and abstain from views, which are not only unsafe but also lack textual evidence, except some views.  For example, there is not a single clear authentic hadith or report which mentions the permissibility of letting the garments fall below the ankles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers do not be naive and fall the opt-repeated notion of majority view, whereas we have shown the pious ancestors ie the Salaf us-Salah, ie the companions, successors and their successors were unanimous in wearing their garments above their ankles. The earlier statements from the Tabi’in indicate all of the companions were upon this way. If this is the case where has this mustahab view come from and why follow unclear statements which talk about if done without arrogance or conceit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly let any person claim he is free from arrogance and conceit! Anyone, of course not, then why all the gurgle? This issue is as clear as the sun, except those who want to open the doors to this all inclusive manhaj-difference of opinion approach and also in the blind ignorant defence of the position of the madhabs, especially the modern neo-Hanbali Madhabists, who are far away from the methods and way of the great Hanbali scholars. Allahs Aid and refuge is sought. Amin</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hanbalee Text</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>al-Khiraqeee ( d. 334):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>– “The hands are raised up to the lobes of the ears or parallel to the shoulders, then the right hand is placed upon the left, and both of them placed below the navel.” (Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee)</strong></span></p>
<p><b>Reply</b></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly the origin and sources are the Quraanic text and the Prophetic ahadeeth and as it is often advocated by those who deem it necessary and permissible to adhere and follow a madhab usually tend to say evidences must have been used to derive these rulings and final positions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a basic text of Hanbalee fiqh authored by Abul Qaasim Umar bin al-Hussain bin Abdullah al-Khirqee and he died in the year 334H. It is considered to be one of the very first classical text on the hanbalee fiqh and as the name suggest it is Mukhtasar ie summarised and brief, its full name is <i>Matn al-Khirqee A’la Madhab Abee Abdillaah Ahmad ibn Hanbal ash-Shaibaanee</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore it is very strange that this text would be used to establish the opinion of the hanaabilah to clasp their hands below the navel when this text is just a very brief guide. Furthermore the author ie al-Khiraqee has not cited any evidences at all whatsoever and has just cited a position we known without evidences this is invalid as its just opinion. It is often said the madhaahib must have used evidences yet in this instance there is no evidence so just to cite Khiraqee saying the position of the madhab is below the navel is ambiguous and requires further investigation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The checker ie Abu Hudhaifah Ibraaheem ibn Muhammad of one of the editions of Mukhtasar al-Khirqee added a footnote to this passage and said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i>“</i><i>There are a number of narrations</i><i> </i><i>from Imaam</i><i> </i><i>Ahmad</i><i> </i><i>that acknowledge and establish the</i><i> </i><i>placing</i><i> (of the hands) </i><i>on the chest.”</i> (<i>Mukhtasar al-Khirqee</i> (pg.21), Chapter, The Characteristics of the Prayer. Edn 1st Daar us-Sahaabah Lil-Turaath of Tantha (Egypt) 1413H/1993)</strong> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So we have previously mentioned al-Khiraqee is a basic text of the Hanaabilah and it does not cite any evidences just opinions of the madhabs. In this situation and other situations it is obligatory upon as Muslims to refer back to the divine sacred texts and in this instance for the evidences utilised by the madhab.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then we look at these evidences in light of the scholars of hadeeth and fiqh if the hadeeth are authentic we take them irrespective of the madhab and what the end result of adopting the ahadeeth brings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A recent explanation of Khiraqee does not mention the evidence used for this position and this explanation was by Khaalid bin Abdullaah al-Ansaari titled. <i>‘Sharh Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee’</i> Edn 1st Daar ul-Ei’tisaam Lil-Nashr 1425H/2004H and he also does not mention any evidence. As it must be said by the checking by Muhammad Zuhair ash-Shaawaish of Matn al-Khiraqee of one of the earliest printed edition in this century with his checking back in 1378H/1954 and he also offered no explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the earliest explanations of the Khiraqee was that of Shaikh Noor ud deen Abee Taalib Abdur Rahmaan bin Umar bin Abil-Qaasim bin Alee bin Uthmaan al-Basree adh-Dhareer who died in the year 684H titled. <i>‘al-Waadhihu Fee Sharh Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee’</i> (Edn 1st Daar al-Khadar Lil Taba’ah Wan-Nashr Wat-Tawzee’a 1421H/2000, Beiroot Lebanon)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In it Shaikh Noor ud deen said in explanation of al-Khiraqees words,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i>“</i><i>and both of them placed below the navel” </i><i>This has been narrated from Alee, Abu Hurairah (</i><i>Radhiallaahu Anhuma) and others from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) who said, “It is from the Sunnah to place the right hand on the left below the navel.” Transmitted by Ahmad and this is equivalent to the Prophetic Sunnah. This statement is also emanated from the companions.</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i>It is also narrated from (Imaam) Ahmad the Sunnah is to place the hands above the navel and this is also the statement of ash-Shaafi’ee from what is narrated by Wail ibn Hujr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) who said, “I saw the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) praying and he placed his hands on his chest one over the other.”</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i>It is also narrated from (Imaam) Ahmad that one has the choice or option to place them below the navel or above the navel based on all of the narrations (on this subject) and the command pertaining to them is broad.”</i> (End of his words)(‘al-Waadhih Fee Sharh Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee’ (1/213-214)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>BENEFITS</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly the explainer Shaikh Noor ud deen has summarised the narrations and used different wordings from what is present in the books of hadeeth. The narrations of Alee and Abu Hurairah (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) have been continuously used by all of the different madhabs in support of this opinion and in recent times books on prayer in the English language from the hanafee school of opinion from the likes of <i>‘Fiqh ul-Imam’</i> of Abdur Rahmaan ibn Yoosuf and Mr Riyadhs book <i>‘Salah of The Believer’</i>which are of Deobandee Hanafee persuasion and also some have been printed in the English language by the Barailwee Hanafee persuasion all by default use the very same reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration elucidating the meaning of the report of Alee and Abu Hurairah can be found in the <i>‘Sunan Abee Dawood’</i>(1/201 no.756) of Imaam Abu Dawood and The <i>‘Musnad’</i> of Imaam Ahmad himself (1/110 no.875)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the narration of Wail ibn Hujr can be found in the <i>‘Saheeh Ibn Khuzaimah’</i> of Imaam Ibn Khuzaimah (1/234 no.479)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So we also find the evidences used by the Hanaabilah for the position of placing their hands below their navels are the very same reports of Alee and Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) but these report have been comprehensively established to be weak. (as a brief idea refer to an appendix of the English translation of Allaamah Muhammad Naasir ud deen al-Albaanees <i>‘Sifah Salaatun Nabee’ </i>which addresses the trustworthiness of the central narrator of both of these reports and he is Abdur Rahmaan ibn Koofee al-Waasitee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most staunchest and most bigoted in this issue are our brethren from amongst the Ahnaaf ie the hanafees and even they have admitted overwhelmingly and acknowledged in their various works throughout history the weakness of Abdur Rahmaan al-Koofee. Which inshaAllaah maybe addressed at a different time. It suffices for now to know that some traditionalists ie prominent and universally accepted scholars have even established universal consensus in his weakness ie Ijmaa which as we dear readers know constitutes evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next question we may ask ourselves well if these reports are so weak why did such scholars from amongst the hanaabilah or others for that matter still utilise them as evidence as part of their madhabs. Well the simple answer to this is that this issue has been continually argued and discussed throughout history on why people still utilise evidences that are weak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is such a complex issue that books have even been written on it, in recent times the great Saudi and renowned scholar of Usool and Aqeedah Allaamah Shaikh Muhammad ibn Saaleh al-Uthaimeen Rahimahullaah, authored a book on why scholars differed or why differences of opinion existed and the Shaikhs goes through such pertinent reasons. It is indeed one of those must read books and you will be pleased to know it has been translated into English a number of years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imaam Shaikh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah also wrote a monumental work on the subject of understanding the differences of opinion amongst scholars titled, <i>‘Raf al-Malaam Ann Ai’matul A’laam’</i> as have other Scholars from the likes of Shaikh Shaah Waleeullaah Dehlawee and Shaikh Muhammad Hayaat Sindhee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the reasons they have mentioned are that the scholars are unaware of the other ahadeeth or narrations, another reason is if they were aware they believed their position was stronger, another reason is that they may have been unaware of the authenticities of such reports and or the authenticity of opposing reports and this leads onto another reason and that is that the scholars of fiqh or compilers of such books on fiqh were not strong in the verification and research of ahadeeth but rather their expertise was more focussed on the interpretation, interpolation and elucidation of these sacred texts. The above narration is a prime example of this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> It must also be noted here and we find this extremely interesting and that is it is often said and re-iterated and this article that was shared with us is a pertinent example that the 2 opinions from Imaam Ahmad are below the navel or above the navel and this is what Shaikh Noor ud deen has mentioned in <i>‘al-Waadhih Fee Sharh Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee’ </i>baring in mind this was at least as early as the 7th century of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Unfortunately there are those who are from amongst us, who for some strange and odd reason lack the vision and insight into such issues and say, “well only the words above the navel has been mentioned from Imaam Ahmad as his opinion and therefore this does not mean on the chest so why do the Salafis and the Ahlul Hadeeth say Imaam Ahmads opinion was to place the hands on the chest.” This is a very common point made by such “madhabees” they also say in a different way above the navel does not mean on the chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In answer to this weak point Imaams Ahmad position was to place the hands on the chest because the evidence used for placing the hands above the navel is the hadeeth of Wail ibn Hujr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) which mentions on the chest. So this shows every time the wording above the navel is cited as Imaam Ahmads position, it should by default denote on the chest as this was the understanding of the explainer of <i>Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee</i> ie Shaikh Noor ud deen as he used the hadeeth of placing the hands on the chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore according to some opinions anything above the navel means the chest and this is well known according to the usoolee scholars and the linguists. So the defining line and distinguishing sign is the belly button ie the navel, below or above it and in this way the navel becomes the line of demarcation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is most pertinent and extremely interesting to note a cunning and deceptive ploy by our madhabee brethren in that they have now shifted their arguments and therefore now say placing the hands below the navel and also above the navel are both valid and correct opinions. They also say placing the hands them on the chest is something alien and an odd opinion. Similarly it also opposes the position of the majority of the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Previously they were (ie the Madhabees) vehemently opposed to anything above or on the navel and in recent times our beloved hanafee brethren have changed and refined their position after realising the strength and authenticity of the evidences presented and have now formulated a new argument that below the navel is good, above the navel is good and acceptable but just not on the chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This ploy according to them has been adopted in order to include the 2 varying opinions of the Hanbalee madhab according to their understanding that above the navel does not mean on the chest thereby increasing their numbers from just the hanafee madhab to now include the hanbalee madhab and to say to the Salafis and Ahlul Hadeeth that you guys now even oppose the hanaabilah, yet this is nothing but just distancing themselves from the truth and overlooking the divine sacred texts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A clear rebuking of this point is that numerous scholars and researchers from amongst the madhab of the hanabilah have done 1 of 2 things, the first is that they have adopted the opinion of the madhab which suggests according to their understanding of the hanbalee madhab that above the navel means the chest and therefore place their hands on their chests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly they may have simply adopted the stronger opinion based on the way of the Madhab of Ahlul Hadeeth that the ahadeeth mentioning the placing of the hands on the chest to be stronger and more authentic than the ahadeeth which mention the position of below the navel. There are numerous scholars from amongst the hanabilah who left and abandoned the position of their madhab in this issue and adopted the position of on the chest and there so many it seems daunting to mention them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Delving into the Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee we have yet another explanation titled, <i>‘Sharh az-Zarkashee A’la Matn al-Khiraqee’</i>which was authored by Shaikh Shams ud deen Abu Abdullaah Muhammad bin Abdullaah az-Zarkashee, who was Egyptian during the 8th century Hijree and he died approximately in the year 772H. So again this is an early explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaikh Zarkashee said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>“<i>and both of them placed below the navel” (Explanation) This is one report from (Imaam) Ahmad. From what Ahmad and Abu Dawood transmit from Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said, “It is from the Sunnah to fasten the palm(s) in the prayer below the navel.” And the definitive Sunnah is equivalent to the Sunnah from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam)</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i> </i><i>The second report (from Imaam Ahmad) and this has the most precedence (al-Afdhal)  is to place the hands below chest as is narrated from Qabeesah bin Hulb from his father who said, “I saw the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) he placed his hands on his chest” and Yahyaa ibn Sa’eed described this and said, “the right on the left above the joint.” Transmitted by Ahmad.</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><i> </i><i>The third report (from Imaam Ahmad) one has a choice between the 2. This was adopted by Abee Moosaa and Abul Barkaat and his actions upon it has been reported. Abul Barkaat said, “and so from these narrations there is a wide scope in these 2 commands and there is no harm in anyone from amongst them. And Allaahs knows best.”</i> (Sharh az-Zarkashee A’la Matn al-Khiraqee (1/298) Edn 3rd 1430H/2009, Maktabah al-Asdee, Makkah, KSA)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>BENEFITS</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again essentially 2 opinions below the navel based on the narration of Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and this has been established and comprehensively elucidated to be weak due to a central problematic narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The saying of Shaikh Zarkashee below the chest is not problematic and just requires a little further comprehension and reasoning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Firstly</i></b> below the chest does not mean below the navel rather it means above the navel. It must also be noted Shaikh Zarkashee said back in the 8th century that this has precedence ie it is better to place the hands above the navel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Secondly</i></b> Shaikh Zarkashee uses the report of Hulb which categorically mentions chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Thirdly</i></b> he explains what he means by chest as he goes onto say Imaam Yahyaa ibn Sa’eed described ‘chest’ as being above the joint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Fourthly</i></b> the question what does the joint mean here? Well being open minded and not indulging into polemics that some will exhort to, it is most pertinent that they are answered before they create further confusion and that is the <i>‘Madhabees’</i>may say above the joint may mean placing the right hand on and over the joint of the left hand ie the palm of the right hand covers the back of the left hand, the wrist and the beginning of the forearm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> This is an incorrect notion as the word ‘fauqa’ (above) has been used denoting position in terms of height in relation to something else and if the meaning we have discussed above was intended, the word A’la (on) would have been used.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><i>Fifthly</i></b> it could be strongly argued that Imaam Yahyaa ibn Sa’eed describing the narration of Hulb is doing so in specifying and clarifying what is meant and intended by chest and the author ie Shaikh Zarkashees by bringing his statement is also explaining his position where he said “below the chest.” So the joint here could mean and refer to the joint that occurs between the 2 sides of the ribs which is well above the navel and just below the chest in the general understanding of the word chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> We have also discussed previously the meaning of the word chest and what does some have opined it could refer to anything from the lower part of the neck to the navel.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Introduction: The Salafi dawah is a methodology and not a sect or madhab as it has never had any one overall leader expect the prophet Muhammad r all other sects, groups or madhabs have a founder or overall leader either in the past or today. Salafis also do not blindly-follow anyone scholars understanding of Islam in every issue unlike groups and sects with in Islam. Salafis follow the scholars of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah also known as Ahlus Sunnah from the past and of today collectively on all issues.</p>
<p>Salafis can come from the Maliki, the Shafi’i, the Hanbali, or the Hanafi schools of law.</p>
<p>Salafis accept teaching of all four schools of law but only if their rulings are supported by clear and authenticated evidences from the Quran and Sunnah. Salafis reject blind-following (taqleed) and call to Ittibaa following and obedience to the Messenger of Allah .</p>
<p>They only say a person should not blind follow a madhab. By this what is meant is following only one madhab in every issue without knowing their evidences believing this madhab is correct on every issue, while rejecting every other madhab on every issue without knowing their evidences, believing they are wrong on every issue.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>1.</strong> Narrated Aisha (RadhiAllahu Anha) that the Prophet Muhammad r said, ‘“But this year he reviewed it with me twice, and therefore I think that my time of death has approached. So, be afraid of Allah, and be patient, for I am the best <strong>SALAF (PREDECESSOR)</strong> for you (in the Hereafter).”’ [Sahih Bukhari, &#8211; The Book of Asking Permission, Hadeeth no. 5885]
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>2.</strong> Abu Haneefah (Rahimahullah) (d. 150H) said: “Adhere to the aathaar (narration) and the tareeqah (way) of the <strong>Salaf</strong> (Pious Predecessors) and beware of newly invented matters for all of it is innovation” [Reported by as-Suyootee (Rahimahullah) in Sawn al Mantaq wal-Kalaam p.32]
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>3.</strong> Imaam al-Awzaee (Rahimahullah) (d.157H) said: “Hold fast to the narrations of the <strong>salaf</strong>, even if people were to abandon you. Beware of the opinions of the people, no matter how much they beautify it with their speech.” [Related by al-Khateeb al-Baghdadee (Rahimahullah) in his excellent book Sharafu Ashaabul-Hadeeth (p.7)]
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>4.</strong> Imaam al-Asbahaanee (Rahimahullah) (d.535H) said: “The sign of Ahlus-Sunnah is that they follow the <strong>Salafus-Saalih</strong> and abandon all that is innovated and newly introduced into the Deen.” [Al-Hujjah fee Bayaanil Mahajjah 1/364]
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>5.</strong> As-Sam’aanee (Rahimahullah) (d.562H) said in al-lnsaab (3/273): “<strong>As-Salafi</strong>: this is an ascription to the <strong>Salaf</strong> and following their ways, in that which is related from them.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>6.</strong> lbn al-Atheer (Rahimahullah) (d.630H) said in al-Lubaab fee Tahdheebul-lnsaab (2/162), commenting upon the previous saying of as-Sam’aanee: “And a group were known by this ascription <strong>(salafi)</strong>.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>7.</strong> lbn Taymiyyah (Rahimahullah) (d.728H) said: “There is no criticism for the one who proclaims the way (madhdhab) of the <strong>Salaf</strong>, who attaches himself to it and refers to it. Rather, it is obligatory to accept that from him by unanimous agreement (Ittifaaq) because the way (madhdhab) of the <strong>Salaf</strong> is nothing but the Truth (Haqq).” [Majmoo al-Fataawaa 4:149]
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>8.</strong> Imaam adh-Dhahabee (Rahimahullah) (d.748H) said: “It is authentically related from ad-Daaraqutnee (Rahimahullah) (d. 995 C.E., 385 A.H.) that he said: There is nothing more despised by me than ‘ilmul-kalaam (innovated speech and rhetorics). I say: He never entered into ‘ilmul-kalaam, nor argumentation. Rather, he was a <strong>Salafee</strong> (a follower of the Salaf).”[Siyar 16/457]
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>9.</strong> Also, Imam al-Dhahabee (Rahimahullah) described Ibn al-Salah (Rahimahullah), a prominent hadith specialist of the sixth century (577-643 AH), as: “Firm in his religiosity, <strong>salafi</strong> in his generality and correct in his denomination. [He] refrained from falling into common pitfalls, believed in Allah and in what Allah has informed us of from His names and description.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>10.</strong> In another of his works, Tadhkirat al-huffaz, Imam al-Dhahabi (Rahimahullah) said of Ibn al-Salah (Rahimahullah): “I say: He was <strong>salafi</strong>, of sound creed, abstaining from the interpretations of the scholars of rhetoric, believing in what has been textually established, without recourse to unjustified interpretation or elaboration.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>11.</strong> Haafidh Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (Rahimahullah) also used the term, <strong>salafi</strong> to describe Muhammad ibn al-Qaasim ibn Sufyan al-Misri al-Maliki (Rahimahullah) (d. 966 C.E., 355 A.H.) He said that al-Malaiki was: “<strong>Salafi al-madh’hab – salafi in his school of thought</strong>.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>12.</strong> In his book, Tabsir al-Muntabih, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (Rahimahullah) mentioned the ascription al-<strong>Salafi</strong> and named Abd al-Rahman ibn Abdillah ibn Ahmad Al-Sarkhasi <strong>al-Salafi</strong> (Rahimahullah) as an example of its usage. Ibn Hajar then said: “And, likewise, the one ascribing to the <strong>salaf</strong>.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Question: What is As-Salafiyyah and what is your opinion regarding it?</strong></p>
<p>Answer:  All praise is due to Allaah alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger, his family and his Companions.</p>
<p>To proceed: “As-Salafiyyah” is an attachment or affiliation to the ‘Salaf’. And “The Salaf” are the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah r and the Imaams of guidance (Rahimahumullah) from the first three generations, those whose goodness Allaah’s Messenger r  bore witness to in his statement:</p>
<p>“The best of mankind is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them. Then there will come people where bearing witness of one of them will precede his taking an oath and his taking an oath will be his bearing witness.” [Reported by Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal in the &#8216;Musnad&#8217; (4/426), &#8216;Al-Bukhaaree (2651), and Muslim (2535)]
<p>And “The Salafiyyoon [or Salafees]” is the plural of “Salafi”, an attachment or affiliation to the Salaf, and its meaning has already preceded above – and they are those who traverse upon the Methodology (Manhaj) of the Salaf in following the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah [of the Messenger of Allaahr], and inviting to them, and acting upon them, and they are, due to this, Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah.</p>

<p><em>“Fataawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Daa’imah”: (2/165-166). Fatwa No. (1361).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Question: I hear much about the Salaf, who are the Salaf O Noble Shaykh?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The meaning of the [word] Salaf is (Al-Mutaqaddimoon) the predecessors so every person that precedes another is a salaf for him but when this term is used unrestrictedly then it only refers to the first three praised generations from the companions (as-Sahaabah) and those that followed them (at-Taabi’oon) and those that followed them [Atba’ at-Taabyi’een]. They indeed are the pious predecessors (as-Salaf as-Saaleh). Whoever came after them and traversed upon their way (Minhaaj) then he is like them upon the way of the Salaf; even though he may have come after them with regards to time because as-Salafiyyah is a designation which applies to the way (Minhaaj) which was traversed by the pious predecessors (as-Salaf as-Saaleh) as the Prophet r said:</p>
<p>“Indeed my nation will split into seventy three sects all of them in the Fire except one and it is the united body (al-Jamaa’ah)”</p>
<p><em>and in another wording,</em></p>
<p>“..whoever is upon the same as what I am upon and my companions.”</p>
<p>So based upon that then as-Salafiyyah here is specific in meaning, hence whoever is upon the way (Minhaaj) of the Sahaabah, the Taabi’oon and those who followed them upon goodness; then he is a Salafi even if he is in our contemporary times and whilst it being the fourteenth century after the Migration [of the Prophet r] (al-Hijrah).</p>

<p><em>Fataawa Noor ‘alaa al-Darb: at-Tawheed wal-’Aqeedah.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Question: Is there a ‘Salafiyyah Qadeemah (old)’ and ‘Salafiyyah Jadeedah (new)’, or is there just one Salafiyyah?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: There is only one Salafiyyah, the one who claims that there is an old and new Salafiyyah has lied. If we contemplate over the ‘aqeedah of the Salaf from the time of the sahaabah to our time today, we find it to be one ‘aqeedah, never contradicting each other. Even if they differed in the subsidiary legislations which are not from the fundamentals and beliefs, then surely they disagree in this (subsidiary legislations). Not one of them belittles the other. This was the way of the Sahaabaah, may Allaah the most high be pleased with them all. As for the beliefs, then their manhaj (methodology) in this regard is one from the time of the Companions until now.</p>

<p><em>al-Fataawah al-Jaleeyah ‘an al-Manaahij ad-Da’waiyyah</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Question: Some of the people claim that Salafiyyah is considered a Jamaa’ah from amongst the jamaa’aat that are working within the arena, and that its ruling is the same as the ruling upon the rest of the jamaa’aat. So what is your assessment of this claim?</strong></p>
<p>Answer:  The Jamaa’ah of as-Salafiyyah is the Jamaa’ah which is upon the truth, and it is the one that it is obligatory to belong to, act in accordance with and to ascribe to. And everything else from amongst the jamaa’aat, then it is obligatory that they not be considered jamaa’aat of da’wah, because they are in opposition. How can we follow a sect that opposes the Jamaa’ah of Ahlus-Sunnah and the guidance of the Salafus-Saalih?!</p>
<p>Whatever opposes the Jamaa’ah of Salafiyyah, then it opposes the manhaj of the Messengerr. It is in opposition to whatever the Messengerr and his Companions (RadhiAllahu Anhum) were upon.</p>
<p>So the statement of the speaker that the Jamaa’ah of Salafiyyah is one of the Islaamic jamaa’aat, this is an error. The Jamaa’ah of Salafiyyah is the sole Jamaa’ah that it is obligatory to follow, to traverse upon its manhaj, to be affiliated with and to make Jihaad with. And everything else besides it, then it is not permissible for the Muslim to affiliate himself with any of that, because it is in opposition.</p>
<p>So if the person pleased to be affiliated with the opponents to the manhaj of the Salaf? The Muslim is not pleased with this. The Messengerr  said, “Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs after me.” Related by Aboo Daawood (no. 4607).</p>
<p>And he r said, “Whosoever is upon the likes of what I am upon today, and my Companions.” Related by at-Tirmidhee (no. 2541). So does a person desire salvation, but he traverses other than its path?</p>
<p>‘You hope for salvation, but you do not traverse its path; Indeed, the ship does not sail upon dry land.’</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Question: What is meant by the Salafi madhab?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: What is meant by the Salafi madhab is the way of the Salaf (early generations) of this Ummah, namely the Sahabah, Taabieen and prominent Imams with regard to issues of ‘aqeedah, sound method, sincere faith and adherence to the beliefs, laws, etiquette and conduct of Islam, unlike the innovators, deviants and those who are confused…There is nothing wrong with calling them Ahl al-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah, so as to differentiate between them and the followers of deviant groups. This is not praising oneself, rather it is distinguishing between the people of truth and the people of falsehood.</p>

<p><em>Al-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Shaykh al-Fawzaan, 1/question no. 206.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Question: Are Salafis/Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah opposed to the Hanafis, Maalikis, Shaafa’is and Hanbalis</strong></p>
<p>Answer: “Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah (Salafis) are not to be regarded as in opposition to the Maalikis, Shaafa’is, Hanbalis and the like, rather they are opposed to the followers of innovated and misguided beliefs and ways such as the Ash’aris, Mu’tazilah, Murji’is, Sufis and so on. The Hanafis, Maalikis, Shaafa’is and Hanbalis are schools of fiqh, whose imams are among Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, and indeed are among the leaders of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah.”</p>
<p><em>al-Ma’soomi</em></p>
<p><em>From his book Hal al-Muslim mulzim bi Ittibaa’ Madhhab mu’ayyin min al-Madhhab al-Arba’ah, p. 38.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Question: Some of those who claim that they are Salafees say: We are Salafees but we do not speak about those who fall into errors and we do not disparage (make jarh) of anyone?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Say to them, your Salafiyyah will be not be sound whilst [holding that] no one is to be disparaged. Loving for Allaah and hating for Allaah and allegiance for Allaah and enmity for Allaah – if a person is devoid of these four matters, then that means that his Islaam is weak.</p>
<p>And the Messenger r  said: “Whomsoever amongst you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand; if he is not able, then [let him change it] with his tongue [by speaking against it with knowledge]; and if he is not able, then with his heart [by hating it for Allaah&#8217;s sake], and that is the weakest of Eemaan.”</p>
<p>The weakest of Eemaan is that you forbid falsehood with your heart. However as for the one who does not forbid falsehood with his heart, then where is the Eemaan in his heart?!!</p>
<p>Meaning that his Eemaan is weak of no benefit. And we ask Allaah for pardon and good health, and Allaah is sufficient for us and what a fine trustee He is.</p>

<p><strong>8. Question: What are the fundamentals of the Salafee da’wah and what are its principles?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The Salafee da’wah is: Calling to that which the Messengerr and his Companions (RadhiAllaahu Anhum) and those who followed them in goodness were upon, with hikmah (wisdom) and fine preachings, and arguing with that which is better, together with (the caller’s) exerting his nafs (soul) upon acting upon that which he is calling to.</p>
<p>And with Allaah is the tawfeeq. And may peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad r and his family and his Companions (RadhiAllaahu Anhum).</p>

<p><em>Question 1 from fatwa 6265 P241 Volume 12 Fataawaa of the Permanent Committee</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9. Question: Noble Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee (Rahimahullah) – we hope for a truthful clarification concerning an issue, which the students of knowledge have had much argumentation about. And it is the affair of judgement upon specific individuals.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And my question is: When is an individual to be judged that he is not from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is it merely due to him innovating a single innovation, or calling to it, or without that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Direct us to the correct statement, and may Allaah reward you with goodness.</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The praise is for Allaah, and may peace and salutations be upon the Messenger of Allaah r, upon his Family and his Companions (RadhiAllaahu Anhum). To proceed:</p>
<p>One leaves from the Sunnah by taking to an innovation from amongst the innovations, regardless of whether it is the innovation of khurooj (revolt), such as the Khawaarij, or the innovation of ta’teel (denial) of the Attributes (of Allaah), such as the Jahmiyyah and the Mu’tazilah, or ta‘weel (figurative interpretation) of them, such as the Ashaa’irah, or if he says that sins do not harm one’s Islaam, such as the Murji‘ah, or other than that from amongst the innovations.</p>
<p>So if you know of an innovation from him, then advise him about it, but if he persists in remaining upon it, then he is to be considered one who has left the Sunnah and taken to the innovation. Indeed, Muslim (Rahimahullah) (d.261H) related in the introduction to his book that Abaa ’Abdur-Rahmaan as-Sulamee (Rahimahullah) advised some of the students of knowledge in that time that they must not listen to the statement of Shaqeeq. And Shaqeeq was not Shaqeeq Ibn Salamah. And he held the view of the Khawaarij. So he (Aboo ’Abdur-Rahmaan as-Sulamee (Rahimahullah)) said that they must not listen to his speech and that they must not go to him.</p>
<p>So the apparent meaning of this is that the one whose affair has settled upon taking to an innovation and he has become known for that innovation, then it is befitting that the students of knowledge be advised against him and that they be warned against him. This is because he is considered one who has left the manhaj of Ahlus-Sunnah due to that.</p>
<p>As for when the opposition occurs in the subsidiary affairs of ijtihaad (independent reasoning), then this is not considered prohibited opposition and it does not obligate rebuke upon the opponent. It is like the one who says, “Indeed, adultery cannot be confirmed, except by a confession made four times.” And someone else says, “Indeed, it is confirmed by one confession.” And the success lies with Allaah.</p>

<p><em>Taken from al-Fataawaa al-Jaliyyah (vol. 2/p. 43-44) of Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The following three questions are part of a dialogue in which Shaykh Hammaad al-Ansaaree (Rahimahullah) makes clear who the people of the Sunnah are:</em></p>
<p><strong>10. Questioner: Who are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-jamaa’ah?</strong></p>
<p>The Shaykh: They are those that hold firmly to that which the companions were upon.</p>
<p><strong>11. Questioner: Are the Salafees Ahlus-Sunnah wal-jamaa’ah?</strong></p>
<p>The Shaykh said: Yes; As-Salafiyyah is the Sunnah and the Jamaa’ah, that is because the meaning of Salafiyyah is to hold firmly onto that which the righteous Salaf were upon in the past.</p>
<p><strong>12. Questioner: O Shaikh; the jamaa’ah of the Ikhwaan (Al-Muslimeen) and At-Tableegh – are they from Ahlus-Sunnah?</strong></p>
<p>The Shaykh said: Everyone who is upon an ideology which is contrary to Ahlus-Sunnah then they are not from them, so the jamaa’ah of the Ikhwaan (Al-Muslimeen) and At-Tableegh are not from Ahlus-Sunnah, because they are upon ideologies that are contrary to them.</p>
<p><em>Shaykh Hammaad al-Ansaaree (Rahimahullah)</em></p>
<p><em>Al-Majmoo’ fee tarjumah Hamaad Al-Ansaaree volume 2 pages 762-763</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>13. Question: We want to know what Salafiyyah is as a manhaj (path or methodology), and can we claim to belong to it? Can we criticise those who do not belong to it or who object to the word Salafi and so on?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Praise be to Allaah, the Salafis are the followers of the way of the Prophet r  and his Companions (RadhiAllaahu Anhum), because they are the ones who came before us (the Salaf) and who advanced ahead of us, so their followers are the Salafis.</p>
<p>With regard to taking Salafiyyah as a path or methodology which a person follows and regards as misguided those Muslims who differ with him, even if they are following the truth, and taking Salafiyyah as a partisan path is undoubtedly contrary to Salafiyyah. All of the Salaf or early generations called for unity and harmony around the Sunnah of the Messenger r  and did not regard as misguided those who differed with them with on the basis of their understanding and interpretation, except when it came to matters of ‘aqeedah or beliefs, because they regarded those who differed with them in these matters as misguided. But with regard to practical issues they were often easy-going.</p>
<p>But some of those who followed the path of Salafiyyah in modern times started to regard as misguided everyone who differed from them, even if that person was correct, and some of them adopted a partisan approach like that of other parties which claimed to belong to the religion of Islam. This is something that is to be denounced and cannot be approved of, and it should be said to these people: Look at the way of the righteous early generation (al-Salaf al-Saalih), what did they used to do? Look at their way and how open hearted they were in the case of differences in which ijtihaad is justified (and differences of opinion are allowed).</p>
<p>They even used to differ concerning major issues, matters of belief and practical issues. You will find some of them, for example, denying that the Messenger r  saw his Lord, whereas others say that he did see Him. You will see some of them saying that what will be weighed on the Day of Resurrection is deeds, whereas others will say that it is the books of deeds that will be weighed. You will also see them differing a great deal with regard to matters of fiqh having to do with marriage, shares of inheritance, buying and selling, and other issues. Yet despite all that they did not regard one another as misguided.</p>
<p>Salafiyyah in the sense of being a particular party with its distinguishing characteristics and in which the members regard everyone else as misguided, these people have nothing to do with Salafiyyah at all.</p>
<p>As for the Salafiyyah which means following the path of the Salaf in belief, word and deed, in calling for unity and harmony and mutual compassion and love, as the Prophet r said: “The likeness of the believers in their mutual love, mercy and compassion is that of a single body; when one part of it is suffering the rest of the body joins it in fever and staying awake”, this is the true Salafiyyah.</p>
<p><em>Shaykh Muhammad Uthaymeen(Rahimahullah)</em></p>
<p><em>Liqaa’aat al-Baab al-Maftooh, 3/246</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>14. Question: Is Salafiyyah a group from amongst the (various) groups? And is the ascription to it blameworthy?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Salafiyyah: It is the saved sect, and they are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, it is not a sect from amongst the party spirited groups that are labeled with partisanship; it is a Jamaa’ah upon the Sunnah and the Deen. He (the Prophet) sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam said: “There will not cease to be a group of my nation manifest upon the truth, not being harmed by those who abandon them, nor by those who appose them.” Reported by Muslim (no.1920)</p>
<p>He (the Prophet) said: &#8220;This Ummah will split into seventy three sects all of them in the fire except one.”. They (the Companions) asked: “What is it (the saved sect) O Messenger of Allaah?” He (the Prophet) said: “Those that are upon what I and my Companions are upon today.” Reported by at-Tirmidhee (no.2641)</p>
<p>So Salafiyyah is a group upon the methodology of the Salaf, upon that which the Messenger and his Companions were upon, that is not a sect from the party spirited sects of today. Indeed it (as-Salaffiyah) is an ancient Jamaa’ah traced back to the time of the Messenger continually inherited legacy, remaining manifest upon the truth up until the establishment of the Hour as he informed.</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>15. Question: What is your view of those who differentiate between the Salafis and Ahl al-Sunnah, and who regard the Salafis as a more specific group than Ahl al-Sunnah, and they that the principles of this group are based on the opinions of the group’s shaykhs?</strong></p>
<p>Answer:  This is not correct, because the Ahl al-Sunnah are those who follow the Sahaabah and the path of the Salaf (the early generations of Islam). These are not two distinct groups, and the Salafis are not a more specific group!</p>
<p>According to the terminology that is well known, the Salaf are the Sahaabah and those who follow their path, and the Ahl al-Sunnah are those who follow the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They are the ones concerning whom the hadeeth was reported: “Whoever follows the same path as me and my Companions” (The hadeeth about the saved group).</p>
<p>Stirring up disputes and conflict on the grounds of names alone is not permissible. Allaah has commanded the believers to be united and has forbidden them to be divided and warned them against that.</p>
<p>The individual’s aim must be to seek the truth, and when he speaks he should say what is fair and just, and not hate individuals in such a way that his hatred makes him reject the truth that the person is saying, or look for faults in him. He should not come up with things that are ambiguous or far-fetched for that purpose. This is not the way of Ahl al-Sunnah, and the Muslim has to like for his brother what he likes for himself. He must be sincere towards him, and hold love and sincerity in his heart.</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Abd-Allaah al-Ghunaymaan</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>16. Question: Is it correct that the Hanaabilah are the only Salafees? And what is the reality of as-Salafiyyah, is it associated with harshness and sternness as some people spread?</strong></p>
<p>Answer:  This is not a correct statement; for indeed the Salaf us-Saalih (the pious predecessors) are the Sahaabah may Allaah be please with them, and whosoever followed their way, from the Taabi’een and the atba’at-Taabi’een, from the Hanafees and the Maalikees and the Shaafi’ees and the Hanbalees; and other than them from those whom traversed upon the truth and adhered to the mighty Book and the pure Sunnah, in the field of tawheed and in the Names and Attributes (of Allaah) and in all the affairs of the religion. And we ask Allaah that He makes us from them. And that He gives success to all the Muslims, in their governments and in their communities in all places, to cling to the mighty Book and the Sunnah of His truthful Messenger. And that they judge by them (Book and Sunnah) and use them for final determination. And that they warn against anyone that opposes them (the Book and the Sunnah). And He is the Protector and Guardian of that and fully capable over it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>17. Question: What are some things that will keep a person firm upon Salafiyyah and distant from the paths of misguidance?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: There are a number of affairs that will help someone in this.</p>
<p>From them:</p>
[1] Staying close to the people of knowledge, those who are known for:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">[a] their capabilities;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">[b] being foremost in virtues;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">[c] being well versed in knowledge;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">[d] their strength in (knowledge of) the Sunnah;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">[e] their adherence to it;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">[f] their harshness against the people of desires.</p>
<p>It is suitable that they are the ones to take (knowledge) from, the knowledge that is paired with wisdom.</p>
[2] Staying distant from the people of innovation and desires, keeping away from their gatherings, and not subjecting oneself to their debating and argumentation.</p>
[3] Reading the books authored by the Salaf, reading them with the scholars if that is possible. If that is not possible, then asking about the phrases or subjects which are difficult to understand within these Salafee books, asking the people of knowledge about them, so they can clarify any misunderstandings one encounters.</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Ubayd al-Jaabiree</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>18. Question: What do you say to those who do not acknowledge (for whatever reason) the scholars of today such as shaikh Uthaymeen, shaykh bin Baaz raheemahullah, shaykh Al-Albaani raheemahullah?</strong></p>
<p>A few call them wahabi and say that these scholars follow a new sect rather than the universal deen of al-Islam that was followed by all the major scholars of the past.</p>
<p>Answer: Praise be to Allaah, the Muslim is obliged to accept the teachings of Islam, and act upon them. When he hears of some word or deed which is based on evidence (daleel) from the Qur’aan or Sunnah, then he has to accept it and give it priority over anything else. He should check what people say against the evidence of sharee’ah, and only accept those views which are in accordance with that evidence.</p>
<p>It is known that Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on him) called people to Tawheed and he wrote his famous book on that topic which is called Kitaab al-Tawheed. In this book he limited himself to quoting only the clear evidence from the verses of the Qur’aan and the saheeh ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Commentaries on this book were written by his grandson ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan and other scholars. Hence none of his opponents can refute this book or claim that his evidence is false. They fabricated lies and believed them, so they believed that he was misguided.</p>
<p>They gave the same label to the scholars of the Muslims such as Shaykh Ibn Baaz and Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on them both). It is known that the shaykhs whom we have mentioned did not deviate from the correct view with regard to beliefs and actions; they followed the same path as the Sahaabah and Taabi’een, the four imaams, the authors of the Six Books and others.</p>
<p>Those who do not acknowledge them do that either out of ignorance, blind imitation of others, jealousy, stubbornness or following their own whims and desires, or adherence to traditions, bid’ah (innovation) and evil actions that go against the evidence (of sharee’ah).</p>
<p>Earlier and later scholars have proven such people to be wrong. So we must follow the evidence and give it priority over the views of all people.</p>
