				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">PART 2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already talked about the varying opinions of the scholars of Islaam in relation to the actual birth date of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in Part 1 so,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The well known expert of astronomy from Egypt, Mr Mahmood Pashaa has established the following points in his book,<em>‘at-Taqweem al-Arabee Qabl al-Islaam Waa Taareekh Milaad ar-Rasool Waa Hijrati’</em> based on his mathematical findings as well as numerous other factors. He said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“On the basis and in light of the event of the Elephants (of the army of Abraha) occurring on the Monday in the month of Rabee ul-Awwal and also on the basis of the Solar eclipse that occurred at the time of the death of the Prophets (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) son, Ibraahim, the Prophets correct birth date corresponds to the 9<sup>th</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal. With regards to the Christian Gregorian calendar this correlates to 20<sup>th</sup> of April 571ce which was on a Monday morning.”</em>(Hadaa’iq al-Anwaar (1/29) printed with ‘at-Taqweem al-Arabee (pg.36-39)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Mahmood Pashas research is spread over a number of pages and this can be summarised as follows</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) The Saheeh of Imaam Bukhaari mentions at the time of the death of the younger son of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) there was a solar eclipse. This solar eclipse occurred in the year 10 Hijree and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) at the time was 63 years old.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(2) Using the principles of mathematics and calculating the time of the solar eclipse that occurred in 10 Hijree, this corresponds to the 7<sup>th</sup> of January 632ce at approximately 8.30 in the morning.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(3) This calculation also establishes that if we subtracts these 63 lunar years (from 632ce) we get 571ce which in specific relates to the 12<sup>th</sup> of April, which in turn correlates to the 1<sup>st</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(4) There are differences of opinion relating to the birth date of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) however what is universally agreed upon is that it was on a Monday in the Islamic month of Rabee ul-Awwal and this date is restricted between the 8<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(5) In the month of Rabee ul-Awwal (in the year 571ce), Monday only falls on the 9<sup>th</sup> between these restricted dates ie between the 8<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup>. So on this basis the birth date seems to be unequivocally on the 20<sup>th</sup> of April 571ce corresponding to the 9<sup>th</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal 632H. Furthermore although the report of 12<sup>th</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal is culturally famous it is not by any means correctly established via the appropriate calculations. (cited from Seeatun-Nabee (1/171-172) of Shiblee)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find from the aforementioned discussion and details that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) was not born on the 12<sup>th</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal, rather what is correct is that he was born on the 9<sup>th</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal. Yet, what we do find and what we known is correct is that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) passed away on the 12<sup>th</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal which is well documented in the books of History and Biographies and this is not the place for such details or discussion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At this instance our intention is just to mention the day our brothers allegedly celebrate the birth day of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) is not the day of his birthday but in actual fact it is really the day that he died. The 12<sup>th</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal is generally famously known as the date of the demise of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) so then we must pose and ask the question what is all this happiness and celebrations on the day that he died? May Allaah the most High grant us understanding and comprehension. Ameen</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>From his book </em><em>‘Celebrating Milaad On the Day Of Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) Died’ (pg.12-14)</em> </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Part 1<span id="more-1314"></span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Traditionally 12<sup>th</sup> Rabee u-Awwal is considered to be the Day of the Birth of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wassallam) and this is the day the soofee and bareilwees gather to indulge in this innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However from a historical perspective this seems to be an incorrect day and the scholars of Islaam have differed as to the day the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) was born.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Seerah of Ibn Ishaaq mentions the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wassalam) was born in the year of the elephant ie when the army of Abraha attacked the Kab’ah which was compromised of elephants thereby incurring Allaahs anger. (with a good chain from Ibn Ishaaq as was said by Shaikh Abdur Rahmaan al-Banna in his Fath ar-Rabbaanee (20/190)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Suhailee mentions, “Elephants came to Makkah in the month of Muharram and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) was born 50 days after this event.” This also seems to be the opinion of the majority of the scholars according to Imaam Suhailee and Muhammad ibn Ishaaq. (Fath ar-Rabbaanee (20/190)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous historian Haafidh Ibn Katheer writes in his well known book of history, <em>al-Bidaayah Wan-Nihaayah</em> that the majority of the people of knowledge believe the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wassalam) was born in the month of Rabee u-Awwal however there are varying statements pertaining to the exact date, whether this was in the beginning of the month, at the end or during the middle. Some have opined 2<sup>nd</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal, some have said 8<sup>th</sup>Rabee ul-Awwal, some have said 10<sup>th</sup>, some have said the 17<sup>th</sup>, some have said the 18<sup>th</sup>, and some have even said the 21<sup>st</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal. The dates that have precedence are the 8<sup>th</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal and the 12<sup>th</sup>of Rabee ul-Awwal. Haafidh Ibn Katheer himself has given precedence to the 8<sup>th</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal. This is also what Imaam Humaidee has transmitted from Imaam Ibn Hazm and many other scholars have also supported this date. (al-Bidaayah Wan-Nihaayah (2/259-262) of Ibn Katheer)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Tabaree and Ibn Khaldoon have favoured 12<sup>th</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal (cited from Allaamah Qadhee Suleimaan Mansoorpoorees book, <em>Rehmatul Lil-A’alameen</em> (1/40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn al-Jawzee has favoured the opinion that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wassalams) date of birth was on the 10<sup>th </sup>of Rabee ul-Awwal in his book <em>‘al-wafaa Bi-Ahwaal al-Mustafaa’ </em>(1/154).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In recent years 2 well known biographers ie Allaamah Qadhee Suleimaan Mansoorpooree in his <em>Rehmatul Lil-A’alameen</em>and Allaamah Shiblee in his <em>Seeratun-Nabee</em>, both opined the date of the birth of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wassalam) was on the 9<sup>th</sup> of Rabee ul-Awwal corresponding to 20<sup>th</sup> April 571 ce (Shiblees <em>Seeratun-Nabee </em>(1/171), Allaamah Qaadhee Suleimaan Mansoorpoorees <em>Rehmatul Lil-A’alameen</em> (1/40).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same date has been endorsed to be correct by Muhammad Tala’at in <em>‘Taareekh Duwal al-Arab’</em> (cited from Qaadhee Suleimaan Mansoorpoorees Rehmatul Lil-A’alameen (1/40) footnotes and (2/367) and also refer to Muhammad <em>al-Qudwah al-Kaamilah</em> (pg.7)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(From <em>‘Celebrating Milaad On the Day Of Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) Demise’</em> of Shaikh Muhammad Munir Qammar with slight adaptation (pgs. 11-12)</span></p>
