<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">READ PART 38</span> &#8211; </span><a href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-38-mawlid-beginnings-historical-origins-rafidhi-fatimids/"><span style="color: #008000;">Mawlid Beginnings &amp; Historical Origins – Rafidhi Fatimids</span></a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Th historians differ greatly as to when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born ie the exact date however most of them opine it was the 9th of Rabī Al-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Sa‘īd Muzaffar Kaukabūrī was himself unsure of the exact date of the Mawlid due to the difference of opinion, he Kawkaburi, who was considered the chief Mawlid innovator, would celebrate the Mawlid on the 8th of Rabi ul-Awwal in one year and on the 12th the following year. (al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah 1:552)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Dahiyyah, the one who wrote one of the earliest books promoting the Mawlid, was of the opinion the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 8th of Rabi ul-Awwal and he refutes the notion of it being the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal (<em>al-Tanwir Fi Mawlid al-Bashir wal-Nazir from al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah</em> 2:260)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Dahiyyah also mention the 17th of Rabi ul-Awwal as another potential birth date (<em>al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah</em> 2:260)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is strange how the Barelwis use Imam Ibn Kathirs al-Bidayah to support their views in other things but in such instances they turn a blind eye to such remarks and research. The likes of Saqid Shami are happy to use Ibn Kathir on Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and his alleged book on the Mawlid, so we are we using here too?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The founder of Baraliwism Ahmad Raza Khān said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 12th of Rabī Al-Awwal and he died on the same day.&#8221;</em> (Malfūzāt 2:220)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Qādir Jilānī said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Prophet ﷺ was born on the 10th of Muharram.&#8221;</em> (<em>Ghuniyyah al-Tālibīn</em> 2:392).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan said about Shaikh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The illustrious son and descendant of the Glorious Prophet ﷺ and the true representative and inheritor of Prophetic Bounties, the great Ghawth Shaykh Sayyid ‘Abd al-Qadir Jilani (d 561/1164) states: ‘I see all the cities of Allah as I see a mustard seed in the centre of my palm.’ The Grand Ghawth also states: ‘The pupil of my eye is set on the Luhe-Mahfuz.&#8221;</em> (Malfuzat 1:35-36, Barelwi translation)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is deception at its highest level, on one hand they have this belief about Abdul Qadir al-Jilnai while at the same time reject his view regarding the birth date and hence the Mawlid. The conclusion, Ahmad Raza was categorically lying when he made this statement about Shaykh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another Barelwi writer, Muhammad Umim Ehsan al-Mujaddadi al-Barkati said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on a Monday in the year of the Elephant, either on the 8th, 9th or the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Awjaz al-Siyar Mulhiq Bi-Mishkat al-Masabih</em> 1:586)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdul Haq Dehlawi also mentions the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal being the birth date of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ (<em>Ma Thabt Bil-Sunnah</em> p.288, <em>Madarij al-Nabuwwah</em> 2:23)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qādi Muhammad Suleimān Mansūrpūrī said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Prophet ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī Al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant, corresponding to 22nd April 571ce, corresponding to the 1st Jith 628 Bikrami in Makkah in the early morning before sunrise. &#8220;</em> (<em>Rehmah Al-Alamīn</em> p.40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The historians have differed with regards to the birth date, Tabari and Ibn Khaldun said the 12th, Abu Fida said the 10th. However all are agreed the Monday (of the birth) on that year corresponds to the 9th and this is why the 9th of Rabi ul-Awwal seems to be most accurate date of birth.&#8221;</em> (<em>Rehmah Al-Alamīn</em> p.40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Suleimān Nadwī said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;As regards to the birth of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ Egypt&#8217;s Mahmūd Pashā the astronomer authored a treatise in which he proved mathematically that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 9th Rabī Al-Awwal corresponding to 20th April 571ce.&#8221;</em> (<em style="color: #000000;">Sirah al-Nabī</em> 1:171)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Indian historian Akbar Shah Najibabadi said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant corresponding to the 40th gathering of Kisrah Naushirwan corresponding to the 22th April 571ce in the morning before sunrise.&#8221;</em> <em style="color: #000000;">(Tārīkh Al-Islām</em> 1:76)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The leader of the Sufi&#8217;s, Yusuf bin Ismail Nabahani said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;And what is famous and well known and what the majority (of the scholars) are agreed upon is that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Hujjatullah Alal A&#8217;lamin</em> p.231)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Deobandi church father, Ashraf Ali Thanwi has also mentioned a difference of opinion with regards to the exact birth date. (<em>Nashr al-Tayyib</em> p.28)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of the well known scholars were of the view that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal. Imam Nawawi mentioned,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away on the Monday morning on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal after the 12th year after the Hijra.&#8221;</em> (<em>Taqrib Ala Ibn Salah</em> 2:251)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti, who is revered by the proponents of the Mawlid because of his generic reverence of the birth of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, said in explanation of the words of Imam Nawawi,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The majority (of the scholars) are upon what the author (i.e. Imam Nawawi) mentioned, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tadrib al-Rawi Sharh Tarib al-Nawaw</em>i 2:51)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Tal&#8217;at, the author of <em>Tarikh Dawal al-Arab wal-Islam</em> was also of the view the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabi ul-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdur Rahman Mubrakpuri in his <em>Tuhfa</em> brings the statement of Hafiz Ibn al-Jawzi from his <em>al-Tanqih</em> in which he says,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;They are agreed the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the Monday in the year of the elephant in the month of Rabi ul-Awwal, however, they differ with regards to the exact date of the month and there are four views, (1) 2nd Rabi ul-Awwal, (2) 8th Rabi ul-Awwal, (3) 10th Rabi ul-Awwal and the (4) 12th Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tuhfa al-Ahwadhi Sharh Tirmidhi</em> 4:295)</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>READ THE LAST PART</strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #008000;"><a style="color: #008000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-35-part-c-shaikh-al-islam-ibn-taymiyyah-728h-demolishing-the-bidah-of-mawlid-what-did-he-really-say/">The Mawlid Papers &#8211; Part 35</a></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s also known as Raza Khani&#8217;s, in a desperate attempt to salvage some misdirected credibility organised a lecture in Luton on Sunday 26th November 2017 at Luton Central Mosque. This was undoubtedly organised in spite of the lecture the Salafi&#8217;s of Luton had scheduled on the same day at Luton Islamic Centre titled &#8216;Mawlid un Nabi &#8211; To Celebrate or Not&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Raza Khani Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s in anger scheduled a lecture titled, &#8216;Mawlid &#8211; Fact not Fiction&#8217; and they invited none other than a disgraced and shambled speaker, who in the past year had been remorsefully recovering from a severe and dismal defeat in a debate. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The deluded individual had duped himself and his ardent blind followers in thinking they could use divine texts revealed by Allah, to justify and evidence the worship and calling upon other than Allah, It did not make any sense to any mature, sensible and sane individual to even think you could use the words of the creator and the words of his chosen Messenger of Allah ﷺ to prove calling upon others, but how can you help those who refuse to think and ponder? We are talking about none other than the Barelwi Sufi Asrar Rashid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same individual in other lectures refers to us, i.e. Salafis as Pseudo Salafis as if this was some kind of obscene swear or a derogatory remark, which will have the desired affect of defamation or degradation. However it does and will have repercussions, and that is we will aptly and happily refer to these Barelwi Sufis as Raza Khani&#8217;s i.e. on the Religion of Ahmad Raza, Rida, Riddah or whatever the Riz Raz Khan he was. Likewise and similarly do not be squeamish or be remotely offended when we start referring to you as Lahabi&#8217;s!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Perhaps, inshAllah we can analyse the lecture itself at a different time but what we found most repugnant was the title of &#8216;Fact not Fiction,&#8217; implying the celebrating of the Mawlid is a something factual, which is obviously ludicrously insane because the Mawlid is a clear, manifest and absolute innovation, a Bid&#8217;ah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What we would like to do, is to see whether the Mawlid is factual or  actually a fiction based on the statements of the Sufi Barelwi Raza Khani&#8217;s Church fathers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You can often hear Asrar Rashid venerating and praising his Barelwi church father, Ahmad Rida Khan in numerous videos and in this regards holds him high esteem and respect. The same Ahmad Raza Khan himself declared the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal to be the day the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died. He said the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born and also died on 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal <em>(Malfuzat 2:220).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask these Mawlid lovers, are you astagfirullah celebrating the birth or death of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ!!! Now let the average Barelwi adherent and sympathiser claim he is celebrating the death of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, this is indeed from the evil tricks of the cursed  Ibis and the shayatin from amongst men. Is this what you call Mawlid &#8211; Fact not fiction, Astagfiruallh!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the problem, that these people do not for a moment think logically with their brains which Allah, from his mercy and blessings bestowed upon them. for how long will you remain ignorant and hide behind those to feign knowledge of the sacred sciences, there is no excuse, and fear the day when your leaders and guides will be exposed for taking you away from the Quran and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Barailwi author and defender of the Mawlid, Abdul-Sam&#8217;i Rampuri clearly says the Mawlid gatherings were conducted in the sixth (6th) century of Islam, he says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Mawlid gatherings which were organised at the end of the sixth (6th) century were considered to be good by the scholars and honourable people.&#8221;</em> <em>(Anwar Sati&#8217;a Dar Bayan Mawlud  wa Fatihah p.50)</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdul Sam&#8217;i Rampuri went onto say</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The selling of goods and products (related to Milad &#8211;  i.e. christmas milad trees, milad cakes, milad lights and HALWA) and with it being specific to the month of Rabi ul-Awwal and then further restricting and designating the 12th day for Milad was practised in later times i.e. at the end of the Sixth (6th) century.&#8221;</em> <em>(Anwar Sati&#8217;a p.159)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There was no Mawlid or a third Eīd during the first centuries of Islam, including the era of the companions, the Tabi&#8217;in and the Atba Tabi&#8217;in, ie the first three generations, what we abbreviate to the Salaf us-Saleh, nor during the period of the great Imāms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Barailwi defender and Churchfather Ahmad Yar Naeemi cites the view of Hafiz al-Sakhawi via the statement of Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Haithami who said (i.e. al-Sakhawi) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Milād was not celebrated by anyone in the first three generations, it was introduced (innovated) later on.&#8221;</em> <em>(Ja&#8217;a al-Haq 1:235)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another Sufi Barelwi church father, Didar Ali, who is held with great esteem also acknowledged and affirmed there was no evidence for Mawlid during the first generation and the Salaf us-Salihin was in fact introduced (innovated/fabricated) later. <em>(Rasul al-Kalam Fi Bayan al-Mawlid wal-Qiyam p.15)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Barailwi Sūfī Hadith explainer, Ghulam Rasool Saeedi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I say: the Salaf us-Salihin meaning the Sahabah and the Tabi&#8217;in did not practise or organise Milad gatherings, and this is correct, however neither did the Sahabah or Tabi&#8217;in prohibit it&#8221;</em> <em>(Sharh Sahih Muslim 3:179)</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Sharh Sahih Muslim 3:179)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The intent here is to show the Mawlid was not practised in the first three blessed generations i.e.  during the time of the companions, successors and their successors i.e. the Salaf us-Saleh. When not a single one of them practised the Mawlid, it shows they were unanimous in its prohibition and that it was an alien concept, so Ghulam Rasool Saeedis assertion they did not prohibit it, is  a very lame and poor line of argument.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, this shows none of the other Sahabah or Tabi&#8217;in practised the Mawlid, because if they had they would been warned and prohibited from doing so by the other Sahabah and Tabi&#8217;in, therefore the last part of the statement of Ghulam Rasool Saeedi is a proof for us. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sahabah and Tabi&#8217;in would not have needed to warn from the Mawlid because they had been instructed by the Messenger of Allah ﷺ not to exaggerate in praise of him like the christians did with Isa Alayhis Salam and they were people who follow the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in totality without following their whims and desires like the Sufi Barelwis do.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Who is Ghulam Rasool Saeedi, well he is someone who the Sufi Barelwis revere due to his knowledge of hadith, he is well respected and has a venerable position with them. He cites an important principle which the sufi Barailwis abhorrently desecrate, he said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;In this regard the correct principle is that any specific act of worship that is to be practised, and there are no preventative factors and despite this the Messenger of Allah ﷺ deliberately abandoned it, then performing such an act is indeed with certainly impermissible and an act of innovation (bid&#8217;ah).&#8221;</em> <em>(Sharh Sahih Muslim 2:545)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, this is the FACT Asrar Rashid and his Barelwi sect would like you to believe, knowing very well their scholars and church fathers were agreed the Mawlid was not celebrated or practised during the first three blessed generations i.e. the Salaf us-Salihun as Asrar Rashid often says. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The real FACT is, the Salaf us-Saleh, the Sahabah, Tabi&#8217;in and Atba Tabi&#8217;in did not celebrate the Mawlid so stop following yourselves and misguiding others.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">&#8216;Ala Hazrat&#8217; Ahmad Raza Khan al-Barelwi</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The barelwi writer Muhammad Faiz Ahmad Owais writes in one place,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Imam Ahmad Raza Khan was an enemy of the british..&#8221;</em> (Ala Hazrat Ka Salmi Jihad &#8211; <em>The Jihad of the Pen of Ala Hazrat </em>p.8)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He further said,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;He hated the British with a passion and the british rule.&#8221; </em>(Ala Hazrat Ka Salmi Jihad &#8211; <em>The Jihad of the Pen of Ala Hazrat </em>p.10)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Syed Altaf Ali Barelvi has expressed his viewpoint as under:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“Politically speaking, Imam Ahmed Raza believed in complete independence and perfect freedom. He was deadly against the British and the British rule.&#8221;</em> ( The Daily Jung, Karachi dated 25.1.79. p-6)
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another Bareilwi research, Muhammad Masud Ahmad writes,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Imam Ahmed Raza was also against the British regime.&#8221;</em> (Gunah Be Gunah p.17)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">he also said</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Imam Ahmed Raza’s son, Maulana Hamid Raza Khan also hated the British Government. &#8220;</em> (Gunah Be Gunah p.18)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahmad Raza Khan and his family were also against what we would call nowadays, british values. Muhammad Masud Ahmad writes,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Maulana Hamid Raza Khan, the son of Maulana Ahmed Raza Khan criticized British civilization and culture in his presidential address at Muradabad. The forth right criticism of the British civilization and culture which he made in course of his inaugural address at Muradabad, 1925 merits our attention and must be studied. He said at the All India Sunni Conference held at Muradabad from 20th to 23rd Shaban, 1343 A.H/l6th to 19th March, 1925,&#8221;</em> (Gunah Be Gunah p. 20)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad Masud Ahmad further writes,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Imam Ahmed Raza went in 1337 A.H./1919 A, D to Jabalpur on the invitation of Maulana Abdul Salam. It should be noted that it was the year when Khilafat Movement had started and there was opposition to the British Indian Government on a large scale. During his sojourn at Jabalpur, Imam Ahmed Raza used to go for sight-seeing off and on. Mufti Muhammad Burhanul Haque Jabalpuri (son of Maulana Abdul Salam) who is more than ninety years old now, writes: </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“One day after Asr Prayer the Maulana went on buggy for sight-seeing towards Guncarriage factory. A group of British military soldiers was going from the factory to their quarters. On seeing them, Ala Hadrat said, “The wretch, they are completely monkeys.” (Gunah Be Gunah p.24), Ikram Imam Ahmed Raza</em> (Gunah Be Gunah p.91)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">he further says,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;From the foregoing evidence and facts, it is clear that Imam Ahmed Raza was neither a well-wisher of the British, nor liked or loved anything English i.e., their regime, civilization and culture, education system, their ideas and faces.</em> (Gunah Be Gunah p.25)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many other statement from Ahmad Raza Khan and his view of the british, it would take many parts to address all of the issues but suffice it to say the origins of extremist and disruption to british society comes from the teachings of Ahmad Raza Khan. One can consult the book of Muhammad Masud Khan Gunah Be Ghunah and how he highlights the view of Ahmad Raza Khan and his opposition to the sanctity of society in the UK. This is another answer to the so called Henry Jackson Society who have been playing hide and seek with the truth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Raza Ali Khan and Naqi Ali Khan (The grandfather and father of Ahmad Raza Khan, respectively)</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us look at the father of Ahmad Raza Khan, Naqi Ali Khan and his views. He was of course an ardent Sufi and had ijazah from the infamous Zaini Dahlan (see al-Ijazat al-Mutayinah p.67, Usul al-rashad liqamah mabani al-fasad p.19)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">a baralvi researcher, Muhammad Hanif Khn Rizvi Barelvi, writes in the introduction to one of Naqi Ali Khan&#8217;s book,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>&#8220;He despised the british rule and always opposed the british all his life. He continued efforts in uprooting british rule and pushed his efforts in writing to liberate the motherland from british rulership. In this regard Chanda Shah Hussaini writes, &#8220;Mawlana Raza Ali Khan had become famous for his Jihad against the british with his speech and pen, the british feared the efforts and fervour of the Mawlana. His son, Mawlana Naqi Ali Khan was also active in jihad against the britishers and the Mawlana had a high status amongst the scholars, furthermore, in this regard he had extensive and virtuous efforts against the british.&#8221;</em> (Shams al-Tawarikh, Usul al-rashad liqamah mabani al-fasad p.22)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">In order to expel the british out of India, the scholars of India formulated a Jihad Committee and issued a Fatwa of Jihad against the britishers and their rule. At the head and the first and foremost who issued the fatwa was Mawlana Raza Ali Khan, (a few other names) and Mawlana Naqi Ali Khan&#8230;&#8221; (Mish&#8217;al Rah &#8211; The Story of the Brtish Oppressors by Abd al-Hakim Akhtar Shahjanapuri, First chapter, the affect of the Clashes of 1857c p.126, Usul al-rashad liqamah mabani al-fasad p.23)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Mawlana Naqi Ali Khan would send horses to the mujahidin, who were wajing jihad against the british. In his speeches and sermons he would incite the people to wage war and jihad against the british. The people of Bareli were successful in their jihad against the british, who had to flee Bareli without choice. (Hayat Mufti Azam, Usul al-rashad liqamah mabani al-fasad p.23) </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course we are not here to debate and scrutinise the realities of these claims and how accurate they are based on historical records, but the point is how have the Sufi Barelvis of England overlooked the views and positions of the Sufi Barelwi elders and Churchfathers. On one hand we have the calamitous absurdities one could ever put on paper i.e. the dismantled report from the Henry Jackson society, who not only were falling short on payday but are also a shamble to academic research, who raised fallacious allegations against Ahl al-Sunnah, while on the other hand they outrightly ignored historical facts embodied within the Sufi Barelwi renegades. These people have places of worship in their droves in the United Kingdom and they preach the same points as their forefathers did, so why are the likes of Henry Jackson society silent on such findings?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well this obviously leaves us with two possible realities which are perhaps closest to the truth, 1. The Henry Jackson Society are either intellectually challenged and have the most despicably shoddiest research on the face of this planet or 2. They act as a front for the neo-con and new world oder agenda. The fact of the matter and reality dictates that both are true in synchrony, we will inshAllah address their disastrous culminations at a later date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We find dear readers, on on hand these Sufi Barelwis hurl allegations against the &#8216;Wahhabis&#8217; and Saudi Arabia while their on forefathers were at the forefront of Terrorism and extremism against the britisher rule. The irony and the most funny thing about these treacherous lying individuals is that they promote these teachings behind closed door in private gatherings and circles and then show another face of peace their with placards of peace and unity to the british public. We are in no doubt if these people had any real power and authority they would take active physical steps  against the Salafi&#8217;s and Ah al-Hadith.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Taken from: <strong><span style="color: #000080;">al-Barelwiyyah; Their History and Beliefs Volume 2, <em>Expounding The Belief of the Pious Ancestors and Ahl al-Sunnah w’al Jama’ah</em><em> </em><em>&amp; </em><em>What Opposes it from the Wicked Deviation of the Barelwi Renegades</em></span></strong></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Historical Overview &#8211; Sufi Barelwi Renegades &amp; Their Origins in Extreme Terror and Kharijism; The Barelwi Ancestry and Lineage</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We begin by looking at the Barelwi Ash’arite and Sufi Churchfathers and their affect on the muslim society. It is common knowledge and a specific and particular hallmark of the Barelwi underlings and global sufi sympathisers that the Saudi Wahabis are government funded, they rebel and murder people, Khawarij and all sorts of fallacious delusional points.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will show how the Barelwi forefathers were themselves upon the methodology of killing innocent Muslims and how they colluded against the Muslims. We will also show how some of them were renegades themselves,  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the lineage of Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Naqi Ali Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Raza Ali Khan son of  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Kazim Ali Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Azam Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’adat Yar Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’idullah Khan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Zafar al-Din Qadri Bihari, <em>Hayat A’la Hazrat</em>, (Karachi: Maqtabah Rizviyya, 1:2 Muhammad Sabir al-Qadiri Nasim al-Bastawi, <em>Ahwal wa Athar Hazrat Mujaddid Islam</em> (Lahore: Raza Academy, 1998) p.34 </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Sa’idullah Khan</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He hailed from Kandahar which in present day Afghanistan, he was a pathan belonging to the Barech tribe. He eventually migrated to Lahore with Sultan Muhammad Nadir Shah as part of his war expeditions. He was given prestigious and high ranking positions within Nadir Shahs Safavid Dynasty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then moved to Delhi whilst he was minister of a department. He received the accolade and title of ‘Bravery of war,’ an official title from the Ruler, ie Muhammad Nadir Shah for his bravery and ardent loyalty (Muhammad Sabir al-Qadiri Nasim al-Bastawi, <em>Ahwal wa Athar Hazrat Mujaddid Islam</em>, p.34) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Nadir Shah (d.1747) was the ruler or Iran of the Safavid Dynasty and had the title The Shah of Iran. He was, naturally of Iranian descent belonging to the Afshar tribe hailing from Khurasan. He was born a Shi’i as an Itha Ashari and was an ardent follower of the Jafari school of thought. Due to the political turmoil at the time he would often say to people he was also sunni in order to keep his cohorts to support him and also to keep the opposing Ottoman empire from fighting him. In fact, numerous people serving and working with him failed to highlight whether he was sunni or shi’i, such was his deception</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He attempted to mix the two and made his own madhab called the jafari madhab so that the ottomans would accept him. His aim was to allow the persians to perform Hajj which was under Ottoman control and administration, and his only aim behind this was to make this a revenue stream. (Michael Axworthy&#8217;s, <em>The Sword of Persia</em> (I.B. Tauris, 2006), Tucker, Ernest, &#8220;Nadir Shah and the Ja&#8217;fari Mazhab reconsidered&#8221;, in <em>Iranian Studies</em>, vol. 27, 1-4 (1994), pp,163-179.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He continued to fight for the Safavid dynasty which was in decline at the period and thus Nadir Shah seized the opportunity to launch his own house. Nadir Shah continued to lead numerous military expeditions throughout the lands, which he was successful in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the time Ghilzai Afghans had control of the southeast regions, namely Kandahar. This was later controlled by the Hotaki dynasty. Nadir Shah defeated the Hotaki dynasty in approximately 1738 and took control of Kandahar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is where Sa’idullah Khan joined Nadir Shah and became a part of his dynasty war campaign for domination. Nadir Shah then went onto fight the Mughals and their empire and in the process captured cities like Ghazni, Kabul, Peshawar, parts of Sindh and Lahore.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Nadir Shah’s history and campaign were a far cry from innocence, one only needs to read the annals of history and they will come to know the wicked and evil nature of his deviation, theologically and socially.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The aim is not to present a reading into the evil actions of certain individuals or a history lesson but to show if one makes erroneous and fabricated claims against Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and al-Saud family, the closet will yield some home truths! (For further reading on the generosity and life of Muhammad Nadir Shah Read, Michael Axworthy&#8217;s, <em>The Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from Tribal Warrior to Conquering Tyrant</em>. (I.B. Tauris, 2006), Ernest Tucker, <em>Nadir Shah&#8217;s Quest for Legitimacy in Post-Safavid Iran</em> (Florida, University Press, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the likes of whom the forefathers of Ahmad Raza Khan colluded with, to cause havoc and rampage in muslim territories, the atrocities, genocide, pillaging land, and philandering of wealth and woman of unprecedented levels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to ask the barelwi sympathisers what do they make of the claim, which they often hurl at Ahl al-Sunnah, petrol dollars, the illegal al-Saud state, corroborating with the British, killing innocent muslims, mass murdering and declaring Muslims to be disbelievers. Of course this is sheer nonsense which has been answered in great detail, however the ignorant wandering mind will always have difficulty focusing on the truth and facts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This said, Barelwi Sufi narrow mindedness and genius level of reasoning fails to see and acknowledge how the forefathers of their Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan were part of such acts which were absolutely heinous and catastrophically evil.  </span></p>
