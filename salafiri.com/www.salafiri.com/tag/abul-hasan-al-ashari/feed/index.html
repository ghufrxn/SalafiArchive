				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<h3><span style="color: #000080">Hadith No. 7443</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Yusuf bin Musa narrated to me: Abu Usamah narrated to me from Al-A&#8217;mash, from Khaythamah, from &#8216;Adiy bin Hatim who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;There is none amongst you except that his Rabb will speak to him, there will be no interpreter between them nor a veil to veil Him.&#8221; </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left">
<h3 style="text-align: left"><span style="color: #000080">Explanation of Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him)</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">And in this Hadith is a refutation of those that speak with &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217;¹, and its meaning is that Allah will introduce speech (yuhdithu al-qawl) in that Hour, He speaks to the one who is alone with him in that Hour, and those that speak with &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217; (i.e., the Asha&#8217;irah) say: &#8220;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi is eternal, however, Allah creates sounds when He wishes for someone to hear, and it is an expression from Al-Kalam An-Nafsi.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And on account of this, some of the intelligent said: The Madhab of the Asha&#8217;irah regarding the Speech [of Allah] is the Madhab of the Jahmiyyah, rather it is even worse! For verily they say that which is heard [in recitation] and that which is written in the Masahif is created, and it is [nothing more than] an expression from the [true] Speech of Allah, and as for the Speech of Allah then it is that which is in His Self, it is not heard and He does not speak when He wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the Jahmiyyah, then they said, &#8220;That which is heard is the Speech of Allah in reality, however it is created.&#8221; So who is closer to that which is correct? The Jahmiyyah, and this is the reason they said, &#8216;The speech of the Asha&#8217;irah regarding the Speech [of Allah] is worse than the speech of the Jahmiyyah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the reality of the matter, then there is no difference between them and the Jahmiyyah, for verily they are in agreement that what was heard by Muhammad ﷺ, and what was heard by Musa (Peace be upon him), and what will be heard in the future is all created. But the Asha&#8217;irah say that is an &#8216;Ibarah (Expression)² from Al-Kalam An-Nafsi, and these people say: &#8220;No! Rather it (the Speech of Allah) is a creation that He created, He created sounds which are heard, and He attributed them to His Self as a way of honouring and venerating.&#8221; &#8211; So this Hadith clearly refutes those that claim that the Speech of Allah is [just] the Meaning established eternally within His Self, and they have narrated that the Speech [of Allah] is like [His] Knowledge or [His] Will.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>(Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin, Sharh Kitab At-Tawhid min Sahih Al-Bukhari p. 437, 438,<br />
Dar Al-Kalim At-Tayyib, 1st Edn.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Translators Notes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>&#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi:&#8217; </strong>The Asha&#8217;irah reject that Allah has volitional actions (actions tied to His will), and this led to their belief in &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217;, the corrupt belief that Allah does not speak, rather the &#8216;Speech (Kalam)&#8217; is merely a single indivisible meaning which is established in His Essence &#8211; as for the Qur&#8217;an that we have with us which is written in the Mushaf and memorised by all Muslims, then it is <strong>created</strong> and merely an &#8216;Expression (&#8216;Ibarah)&#8217; of the Meaning which subsists within the Essence of Allah. Some went as far as claiming the Qur&#8217;an we have with us is the speech of Jibreel (Peace be upon him), rather than the Speech of Allah! Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;The Ash&#8217;ariyyah say: What is in the Mushaf is not the Speech of Allah, rather it is an &#8216;Ibarah (Expression) from Him [&#8230;] and these letters which are in the Qur&#8217;an, and the sounds which the Messenger heard, or Jibreel heard, verily it is created.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sharh Fath Al-Bariyyah bi-Talkhis Al-Hamawiyyah p. 314)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Madhab of Ahlus-Sunnah regarding the Speech of Allah: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu &#8216;Uthman As-Sabuni said, &#8220;And the Ahlul-Hadith testify and believe that the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah and His Book, and His Revelation, and that which He revealed is uncreated, and whoever speaks with its creation (i.e., that the Qur&#8217;an is created) and believes in it is a Kafir according to them.&#8221; <em>(Aqidatu&#8217;s Salaf wa Ashabu&#8217;l Hadith p. 165, Dar Al-&#8216;Asimah)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Muhammad bin Isma&#8217;il Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;I met more than 1000 men from the People of Knowledge: [From] the People of Hijaz, and Makkah, and Madinah, and Kufa, and Basrah, and Wasit, and Baghdad, and Sham (Levantine Region), and Misr (Egypt) [&#8230;] and I did not see one of them differ on these matters: [&#8230;] and that the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah, uncreated&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad of Imam Al-Lalaka&#8217;i 1/273-274, Dar Al-Lu&#8217;lua)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Abu Zur&#8217;ah and Abu Hatim Ar-Raziyayn said, &#8220;We reached the scholars of all the cities, in Hijaz, &#8216;Iraq, Sham, Yemen, and from their Madhab was: Al-&#8216;Iman is speech and action, it increases and it decreases, and the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah, uncreated from all aspects [&#8230;] and whoever claims that the Qur&#8217;an is created then he is a disbeliever in Allah Al-&#8216;Adhim, with a disbelief that removes him from the Religion, and whoever doubts his disbelief &#8211; from those that understand [this issue] &#8211; then he is [also] a disbeliever&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad of Imam Al-Lalaka&#8217;i 1/278-282, Dar Al-Lu&#8217;lua)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Ibn Battah narrated from Imam Ahmad who said, &#8220;And whoever says that verily Allah will not be seen in the Hereafter, then he is a Jahmi who has surely disbelieved&#8221; and &#8220;They will look at their Rabb, and He will look at them, and they will speak to Him, and He will speak to them, However He wills, Whenever He wills.&#8221; <em>(Al-Ibanah &#8216;an Shari&#8217;atu&#8217;l Firqatu&#8217;n Najiyah #47-48, Dar Al-Rayah)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Harb Al-Kirmani, companion of Imam Ahmad and Ishaq bin Rahuyah, transmitted consensus on this issue saying, &#8220;And the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah by which He speaks, uncreated, so whoever claims that the Qur&#8217;an is created then he is a Jahmi Kafir.&#8221; <em>(Ijma As-Salaf fi&#8217;l-I&#8217;tiqad p. 64, Dar Al-Imam Ahmad)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;Ahlus-Sunnah w&#8217;al-Jama&#8217;ah have agreed upon that Allah speaks, and His Speech is an Attribute in truth, established for Him in a manner which is befitting for Him. And He, Exalted is He, speaks with letters and sounds, however He wills, whenever He wills, and His Speech is an attribute of His Essence (Sifat Dhatiyyah) in terms of genus, and it is an attribute of action (Sifat Fi&#8217;liyyah) in terms of occurrences.&#8221;</strong> He commented on his own speech, explaining, &#8220;This is because it is connected to His Will, and every attribute connected to His Will is an attribute of action, and Speech in its essence is an attribute of the Essence, for verily Allah has not ceased and does not cease to be One that Speaks.&#8221; <em>(Sharh Fath Al-Bariyyah bi-Talkhis Al-Hamawiyyah p. 303, 304) </em></li>
</ol>
<p>² Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilani said, &#8220;So whoever claims that it (the Qur&#8217;an) is created, or an &#8216;Ibarah, or that the recitation is other than what is recited, or he says: &#8216;My articulation of the Qur&#8217;an is created&#8217;, then he is a disbeliever in Allah Almighty, he is not to be mingled with, or fed, or married, or neighboured&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Al-Ghunya li-Talibi 1/128, Dar Al-Kutub Al-&#8216;Ilmiyyah)</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>AYĀT FROM THE QURĀN ON THE CREED OF THE SALAF. </strong></span></h4>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Indeed your Lord is Allāh, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty).</strong><strong>[Al-Arāf:54]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Surely, your Lord is Allāh Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty), disposing the affair of all things. </strong><strong>[Yūnas:2]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Allāh is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then, He rose above (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty). [Ar-Rʿad:2]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawa) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty) </strong><strong>[Taha:5]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six Days. Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). The Most Gracious (Allāh)! Ask Him as He is Al-Khabîr (The All-Knower of everything i.e. Allāh). </strong><strong>[Al-Furqān 59]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Allāh it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six Days. Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Walî (protector or helper) or an intercessor. Will you not then remember (or receive admonition)? </strong><strong>[As-Sajdah:4]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, and what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. And Allāh is the All-Seer of what you do. </strong><strong>[Al-Hadīd:4]</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ISTIWĀ’ WITH THE MEANING OF ‘IRTIFĀ’ TO BE HIGH AND ABOVE.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is recorded in the Sahīh of Al-Bukhārī in the book of Tawhīd, chapter of ‘His Throne Was Above The Water<em>’</em> from <em>Abū Ālīyah that, “His saying “He rose above the heavens” meaning ‘Irtifā’ [he rose].” Mujāhid said it means “He rose high/above’ his Throne” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Ḥajr says <em>“Abū ʿĀlīyahs report has been cited by Ibn Jarīr in mawsūl via the route of ʿAbdullāh bin Jʿafar’s from his father from Abū ʿĀlīyah and Mujāhids report has been transmitted by al-Faryābī in his Tafsīr in mawsūl via the route of Warqā from Ibn Abī Najīh from Mujāhid.”</em> [Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī [22/427] and Fath al-Bārī of Ibn Ḥajr [17/176]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Imām Ishāq Ibn Rahawaihah states that he he heard from numerous specialist explainers of the Qurān that the meaning of <strong>“</strong><strong>The Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawā) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)”</strong> <em>“is that ‘Irtifā’ he rose/above.”</em>  [Jalāl ud-Dīn al-Qāsmī, Tafsīr Maḥāsin ut-Tā’wīl [7/2703]</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>TO SAY ‘ISTAWĀ’ [HE ROSE ABOVE] MEANS ‘ISTĪLĀ’ [HE CONQUERED] IS TOTALLY INCORRECT. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ismāʿīl al-Harawī narrates in his book <em>‘al-Fārūq’</em> with a chain of transmission from Dawūd bin Khalf that he was with Muḥammad bin Ziyād al-Lughawī when a man asked him about the ayah <strong>“</strong><strong>The</strong><strong> Most Gracious (Allāh) rose over (Istawā) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)</strong><strong> [Ta-ḥa 4].” </strong><em>He replied, “We accept it as he has informed us. The man said it means “he overcame and conquered [Istawlā].” al-Harawī replied, “Istawlā would only be correct if head any competitor or challenger to overcome so this cannot be correct.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad bin Aḥmad bin Naḍr al-Azdī transmits that he heard from Muḥammad bin Ziyād Al-Lughawī who said that <em>“Aḥmad Bin Dawūd enquired of me whether I could investigate whether the word “Istawā’ [he rose] has ever been recorded in the Arabic language as “Istawlā [He conquered]? I replied, “I swear by Allāh that I searched for this and could not find it in any place.”</em> [Fath al-Bārī of Ibn Ḥajr [17/177]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, the Hāfiẓ Ibn Qayyīm has recorded in his monumental work <em>‘As-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah’</em> over 42 replies to rebut the fact that ‘Istiwā’ in this verse does not mean ‘He conquered or overcame’. From amongst these are:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The third response is that al-Khattābī mentions in his book ‘Shiʿār ud-Dīn’ that, “Some have considered that Istiwā here means he overpowered basing this on some lines of poetry and these are not such that they can be used an evidential basis. If it meant as they say that he overpowered/conquered then this would render the verse confusing as Allāh’s knowledge and power is all encompassing then why would he need to ‘conquer’ his Throne whilst this is the case? The word ‘istawlā’ he overpowered would only be used for one who was stopped from something and then through struggle he achieved success by overpowering. So what is it that they say was ‘stopping or restricting’ Allāh? So these are the words of Al-Khattābī who was from amongst those who were known as a linguist.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,<em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The fifth response is that to say as they say falls under the forbidden action of explain the Qurān based on one’s own intellect. No Companion OF Muhammad, a successor of theirs or any scholar of the Muslims [mufassirs] have explained as they have. Let them know that Muhammad the prophet said that ‘let him take a seat in the fire of hell who explains the Qurān with his own opinion.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The tenth response is that the words ‘istawā’ and ‘istīlā’ have not been considered interchangeable in use by the scholars of the Arabic language and this is due to the reason that they both have distinct and separate features and meanings. Those who claim other than this are lying. Research the Qurān, Sunnah and Arabic language and syntax and you will never find that the word ‘istawā’ has come in the meaning of or interchangeable with ‘istīlā”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The fifteenth response is that Imam Abūl Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī has recorded a consensus that to take ‘istawā’ with the meaning of ‘istīlā’ is wholly incorrect.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The twenty seventh response is that the one amongst the creation who knows most about his lord is prophet Muhammad who has described in numerous traditions that Allāh is high and above and these traditions are an evidence of the explanation of such ayat”</em> [Mukhtaṣar as-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah, Muhammad al-Mawṣalī [2/321-326]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some have figuratively attempted to explain (Tāwīl) the fourth ayah and said that ʿAla is the action (Fʿil) and ar-Rahman is the one who does the act (Faʿil) and the Faʿil of Istawa is the ʿArsh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zarkashī refutes this (Tāwīl) and says, <em>“This is refuted from two angles the first is that the mu’awil (the one who did the tāwīl) made the attribute into an action and all of the scripts of the Qurān in Shām, ʿIrāq and Ḥijāz have ʿAla as a harf and if this was Fʿil (ie action) it would have been written with a Lām and ālif like for example at another instance it says, “Walʿalā Baḍuhum ʿala Bʿaḍ. The second reasons is the mu’awil rendered ʿArsh as marfū whereas none of the reciters ie Qura recite it like this.” </em>[Zarkashī, al-Burhān Fī ʿUlūm al-Qurān [2/81]  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the third reason is that it will contradict the other ayahs.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THOSE AYAT WHICH MENTION ALLĀH BEING ‘ISTAWĀ’ ABOVE THE HEAVENS. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything. </strong><strong>[Al-Baqarah:29]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2] </strong><strong>Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: &#8220;Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.&#8221; They both said: &#8220;We come, willingly.” [Fuṣilat:11]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already recorded the narration from <em>Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī</em> from Abu ʿĀlīyah that ‘istawā means he rose high above.’ In fact Ibn Qayyīm quotes an Ijmāʿ consensus that <em>“The meaning here is he rose high above.”</em> [Mukhtaṣar as-Sawāʿiq al-Mursalah [2/320]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Baghawī explains the above ayat in his <em>‘Tafsīr Muʿālim ut-Tanzīl’</em> notes on Khāzin’ states, <em>“Many explainers of the Qurān from the Salaf and Ibn ʿAbbās explain this ayat to mean he rose above.”</em> [Tafsīr Muʿālim ut-Tanzīl [1/37]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Jarīr whilst explaining the above ayāt in his Tafsīr states in his Tafsīr <em>‘Jāmʿe ul-Bayān’</em> that, <em>‘The true meaning of the verse <strong>‘</strong></em><strong><em>He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything </em></strong><strong><em>[Al-Baqarah 29]</em></strong><em>’ is that he went high and rose above. Allāh showed his wisdom in creating the heavens and the earths. It is very strange that those who oppose this go against what is understood by the language of the Arabs, that is, he rose and was high. They prefer such meanings as they themselves give thinking that they will escape giving the verse a meaning which is not befitting to Allāh according to their own intellects. In fact, if he were to consider carefully his own explanation then in it he will find that which he was trying to avoid, for example, if he says istawā means he ‘turned towards/observed’ the heavens then we reply, was he ‘not observing/turned away’ from the heavens that you say he had to then ‘turn towards’ them? And if he replies, yes to this then we ask what is it that you base this on? In reality, his explanation causes more conflict and confusion and this is the very thing that he aimed to avoid in the first place. Praise be to Allāh I this way we reply to all those who oppose the truth and deviate from the true understanding of the Qurān. Abū Jʿafar said, that if someone were to ask us whether Allāh’s istiwā towards the heavens was before the heavens were created or after? Then we reply, it was after the heavens were created but Allāh said before he created the seven heavens that ‘</em><strong><em>Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: &#8220;Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.&#8221; They both said: &#8220;We come, willingly.’</em></strong><em> [Fussilāt 11]. </em><em>So the istiwā was after the creation of the smoke but before the formation of them into seven heavens. </em><em> </em><em>In regards to the word in the verse ‘Fasawwahunna’ i.e., [he made them] then this means that he created and originated them. He made them as he willed with perfection and suitability.  In Arabic ‘taswiyah’ means to make something correct and suitable, as it is said in the language ‘so and so made such a thing suitable’. So Allāh created the heavens in a most suitable way as he willed and planned and when they close he opens them as per his will.”</em> [Tafsīr at-Ṭabarī [1/192]</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE MENTION OF THE ‘GREAT THRONE’ OF ALLĀH. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] But if they turn away, say (O Muhammad): &#8220;Allāh is sufficient for me. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), in Him I put my trust and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne. </strong><strong>[At-Tawbah:129] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[2] </strong><strong>And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. [Hūd:7]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[3] Had there been therein (in the heavens and the earth) âlihah (gods) besides Allāh, then verily both would have been ruined. Glorified is Allāh, the Lord of the Throne, (High is He) above all that they attribute to Him! [Al-Anbiyā:21]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[4]   </strong> <strong>Say: &#8220;Who is (the) Lord of the seven heavens, and (the) Lord of the Great Throne?&#8221; (86) They will say: &#8220;Allāh.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Will you not then fear Allāh (believe in His Oneness, obey Him, believe in the Resurrection and Recompense for every good or bad deed)?&#8221; </strong><strong>[Al-Muminūn:86-87]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[5] So Exalted is Allāh, the True King, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne! [Al-Muminūn:116]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[6] </strong><strong>Allāh, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne! [An-Naml:26] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[7] (He is Allāh) Owner of High Ranks and Degrees, the Owner of the Throne. [Al-Ghāfir:15] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[8] </strong><strong> Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted is He from all that they ascribe (to Him). [Az-Zukhruf:82]</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[9] </strong><strong>Owner of the Throne, the Glorious. </strong><strong>[AL-Burūj:16] </strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE MEANING OF ARSH [THRONE]. </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the meaning itself of Throne is the indication of Allāh being high and above as is found in the verses and narrations. Then it should be known that Allāh being above his Throne shows he is above it and ‘bāin ʿanil Khalq’ separate and distinct from his creation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Bakr al-Ājurī said in his book <em>‘ash-Sharīʿah’</em> that, <em>“It is the madhab of the scholars that Allāh is above his Throne above the heavens. His knowledge encompasses all. He knows that which is in the heavens, earth and that which is beneath it. He knows that which is open and hidden. He knows that which is concealed in the chests and the deceitful eyes. He knows the affairs of the hearts and every beat it takes before it occurs. There is not a particle in the heavens or earth except that he is aware of it. He is above his Throne. He raises the deeds of the people up towards himself and he is aware of their deeds even more so than those angels whose duty it is to record such deeds.” </em>[Imām Abū Bakr al-Ājurī, ash-Sharīʿah [pg.288]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the first ayah above, <em>“It shows he is the originator and owner and this is why he is the owner of the great Throne. His Throne is a ceiling for all of creation including all of the heavens, earth and all that is what is between them. His knowledge is encompassing everything. His decree is upon everything and he is the creator of all.” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [2/404]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Tafsīr <em>‘Madārik ut-Tanzīl’</em> of Nasafī’ considers the ayah <em>“The Lord of the mighty Throne’ that the greatest of the creation was his Throne, which is a place of where duʿā is directed by those in the heavens.”</em> [Tafsīr Nasafī [2/152]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the second ayah above, <em>“Ibn Abbās (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhuma) said that the Throne was given this title as it is something which is high/above. Ismāʿīl bin Abī Khālid said he heard Sʿād Ṭā’ī say that the Throne is red/ruby in colour. Muḥammad bin Ishāq said concerning the verse <strong>‘And</strong></em><strong><em> He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds’, </em></strong><em>that, it is as he has described. There is nothing but water, upon this is the great Throne and above this is Allāh, the owner of all majesty and great, the wisest, the ablest and the one who is most merciful, wise all bountiful. He does as he wills and wishes.”</em> [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [2/437]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Nasafī states concerning the second verse, <em>“Meaning that his Throne was above the water, that is, before the creation of the heavens and the earth there was nothing but water beneath his Throne.”</em> [Tafsīr Nasafī [2/13]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is stated in <em>‘Tafsīr al-Futūhat al-Ilāhīyah lil Jamal’</em> that, <em>“He was where he is now, that is, above the seven heavens and the water was where it is now, that is, below his Throne.” </em>[Tafsīr al-Futūhat al-Ilāhīyah lil Jamal [2/382]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the fourth ayah above, <em>“He is the lord of the mighty Throne which is a ceiling for his creation. It is mentioned in the narration transmitted by Abū Dawūd that the prophet said ‘Your Lords status is the greatest and his Throne is above the heavens’. [after recording a few more narrations] Ḍihāk narrates from Ibn Abbās (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) that ‘it is called ʿArsh [Throne] due to it being lofty/high’. Aʿmash narrates from Kʿab al-Ahbār that the heavens and earth in relation to the Throne are as if a small lamp is lit hanging in between the heaven and the earth. Mujāhid states that ‘the heavens and earth in relation to the Throne are like a small ring which are left in a vast plain.” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [3/253]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the fifth ayah above, <em>“The Throne is a ceiling for the entire creation. It is called ‘ʿArshul Karīm’ [supreme Throne] as it is the most beautiful to look at greatest presence.  As Allāh has said ‘</em><em>And We send down water (rain) from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind to grow therein.’ [Luqmān:9]” </em>[Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [3/259]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Nasafī states, <em>“It is called supreme Throne as all mercy from Allāh descends from there or that the closest most supreme angels surround it.” </em>[Tafsīr Nasafī [3/130]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tafsīr Khāzin records that, <em>“Karīm, that is beautiful. Others have said it means high. It is recorded as such by Baghawī in his footnotes on Khāzin.”</em> [Tafsīr al-Khāzin [5/38]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shawkāni states in his <em>‘Tafsīr Fath al-Qadīr’ </em>that, <em>“It is called the supreme Throne because Allāh descends his mercy to his creation from it or it is supreme due to the fact that the one who is above it [the Throne] is the most supreme as it is said by the Arabs ‘the noble house’, meaning that the one who resides in it is noble.” </em>[Fath al-Qadīr [3/485]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Kathīr said in his explanation under the ninth ayah above, <em>“Glorious Throne, that is, he is the owner of the great Throne which is above all of creation.”</em> [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr [4/496]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nasafī states, <em>“Glorious, that is, the creator of the Throne is the most glorious and greatest. Glorious here also refers to his Throne as well as himself. Meaning, that the one who is the owner of the Throne is even more Glorious than it.” </em>[Nasafī [4/346]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in Jalālayn it says, <em>“Glorious, that is, the owner and creator of the Throne is the most glorious. Glorious, meaning that the one who is completely deserving of the attribute of being highest and it is like this in ‘Jamal’ and ‘Maḥāsin at-Tā’wīl.”</em>  [Jalalayn [12/422], Jamal [4/515] and Maḥāsin at-Tā’wīl [18/6118]  </span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Publishers Foreword</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Alhamdullilahi Rabbil A’lamīn, Waṣalatu Wasalam Ala Rasūlillahil Karīm,  Wa, Ba’d</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is a long awaited translation of Allāmah Badīʿ ud-Dīn Shāh ar-Rashīdī as-Sindis [1416H] ‘Tawhīd Khāliṣ’, The Pure Tawhīd. In it the Shaikh answers two questions about where is Allāh and whether we can ask Allāh through intermediaries with his answer spanning over 625 pages!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The book was first published around 1398H/1977ce and then in 1415H /1994ce during Shaikh Badʿī ud Dīn’s lifetime and in recent times a new edition has also been published. The brothers Abū Ḥibbān and Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī first began translating this book in late 1995ce.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Over the years the translation continued sporadically and most times portion or excerpts would be given to brothers who were confused on this issue in around the city of Birmingham, England, contrary to the common desperate lies of those who claimed issues of fiqh were always discussed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We urge all those who are serious students of knowledge to study this book with great detail as in it are evidences, rebuttals, refutations and principles which the Shaikh has explained in magnificent detail. We promise those who advocate shirk and bidʿah and the so called evidences are fully answered in this book as the Shaikh leaves no stone unturned with the help and will of Allāh</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To our limited knowledge there has never been a book written in the sub continent with such detail and exposure on these topics as the one before you. May Allah accept it from these two poor servants of Allāh whose aid is sought.]</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Praise be to Allāh, we seek His help and His forgiveness. We seek refuge with Allāh from the evil of our own souls and from our bad deeds. Whomsoever Allāh guides will never be led astray, and whomsoever Allāh leaves astray, no one can guide. I bear witness that there is no god but Allāh, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islam (as Muslims) with complete submission to Allāh.’<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person, and from him He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women, and fear Allāh through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship) Surely, Allāh is Ever an All-Watcher over you.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a>’ </em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>“O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allāh and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><strong>[3]</strong></a> <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><strong>[4]</strong></a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>To proceed,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You have asked concerning two questions of fundamental importance to a Muslims creed so beginning in the name of Allāh and we ask him for guidance and we will answer both questions in great detail and clarify both issues with textual and intellectual overwhelming evidences. We supplicate to Allāh that he guides all the Muslims to tread upon the straight path and preserve us from the evilness and effect of Shayṭān. Amīn Oh creator of everything that exists.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>Question</em></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Amongst the Muslims today there are five different beliefs concerning the Tawhīd of Allāh.  [First Type] A group of scholars explains Tawhīd to mean that everything that exists is Allāhs creation and that he is separate from his creation and who is in his self and his Dhāt ie essence rises over his Throne.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Second Type] Mawlāna Rūmī who was a scholar of the Qurān and a mufassir, whose statements of poetry are often uttered by the people for years, says in his Mathnawī that it is Allāh himself in the creation and everything prostrates to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Third Type] Another Sūfī elder and an expert in poetry in the Multānī language, Khāwaja Ghulām Farīd represents another specific group in the following couplets that, He has all the right and might the one who is Ahmad, he also said, there is no difference between Aḥad (one and Aḥmad as they are one in Dhāt and Ṣifāt and he says, Aḥad is he and Aḥmad is he without any difference.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Fourth Type] The fourth type of Tawḥīd was explained a famous elder and luminary Ḥājī Imdādullāh Muhājir Makkī, who is the Pīr and Murshid ie the spiritual guide and leader of the deobandīs. He is considered to have a lofty and high status among the Sūfīs. Likewise, and similarly he is revered and venerated to be a holy elder by the Barelvīs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says in his book, ‘Shamaim Imdādīyyah’,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Man before his existence was a hidden god himself and God appears to be a human being.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><strong>[5]</strong></a>     </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fifth type of understanding of Tawḥīd is that which most of the people of Waḥdatul Wajūd often explain in their speech which was vocalised by Khawāja Ghulām Farīd who is an established representative for them, he said, “Wherever there is an image then every image is in reality his” and his saying, “See every number as one as many are lost he is in every image as their no one other than him.” Etc</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So all of the aforementioned types that have been mentioned can be summarised as follows,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1]   Allāh is above the seven heavens, above his Throne, separate from his creation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2]   Allāh breathed into Adam and became part of him and in him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3]   Allāh came to earth in the form of Muhammad,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4]   Allāh is incarnate in all humans and he is in their form</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5] Allāh is incarnate as part of his entire creation and is thus everywhere.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At one hand it is said that all of the creation is separate and in need of his sustenance as his is the creator and provider. Whereas on the other hand it is said there is no existence except for Allāhs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Would please clarify this issue because up until a Muslim does not have the correct and acceptable pure Tawḥīd based on the Qurān and Ḥadīth his Imān ie faith will not be accepted and nor will any of his actions, so would you clarify.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Creed of the Salaf of this Ummah </strong><strong>Concerning Tawḥīd.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Know may Allāh have mercy on you that the belief we should have about Tawḥīd is as you have said in one above and this was the creed of all of the Salaf of the ummah and they were all unanimously agreed upon it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad Ibn Kathīr al-Maṣiṣi narrates that he heard Imam Awzāʿī say:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;It is my creed and that of the Tabiʿūn that Allāh is above his Throne and we believe in all his attributes as has been stated in the Sunnah&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><strong>[6]</strong></a> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ismāīl Al-Anṣārī mentions in his &#8216;Dham ul-Kalām Wa Ahlihi&#8217; that ʿAbdur Rahmān Ibn Abī Hātim narrated that, I asked my father and Abū Zurʿah about the creed of Ahl us-Sunnah and all the scholars at the time. They replied,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;We have met the scholars from afar and all places. The scholars of the Ḥijāz, ʿIrāq, Egypt, Shām and Yemen all explained that there creed was that Allah was above his throne separate from his creation as he has explained himself without any similitude and his knowledge is all encompassing.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><strong>[7]</strong></a>’ </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū ʿAbdullāh Ibn Baṭṭah states in his book &#8216;Al-Ibānah&#8217; that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;The Sahabah and their successors, the Tabiʿūn along with all the people of knowledge from amongst the Muslims all had the creed that Allāh is above his throne, above the heavens separate from his creation&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><strong>[8]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abū Naṣr As-Sizjī mentions in his book &#8216;Al-Ibānah&#8217; that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;Our Imāms like (Sufyān) ath-Thawrī, Mālik, </em><em>(</em><em>Sufyān bin) Uyainah, Ḥammād bin Zayd, al-Fudayl (bin ʿIyād), Ibn al-Mubārak, Aḥmad, and Ishāq are agreed</em> <em>that Allāh is above the Throne bi Dhātihi (with His essence) and His</em> <em>knowledge is in every place&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><strong>[9]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Imam Abūl Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī has reported a ijmāʿ consensus on this creed as in Al-Ibānah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, Abū Umar Talmankī states in his book &#8216;Al-Wasūl Ila Mʿarifah al-Ūsūl that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;The Ahl us-Sunnah are agreed upon the creed that Allah is above the Throne haqiqatan [in reality] and not majazan [metophorically]&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Abū Nuʿaym, the author of Ḥilyah ul-Āwlīya says in his &#8216;Kitāb ul-Eʿtiqād&#8217; that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;Our creed and that of the Salaf who followed the Quran, Sunnah and Ijmaʿ consensus is that those narrations which mention the rising of Allāh above his throne be accepted, without enquiring how, without making any similitude and to say that he is separate from his creation and they from him. He is not within his creation. He has not made halūl [within] them and nor is he mixed within them. He is above the heavens above his throne and not on the earth [creation]&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><strong>[11]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further states from Hāfiẓ Abū Bakr Ismaʿīl who said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;It is the creed of the Ahl ul-Ḥadīth Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamāʿh is to believe in Allāh, his angels and books and Messengers. To accept that which has come in the book of Allāh and the authentic Sunnah established from the messenger without any distortion. They also believed that Allāh is to be called upon with his beautiful names and he is as he has described himself and as described by his messenger. He created Adam with his hands and his hands are open without asking how and he is above his Throne without delving into how&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><strong>[12]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū ʿAbdullāh al-Ḥākim says in his ‘Mʿarifah Ulūm ul-Ḥadīth’ that Imām Abū Bakr Muḥammad Ibn Ishāq Ibn Khuzaimah said that,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“One who does not affirm that Allāh is above the Throne above the seven heavens is a disbeliever before his lord. He must be made to repent and if not so then punished and left to rot at some sewer so that the Muslims and those under there dhimmah do not even smell his stench. He will have no inheritor from amongst the Muslims as they cannot inherit from one upon disbelief&#8217;.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><strong>[13]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām ʿAbdullāh bin Aḥmad narrates from Imām ʿAbdur Rahman bin Mahdī who said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“From the people of desires none is worse than the people of Jaḥm who say there is nothing in the heavens, I swear by Allāh I see that they should not be married nor inherited from. Ibn Abī Ḥātim said in refutation of the jaḥmīyyah whilst narrating from him that the people of jaḥm intend and mean Allāh did not speak to Mūsa, they intend and mean there is nothing in the heavens and that Allāh is not upon his Arsh (Throne). I hold that they should be asked to repent, if they do it is good but if they abstain, they should be executed”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><strong>[14]</strong></a> </em></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We the Ahlul Hadith have learnt the Quran, Aqadah, Hadith and Fiqh as part of our Islamic responsibility so that we can serve this Deen in a manner that best suites this Ummah. In response to our dedication and efforts the hanafis deobandis of Bury and Dewsbury decided to setup Tablighi organisations against the Salafi Dawah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The efforts of Ahlul Hadith was spreading by Allahs mercy and in the year of 2000-2001, the elder generation of the deobandis felt the need to arrange emergency meetings to discuss ways of creating counter measures in an attempt to curb the Salafi Dawah. Such meetings or conferences were held in India and the UK to address this situation. It is therefore intriguing to contemplate if Mr Yasir is aware of this history but decided to conceal it just like Mohammad Ilyas sahib concealed the true founder of the 6 principles of the deobandi Manhaj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a historical fact that the people of truth are always less in number but their Dawah is very effective and consequently the deobandi contingency become very fearful of this threat. In a desperate and cheap attempt, the Deobandis decided to approach the masses and make false statements against the Salafis, such as <em>“oh the Salafis will drive you away from the taqleed of the imams and the burzugh… how can we allow our children to abandon the Deen of our forefathers of Deoband.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was at this point this these people promoted the term <em>ghair muqalid </em>in reference to Ahlul Hadeeth.  It was light of these crocodile tears that the deobandis had the apparent justification in setting up institutions around the UK.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this one may ponder how the Salafi Dawah is gaining strength if they lack the Madaris as Mr Yasir claims. A further point to note is to ponder how is it that Hanafis are embracing the Salafi Dawah and not the reverse? We can conclude that Mr Yasir is a victim of the inferiority complex, to make statements such as “<em>they hardly have any proper madaris</em>” shows he has no intelligence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a known fact that the Salafis have always propagated their Manhaj with small quantities of people but the large number of deobandi and hanafis from the subcontinent along with their kosher money have led to their institutions. This followed with an influx of migrants from the subcontinent who are mainly hanafi and heobandi who have contributed to the numbers in the UK. This has now become a point of argument by those who lack in concrete proof in defence of the deobandi hanafi sect which is corrupted with Shirk and Bid’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be noted here that the vast majority of these migrants are the laymen and do not possess a concrete understanding of the correct Aqidah and it is very cunning of Mr Yasir in using this to promote a false argument highlighting that the Salafis are weak in number. We should also emphasise that if success is judged by numbers then the Sahaba would have been on the brink of failure during the battle of Badr, but it was because of their correct Aqidah and firm Iman that won the battle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir further states </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“<em>it’s funny how they chant one word salaf when they have no link to the pious salaf as salaf means that came before us.”</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have addressed this comment previously and revisiting this would be unnecessary. It is very ironic that Mr Yasir uses the word chant as this is a term his Sufi Manhaj promotes in their circles of zikr, this is because the deobandis are essentially Naqshabandi who are well known for their methods of worship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It seems Mr Yasir was excluded from these circles of remembrance where they CHANT like individuals intoxicated with harmful substances. In light of this we do not follow the Salaf and if we choose to, then it needs to be substantiated with evidence and this is easy for us. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi as his name suggests claims to be hanafi, therefore please attempt to highlight the current day deobandi belief &amp; practices from the manhaj of Imam Abu Hanifah. This is a challenge which will be met with certain failure. Meanwhile we the Salafis can bring forward our proofs which emphasises that our Manhaj and Aqidah has not been diluted but rather it is a mirror reflection of the Companions, Tabieens and Taba-Tabieens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have previously stated examples such as books of Aqidah i.e creed issues as Mr Yasir phrases it. Furthermore, he has misunderstood the word Salaf in terms of what it denotes, and the meaning that it draws. This is a further example demonstrating the ignorance of Mr Yasir who embarrasses himself by spitting at himself whilst attempting to spit at the sun in the presence of his deobandi devotees.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One may contemplate how an overly enthusiastic deobandi is capable of such diabolical profanities whilst his senior counterparts would seek refuge in such foolish statements. Mr Yasir should realise that the term Salaf cannot be restricted to an era but rather it must align with the principles of the Quran and the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore any individual whose beliefs, madhab and opinions do not conform and agree with the Quran and Sunnah or that they oppose the people of truth will be upon misguidance. A manifestation of this situation can be understood in the case of Ma’bad al-Juhani 70H, the leader of the Qadiriyyah, Ghilan Dimashqi 105H, the head of the Jahmis, Jahm ibn Safwan 128H, Ja’d ibn Dirham 124H and Wasil ibn A’ta 131H, the head of the Mu’tazilah (Refer to Qadiyah Way-Ta’weel).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The aforementioned individuals were from the leaders of the Salaf of Mr Yasir. We urge him to investigate his own Salaf, the likes of Jahm, Wasil to name a few. Mr Yasir is a very confused individual who claims to be an Ashari but in reality he and his sect are Kullabis which is derived from the Jahmi’s. In light of this we cannot consider Mr Yasir a serious student of knowledge from whom knowledge can be taken from (this is for those who belong to his sect).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Safarini has stated that the Salaf must be upon righteousness and truthfulness so that knowledge can be sought from them. Their character must be of good conduct and individuals who strongly oppose the people of innovation. He further states in regards to the Salafis,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“They are labelled or titled with names that are not linked by the people like the Khawarij, Rawafidh, Qadariyyah, Murjiah, Jabariyyah, Jahmiyyah etc”</em> (Lawamah Al Anwar 1/20)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir further states </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Yes they do follow the misguided Salaf”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Only one needs to read the books of rijal and history to understand the Salaf within the deobandis and hanafis. For instance we can study the example of Abu Mute’a al-Balkhi and his beliefs (Refer to Lisan ul-Mizan Vol. 2, Mizan ul-E’tidaal Vol. 1 and Kitab al-Kunna Vol. 2 of ad-Daulabi).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A further example to look at is the E’tizaal and Irja and their respective origins. Al-ikmaal (1/252-253) of ibn Makaula is yet another example to look at wherein it provides information on the individual who pulled the reigns of the horse of the wife of Jahm Ibn Safwan. Much more can be stated about Mr Yasir’s Salaf and therefore he needs to address the matters of his own house before he chooses to attacks others with foolish remarks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir further states </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“By changing your name, the reality doesn’t turn into gold.”</span> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ironically this is the very point Ahlul Hadith have been driving forward. To label oneself as a hanafi does not imply that one is now amongst the hanafi scholars of the classical era who were free of the deviant beliefs as those hanafis of today. The same principle can be applied when choosing to label oneself as an Ashari or Maturidi who also did not share the deviant practices as Mr Yasir, such as seeking aid from the deceased or from the souls of the righteous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It only takes one to study the statements of their respective hanafi deobandi scholar to realise that he has more right to ilm to label himself a hanafi, and claims that he is a muqallid of Imam Abu Hanifah in trivial matters of the deen. Whilst in matters of Manhaj and Aqidah they choose to acknowledge Imam Abul Hasal al-Ashari and Imam Abu Mansur Maturidi (Muhannad Ala Mufannad Page 22).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore we ask Mr Yasir to present his sufi beliefs from these scholars i.e. their elders from whom they take their knowledge from and emulate. In light of this if Mr Yasir is not fully versed with Muhannad Ala Mufannad then this a clear sign of ignorance in his knowledge and a classical example of someone to have some shame and regret.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However if on the other hand My Yasir is completely unware of this book then we would highlight that this book does not fall short in being the ultimate reference guide for the Sufi deobandi forefathers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir should be familiar with the calibre and the number of the deobandi elders who satisfied the beliefs and the fundamental principles of this book. Nonetheless, addressing the original point, labelling oneself a hanafi whilst the heobandi doctrines are derived heavily from the Greeks and Hindus and in addition to having the ideas of Jahm Ibn Safwan, Ja’d Ibn Dirham and Wasil Ibn Alta is a matter that needs to be reflected upon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is intriguing to see that Mr Yasir has the audacity to present himself in front of an audience to critique Ahlul Hadith whilst the state of his own affairs is a disgrace. If he truly believes that he is surely upon truth then we ask him to highlight the concepts of wahdatul wujood, seeking aid from the deceased, seeking aid from the living in a manner that is beyond the capacity of a person, holding the belief that calamities can be alleviated from the creation of Allah and so forth from the works of Imam Abu Mansur Maturidi and Imam Abul Hasan al-Ashari. This is a challenge that he will fail miserably.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the final tirade then it amounts to nothing but an overly excited child with sweets. We eagerly await your response. With regards to the flapping, then we say that once Ahlul Hadith have dealt with Mr Yasir al-Hanafi, he will not be able to crawl back to deoband let alone flapping, that is if he is not disowned by the real academics amongst them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the very deoband which was established in a Hindu city where their respective goddess would be worshipped and venerated. It is also the very deoband which was formed through the donations of Hindus and the British East India Company.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our advice for Mr Yasir before he chooses to undertake his long journey back to Deoband where the goddess of Durga was worshipped i.e. Devi van, Devi gan or Devi Vandan is to equip yourself with pen and paper so that you can actually acquire the knowledge of your forefathers in Devgand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also a JazakAllah Khair to Abu Hashim for his diligence and efforts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Written by the two weak slaves of Allah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise be to Allah lord of the worlds to whom we praise and seek his aid and assistance without any intercessors. May there be abundant salutations upon the noblest messenger, his family, his companions and all those Muslims who follow until the last day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Very recently some proponents and ardently staunch followers of the Hanafi Deobandi Madhab under the guise of the Hanafi Fiqh  have made some slanderous remarks which were based on bigoted ignorance, deliberate opposition of the true reality, state of affairs and malicious misrepresentation of the facts through social media platforms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The perpetrator of these remarks were carried out by neonate, new kids on the block with new found levels of testosterone, namely Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi. Our aim is not to entertain the mind-set of this individual or his scathing remarks as this will lengthen this brief response. Rather we wish to highlight some key points to show the slanderous lies and ignorance of this individual.     </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I also like to request our Sunni brothers to refrain from uploading any youtube videos, creating articles against the likes of the Hanafi and Deobandi sect including their overly exaggerated teachers such as Maulana Qasim Nanautwi, Ashraf Ali Thanvi and Rashid Ahmad Gangohi who are not well versed with this sect and their school of thought. The brothers should understand that attempting a refutation against the aforementioned individuals, the Deobandis and Hanafis will result in a subsequent response from them which may be difficult for those brothers to rebut and thereby causing embarrassment on behalf of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah. It is indeed easy quoting what Ashraf Ali Thanvi said etc but when accusations are levied against us these brothers are no where to be seen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The effects of this scenario will make our brothers look weak and defeated. In summary, it is very simple to upload videos which make criticism of the Deobandi Manhaj by our zealous brothers however any response from the opposition is met with silence. Therefore our brothers should realise their respective limits when dealing with such matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us proceed and analyse the confused statements of Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi. He stated the following…</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>“Salafis” </em><em>Who are very new to this ummah, maybe a hundred years or so, though they take many of their creed issues from Hafiz Ibn Taymiyyah, bin Baz, Uthaymin et al who were nowhere near the salaf</em>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Response: We do not know if we are to laugh at this statement or cry at the Jahala of this individual. Such statements have become so monotonous or repeated that it is deemed as ignorance to even raise such a point. This statement has demonstrated the childish and immature behaviour and pathetic mind-set of this person</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If we are to accept his statement that the Salafis existed for no more than 100 years or so then consider the following.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir died in 1164H (approximately 272 years ago). He wrote in his refutation of the Ashari’s which mentions Allahs Kalam Nafsi (i.e. the incorrect Aqidah),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“(They say) Allah does not speak but they are internal sounds!!! Then you cannot even find the smell of this in the Quran and Sunnah” (Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqaid an-Hadithiyyah (also referred to as Athariyyah pg.21). </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this Mohammad Yasir has either demonstrated his poor mathematical skills or he has shown poor understanding of the Salafis and Ahlul Hadith. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir died in 1164H refuting the Asharis but also the fact that he was a bona fide scholar of the Salafis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be noted critically here that during this period Deoband was not even in existence and therefore we should redirect the statements of Muhammad Yasir on the forefathers of the Deobandi sect which did not exist over 100 years ago until the intervention of the British Empire through the East India Trading company.  (Refer to our treatise, The Deobandis &amp; The British Government. At the following link <a href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-deobandis-the-british-government/">http://www.salafiri.com/the-deobandis-the-british-government/</a>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is clearly apparent from this short analysis that Mr Yasir is having a hard time grasping basic mathematics, books of the Salaf and History. What reliance can we have in his short outburst?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He states</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Salafis”, <em>who are very new to this ummah, maybe a hundred years or so</em>”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">in this case we him to consider the following.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Sam’ani (562H) said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Salafi, they are those who are attributed to the Salaf and following the Madhab of the Salaf, as I HAVE HEARD FROM THEM” (al-Insab 7/723)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Ibn Athir (630H) adds to the statement of Allamah Sam’ani and says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“A group (of people) are well known with this Nisbah (i.e. attribution of being a Salafi)” (al-Ikmal (4/471-470) of Ibn Makaula, al-Tashabha Fir Rijal (1/364) and al-lubab (2/126).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If we accept Mr Yasir’s statement that the Salafi’s are a century old then please explain with your amazing mathematical mind, how Allamah Samani stated he heard from the Salaf that they followed the Madhab of the Salaf during the 6<sup>th</sup> century Hijri? And that Allamah Ibn Athir stated that he saw a group calling themselves Salafi during the 7<sup>th</sup> century Hijri?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not wish to invest too much time educating Mohammad Yasir of the definition of Salafi, however we ask him to refer to his own Ashari Scholar Ibrahim bin Muhammad Baijauri (1277H) in regards to the definition of Salaf (Refer to his Tuhfatul Murid).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known to most people that the Salafi’s are the ones who adhere to the way of the Salaf and their Madhab and it is for this reason that we label ourselves as Salafis. We should emphasise here that being a prerequisite of being a Salafi is NOT to follow Shaikh Bin Baz, Shaikh ibn Uthaymin and Imam Ibn Taymiyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather Allamah Safarini has explained that the later scholars who adopted the way of the companions, Tabieen and Taba Tabieen are known as the Salaf (Lawameh al-Anwar (1120).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taimiyyah (728H) and Hafidh ibn Rajab (795H) have included Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal (241H), Imam Shafi’ee (204H), Ishaq Ibn Rahawaihah (221H) and Imam Abu Ubaid (224H) to be from amongst the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some authorities have stated that the first three generations was the period of the Salaf. This can be confirmed within at-Tahaf Fi Madhab  as-Salaf (pg.117-118), Lawameh al-Anwar (1/20), Dar Tarudh an Aql Wan Naql (1/207 &amp; 7/134) of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Fadhal Ilm as-Salaf Alal Khalaf (p.60) of Hafidh Ibn Rajab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Ajurri superseded them in this and included Imam Ahmad and the scholars of his era from amongst the Salaf (ash-Shariah (p.14)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this, the intelligent reader will acknowledge with certainty that we take our creed issues </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">from Imam Ahmad (241H) from his Usul us-Sunnah and as-Sunnah as narrated by his sons and students</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and the creed of the Salaf from Imam Sufyan, the two Hammads,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nuzul, as-Sifat and ar-Ru’ayah all of Imam Daraqutni (385H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ibanah Aan Shari&#8217;atil Firqatun Najiyyah and Sharhul-Ibaanah Aan Usul us-Sunnah Wad-Diyanah of Battah al-Ukbari (387H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Kitabut-Tawhid and ar-Radd Alal Jahmiyyah both of Ibn Mandah (395H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and the list continues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this, the slanderous accusations highlighting that we take our matters of creed from the likes of Shaikh Bin Baz, Shaikh Ibn al-Uthaymin and Imam Ibn Taymiyyah is a disgraceful and fabricated lie. One would contemplate as to where does Mr Yasir take his issues of creed from?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Does he take them from his Imam Abu Mansur al-Maturidi or the Ashaa’irah? Further to this, one would ask to what extent did the former of these individuals understood their creed with respect to the Salaf. Mr Yasir labels himself as an Ashari but yet he has not been able to substantiate the origins of his Aqidah, whether this be early or late Ashari or the Kullabiyyah. Furthermore, your Deobandi Church forefathers have stated in their respective books such as Maulana Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri, Qari Tayyab and Maulana Yusuf Binnori that they adopt and follow the Aqidah of Abu Hasan al-Ashari and Abu Mansur al-Maturidi however they choose to follow Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahimahullah) in fiqh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is astonishing to see that they abandon the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah in favour of their Deobandi forefathers, we ask you, what is wrong with the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah? Whilst you follow the Aqidah of the Khalaf? Also can you explain which book of the Salaf or their teaching did the Deobandi’s acquire the Sufi tariqah, Chistiyyah or the Naqshbandiyyah from?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is difficult to fathom as to how Mr Yasir chooses to follow a diluted Aqidah and yet have the audacity to claim that the Manhaj of Ahlul Hadith is no more than 100 years old. An intelligent student of knowledge would come to terms with the fallacy and fictitious nature of My Yasir’s baseless statements and his corrupted diluted Madhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> At the very least he could have adopted the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah as cited in Fiqh ul-Akbar or in his Wasiyyah Al-Imam Abu Hanifah. It is clear that Mr Yasir evidently has no shame in labelling himself as a Hanafi whilst he follows the Aqidah of his Deobandi forefathers. So either deny the attribution of these books to Imam Abu Hanifah and the Aqidah contained therein or accept the words of your own Imam, the same Imam you spend your lives defending his fiqh and yet on the other hand you turn a blind eye to his beliefs, this is the most hypocritical manipulation of the worst dimension.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We therefore stress that he should spend some useful time in reading Imam Abu Hanifah’s Aqidah in Wasiyah (p.38) (We would be surprised to say the least if he has even heard of this book) or Imam Abul Hasan al-Ashari’s Al-Ibanah (p.55). In light of these references we would expect Mr Yasir to revert to making claims that Imam Abul Hasan Al-Ashari’s Al-Ibanah has been tampered when he fails to provide an educated response.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further states in his allegations</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“<em>Also the fact that in this country they have hardly any proper madaris, except for a few crash course “Halaqas”</em>”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a further lie, the Salafis and Ahlul Hadith have been teaching in their respective madrassahs for years well before Bury and Dewsbury appeared on the scene. Madrassah’s were and are well established throughout the United Kingdom with names like Madrassah Salafiyyah. We would surely know as we studied in them in the early 80’s and the teaching was regular and consistent from the mid 70’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The level and methods of teaching were evident and widespread where students would deliver lectures and sermons as training in the annual conferences. The evidence is in your face yet due to his vehement bigoted and staunch animosity for the Ahlul Hadith he is so blind to the truth when it is right in front of him and even if it was to slap him in the face, he would still be upon his farcical and slanderous absurdities. The videos are on Youtube, may be when he has time from his repugnancy he might have a look!!! All this when deoband was still in deoband on paper!!!</span></p>
