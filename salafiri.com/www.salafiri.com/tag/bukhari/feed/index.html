				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>[This is a slight elaboration on the hypothetical situation whether a muqallid should look for daleel. In this brief reply we produce evidence to show the methodology of the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was to give more information and knowledge to a questioner.]</em></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>باب مَنْ أَجَابَ السَّائِلَ بِأَكْثَرَ مِمَّا سَأَلَه (53)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Chapter: Whosoever Answered a Questioner More Than What was Asked</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Explanation of the chapter</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">This chapter is concerning the etiquette of answering a question. The need for this chapter arose due to a principle which some jurists mention, that a mufti should answer a question according to the questioners enquiry only (i.e. limit information). So, Imam al-Bukhari wanted to clarify it was not the intended meaning used by some jurists and that additional knowledge or information cannot be given to a questioner. Giving additional knowledge or information is from the generousity of knowledge and is a praiseworthy act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">حَدَّثَنَا آدَمُ، قَالَ حَدَّثَنَا ابْنُ أَبِي ذِئْبٍ، عَنْ نَافِعٍ، عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم‏.‏ وَعَنِ الزُّهْرِيِّ، عَنْ سَالِمٍ، عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَنَّ رَجُلاً سَأَلَهُ مَا يَلْبَسُ الْمُحْرِمُ فَقَالَ لاَ يَلْبَسِ الْقَمِيصَ وَلاَ الْعِمَامَةَ وَلاَ السَّرَاوِيلَ وَلاَ الْبُرْنُسَ وَلاَ ثَوْبًا مَسَّهُ الْوَرْسُ أَوِ الزَّعْفَرَانُ، فَإِنْ لَمْ يَجِدِ النَّعْلَيْنِ فَلْيَلْبَسِ الْخُفَّيْنِ وَلْيَقْطَعْهُمَا حَتَّى يَكُونَا تَحْتَ الْكَعْبَيْنِ</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>[with 2 chains] “A man asked the Prophet </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>, &#8220;What kind of clothes should a Muhrim (someone making Umrah or Hajj) wear? He replied, &#8220;He should not wear a shirt, a turban, trousers, a head covering garment or any material coloured with Saffron or Wars (types of colours and fragrance). And if he has no slippers, he can use Khuffs (leather socks) but they should be cut to be below the ankles.&#8221;</strong> (Sahih al-Bukhari no.134).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Narrators in the Chain</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Adam:</strong> He is Adam b. Abi Ayyas al-Asqalani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Ibn Abi Dhi’b:</strong> He is Muhammad b. Abdur Rahman al-Mughirah b. Harith b. Abi Dhi’b and Abu Dhi’b is Hisham b. Shu’bah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Az-Zuhri:</strong> He is Muhammad b. Muslim ibn Shihab az-Zuhri</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Salim:</strong> He is the son of Abdullah b. Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Linguistic Clarification</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Al-Burnus:</strong> Is a type of coat or garment which has a hat sewn onto it. Generally speaking the people of Morocco and Algeria wear such garments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Al-Warsu:</strong> Is a type of plant that has a fragrance which is used to colour garments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Benefits of the Hadith</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">This hadith conveys the manner in which the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam answered questions, in how his answers were complete and sufficient. The questioner asked what should a Muhrim wear but he Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam in his answer mentioned what he should not wear. Indicating, anything besides these things were permissible since this list could be extensive. This is just like a patient asking a Doctor what he could eat and the Doctor replies by saying abstain from such and such thing but you can eat everything else.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The conclusive element of this hadith is the questioner asked about affairs he had a choice over, meaning what he could wear or not wear based on his options or choice. However, the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam further explained other important matters. This was additional knowledge given to the questioner. Once a group of people asked about making Wudu with sea water and the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">“Its water is clean (i.e. pure to make Wudu from) and its dead animals are lawful to consume.”<a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Whereas the question was just concerning Wudu but the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam answered with additional knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">The wearing of the Khuffayn is for the one who does not have shoes or slippers. This position further refutes and answers the people who say the top of the feet should be open whilst in a state of Ihram, this is because leather socks cover the feet completely, therefore their statement has no basis.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>NOTES</strong>   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><a style="color: #003366;" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Sunan Abi Dawud – Kitab at-Taharah – Bab al-Wudu Bima al-Bahr (no. 83), Jam’i at-Tirmidhi Abwab at-Taharah – Bab Ma Ja’a Fi Ma’a al-Bahr Innahu Tahur (no. 69) Shaykh al-Abani authenticated it.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Fazilatush Shaikh Abdullah Nasir Rehmani</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Amir Jamiyyah Ahlul Hadith Sindh</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Translated &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>[1] When Fasting Is Obligated</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The obligation of fasting the month of Ramadhan commences when the month begins. The commencing or beginning of the month is determined in three ways,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The First Way</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Through observing the moon. Allah says <strong>“…So whoever of you sights (the crescent) the month (of Ramadhan) he must observe the fasts…” (Surah al-Baqarah:185)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <strong>“Fasting by observing (the moon crescent).”</strong> (<em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> (1909), <em>Sahih Muslim</em> (1081/19).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Therefore, fasting becomes obligatory upon the who observes the moon.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The Second Way</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">An individual does not see the moon himself but reports of observation are conveyed to him. If the one who saw or the one relaying the news is trustworthy, honest and obligated of the commands of Allah, their reports will be accepted. This is supported by the narration of Abdullah bin Amr RadhiAllahu Anhu who said<strong>, “Once people were in doubt regarding the observation of the moon and so I informed Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam that I had seen the moon. He Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam then fasted himself and ordered others to also fast.”</strong> (<em>Abu Dawud </em>(2342), <em>Ibn Hibban</em> (3447), <em>Hakim</em> (1541), <em>ad-Daraqutni</em> (2127)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>The Third Way</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">By completing 30 days of the month of Sha’ban If on the 29<sup>th</sup> the moon is not observed. Whether this is due to clouds, poor visibility or other environmental factors. The evidence for this is the statement of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, <strong>“A month can be 29 days so do not (begin [the month]) fast until you see (the moon) and break the fast (ie end the month) until you see (the moon) and if its overcast then complete the month (ie. 30 days).</strong>” (<em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> (1907), <em>Sahih Muslim</em> (2499) and its Muslims wording)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">We have specified the meaning of the words <strong>“then complete the month”</strong> to mean 30 days by using the hadith of Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu which mentions, <strong>“If it is overcast, complete 30 days (of Sha’ban)”</strong> (<em>Sahih al-Bukhari </em>(1909), <em>Sahih Muslim</em> (2516) and its Muslims wording).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Remember, it is impermissible to fast on the day one has doubts about it. Ammar bin Yasir RadhiAllahu Anhu said, <strong>“Whoever fasted on the day they doubted have disobeyed Abul Qasim Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.”</strong> (<em>Imam al-Bukhari</em> transmitted this in Kitab as-Sawm, Chapter: Fast when you see the crescent, in ta’liq form)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Similarly, fasting a day or two before Ramadhan is also impermissible. Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <strong>“</strong><strong>None of you should fast a day or two before the month of Ramadhan unless he has the habit of fasting </strong>(eg Modays or Thursday)<strong> then he may fast that day.&#8221;</strong> (<em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> (1914), <em>Sahih Muslim</em> (1082),<em> Musnad Ahmad</em> (7722).</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">By</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Aqeel al-Hindi</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the charges against the people of hadith is that their role within Islamic scholastics is one of compilation and transcription of the Sunnah for its benefit as a legislative source for those with the tools who fully understand it and can use it. Those who follow this line of thought argue that the one-dimensional role of the scholars of Hadith can be juxtaposed with the more complex, intricate and cognitive role of the Fuqaha. While it is true that it <em>can</em> be the case that a memoriser of Ahadith may not have complete understanding of what they convey<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, to tar the people of hadith in their entirety with such a brush is an injustice at best and libellous at worst. As will be demonstrated in this article, the well-known scholars of Hadith were individuals whose faculties for memorisation <em>and</em> understanding of the narrations they conveyed were gifts from Allah, as their works attest to.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another result of this fallacy is the assertion that the books of Ahadith are purportedly too complex for anyone other than a scholar of fiqh to benefit from and the layperson is to be warned against reading them, for fear of misunderstanding and going astray. This categorisation of the books of the Sunnah as such lowers their status to one of repositories of information, to be accessed by the elite few who have understanding. While it is true that the people of knowledge will appreciate and gain more from the books of hadith than the layperson, the success that Allah has granted the scholars of hadith in their works, in terms of their practical abilities to compile their works, as well as the thought that went in to their works, means that their books are far more than stores of Ahadith and that the layperson can pick up one of these books and learn about the religion of Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As demonstrated in the article in issue no.4, &gt;&gt;&gt; <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/imam-al-bukhari-was-a-muwahhid-salafi-athari-not-a-muqallid-partisan-or-blind-follower-of-any-madhhab-he-was-upon-the-madhhab-of-ahlul-hadith/">Imam al-Bukhari was a Muwahhid and Salafi in his Aqidah and Manhaj</a></strong></span>. One of the sources of his Aqidah is his book, the Sahih. The oft-cited principle when reading the Sahih of Imam Bukhari is that his fiqh is understood through his chapter headings. So chapter headings and the titles of books within the Sahih give an understanding as relates to his Aqidah, which he based upon the Athar. Al-Mustamla narrated in his report of the Sahih adds to the chapter heading of the book of Tawhid, <em>‘The Book of Tawhid; a Rebuttal of the Jahmiyyah and other than them’.</em> Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar comments, under the chapter heading of Tawhid:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The intent behind the narration of al-Mustamla: and other than them” is the Qadariyyah. As for the Khawarij, that which relates to them proceeded in the Book of Fitan and the Rafidah in the Book of Ahkam. And these four groups are the heads of innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Hafiz’s words show that the Sahih of Imam al-Bukhari is rich in terms of its Aqidah-based content that rebuts the fundamentals of the major groups of deviation. This richness is not, however, restricted to Aqidah. Matters relating to the relaying of Ahadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, fiqh<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, the virtues of righteous actions<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> and other than this can be derived from the Sahih. Some of the scholars have taken this a step further by compiling works that that have been derived from the two Sahihs, al-Bukhari and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The books of Sunan, particularly Abu Dawud’s and at Tirmidhi’s, also demonstrate the understanding and the compiler’s had of the implications Ahadith carried, their relevance to the sciences of fiqh and the relative stances of the people of knowledge relating to them. Abu Dawud, for example, states in his <em>Sunan</em> after reporting the Hadith of Uthman relating the wudhu of the Prophet ﷺ,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The authentic Ahadith of Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, all indicate that wiping over the head is done once, for they (the narrators) mentioned the actions of wudhu thrice and mentioned the wiping of the head without mentioning the number of times, as they did for the other actions.</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also clarifies some meanings contained in Ahadith; <em>‘…give her food when you eat, clothe her when clothe yourself, do not strike her on the face, do not revile her or leave her except in the house’</em> Abu Dawud stated:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The meaning of ‘Do not revile her’ is to say [to her] ‘May Allah revile you.’</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to fiqh-based intricacies and clarifying meanings, he also explains the meanings of terminology that is not often used in Arabic (Ghara’ib) in numerous Ahadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholastic weight of Imam at Tirmidhi is equally evident in his Jam’i, as attested to by Ibn al-Athir, where he mentions its distinguishing features among the books of Ahadith, namely: its ordering and lack of repetition; mentioning the views of the fiqhi Madhahib and how they respectively deduce rulings; explanation of the Ahadith, in terms of their grade of authentic, sound, weak, gharib and mu’alal; explaining the names of the narrators, their monikers and kunyas, and additional points of benefit that pertain to the sciences of rijal and the book of Ellal at the end of the Jami<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Having established the richness of the books of Hadith, we can now focus on how to benefit from them. This has been outlined by countless scholars when discussing the Manhaj of the student of knowledge in acquiring knowledge. A fitting example here would be the Muhaddith of Yemen, Shaykh Muqbil b. Hadi al-Wadi’, a scholar whose call to the Quran and the Sunnah, and particular emphasis on Ahadith, caused changes on a societal level in his native lands. He states:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fact that some beginner seekers of knowledge in the field of Ahadith err [in their endeavours] is taken up by their antagonists, who use the errors to justify driving them away from their Manhaj [that of the people of hadith]. However, I advise my brothers to acquire what they can from the books of Ahadith and dedicate themselves to reading them – and as for the one who says that whoever’s Shaykh is a book will err more than they are correct, this is only if they do not choose the most fitting book and do not refer to the statements of the scholars relating to the hadith – and acting upon knowledge that has been found [al-Wijadah] is permissible. They should refer to the explanations that the people of the Sunnah have given and if they see in the books of Hadith something that contradicts what the people around them are upon, they should look to see what the people of knowledge have said about the Ahadith in terms of its authenticity and in terms of its meanings. If the Hadith is authentic and the meaning has been understood correctly, it has not been abrogated and you have checked in the explanations that it is not a general hadith that has been made specific elsewhere, or an unrestricted hadith that has been restricted elsewhere, do so if you can. If they are in an environment in which the community have an acceptance of the Sunnah and have trust in them, they should teach them with statements and actions. If they are in an environment in which the community do not have acceptance of the Sunnah, nor do they have trust in them, they should strive to encourage them to act in accordance to the Sunnah and request evidences [for practices].<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Compiled by</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Abu Hibban</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Many claim that Imām Bukhārī was an Ashʿarī, Ṣūfī, or a fanatic to a particular Madhhab, or … and the claims continue! Yet the most authentic book accepted by all the Muslims after the Quran Imam Bukhārī’s ‘Ṣaḥīḥ’ completely contradicts what the claimant’s state. What follows is merely an aerial view of some of Bukhārī’s beliefs as put forward in his ‘Ṣaḥīḥ’ set out as elementary level for easy understanding. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>READINGS FROM SAHIH BUKHARĪ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Book: Oneness, Uniqueness of Allāh (Tawḥīd)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Chapter: The Prophet (</strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>) inviting his followers to Tawḥīd of Allāh</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Ibn ʿAbbās: When the Prophet (ﷺ) sent Muʿādh to Yemen, he said to him, &#8220;You are going to a nation from the people of the Scripture, so let the first thing to which you will invite them, be the Tawḥīd of Allāh. If they learn that, tell them that Allāh has enjoined on them, five prayers to be offered in one day and one night. And if they pray, tell them that Allāh has enjoined on them Zakat of their properties and it is to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor. And if they agree to that, then take from them Zakat but avoid the best property of the people.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Our Noble Prophet began with Tawḥīd and he obligated it upon others to also do the same as one can clearly see from the ḥadīth of the noble Companion Muʿādh. For it is the belief in Tawḥīd and a warning from shirk for which all the messengers were sent <strong>[16:36] </strong>and Allāh will not forgive Shirk and may only do so if one repents before he dies <strong>[4:48]. </strong>Therefore, we can see why it is vital and obligatory to start with Tawḥīd, as it is the foundation upon which all other aspects of worship are built.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">It is a travesty that we have sects today who claim to follow the way of our Prophet but totally make up their own rules of giving daʿwah and what daʿwah should be given to. Some sects such as Ikhwān al-Muslimīn start their daʿwah by calling people to politics and to join the struggle to overthrow rulers, which is itself against the Sunnah! The Jamāt at-Tablīgh are another example, they call to their invented charter and the Tablighī Niṣāb with the call of ‘as long as you establish Salah then this is the most important thing’, clearly this is not true for Shirk nullifies all good deeds<strong> [6:88]</strong> and it is against the Sunnah of the methodology of our prophet in calling people to Allāh as per the ḥadīth of Muʿādh and the call of all the prophets as stated in the Qurʾān. Therefore, it’s an obligation that we don’t go beyond the Sunnah of the Prophet in any affair and abandon all these innovated sects and methodologies and stick to the truth.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">The Tablighī responds and says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">We make the people repent from sin the details Tawḥīd and shirk can follow later.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">[as argued by modern day leader of Tablighi’s, Mawlāna Ṭāriq Jamīl in a pre-recorded lecture broadcast on PTV 2013. In other words, the individual is left upon his Shirk and Bidʿah and may never be corrected by them! Then this argument by the head of Bidʿah in the religion Ṭāriq Jamīl was actually responded to by Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah hundreds of years earlier wherein he debated with a Sufi who made a similar claim [to that of Ṭāriq Jamīl] to which Ibn Taymiyyah responded:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">And some of them [the Ṣūfis] have said: we make people repent. I [Shaykh ul-Islam] said: you make them repent from what? He [the Ṣūfī] said: from thievery, highway robbery and so forth. I [Shaykh ul-Islam] said: their condition before you make them repent is better than their condition after you made them repent; verily, they were transgressors and they used to believe that what they were upon is unlawful, they were hoping for the mercy of Allāh and repenting to Him or intending to repent. By having them repenting, you made them misguided, polytheists who have deserted from the divine Islamic law, who love what Allāh hates and hate what Allāh loves. And I [Shaykh ul-Islam] have clarified that these innovations that them and others are upon are worse than sins.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Chapter: “(He Alone is) the All-Knower of the Unseen, and He reveals to none His Unseen.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Ibn ʿUmar: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The keys of the unseen are five and none knows them but Allāh: (1) None knows (the sex) what is in the womb, but Allāh: (2) None knows what will happen tomorrow, but Allāh; (3) None knows when it will rain, but Allāh; (4) None knows where he will die, but Allāh (knows that); (5) and none knows when the Hour will be established, but Allāh.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Masruq: ʿAiʿshah said, “If anyone tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord, he is a liar, for Allāh says: <strong>“No vision can grasp Him.” (6.103)</strong> And if anyone tells you that Muhammad has seen the Unseen, he is a liar, for Allāh says: <strong>“None has the knowledge of the Unseen but Allāh.”</strong><a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">We can see the clear, precise and concise words collected by the Imām of Imām ul-Anbiyā and his noble wife, our Mother Aisha concerning the fact that it is only Allāh that has the knowledge of the unseen, that is ‘Ilm ul Ghayb’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Consider the words carefully, for the noble prophet is saying “The keys of the unseen are five and none knows them but Allāh,” this excludes all of creation, including our Noble prophet from having knowledge of these matters. Yet the Ṣūfī Qubūrī lies against the Nabī and gives him that which only belongs to Allāh alone all in the name of ‘loving the prophet’! such ‘love’ was not the belief of the prophet or his companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Furthermore, our Mother Aiʿshah calls the person a ‘liar’ who says the prophet has Ilm ul-Ghayb. What then of Aḥmad Raza Khān Barailwī who states:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">The Prophet has knowledge of all the unseen including that which has been, will be, even down to how many turns the leaf shall take before touching the ground.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">What then of Ashraf ʿAlī Thanwī who said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">The prophets knowledge of the unseen is something that is established beyond any doubt and such knowledge of the unseen was even given to Allāhs friends Awliyā who knew what was inside the womb.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Truthful or liars? For those who have a sickness in their heart they may say this was merely the opinion of Aisha then they should know that she substantiated what she said with the verse of the Quran <strong>“None has the knowledge of the Unseen but Allāh.&#8221;</strong> Alḥamdulillāh, sufficient for us is the belief of our Prophet and noble mother.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Walillahil Hamd Imam Bukharī was not a Muqallid, Partisan, Blind Follower of any Madhhab but was upon the Madhhab of the Salaf!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Many who are fanatics [but they may not know or acknowledge this] towards there Madhhab oft repeat the mantra that <em>‘There is Ijma/consensus that the ummah blindly followed one of the four Madhhabs’</em> and that ‘<em>The scholars of Islam such as Imam Bukhari and others were all blind followers of a Madhhab’</em>. This short article is a result of notes for lessons, presented to my students, May Allah bless them, taken from notes when we covered the subject area of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">The article shall illustrate that Imam Bukhari was not a fanatic towards the Madhhabs or a blind follower as opined by the Madhhabists but instead his belief and methodology was to accept the Sunnah even if that was in opposition to the fatwa or verdict of any Imam, his own teachers or the Madhhabs!! From amongst 100 plus examples studied, a few are illustrated below:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>[1] &#8211; </strong>It is established within the Hanafi Madhhab in particular by Imam Abu Hanifa and Abu Yusuf that the water that remains unused in a tumbler after wudhu is impure.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> Imam Bukhari responded to this by placing the hadith chapter heading as:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Chapter: The using of the remaining water after ablution</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">He then followed up his chapter heading with the following authentic hadith:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Abu Juhaifa: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) came to us at noon and water for ablution was brought to him. After he had performed ablution, the remaining water was taken by the people and they started smearing their bodies with it (as a blessed thing). The Prophet (ﷺ) offered two rak`at of the Zuhr prayer and then two rak’at of the Asr prayer while a short spear (or stick) was there (as a Sutra) in front of him.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong><em>Comment:</em></strong> This illustrates that the way and Manhaj of Imam Bukhari was to present and follow the Sunnah and sayings of the Salaf, regardless of whom may have opposed them! The blind followers of Madhhabs will have such flowery titles before their names but will seldom, rather never, leave their Madhhab for any evidence or narration that may oppose it!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>[2] &#8211; </strong>Imam Sufyan al-Thawri and the people of Kufah held the view that the Women folk are not to attend the eclipse prayer in congregation<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>. Imam Bukhari challenged this view and opposed it by bringing the following chapter heading and narration:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Chapter: Offering of Eclipse prayer by women along with men</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Fatima bint Al-Mundhir: Asma&#8217; bint Abi Bakr said: I came to Aisha the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) during the solar eclipse. The people were standing and offering the prayer and she was also praying too. I asked her, &#8216;What has happened to the people?&#8217; … to the end of the narration.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong><em>Comment:</em></strong> No matter how esteemed or renowned an Imam may have been if they opposed the traditions and evidence Imam Bukhari rejected their standpoint giving precedence to the Sunnah! The narration also exemplifies the status and position of our Mother Aisha () in being a scholar and one from whom verdicts and Fatawa were taken despite the detractors!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>[3] &#8211; </strong>The illustrious trustworthy Tabi’, Imam Mujahid held the position that the one performing the Hajj should wear the Ihram and thereafter mark out his sacrifice.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> Imam Bukhari refuted this with the following chapter and narration:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Chapter: Marking and garlanding (the Hadi) at Dhul-Hulaifa and then assuming Ihram</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan: The Prophet (ﷺ) set out from Medina with over one thousand of his companions (at the time of the Treaty of Hudaibiya) and when they reached Dhul-Hulaifa, the Prophet (ﷺ)  garlanded his Hadi and marked it and assumed Ihram for Umrah.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Aisha: I twisted with my own hands the garlands for the Budn of the Prophet (ﷺ) who garlanded and marked them, and then made them proceed to Makkah; Yet no permissible thing was regarded as illegal for him then.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong><em>Comment:</em></strong> Hafiz Ibn Hajar in his <em>Fath</em> comments that Imam Bukharī has refuted the position of Imam Mujahid by formulating the chapter heading and providing his evidence in support.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Also ironically the words related to modern day blind following <em>‘Taqlid’</em> [Qala’id] have been mentioned in the Hadith and chapter heading above in relation to animals and the reality is that in the book and Sunnah such words have never been used in a praiseworthy way for humans but mostly for other things such as this hadith illustrates. Yet, those who call to <em>‘Taqlid’ </em>make it obligatory for the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">Also in the isnad/chain of the Hadith is present Imam al-Zuhri and many modernists<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> who reject hadith have attempted to vilify and attack the reliability and memory of Imam al-Zuhri simply because he narrated some narration which forbid music and musical instruments from our prophet. To serve their own purposes they attacked the Imams of the Sunnah yet they themselves are not even worth a full stop in a footnote in some book! Imam Bukhari who is the Imam of Hadith clearly thought the narrations of Imam al-Zuhri are acceptable despite what many of the rejectionists claim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>[4] &#8211; </strong>Imam Ahmad held the view that the Jumu’ah prayer can be offered before the midday. Imam Bukhari responded by rejecting the position by the following chapter heading and narration:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong>Chapter: The time for the Jumu&#8217;ah (prayer) is after midday</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333300;">Narrated Anas bin Malik: The Prophet (ﷺ) used to offer the Jumu’ah prayer immediately after midday.<a style="color: #333300;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;"><strong><em>Comment:</em></strong> Imam Ibn Battal the explainer of Bukhari states that Imam Bukhari refuted Imam Ahmad and Imam Mujahid by writing the chapter heading that he did.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333300;">This is also a response to those who say that the Salafis are actually Hanbalis, blind followers of Imam Ahmad’s Madhhab. Evidently, this viewpoint is misconceived as the Salafis of the past, such as Imam Bukhari nor the Salafis of today are bigoted and partisan blind followers of the Hanbali Madhhab, Walillahil Hamd.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">(This biography from is <em>Maqalat Irshad ul-Haq Athari</em>, 4:369-403, which I have very slightly adapted)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">[tn. introduction: This a very brief biography of Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi by his astute and perceptive student, Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq Athari. We find that the true people of knowledge have lofty, praiseworthy and beautiful character which is in accordance with the true teaching of Islam. Despite their vast knowledge, you will find them in them humility, modesty and taqwa. This should be a lesson for all aspiring students of knowledge. Seeking fame, status, and using titles which are not befitting for you, is not from the way of the Salaf, and is in fact a dangerous disease of the heart. Do not be amazed with the little knowledge Allah has given you, and never consider yourself above your brothers]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If a person is born with the qualities of knowledge and acting upon it, insight, virtue, truthfulness, zuhd, taqwa, honesty, integrity, intelligence and other qualities then we say this is the likes of <strong>Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi</strong> who died in <strong>Ramadhan 1405H corresponding to 4<sup>th</sup> June 1985</strong> on a Tuesday to meet his creator and left behind thousands grieving his loss.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was unwell for a while and it was during this period that I had the opportunity to meet him every so often. The last occasion was during the last days of Sha’ban (of that year) when his situation worsened and so I went to enquire regarding his health. He was unable to hear and all that remained was an acquaintance, and so I returned home in a state of sadness and grief. People would ask me concerning the Shaykh and I would say to them May Allah wish good for him as his health situation is bad and worrying. Thereafter, after a period of 4 months of illness the Shaykh passed away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The writer of these words sought knowledge and benefitted from the Shaykh in 1968</strong>. Liyaqatpur was my native area and in 1963 I completed the beginner level books from the local deobandi madrassah Qasim al-Ulum. My teachers advised me to go to Jamia Rashidiyyah in Sahiwal or Khayr al-Madaris in Multan (the madrassah of Mawlana Khayr Muhammad Jalandhari) however Mawlana Mufti Abdur Rahman of Kehraurpaka advised me to go al-Jamia al-Salafiyyah in Faisalabad, this was not because he was an Ahl al-Hadith but rather because his friend Shaykh Sharifullah Khan was teaching there, who was considered an expert teacher of the Ma’qulat. So eventually with my father’s permission I enrolled at al-Jamia al-Salafiyyah. However, Shaykh Sharifullah Khan had left al-Jamia al-Salafiyyah in 1962, nonetheless he was replaced by his student, the teacher of the scholars, Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Abdullah Budhiyamalwi.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> After completing the middle level education I went to Gujranwala to Jamia Islamiyyah Chah Shahan in my last year and this is when I had the opportunity to attend the lessons of the Shaykh (Muhammad Ghonadalwi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Lessons</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In my brief life I’ve had the opportunity to attend the lessons of various Shuyukh and teachers of the era but the prestige I experienced in Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi’s lessons I never experienced elsewhere. We had read about the special care and attention Imam Malik would undertake to deliver his lessons, while first performing Wudu, combing his hair, use Kohl and perfume himself, wear fine clothes and then teach, then our Shaykh would also do the same. He would always arrive on time. As soon as he would enter the masjid he would offer 2 rak’ahs for Tahayyatul Masjid and then focus on his lesson on hadith. One day there was torrential rain and the days were very cold, some us assumed that today the Shaykh won’t come and the lesson will be cancelled, however one our friends came running and told us while he was in a state of shock that the Shaykh is coming, so we all scurried and the Shaykh as per his norm, entered the Masjid and prayed his Tahayyah. Mawlana Muhammad Ali Muslim Chima mentioned to me that before the Shaykhs residence in Abadi Hakim Rayy he would travel from Ghondalwala every day by bicycle, we never ever saw him to be late, even once. One day the Shaykh generally mentioned that it has been five (5) years (in the teaching post) and it is Allah’s blessing that I have never been late for Madrassah, not even one day. Alas, where do we find people who fulfil their obligations with such responsibility nowadays.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the Tahayyatul Masjid he would sit in his position with great care composure and begin his lesson. The Shaykh had so much respect and reverence for hadith that even after one and a half hours he would remain sitting calmly in the same position and would at the very least just move his feet up and down, despite tiredness due to age, which is a natural affair. There was no possibility at all of him lying down on a pillow (due to the respect of hadith). During the lesson if he needed to scratch himself somewhere he would not stop saying the beloved words of <strong><em>Qala Qala Rasul Allah….</em></strong> He would respond to the Salam and and say Walaykum Asalam to whoever was attending the lesson. He would turn to the guest as soon as he would finish his lesson, greeting them with a smile and then ask them how they were, thereafter address their reason for coming.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Shaykh’s Qualities</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With Allah’s infinite blessings, he had a remarkable memory and vast knowledge. <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti</strong> wrote the truth when he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“His mind and memory were remarkable and without match. The affair of vast knowledge was as such that when he would talk about a matter, all the discussions and information pertaining to that matter would be put forth and nothing would be missed while his speech was articulate and continuous, there was no hesitancy or stuttering in his speech (when delivering ilm).”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many of his students have verified the veracity of his memory and presented ample testimonies which can be read in the special edition of <strong><em>al-I’tisam, vol.38, issues 1-2</em></strong>. In this regard you may read the testimony of <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Ashraf Sandhu</strong>, he writes:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Shaykh Hafiz Abdullah Amritsari’s memory and recollection was such that he had complete mastery over all books of Ulum and Fiqh. We observed regarding very difficult issues that when he needed to open a book to refer to an issue, then he would be at the right place straight away. This was also the affair with Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi, that whatever book he consulted, the themes and context would be completely preserved and accurate.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The result of this powerful memory was that when he would speak, it would be as if he was turning the pages and reading from the book and there was no feeling that he was slowing down or having difficulty in what he was teaching. He would teach the basics of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> for example, the difference between the Quran and hadith, the difference between Sunnah and khabar, the authority of hadith, the preservation of hadith, the writing of hadith, the categorization of the books of hadith, a summary of the life and times of Imam al-Bukhari, the importance of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari </em>and its authority, likewise and similarly the authority khabar al-wahid, <strong>the specification of khabar al-wahid and issues of apparent contradiction which would last approximately 15-20 days</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-8796 alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?resize=381%2C233" alt="Minhatul Bari" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?resize=300%2C183 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?resize=768%2C468 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?resize=1024%2C624 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?w=1322 1322w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Minhatul-Bari.png?w=1236 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would talk about apparently conflicting narrations and then mention that according to the Shafi’yyah the first stage is reconciliation <strong>(<em>Tatbiq/Jam’</em>)</strong> and if that was not possible then declaring one to be <strong><em>nasikh</em> </strong>and the other <strong><em>mansukh</em></strong> and again if this was not possible then they would try to show one as being <strong><em>rajih</em></strong> and the other <strong><em>marjuh</em></strong> (one has precedence over the other) and if all of this was not possible then the ruling from both reports would be dropped. With the Ahnaf the first stage was abrogation<strong> (<em>naskh</em>),</strong> then giving precedence to one report over the other and then the last stage of trying to reconcile between the two reports <strong>(<em>Tatbiq/Jam’</em>).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While mentioning this he would say that in one instance Mawlana Anwar Shah Kashmiri says that doing <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong> has precedence over <strong><em>tatbiq</em></strong> because taking the <strong><em>rajih</em></strong> position is in line with the human natural disposition. However, at the same time he says and holds the view that it is permissible to specify the Qur’an (made <strong><em>takhsis</em></strong> of) by the Sunnah, whereas this is in reality from the angle of <em>tatbiq</em> and it is absolutely clear and manifest that the Quran is <strong><em>rajih</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, according to the Hanafiyyah specifying the Sunnah with the Sunnah and specifying the Quran with Mutawatir hadith and vice versa is permissible and they do not look at the strength of the evidence in this regard. He further said, (i.e. Shaykh Ghondalwi said) that it is amazing that Mr Kashmiri in this discussion of Usul holds the position of the Hanafiyyah to be correct, in that <em>tarjih</em> is the first stage compared to <em>tatbiq</em> but the various statements of Imam Abu Hanifah contradict this view of the Hanafiyyah. He (Anwar Shah al-Kashmiri) said in <em>Kitab al-Ghusl</em> (in his explanation of <strong><em>Sahih al-Bukhari, Faydh al-Bari</em></strong>) that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Know that different reports which have been transmitted from our Imam on a single issue (i.e. Abu Hanifah), then the general position of our Mashaykh is to give one report <em>tarjih</em> first and to take the manifest report and leave the rare or uncommon report but I do not take this view. This is especially the case when the rare or uncommon report is supported by hadith, then in such instances I take that report without caring that it is a rare or uncommon report. This is because any reports from our Imam, May Allah have mercy on him (despite being rare) it is not possible that he did not have evidence from the ahadith or anything else and so if we find the hadith agrees with his report, then we take it. Yes, and if there is disparity between the views of the Mashaykh,<strong> <em>tarjih</em> </strong>is a possibility due to differences between them and sometimes reconciliation between their statements may defy the purpose of the difference. This is because there is no option other than <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong> contrary to the differences that emanate from a single person, when reconciliation has precedence. This is because the principle is that there should not contradictions in the statement of a single individual and therefore reconciliation should take precedence before making <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong>. It is strange that when our people see apparently contradictory ahadith, they try to reconcile them but when they find differences in statements of the Imam they take up the position of <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong> first and leave the method of reconciliation. I like that the contradictory statements that have from our Imam to be first reconciled provided there is no evidence established against this.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You clearly see his words (i.e. Anwar Shah Kashmiri’s) and then in the introduction<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> he gives <em>tarjih</em> precedence over reconciliation but then on the other hand when there are differences in the views or statements of a person,  he holds that reconciliation has precedence over <strong><em>tarjih</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In summary Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi would deliver some introductory lessons for a number of days before teaching <em>al-Bukhari</em>. During his lessons he would not only suffice with explaining why the hadith was under the relevant chapter heading, clarification of the juristic points from the hadith, discussions on the controversial issues, a clarification and explanation of the difficult words, but he would also, while treading the path of the scholars of hadith, present brief biographies of the narrators in the chain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example, during the explanation of the first hadith in <em>al-Bukhari</em>, regarding the point of <strong><em>“Hadathana al-Humaydi”</em> </strong>Imam al-Bukhari transmit the hadith from his famous teacher, Imam Abdullah bin al-Zubayr al-Humaydi al-Qurayshi al-Makki, who in turn was the student of Imam al-Shafi’i and of al-Qurayshi lineage. Imam al-Humaydi collated his narrations as a Musnad which has been printed in two volumes. Imam al-Bukhari, by transmitting from Imam al-Humaydi intended to show revelation began in Makkah and thus transmitted his first hadith from his Makki Shaykh. Likewise, and similarly, since Imam al-Humaydi was a Qurayshi and due to the Prophets Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam’s words, <strong><em>“Begin with the Quraysh”</em> </strong>he transmitted his hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since Imam al-Humaydi was Imam al-Shafi’is student, the student like his teacher was also critical of Ahl al-Rayy. Since Imam al-Bukhari had severely criticized Imam Abu Hanifah and some of the hanafi scholars said that Imam al-Bukhari’s criticism of Imam Abu Hanifah was due to the influence of Imam al-Humaydi and his other teacher, Nu’aym b. Hammad, whereas this is incorrect. Imam Muslim and Imam al-Nasa’i also criticized Imam Abu Hanifah, so were they also influenced by Imams al-Humaydi and Nu’aym b. Hammad? There is another al-Humaydi who is famous and he is Imam Abu Abdullah Muhammad b. Abi Nasr, who collated the (biographies) of the narrators of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em> and he was the student of Imam Ibn Hazm.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The second narrator in the chain is Sufyan and there are two famous scholars of hadith with this name. One is Sufyan al-Thawri and the other was Sufyan b. Uyaynah. They were the contemporaries of Imam Malik and from the most trustworthy scholars of hadith in Makkah. Imam al-Shafi’i said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If it were not for Malik and Ibn Uyaynah knowledge in Hijaz would have departed.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Uyaynah like Imam Malik was from the Taba Tabi’in and I remember him vividly saying this part that he read the footnotes of Mawlana Ahmad Ali Saharanpuri (Hanafi) who referred to him as <strong>“Makki al-Tabi’i”</strong> and then said he made a mistake. So he would introduce the narrators comprehensively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the characteristics of the scholars of hadith is that they also sought knowledge from people who were lower (in knowledge or younger) than them in status without any hesitation which led to a specific category in the science of hadith, <strong>‘the narrations of the senior from the junior’</strong>. No matter how many amazing qualities a teacher has, he is still a human at the end of the day and who is free from error or mistakes? Imam Abdullah b. Mubarak said: <em><strong>“Who is safe from error.”</strong></em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> So if a teacher makes a mistake and then his student corrects him in the gathering then the Muhaddith wont feel any anger nor have animosity for the student because the fundamental aim is serve knowledge without any inkling for fame. Our Hafiz was also an example of these qualities. Hence, once during the lesson on <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> we were going over <em>Kitab al-Manaqib</em> and we got to the hadith of Anas RadiAllahu Anhu pertaining to the mi’raj. Sharik b. Abdullah narrates from Anas RadiAllahu Anhu and while discussing the hadith, Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Sharik b. Abdullah made a mistake in this hadith, he was unable to preserve the wording of the narration due to his weak memory. When he became the Qadi of Kufah his memory deteriorated and changed. Other than changing the chronology of the explanation and the details he presented for, ‘thumma Haddathana Fatadli’ the scholars of hadith have criticized this.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When he finished speaking I gathered my courage and said, Shaykh this is not Sharik b. Abdullah al-Nakha’i al-Qadi but in fact it is Sharik b. Abdullah ibn Abi Nimr because Imam al-Bukhari did not take any narrations from Sharik Qadi.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> However Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi disagreed and said the individual was Sharik Qadi. However, I still gathered courage and expressed the same view and then the Shaykh stayed quiet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The next day as per usual the Shaykh after reciting the khutbah addressed me and said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“What you were saying yesterday is correct the narrator is not Sharik Qadi but rather it is Sharik b. Abdullah bin Abi Nimr, who is truthful but he made mistakes and the scholars of hadith have criticised some of the wordings of this narration.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One can learn the open mindedness of the Shaykh from this example and an expansive readiness to accept the truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While explaining the ahadith under the <strong>“Bab Halwatul Iman” (The Chapter on the sweetness of Iman”</strong> he said the reality of Iman and its sweetness is something physical and something that one can also feel when one has hatred and dislike for sins, his soul is refreshed (tr. This means he feels his Iman increasing) which causes nur to flourish on the individual due to righteous actions on a truthful believer and therefore sometimes he smells something foul on evil sins and something fragrant due to good deeds. The Shaykh went on to present numerous evidences for this and also mentioned the narration of Jabir b. Abdullah RadhiAllahu Anhu that he was with the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam when a foul smell arose so the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Do you know what this foul stench is? This is the smell from the mouth of the people who backbite the Muslims”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, the hadith:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“When a person lies the angels due to his lying, move away from him.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So I asked the Shaykh is it possible that can happen even now, i.e. being able to smell the fragrance or a foul smell due to deeds. The Shaykh replied the Companions would also experience this which was due to the favours and blessings of Allah upon them. So, if a person maintains a strong powerful link with Allah he would perhaps also experience this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another incident is what is mentioned by <strong>Muhammad Rafiq</strong>, when I saw him I told him that I was studying with Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi and upon hearing his name he was pleasantly surprised. So I asked him if he knew him and he replied very well. Then he mentions that he used to live in Sheikhpura and during the night he would hear a sound in the drains which would increase day by day. We called many people to recite but nothing worked. Then someone advised us to get Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi to do ruqyah, so we bought him to our house and he stayed the night and then when leaving in the morning he advised us to disperse some water throughout the house on which he had recited. This not only helped with the problem but we also smelt roses on the house for three days, so he is indeed a great scholar and sitting with him is an indispensable treasure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another incident which the Shaykh narrated to us was something that occurred during his teaching spell in the Islamic University of Madinah. There was a person who would have severe pain in his back which would start suddenly. The Shaykh instructed him to come to him when the pain arose. So one day he came and the Shaykh put his hand on the pain and informed the person the pain was due to the effect of magic. So the Shaykh did ruqyah on him for a few days and Allah cured him. So I asked the Shaykh how did he know magic was done on him. The Shaykh replied that when I put my hand on his back I could smell a foul stench and I realized this was due to the effect of magic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Under <strong>Kitab al-Ilm</strong>, in the chapter to fix duties in rotation for learning knowledge Imam al-Bukhari cites the hadith of Umar RadhiAllahu Anhu that briefly talks about the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam divorcing his wives. The Shaykh went onto say that Allamah Shibli Nu’mani expressed the view the hadith indicates the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam had divorced his wives but this was only a false rumour and that <strong>Hafiz ibn Hajr</strong> said this false rumour was perhaps spread by a hypocrite, Shibli Nu’mani thus concludes, that narrations in that period were fabricated based on the analogical reasoning (qiyas) of the narrator and therefore the narrations must be scrutinised to see how much of he narration was based on the qiyas of the narrator.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While discussing this Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi said this was a historical event during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and irrespective of the type of rumours, everything must be investigated. Allah says: <strong>“When a fasiq comes to you then verify.” (Surah al-Hujurat:6)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam had exemplary interactions with his wives but despite this he separated from them for a month. It is also possible that a hypocrite may have spread this rumour, however this has no connection whatsoever with the Ahadith of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam but just one incident. The same incident was investigated by Umar RadhiAllahu Anhu and the reality of the issue became clear. The Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam separating from his wives for a month, is something which is established. Qiyas or the rumour is only connected to the understanding of the narrator that the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam divorced his wives and then to form a principle that there is analogical reasoning in the Prophetic Ahadith by a narrator is totally incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then the Shaykh went onto discuss (the issues with) Allamah Shibli’s interpretation and understanding of narrations.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> The Shaykh also said Shibli also rejects the hadith of Qartas (i.e. the hadith of the paper and inkwell during the last days of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam), he claims it was only narrated by Abdullah b. Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma when he was young.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi explained, this view of Allamah Shibli is incorrect because Abdullah b. Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma narrated the incident during the era of the companions and numerous students narrated it from him and when it was not denied or rejected by a single one of them is a reality of its authenticity and just because only one companion transmits a narration does not cause it to be spurious. Abdullah b. Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma also narrated the hadith of talaq and likewise Umar RadhiAllahu Anhu narrated the hadith, actions are by intentions and no other companion narrates this hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The summary of these points is that Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi did not only rely on the books explaining al-Bukhari and other books of hadith but that he was also aware of the disease of the hadith rejectionists in the subcontinent. He also authored two specific books against the hadith rejectionists.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While discussing a mutual issue between a hadith transmitted by Imam al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>There are five types of kissing</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) The kissing of Rahmah, when a parent kisses their child, like the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam kissed Hasan, Hussayn and Fatimah RadhiAllahu Anhum</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) The kissing of greeting, like when Muslims meet each other which is the practice in the Arab lands</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) The kissing of compassion, when children kiss their parents</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) The kissing of desires, when a husband and wife kiss.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) The kissing of love i.e. family, when a brother kisses his brother.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the chapter of writing Ahadith the first hadith Imam al-Bukhari mentions is the hadith of Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu which mentions his sahifah, which contains the hadith: <em>“A Muslim must not be killed for disbeliever.” </em>Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi said while discussing this hadith that the 3 Imams, Malik al-Shafi’i and Ahmad issued their legal edicts in conformation to this hadith. However, Imam Abu Hanifah was of the view that if a Muslims kills a dhimmi then the Muslim shall be killed in retaliation. Allamah Kashmiri has defended the Imam and after a long discussion he presents the following four answers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) In the hadith the disbeliever that is referred to is a combatant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) This hadith is in relation to stopping the blood spilt in the days of ignorance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) The ruling concerning the life of a dhimmi is the same as a Muslims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) During the sermon of the conquest of Makkah the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam announced the laws of retribution for the killing of a Muslim and the dhimmi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These four points that are provided in answer are far fetched and incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) Explaining that the disbeliever in the hadith is a war combatant is an extremely superficial point because the blood of a combatant is permissible irrespective anyway. In fact this understanding is in relation to an attribute and Allamah Shawkani has explained that this understanding is also unreliable according to the hanafi scholars themselves.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) Restricting the hadith to the blood of the people of ignorance is a claim that is without evidence and specifying or restricting something without evidence or proof is impermissible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) The dhimmi is terms of his life is not equal to that of a Muslim, Allah says: <strong>“The people of the fire and the people of Jannah are not equal.” (Surah al-Hashr:20)</strong> he also said: <strong>“</strong><strong>and never will Allah give the disbelievers over the believers a way”</strong> <strong>(Surah al-Nisa:141)</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> and what has been transmitted by Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu: <strong><em>“The Muslims are equal in their retribution of blood.” </em></strong>Therefore, saying the dhimmi is equal to the Muslim in terms of the sanctity of life is incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) During the conquest of Makkah thinking the Muslims and the dhimmis were being addressed in wrong in the first place because the disbelievers are not permitted to enter Makkah and Mr Kashmiri himself, the incident he refers to he says the person was not a dhimmi but rather a someone who fell into the ruling of a dhimmi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being, the Shaykh was mindful of the various explanations of Bukhari from <strong><em>Fath al-Bari, Umdah al-Qari</em></strong> as well as Allamah Kashmiri’s notes, <strong>Faydh al-Bari</strong> and at times he would vehemently express his views when needed. Sometimes he would answer Mr Kashmiri and the Shafiyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once I asked the Shaykh:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Did you meet ever Allamah Kashmiri and have a discussion with him? He replied no, “I never met him, however, once he came to a conference organized by Mawlana Abdul Wahid and in those days an Arab student of knowledge used to study with me. So the student visited Mawlana Kashmiri and discussed some issues of aqidah with him. After his discussion with the Mawlana, any issues the student didn’t understand, he would come and ask me (and I would clarify them to him). So, this coming and going to Mawlana Kashmiri continued for a few days. In the end while leaving him, the student said to him (i.e. Mawlana Kashmiri):</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>لولا الشيخ محمد جوندلوي لأضللتني</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If it were not for al-Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi, you would have misguided me.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Shaykh as a Mufassir</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I also benefitted from the Shaykh while he explained and translated the meaning of the Qur’an. First the Shaykh would begin with discussion the issue of the Qur’an being the speech of Allah which would be followed by explaining the difference between the Quran and Hadith, defining the knowledge of tafsir, the methodology of tafsir, tafsir via transmitted reports and tafsir through opinion as well as other sciences like reason for revelation etc. Once I asked which tafsir was better, he replied if Mawlana Abdul Aziz Muhaddith Dehlawi had completed his tafsir it would have been unrivalled.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our Hafiz and Shaykh was also expert exegetist of the Quran in addition to being a great Muhaddith. I heard from some of the teachers in al-Jamia al-Salafiyyah that when the Shaykh was teaching there, he would deliver lessons on the Quran after the morning prayer and he took 10 months just on Surah al-Fatihah. While at al-Jamia Islamiyyah in Gujranwala, the Shaykh would deliver the Khutbah in Masjid of the Jamia. Shaykh Isma’il al-Salafi was also alive at the time and his sermons were also extraordinary on a range of issues and also include guidance on the socio-political issues which would also be published in <em><strong>al-I’tisam</strong></em> magazine. However, despite this I would pray behind Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi and I would be eager to know what the subject of the khutbah would be each week. The reader will be astonished to know, as I was, that the Shaykh spent almost a whole year explaining the ayah <strong>“He has certainly succeeded who purifies himself And mentions the name of his Lord and prays.”</strong> <strong>(Surah al-A’la: 14-15)</strong> in his Friday sermons every week.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh would say while detailing the requirements of the person who explains the Quran that: “It is necessary for an explainer of the Quran to have the following requirements, to have the correct belief accompanied with the correct intention, having knowledge of hadith and its sciences, the language of the Quran and that he should have comprehensive understanding of Imam Raghib’s <em><strong>Mufradat al-Quran</strong></em>. He must know Sarf, Nahw, the meanings, the knowledge of fiqh and its principles, speculative rhetoric and the knowledge of the variant methods in recitation, so that Allah’s aids him in his explanation.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It can be said without any hesitation that Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi possessed all these qualities and requirements. He would explain the ayah, <strong>“You Alone we worship and you alone we ask for help</strong>”<strong> (Surah al-Fatihah: 4)</strong> in a way that the listeners would be astounded. He would explain in detail the meaning of worship, the difference between worship and habitual norms or customs, why and how Allah should be worshipped and the reasons for worship. In this regard he would explain the difference between worship and obedience and refute the ideas of <strong>Allamah Mashriqi </strong>and<strong> Mawlana Mawdudi</strong>, who would say that establishing Allah’s law (on earth) was in essence and in reality worship and that the prayer, fasting and zikr were merely part of a training course.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh also clarified the difference between worship and obedience and also refuted the ideology and principles of <strong>Mawlana Mawdudi</strong> in a specific book titled, <em><strong>Tanqid al-Masa’il</strong> </em>which is printed. The book does not have the publication date, but it seems to be around 1957ce, this was when Mawlana Mawdudi deviated from his methodology of da’wah all of a sudden, and he would describe the first method of da’wah as the way of the Prophets. Thereafter, contrary to the first method, when he adopted the scientific method of da’wah, aiming for success and reformation with elections and leadership as a policy, which he declared to be prohibited and impermissible before.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people of knowledge know, with this (new) decision and policy of his, 70 of his close allies left him, some of whom were considered the pivotal central core of <strong>Jamat Islami</strong>. It has been a few years his previous associates refuted him, i.e. Mawlana Mawdudi’s understanding of worship, which include the likes of <strong>Mawlana Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi</strong> in his <strong><em>“Asr Hadhir Mein Din Ki Tafhim wa Tashrih” </em></strong>(The Understanding and Explanation of the Religion in Current Times) and Mawlana Manzur Ahmad Nu’mani’s <strong><em>“Mawlana Mawdudi Ke Sath Meri Rafaqat ki Sarghazisht Awr Ab Mera Mawqif”</em></strong> (The History of my Association with Mawlana Mawdudi and My Position on him Now) only when <strong>Mawlana Mawdudi’s</strong> book, <strong><em>“Quran Ki Char Bunyadi Istalahain”</em></strong> (Four Fundamental principles of the Quran) started to emerge in the market. However, our Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Ghondalwi sensed the danger way earlier and comprehensively refuted him in his <em><strong>Tanqid al-Masa’il</strong></em> and warned the nation from the dangerous ideas of Mawlana Mawdudi. May Allah give him a great reward, Amin. I wish to expand on his more but this is not the place for this, however, the avid reader can refer to <em><strong>Tanqid al-Masa’il.</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh said regarding the reality of ghulu while explaining the ayah <strong>“do not commit excess in your religion” Surah al-Nisa:171</strong> that Allah and his Messenger established the limits for the affairs of the Din and therefore exceeding that does not entail reward but rather it entails punishment. Exceeding the prescribed limits in the Din is ghulu and excessiveness. If this excessiveness is in belief, transactions, in places and situations it is considered ghulu, if it is in knowledge then it is considered to be implementation and if it is regarding mannerisms and worship then it is considered to be monasticism, if it is in customs or habits then it is considered compulsion. If it is it do with purification and to keep impurities away it is considered to be whisperings and if it is regarding the lack of preservation of the usul and furu then it is considered to be oppression.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said in explanation of the ayah <strong>“O you who have believed, enter into Islam completely” (Surah al-Baqarah:208)</strong> this ayah commands complete submission and obedience to Islam and a warning against the path of the misguided nations which traversed the path of shaytan <strong>“So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part” Surah al-Baqarah:85</strong>. It is incorrect to take some aspects of Islam and reject the rest and one can only abstain from misguidance after research. It is taqlid that pushed fanaticism and partisanship in Islam. The dissension and discord between the Hanafi’s and Shafi’s was so intense that let alone praying behind one another, they would not marry each other. They issued legal edict that debating with one another was like jihad and it was permissible to break the fast in order to debate with much energy and such historical facts are very lengthy to discuss.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The straight path which was one was divided into quarters and this was why <strong>Allamah Sha’rani</strong> said doing taqlid of one Madhhab does not act on the complete shari’ah. This ayah also refutes the notions above because it advocates complete submission and obedience to Islam and to live in peace and harmony because in <strong>fis silmi</strong> the meaning of silmi is also harmony. Allah said <strong>“And if they incline to peace” (Surah al-Anfal:61)</strong>, in this regard the meaning of the ayah would be oh honest people live with each other in complete harmony and peace and do not be disunited and differ while following the way of shaytan. The summary is that this ayah refutes the ideas bigoted taqlid and supports the concept of research and investigation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said in explanation of <strong>“Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans” (Surah al-Baqarah:62)</strong> he talked about the Sabiyyah and the condition of doing righteous deeds. He also mentioned that <strong>Mawlana Abul Kalam Azad</strong> made a mistake in understanding this ayah because he said that a jewish or christian person believes in Allah and the hereafter while doing righteous deeds, he will worthy of paradise and this is incorrect. This is because believing in Allah entails and obligates believing in the Messenger, who guides to the worship of the creator. So, therefore, if a person believes in Allah and not the Messenger he sent then this is synonymous in him rejecting Allah. In fact, a person has to believe in all of the Messengers and rejecting a single one is disbelief because the jews and Christians do not believe in Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam as the Messenger of Allah so therefore it is incorrect to say they have faith. This ayah also has the wording “and did righteousness” which is restricted to obeying and following the Prophet. Allah says <strong>“Say, [O Muhammad], &#8220;If you should love Allah, then follow me” (Surah Al-Imran:31)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Pakistan and Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In additional to Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi being a distinguished teacher, researcher, Muhaddith, Mufassir, Munazir and author, he was also involved in politics. He was in favour of the two state solution. This was the reason he supported Muslim league for the Pakistan independence movement and not only this, he was also the president of the Muslim league branch in Gujranwala and offered a credible role in the independent Pakistan movement.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Who does not know that the intent in establishing an independent Pakistan was solely to create an Islamic environment and in light of the Quran and Sunnah to spread the message of living (Islamically) to the sad state of affairs of the world and similarly to present a practical example of an Islamic state. However, how disconcerting is this affair that despite continuous efforts this noble and sacred ideology was sidelined that let alone completing this objective the future generations are distancing themselves from Islam. Most of the shortcomings lie and fall with our people of authority and leadership, who did everything in this country but nothing for Islam. This action of these people is synonymous to betraying Allah and his Messenger. Some of which they were punished for by the annexing of East Pakistan (i.e Bangladesh) and the remainder of which we hear on a daily basis. Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi vividly felt these realities so much so that it led him to write:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If the Islamic constitution is not established in Pakistan it will never be safe and there is a real danger that it might break way (into separate states) from a geographical, language and tribal (or regional) perspective. There is a dire need for the Islamic constitution to be established here due to logical perspective and not on the basis of religious devotion. So whoever wishes for a constitution other than an Islamic constitution to be established in Pakistan and he exerts efforts and works towards this, then in reality he is someone who betrays the country. They intend to weaken Pakistan and dividing in to states or wanting it to integrate with India again.&#8221;</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The affair is manifestly clear that there was only one way to protect and defend Pakistan and also to guard it from conflict, which was to establish an Islamic constitution immediately. However, due to stark reality this was not achieved and as a result the same things happened which Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi had expressed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this era, not just Pakistan rather the whole Islamic Ummah is subject to division and discord. The enemies of Islam are in agreement in exterminating the Muslims but a shame the Muslims are disunited. So what should the Muslims do, who feel the pain of the Ummah and what steps should they take. So Shaykh Muhammad Ghondalwi also offers some valuable advice and thoughts on this, he says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>In this era the world is divided into three parts, politically speaking; The socialist or communist block, the western block (Democracy) and the Islamic block. In such circumstances it is mandatory on all Muslims to support the Islamic Block and all of the Muslims countries should be united into one nation and they should be united on a single point of interest (or demand). All of the Muslims leaders of the different countries should be organised into a group which will make the decisions and all of them should have the same Islamic constitution as well as the education system and where as much as possible, to be lenient on distinctive law pertinent in the different countries as much as possible and finally anything that prevents unity between the Muslims which revolves around, nationalism and language, the utmost effort should be exerted to eliminate them.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, you can understand how much passion he had with regards to unifying the Muslims. He despised division and discord on a national level nor divisions on a global Islamic level. On the contrary he understood global Islam based on the words of the blessed Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam that: <strong><em>“The example of the Muslims is like a single body” </em></strong>as a single body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>An Embodiment of Knowledge and Action</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was in terms of his knowledge some one who upheld the Sunnah and a true embodiment of beneficial knowledge. He was scholar with taqwa and zuhd. He was someone who spent his nights awake in the servitude of Allah, in fact this was his norm from the days he was a student. <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Abduh</strong> narrates from <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Yunus Dehlawi</strong> when Shaykh Ghondalwi was studying in Delhi he would pray tahajjud in a masjid which was further away from Chandni Chowk. One evening he was going to the masjid when a guard blew his whistle. The Shaykh due to his simplicity decided to run and fell when he approached the masjid. The guard by then had caught up with him and arrested him under the pretense of being a thief. The masjid administrators eventually were able to free him once they found out. His night prayers were long with good recitation of the Quran. While reading the ayahs of glad tidings it would seem real. His trembling voice would give away his fear of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His attention to his prayer was such that his acclaimed student <strong>Shaykh Ataullah Hanif mentions the Shaykh never missed the first Takbir of the prayer for approximately 50 years</strong>.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> He would also focus on the recommended acts besides those which were obligatory and Sunnahs. He would always offer 2 units of prayer when entering the masjid and would never sit without offering them. After offering his Tahajjud prayers at home he would go to the Masjid and instruct the Mu’adhin to call the Adhan at its correct and allocated time. He would then proceed to make zikr with full concentration.  After sunrise he would offer his Salatul-Duha and then return home and he would the same with the optional prayers after Maghrib.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My brother in Islam <strong>Shaykh Shahbaz Ahmad Salafi</strong> mentions once a questioner came before prayer time. He said i’ve come to know you are a senior scholar of this city, so could you assist me? After helping him the Shaykh said: <strong><em>‘Someone has misinformed you, Shaykh Muhammad Isma’il al-Salafi is the senior scholar, he is the khatib of the of the large masjid, im just a student of knowledge and the Imam of a small masjid.&#8217;</em></strong> After everyone had departed, his affair of humility and modesty was such that he cried through the whole prayer while he led us in prayer. Allah Allah, what a stature of humility, humbleness and modesty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The attachment Shaykh had with the Quran can be deduced from the following example that <strong>Shaykh Sufi Muhammad Akbar</strong> mentioned. In 1984 the Shaykh’s health deteriorated and he was taken to hospital. It was during the month of Ramadhan and the doctor prohibited him from fasting. During the days of severe health concerns he continued to make zikr and recite the Quran. <strong>Later, he expressed his sadness in not being able to fast but also expressed that during this period he was able to finish 30 recitations of the Quran, meaning that he would recite the whole Quran in one day</strong>. It was the same affair during the end of his days when he was in a hospital in Lahore, he was constantly engaged in the remembrance of Allah from his heart and tongue. When people would come to meet him and ask about his health, he would reply with a brief answer and then continue in his Zikr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One day after the Shaykhs death I visited <strong>Shaykh Ataullah Hanif</strong>, during the visit the phone rang. I gathered from the phone conversation Shaykh Hakim Abdul Rahim Ashraf was on the other end and he called to offer his condolences. Shaykh Ataullah’s voice spoke with fear and his eyes became wet and said in a very saddened tone, <em>“Hakim Sahib, not only has the Musnid of Ilm passed away but the gatherings of remembering and pondering have also finished.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh besides talking about knowledge would also encourage righteous actions and remembering Allah. I also had the pleasure to benefit from this and the issues that troubling me before I spent time with the Shaykh were alleviated by the Shaykhs admonitions and advices. In my early days there was a lack of attention but I eventually maintained a link of knowledge and its people. <strong>The Shaykh was unique that if I missed a lesson, he would ask about me.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After finishing my education, I joined Idarah Ulum al-Athariyyah and after every 2 or 4 months I would visit the Shaykh to ask about difficult issues. These gatherings would last long with the Shaykh. After departing from the Shaykh it would seem like I have acquired major wealth and it was this feeling that would give me the inclination to return.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once I went through a period when I was unable to achieve tranquility in my prayer, I was unable to concentrate on my zikr nor have the zeal to research. So, I wrote to the Shaykh. He replied very quickly and instructed me with some duas and invocations, after which those feelings disappeared.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have already mentioned his attention and focus on the obligatory and acts of sunan. After the second sajdah and the brief period of resting, it is the norm of the scholars of hadith to support oneself on the ground, but what is the defined method? This is something that was differed over. However, the Shaykh would support himself with his fists, just as one kneads dough. This resulted in marks on the knuckles, just as one get marks on the ankles (from Tawarruk). I remember very clearly while studying Sahih al-Bukhari when he explained this issue, he read the statement in the marginal notes of Sahih al-Bukhari (1:114), <strong><em>“The jurists says one should support himself just as one kneads dough, as cited by al-Kirmani.”</em></strong> He said the notes mention the word <em>al-Abin</em> but the correct ward is al-Ajin has <em><strong>al-Kirmani</strong></em> has mentioned in his explanation of <em><strong>al-Bukhari</strong> </em>(5:176).<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Abul Barkat Ahmad</strong> mentions the Shaykh would focus on fasting on the white days, but when he became weak he stopped keeping them. However, after this he suffered from nose bleeds and he said, <em>“I realise, the nose bleeds were controlled by fasting and this has happened due to not keeping the fasts.”</em> The point being the Shaykhs was a true example of the Salaf in terms of knowledge and action.</span></p>
