<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the 15 point in response to the piteous video of the hanafi fiqh channel left a sour taste in your mouths, this will not be any easier. Therefore, no long discourses, polemics or semantics, we will show you the reality of these people i.e. the Hanafi fiqh channel and their cohorts, their dire and embarrassing double standards through their criteria of bigoted hanafi partisanship and madhhabist spirit. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The hanafi fiqh channel ran with a youtube video of Shaikh al-Albani allegedly weakening a hadith is Bukhari, but did they develop amnesiac delirium when their own scholars and arch proponents of the Asharite Maturidi Hanafi Madhhab, the defender of the Hanafi Madhab, the Majnun Abi Hanifah, Muhammad Zahid bin Hussain al-Kawthari weakened hadith in Bukhari and Muslim. What happened? You turned a blind eye to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As mentioned before, if you had any fairness and justice you would make a youtube video against Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, but obviously you don&#8217;t have the guts to do that right? Why because he is not a &#8216;leader of the salafiyyah group&#8217; and that he is a &#8216;leader of the Ash&#8217;ari hanafiyyah group&#8217;? We also mentioned that you opened this bab and inshAllah we are going to open it properly for you and let everyone in, and we will see how many Hanafi Ash&#8217;ari&#8217;s walk through, let us begin</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s responded to the fanatical Hanafi Ash&#8217;arites, he said you accuse me of weakening hadith in Bukhari and Muslim, let me show you with books and page numbers where (your) &#8216;Ustadh&#8217; Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari weakened and criticised ahadith in the Sahihayn. Shaikh al-Albani asks Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah a rhetorical question regarding his Shaikh, al-Kawthari who weakened hadith in the Sahihayn or either in Bukhari or Muslim, and as such they are ahadith which are well established according to the Ahl al-Hadith. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani then proceeds to list the ahadith al-Kawthari criticised or weakened that are in the Sahihayn or in either one of them in from Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah (</span><span style="color: #000000;">p.39)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith al-Kawthari makes kalam on is is as follows,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Abu Huraira reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) took hold of my hands and said Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, created the clay on Saturday and He created the mountains on Sunday and He created the trees on Monday and He created the things entailing labour on Tuesday and created light on Wednesday and He caused the animals to spread on Thursday and created Adam (peace be upon him) after &#8216;Asr on Friday; the last creation at the last hour of the hours of Friday, i. e. between afternoon and night. This hadith is narrated through another chain of transmitters.&#8221;</em> (Muslim no.2789)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>2. The hadith in which Musa Alayhis Salam advised the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to go back and have the prayers reduced from 50, on the night of al-Isra. It is Agreed Upon</strong> <strong>(i.e. both Bukhari and Muslim transmit it.)</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Kawthari&#8217;s notes to <em>al-Asma was-Sifat</em>, p.189) (p.186-187, Turath Edition)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Compilers Note:</strong></span> <span style="color: #000000;">The hadith in question is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I was brought al-Buraq Who is an animal white and long, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule, who would place his hoof a distance equal to the range of version. I mounted it and came to the Temple (Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem), then tethered it to the ring used by the prophets. I entered the mosque and prayed two rak&#8217;ahs in it, and then came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriel said: You have chosen the natural thing. Then he took me to heaven. Gabriel then asked the (gate of heaven) to be opened and he was asked who he was. He replied: Gabriel. He was again asked: Who is with you? He (Gabriel) said: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? Gabriel replied: He has indeed been sent for. And (the door of the heaven) was opened for us and lo! we saw Adam. He welcomed me and prayed for my good. Then we ascended to the second heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) (asked the door of heaven to be opened), and he was asked who he was. He answered: Gabriel; and was again asked: Who is with you? He replied: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. The gate was opened. When I entered &#8216;Isa b. Maryam and Yahya b. Zakariya (peace be upon both of them), cousins from the maternal side. welcomed me and prayed for my good Then I was taken to the third heaven and Gabriel asked for the opening (of the door). He was asked: Who are you? He replied: Gabriel. He was (again) asked: Who is with you? He replied Muhammad (ﷺ). It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and I saw Yusuf (peace of Allah be upon him) who had been given half of (world) beauty. He welcomed me prayed for my well-being. Then he ascended with us to the fourth heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) asked for the (gate) to be opened, and it was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was (again) said: Who is with you? He said: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. The (gate) was opened for us, and lo! Idris was there. He welcomed me and prayed for my well-being (About him) Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious, has said:&#8221; We elevated him (Idris) to the exalted position&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an xix. 57). Then he ascended with us to the fifth heaven and Gabriel asked for the (gate) to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He replied Gabriel. It was (again) said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad. It was said Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and then I was with Harun (Aaron-peace of Allah be upon him). He welcomed me prayed for my well-being. Then I was taken to the sixth heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) asked for the door to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and there I was with Musa (Moses peace be upon him) He welcomed me and prayed for my well-being. Then I was taken up to the seventh heaven. Gabriel asked the (gate) to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He said: Gabriel It was said. Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad (may peace be upon him.) It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and there I found Ibrahim (Abraham peace be upon him) reclining against the Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur and there enter into it seventy thousand angels every day, never to visit (this place) again. Then I was taken to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha whose leaves were like elephant ears and its fruit like big earthenware vessels. And when it was covered by the Command of Allah, it underwent such a change that none amongst the creation has the power to praise its beauty. Then Allah revealed to me a revelation and He made obligatory for me fifty prayers every day and night. Then I went down to Moses (peace be upon him) and he said: What has your Lord enjoined upon your Ummah? I said: Fifty prayers. He said: Return to thy Lord and beg for reduction (in the number of prayers), for your community shallnot be able to bear this burden. as I have put to test the children of Isra&#8217;il and tried them (and found them too weak to bear such a heavy burden). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I went back to my Lord and said: My Lord, make things lighter for my Ummah. (The Lord) reduced five prayers for me. I went down to Moses and said. (The Lord) reduced five (prayers) for me, He said: Verily thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden; return to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. I then kept going back and forth between my Lord Blessed and Exalted and Moses, till He said: There are five prayers every day and night. O Muhammad, each being credited as ten, so that makes fifty prayers. He who intends to do a good deed and does not do it will have a good deed recorded for him; and if he does it, it will be recorded for him as ten; whereas he who intends to do an evil deed and does not do, it will not be recorded for him; and if he does it, only one evil deed will be recorded. I then came down and when I came to Moses and informed him, he said: Go back to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: I returned to my Lord until I felt ashamed before Him.&#8221;</em> (Bukhari no.13, 478, 479, Muslim no.162)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>3. The hadith concerning seeing Allah on Yaum al-Qiyamah, which also mentions the hypocrites will not see Allah in his real image. It is transmitted by the two Shaikhs.</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Kawthari&#8217;s notes to <em>al-Asma was-Sifat</em>, p.292) (Turath Edition p.278-279)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Compilers Note:</strong></span> <span style="color: #000000;">The hadith in question is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Abu Huraira reported: The people said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): Messenger of Allah, shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the moon on the night when it is full? They said: Messenger of Allah, no. He (the Messenger) further said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the sun, when there is no cloud over it? They said: Messenger of Allah. no. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Verily you would see Him like this (as you see the sun and the moon). God will gather people on the Day of Resurrection and say: Let every people follow what they worshipped. Those who worshipped the sun would follow the sun, and those who worshipped the moon would follow the moon, and those who worshipped the devils would follow the devils. This Ummah (of Islam) alone would be left behind and there would be hypocrites too amongst it. Allah would then come to them in a form other than His own Form, recognisable to them, and would say: I am your Lord. They would say: We take refuge with Allah from thee. We will stay here till our Lord comes to us. and when our Lord would come we would recognise Him. Subsequently Allah would come to them in His own Form, recognisable to them, and say: I am your Lord. They would say: Thou art our Lord. And they would follow Him, and a bridge would be set over the Hell; and I (the Holy Prophet) and my Ummah would be the first to pass over it; and none but the messengers would speak on that day, and the prayer of the messengers on that day would be: O Allah! grant safety, grant safety. In Hell, there would be long spits like the thorns of Sa&#8217;dan He (the Holy Prophet) said: Have you seen Sa&#8217;dan? They replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah. He said: Verily those (hooks) would be like the thorns of Sa&#8217;dan, but no one knows their size except Allah. These would seize people for their misdeeds. Some of them would escape for their (good) deeds, and some would be rewarded for their deeds till they get salvation. When Allah would finish judging His bondsmen and because of His mercy decide to take out of Hell such people as He pleases. He would command the angels to bring out those who had not associated anything with Allah; to whom Allah decided to show mercy. those who would say: There is no god but Allah. They (the angels) would recognise them in the Fire by the marks of prostration, for Hell-fire will devour everything (limb) of the sons of Adam except the marks of prostration. Allah has forbidden the fire to consume the marks of prostration. They will be taken out of the Fire having been burnt, and the water of life would be poured over them, and they will sprout as seed does In the silt carried by flood. Then Allah would finish judging amongst His bondsmen; but a man who will be the last to enter Paradise will remain facing Hell and will say: O my Lord I turn my face away from Hell, for its air has poisoned me ard its blaze has burnt me. He will then call to Allah as long as Allah would wish that he should call to Him. Then Allah, Blessed and Exalted, would say: If I did that, perhaps you would ask for more than that. He would say: I would not ask You more than this, and he would give his Lord covenants and agreements as Allah wished, and so He would turn his face away from the Fire When he turns towards the Paradise and sees it, he will remain silent as long as Allah wishes him to remain so. He will then say: O my Lord I bring me forward to the gate of the Paradise. Allah would say to him: Did you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything besides what I had given you. Woe to thee! O son of Adam, how treacherous you are! He would say: O my Lord! and would continue calling to Allah till He would say to him: If I grant you that, perhaps you will ask for more. He will reply: No, by Thy greatness, and he will give His Lord promises and covenants as Allah had wished. He would then bring him to the gate of the Paradise, and when he would stand at the gate of the Paradise, it would lay open before him. and he would see the bounty and the joy that there is in it. He would remain quiet as long as Allah would desire him to remain silent. He would then say: O my Lord, admit me to Paradise. Allah. Blessed and Exalted, would say: Did you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything more than what I had granted you? Woe to you! son of Adam, how treacherous you are! And he would say: O my Lord, I do not wish to be the most miserable of Thy creatures. He would continue calling upon Allah till Allah, Blessed and Exalted, would laugh. When Allah would laugh at him, He would say: Enter the Paradise. When he would enter, Allah would say: State your wish. He would express his wishes till Allah would remind him (the desire of) such and such (things). When his desires would be exhausted Allah would say: That is for thee and, besides it, the like of it also. &#8216;Ata&#8217; b. Yazid said: Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri was with Abu Huraira and be did not reject anything from the hadith narrated by him, but when Abu Huraira narrated:&#8221; Allah said to that man; ind its like along with it,&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said:&#8221; Ten like it along with it,&#8221; O Abu Huraira. Abu Huraira said: I do not remember except the words:&#8221; That is for you and a similar one along with it.&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said: I bear witness to the fact that I remembered from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) his words:&#8221; That is for thee and ten like it.&#8221; Abu Huraira said: That man was the last of those deserving of Paradise to enter Paradise.&#8221; </em>(Bukhari 11:444, 446, 13:319-320), Muslim no.182)</span></p>

It would be a feast arranged in the honour of the people of Paradise. He (the narrator) further narrated that a person from among the Jews came and he said: Abu al-Qasim, may the Compassionate Lord be pleased with you! May I inform you about the feast arranged in honour of the people of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection? He said: Do it, of course. He said: The earth would become one single bread. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) looked towards us and laughed until his molar teeth became visible. He then again said: May I inform you about that with which they would season it? He said: Do it, of course. He said: Their seasoning would be balim and fish. The Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) said: What is this balam? He said: Ox and fish from whose excessive livers seventy thousand people would be able to eat.&#8221;</em> (Bukhari 11:372, Muslim no.2792)</span></p>

<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Kawthari&#8217;s notes to <em>al-Asma was-Sifat</em>, p.336) (Turath Edition p.324)</span></strong></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;">(<span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Compilers Note:</strong></span> <span style="color: #000000;">The hadith in question is.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri: We said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon when the sky is clear?&#8221; We said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;So you will have no difficulty in seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon (in a clear sky).&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;Somebody will then announce, &#8216;Let every nation follow what they used to worship.&#8217; So the companions of the cross will go with their cross, and the idolators (will go) with their idols, and the companions of every god (false deities) (will go) with their god, till there remain those who used to worship Allah, both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, and some of the people of the Scripture. Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a mirage. Then it will be said to the Jews, &#8220;What did you use to worship?&#8217; They will reply, &#8216;We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What do you want (now)?&#8217; They will reply, &#8216;We want You to provide us with water.&#8217; Then it will be said to them &#8216;Drink,&#8217; and they will fall down in Hell (instead). Then it will be said to the Christians, &#8216;What did you use to worship?&#8217; </em></span></p>
<div class="text_details" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;">
<div class="text_details">
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>They will reply, &#8216;We used to worship Messiah, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What: do you want (now)?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We want You to provide us with water.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;Drink,&#8217; and they will fall down in Hell (instead). When there remain only those who used to worship Allah (Alone), both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, it will be said to them, &#8216;What keeps you here when all the people have gone?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We parted with them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today, we heard the call of one proclaiming, &#8216;Let every nation follow what they used to worship,&#8217; and now we are waiting for our Lord.&#8217; Then the Almighty will come to them in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, &#8216;I am your Lord,&#8217; and they will say, &#8216;You are not our Lord.&#8217; And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and then it will be said to them, &#8216;Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?&#8217; They will say. &#8216;The Shin,&#8217; and so Allah will then uncover His Shin whereupon every believer will prostrate before Him and there will remain those who used to prostrate before Him just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate but their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not be able to prostrate). Then the bridge will be laid across Hell.&#8221; We, the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)! What is the bridge?&#8217;</em><em>He said, &#8220;It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are clamps and (Hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the other and has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in Najd and is called As-Sa&#8217;dan. Some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye, some others as quick as lightning, a strong wind, fast horses or she-camels. So some will be safe without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some scratches, and some will fall down into Hell (Fire). The last person will cross by being dragged (over the bridge).&#8221; The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &#8220;You (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming from me a right that has been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding with Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves safe. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>They will say, &#8216;O Allah! (Save) our brothers (for they) used to pray with us, fast with us and also do good deeds with us.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one (gold) Dinar.&#8217; Allah will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of those sinners. They will go to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle of their legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then they will return, and Allah will say (to them), &#8216;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one half Dinar.&#8217; They will take out whomever they will recognize and return, and then Allah will say, &#8216;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant), and so they will take out all those whom they will recognize.&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said: If you do not believe me then read the Holy Verse:&#8211;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.&#8217; (4.40) The Prophet added, &#8220;Then the prophets and Angels and the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the Almighty (Allah) will say, &#8216;Now remains My Intercession. He will then hold a handful of the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the water of life. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the torrent grows. You have noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how the side facing the sun is usually green while the side facing the shade is white. Those people will come out (of the River of Life) like pearls, and they will have (golden) necklaces, and then they will enter Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say, &#8216;These are the people emancipated by the Beneficent. He has admitted them into Paradise without them having done any good deeds and without sending forth any good (for themselves).&#8217; Then it will be said to them, &#8216;For you is what you have seen and its equivalent as well.&#8221;</em> (Bukhari 8:663, 664, 13:420, 422, Muslim no.183)</span></p>

<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>(Ta&#8217;nib al-Khatib</em> p.83)</span></strong></p>

<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(<em>Ta&#8217;nib al-Khatib</em> p.185)</span></strong></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;All of the aforementioned ahadith are in the al-Sahihayn or in either one of them, which al-Kawthari weakened all of them and if a person of knowledge was to scrutinise and analyse his (al-Kawthari&#8217;s) books and the books he annotated, they would collate a voluminous book.&#8221; </em>(Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah 39-40)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">End of the words of Shaikh al-Albani.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Kawthari also weakens the hadith where Ali sends Abu al-Hayya al-Asadi to destroy images and high graves. The text of the hadith is,</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Abu&#8217;l-Hayyaj al-Asadi said that Ali (b. Abu Talib) said to him: &#8220;Should I not send you on the same mission as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) sent me? Do not leave an image without obliterating it, or a high grave without levelling It. This hadith has been reported by Habib with the same chain of transmitters and he said: (Do not leave) a picture without obliterating it.&#8221;</em> (Muslim no.969)</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Kawthari weakens this hadith in his <em>Maqalat al-Kawthari</em> (p.159)</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not need to introduce al-Kawthari to you, dear readers, as his reality and affair is clear and manifest. However, we would like to present just one example in how the Hanafi Deobandi Ash&#8217;ari Maturidi&#8217;s are part of this trinitarian nexus of Hanafi Ash&#8217;ari/Maturidi, Deobandi Sufi and Barelwi Sufi and how they are all interlinked and intrinsically connected.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The well known Hanafi Deobandi Ash&#8217;ari Maturidi Ustadh, Mawlana Muhammad Yusuf Binnouri, who was the student of Mawlana Anwar Shah Kashmiri, who in turn was a student of Mawlana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, Mawlana Mahmud al-Hasan and Mawlana Abdul Qadir Raipuri. This is the link.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Muhammad Yusuf Binnouri lauds, extols and praises the likes of this, al-Kawthari, whose popularity is unique due to his appalling and reprehensible views and doctrines. In this era he championed the ideas of the Jahmiyyah, Murji&#8217;ah and the Mu&#8217;tazilies all under the defence of the hanafi madhhab.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even the likes of Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmad and his Dar ul-taqlid have association with him, they venerate him and are secret admirers without having plucked the courage to openly promote him as of yet, except use him when they need without giving the game away.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Yusuf Binnouri introduced the compilation of articles of Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, titled Maqalat al-Kawthari, which is spread over 10 pages. Over the 10 pages he praises him, that he refutes the detractors etc, in one place he says,</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;(he was) a pure upright hanafi who destroyed all big and small idols.&#8221;</em> (Introduction to Maqalat al-Kawthari p.6)</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">he also he was,</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was a shining sword, an unsheathed famous Indian sword.&#8221;</em> (Introduction to Maqalat al-Kawthari p.7)</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the reality of the Deobandi Hanafi&#8217;s who are Ash&#8217;arites Maturidi&#8217;s. </span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">In this book we have discussed</span></strong></h5>

<h5 align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The reality of Imaam Haakims authentications and Haafidh Dhahabee agreeing with him, The reality of Imaam Haakim and his gradings, The status of Musnad of Imaam Ahmad, The grading of ‘hasan’ of Imaam Tirmidhee, The Gradings of Dr Muhammad Musafaa al-A’dhamee, The Gradings of Allaamah Muhammad Naasir ud deen al-Albaanee</span></strong></h5>
<h5 align="center"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The reality of Mahmood Sa’eed Mamduh, Eesaa al-Himayree, Muhammad bin Alawee al-Maalikee Soofee, Muhammad Zahid al-Kawtharee, Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah, Muhammad Awwamah and 65 statements of the Scholars on Graves.</span></strong></h5>
<blockquote>
<h5 align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">(In this treatise we have also answered and refuted, Shaikh Zafar Ahmed Uthmaanee Hanafee, Muhammad Alawee al-Malikee Soofee, Mahmood Sa’eed Mamduh Soofee, the lying Soofee Eesaa al-Himyaree, Abu Layth and others. Similarly we have shown the contradictions, inconsistencies and the incongruity of Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed and Gibril Fouad Haddad from the ink and words of their own Hanafee elders like Shaikh Zafar Ahmed Uthmanee, Shaikh Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah, Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowee, Shaikh Shu’ayb al-Arnaa’oot and their underlings pertaining to Hadeeth and it Sciences. Furthermore, we have shown this from books that have been verified and checked by Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed and Gibril Fouad Haddad’s teachers, those they have alleged ‘ijazahs’ from and those who are their trusted authorities, from the likes of Shaikh Noor ud deen Ittar, Muhammad Awaamah, Shaikh Shu’ayb al-Arnaa’oot and so on)</span></strong></h5>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">In this book we have discussed</span></strong></h5>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We begin by praising Allāh the Lord of the Almighty Throne and sending peace and blessings upon our noble and beloved Prophet Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and all those who follow him with goodness until the last day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To proceed:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have been asked by our brother Raza Hasan to write a short introduction in his defence of Shaikh ul Islām ibn Taymiyyah in an issue of creed, being a critique of the miskin Deobandi Yasir Hanafī Jahmi, Mātarudi Sūfi Asharī. May All reward our brother for his noble efforts and accept his work before him as a means of allowing him to enter Al-Jannah. Āmīn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed has been refuted and exposed for the fraudster that he really is on numerous occasions by us. He has clearly demonstrated his ignorance in every aspect of the sacred sciences and as such he should be warned against for his opposition to the manhaj and creed of the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This said, we also have refuted the likes of his ‘run-arounds’ Yasir Jahmi and the new kid on the block Ibn Nur al-Shanti disgracefully known as Usamah Muttakin, both of whom are on vacation undergoing hormone replace therapy in Deoband. These people are upon the methodology of the Mutakallimin and the Mu’tazilites.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Raza Hasan has comprehensively answered everything and his effort has left us not much to comment upon, nonetheless we would like to, very concisely outline a few points as to why the Deobandis and their madhab Hanafiyyah is nothing more than a cauldron of falsehood, misguidance and wretchedness at its very route. In order to mask their falsehood, the Deobandis have always attacked the scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah and the Salaf who have exposed and contradicted their deviant ways and beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu al-Muzaffar al-Sam’ani [409H] mentioned some incredible words concerning the Mutakallimin, the way of Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmed, Yasir and Mutakin, he said that Allah sent his Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam to convey and propagate the Din and from the most essential and mandatory aspects of the Din that were commanded is the Aqidah of Tawhid. Tawhid is the foundation and the Din in itself. The Messenger of Allah Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam conveyed everything from the Usul and Qaw’aid without missing anything. You will not find in the whole Din that he called and propagated the call and the way of the Mutakallimin in deducing from Jawhar and Ard (ie atoms and particles) in fact a single letter is not established from the companions. Thus, we can surmise from this that the Mutakalimin are upon a path which totally contradicts and opposes the way of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallm and his companions. Further, the principles and opinions they adhere to while opposing the aforementioned path they have concocted themselves. What is further depraved is that they target and insult the Salaf after formulating this futile way; they accused the Salaf of lacking knowledge and labelled their way as Tashbih. We warn everyone from the way of the Mutakallimin and to stay away from them as they have nothing but pure opinion and they even contradict and oppose each other in their writings. [Fath al-Bari [13:504]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abul Abbas Ahmad bin Ali al-Maqrizi [845H] wrote in detail concerning way of the Mutakallimin and their shenanigans. He rocked the foundations of the Ashariyyah and Kullabiyyah, he says, <em>“All of the Arabs whether they were town people or bedouins heard the Sifat (of Allah) but they did not question the Prophet Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam about them just as they would question him about the prayer, zakah and hajj.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say, <em>“If any of the companions had asked the Prophet Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam about any of the Sifat of Allah then indeed they would have been transmitted to us as well as the answers just as they have in numerous other issues like the Ahkam, Halal and Haram etc&#8230;” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said, <em>“The person who has deep research into the Prophetic Hadith and the reports of the Salaf us-Salihin he will clearly know that it is not established from a single companions via an authentic or even a weak chain that they asked the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam about the meaning of Dhat of Allah with regards to his Sifat as mentioned in the Quran and Hadith&#8230;.. The reality is they understood the apparent Dhahir meaning of the Sifat, did not delve into Kalam and remained silent.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say, <em>“Not a single companion made Ta’wil of any of the Sifat of Allah and in fact they were all united on the belief (Aqidah) that the Sifat are to be left on their apparent ie Dhahir meaning just as they were transmitted.”</em> (Refer to al-Muwa’iz Wa’l Ei’tibar Bi-Zikr al-Khitat Wa’l Athar [2:356]    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ahl ul-Bidʿah throughout the ages have employed various means in order to attack and vilify Ahl us-Sunnah. If one was to consider the books written by the Salaf which deal with rudūd and naqd then it as clear that one of the greatest way to attack Ahl us-Sunnah is to attack, it’s scholars. In reality, the attack on the Ahl us-Sunnah scholars by Ahl ul-Bidʿah is to attack what they carry by way of knowledge from the book, Sunnah and Salaf.  Ahl ul-Bidʿah are fully aware that once the scholars honour is taken then the ignorant masses will have a seed of doubt put in their hearts</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, one should not be surprised that the Deobandi Jahmi speaks ill of Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah as they have spoken ill of those far more superior than Ibn Taymiyyah such as the companions of the noble Prophet Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam and indeed our Lord Allah himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An example,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abū Hanīfah said that the Imān of Iblīs and the Imān of Abu Bakr is one as Abu Bakr said ‘Yaa Rabb’ [Oh My Lord] and Iblīs also said ‘Yaa Rabb’”</em> [Tārīkh Baghdād [13:376]. It’s chain of narration is Sahīh].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We free the noble Imām from such a statement but ask where is the Deobandi Jahmi Yasirs and his sidekicks critique of this belief regardless of whether it is ascribed correctly to the Imām or not so? How can he critique this when he himself is a burnt Murji who believes Iman is that which is only found in the hearts whilst actions are not a part of Imān.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Those whose foundation is built upon speaking ill of the greatest scholar of this Ummah, Abu Bakr, whilst likening his Imān to Iblīs then what hope do the likes of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah have in being secure from such wretched tongues?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, the Deobandi Jahmi Yasir Hanafi saw fit to play on the words of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah accusing him of blaspheming Allah suggesting that the Prophet Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam will be seated next to him on his Throne then has he not seen the blasphemy being committed in his own home or does he just wish to remain blind? An example,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abū Hanīfa said that if one were to worship the shoe in order to get closer to Allāh then I see no issue with this.”</em> [Tārikh Baghdad [13/374], Kitāb al-Marifah Wat Tārīkh [2/784], Kitāb al-Majrūhīn [3/73].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So where is the Deobandi Jahmi Yasirs critique of this belief regardless of whether it is ascribed correctly to the Imām or not so? InshaAllah we give husn al-dhan to Imām Abu Hanīfah over such statements and hold him in high esteem but sufficient it is to say that the likes of Yasir Deobandi Murji have never refuted or explained such statements but yet lie on other scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say, the books of the Hanafis are no better and have put the Ummah to trial and tribulation. You will see that the Hanafīs are only interested in preserving their madhab even if this means twisting meanings of the book and Sunnah as well as defaming the scholars. Some examples:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abul Hasan Karkhī states: <em>“Any verse which conflicts with the sayings of our companions [Hanafee scholars] then we will consider it as being abrogated or an issue of paramount consideration of evidence. It is better for an interpretation to be made so that the conflict can be resolved between the verse and the saying.”</em> [Usūl al-Karkhī [pg.18]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Anyone who refutes the saying of Abu Hanīfah may there be as much curse on him equating the grains of sand upon the earth”</em> [Haskafi, Durr al-Mukhtar [1/63].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When the Prophet Esa (Alayhis Salam) shall return to earth he shall give legal verdicts based upon the fiqh of Abu Hanīfah”</em> [Khaskafi, Durr al-Mukhtār [1/55]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Prophet said [of course he did not as this is a complete fabrication],There will be a man from my Ummah who will be called Abū Hanīfah and he will have between his shoulders a sign and All will give life to the Sunnah through him”</em> [Reported via Nadharī in Manāqib Abī Hanīfah [1/16].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Commenting on this Allamah Mu’allamī Said, <em>“It is not hidden that the mentioning here of the sign between the shoulders is a reference and similarity to the seal of prophet hood between the shoulders of the Prophet Sallalahui Alayhi Wasallam.” </em>[Mu’allamī, at-Tankīl [pg.216].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the dreams and mysticism of the elders of Deoband then by the honour of all if we were to write and continued writing many volumes would be produces showing the pathetic manhaj of the Deobandīs in trying to fool the Ummah and also blaspheming the prophet in the process. Just one example suffices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi and or Khalil Ahmed Saharanpuri write in their joint venture, al-Barahin al-Qatiya against their fellow Hanafi Sufi Barailwi [The real Mawlid Imam] Abdul Sami Rampuri about the superiority of the Madrasah (school) of Deoband:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“A noble person was blessed with a vision of the Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam), in which he saw Allah’s Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) speaking in Urdu. The noble person asked, ‘How do you know this language, while you are an Arab?’ He (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, ‘From the time I have been in contact with the scholars of the school of Deoband, I’ve known this language’.” Rasheed Ahmad Gungohi comments, “From this we understand the greatness of this Madrasah (school).&#8221;</em> [<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.ahya.org/tjonline/quotes/bqatia-30/bqatia-30.htm">al-Barāhīn al-Qātiya, Urdu Bazār, Karāchi, [pg.30</a>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So in order to propagate the prestige of a primary school the elders of Deoband claim to meet the Prophet just like there brother Tāhir Qādrī insists he invited and met the noble Prophet Sallalalhu alayhi Wasallam in Pakistan who was upset with the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Why does Yāsir Jahmī not free himself from the statements that we have mentioned? He can rest assured that by rebuking and freeing himself from such statements his hanafiyyah will remain intact if that is something that is worrying him. Or will he defy Allah and his Messenger seeking the pleasures of his cult rather than the face of Allāh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Well is there any point in quoting further? Inshāllah the above suffices for the one who wants to ponder and reflect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah then we suffice with the words from Allamah Uthaymīn concerning him and those like him who were put to trial by Ahl ul-Bidʿah due to their adherence to the book and Sunnah.  He commented,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘Allah has sent Muhammad Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam with guidance and the true religion. He sent him as a mercy to the world, as an example for the workers, and as a proof against all the servants. He (Muhammad) fulfilled the trust, conveyed the message, advised the Ummah, and he clarified for the people all of what they need regarding the foundations of their religion as well as its detailed matters. He left no good except that he clarified it and encouraged it, and he left no evil but that he warned the Ummah from it so much so that he left his Ummah upon a clear, white path </em><em>‐</em><em> its night as clear as its day. His companions traversed this path, shining and radiant. Afterwards, the best generations took it from them in the same state until oppression frowned upon them with the darkness of various innovations by which the innovators conspired against Islaam and its people. The people then wandered in confusion purposelessly, and they began building their Aqidah beliefs upon a spider’s web. However, the Lord upholds His religion with His close helpers upon whom He bestows Eemaan, knowledge, and wisdom by which they prevent these enemies. They repel their plot back against their own throats. So no one ever comes out with his innovation except that Allaah </em><em>‐</em><em> and for this deserves praise and thanks </em><em>‐</em><em> destines to send someone from Ahlus</em><em>‐</em><em>Sunnah who refutes and disproves his innovation and extinguishes it. There was from the foremost of those who stood up against these innovators  </em><em>‐</em><em>  Shaikh ul</em><em>‐</em><em>Islam Taqi ud Din Ahmad ibn  Abdul Halim ibn Abdus Salam ibn Taymiyyah al</em><em>‐</em><em>Harani, al</em><em>‐</em><em>Dimashqi. He was born in Haran (in Iraaq) on Monday, the 10th of Rabi al</em><em>‐</em><em>Awwal in the Hijrah year of 661 and he died whilst being imprisoned oppressively in the fortress of Damascus in Dhul</em><em>‐</em><em>Qa’dah in the Hijrah year 728 </em><em>‐</em><em> may Allah have mercy on him. He has many works on the clarification and explanation of the Sunnah, the reinforcement of its pillars, and the destruction of innovations.’</em> [al-Uthaymīn, Fathu Rabb al-Bariyyah bi‐Talkhis al-Hamawiyyah [pg.8].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What wise and profound words Imam Abu Muhammad al-Juwaini, the father of Imam al-Haramin said whilst advising the Ashariyyah and let the modern day Ashariyyah and Kullabiyyah ponder over this, <em>“The person who despite studying so much is still ignorant of the Jihah of his creator yet a sheep herding slave girl knows Allah more than him. Thus the heart of that individual (who has studied so much) will always remain in darkness and will never be blessed with Iman and Ma’rifah.”</em> [Majmu’ah al-Rasa’il al-Muniriyyah [1:185]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once again may Allah reward our brother for his defence of the pristine and clear Aqidah of Ahl us-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah and indeed we pray that Allah rewards him immenselyand to accept it from him. Thus, this epistle also serves as reference point when these ignorant and lost Asharis and Kullabites raise unfounded accusations against Ahl us-Sunnah and Imam Ibn Taymiyyah.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abul Hasan as per usual in his 10 pence remarks unable to answer any of the main points boasts that he alone writes his articles etc without any help. He alludes to our thanking of Abush-Shaikh, a brother from Birmingham who at our request picked up a book for us and from the bab of the one who does not thank others does not thank Allah, we mentioned his name. Abu Hasan Hussain Ahmed wants to praise himself and tried to highlight this as a point attempting to say we had help in writing our response to him!!!! Seriously when is this guy going to grow up , even after all these years he behaves like a immature teenager. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He fails to read our words in which we intended a recourse to his protege and the underling Yasir Jahmi who has since gone into hiding, and so he should due to his ignorance and obnpxious remarks which are unfit for any audience let alone the seekers of the truth. However this is unsurprising as these like minded digressional tacticians are peas in a pod. Abu Hasan Hussain Ahmed goes onto mention some other profanities which are not even worth responding to as he himself knows how immature and infantile they are. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To end, we have advised the like of Yāsir many times before about taqwa and seeking the truth and that his time would be far better spent in promoting the true Aqīdah and way of the Salaf whilst freeing himself from statements of his elders which can truly have no justification behind them. We also advise our brother the author of this treatise to spend his time more wisely in defending Ahl us-Sunnah rather than replying in every minute issue to every Bakr, Amr and Zaid who is possibly not worthy to be responded to.  May Allah guide us All.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ones in need of the pardon of Allāh the Almighty.</span></p>
