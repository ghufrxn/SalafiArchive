				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="center"><strong>Compiled &amp; Translated </strong></h5>
<h5 align="center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, no long introductions straight to the point. 6 scholars &#8211; 3 fathers and 3 sons who spent decades upon calling to Tawhid and Sunnah, teaching hadith, reprimanding Madhhabism and the associated bigoted taqlid. If anything take the benefit of nurturing your children on the pure pristine Salafi Manhaj and keep away from blind fanaticism of madhhabs and take evidence when it comes to you. Same people who fall prey to technical fiqhi buzz words and think they have a defence!</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[1] Shaikh al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Muhammad Sa&#8217;id Muhaddith Banarasi</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was born in a sikh household in 1274H and died in 1322H/1904CE. He was born as Mawl Singh in Gujrat and his father’s name was Karak Singh. He was a sikh and converted to Islam. He first sought knowledge in Deoband but later became Ahlul Hadith and eventually studied with major Salafi Ahlul Mashaykh like Shaykh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi who he studied hadith and tafsir with as well as Shaykh Abdullah Ghazipuri and Shaykh Muhammad Ibrahim Arawi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then went to the Banaras (Varanasi) the holiest city of the idol worshippers and set up Madrasah Sa&#8217;idiyyah in 1297H and taught for a few decades until he died. He also set up a printing press called Matba&#8217;a Sa&#8217;idiyyah and printed thousands of pages of amazing books that promoted the Madhhab of Ahlul Hadith and Salafis and refuted the bigoted Madhhabists</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From Sikhism to establishing a Salafi Madrasah built upon Tawhid and Sunnah in the holiest place of the idol worshiping Hindus and a phenomenal printing press.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaykh Abdur Rahman al-Faryawa&#8217;i said about him, <em>&#8220;He had numerous works and treatises most of which were fierce and vehement refutations of the muta’ssub Madhhabists and the bigoted staunch Muqallidin he also had a book on Fatawa in 2 parts.&#8221;</em> (al-Harakatus Salafiyyyah wa Dawriha Fi Ihya as-Sunnah (p.44)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He died in 1322H/1904CE. He had a son, who he nurtured on the Quran and Sunnah with care, affection and diligence and he was,</p>

Muhsin Ansari.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He began teaching in his father&#8217;s Madrasah Sa&#8217;idiyyah where he taught Bukhari and Muslim 30 times (each) during his life. He spend his life defending and spreading hadith. When a Hanafi bigoted muqallid wrote a book called <em>&#8220;Jarh Alal Bukhari&#8221;</em> and 6-7 other books criticising and disparaging Sahih al-Bukhari and hadith in general. Shaykh Abul Qasim Sayf Banarasi answered and refuted all of them in overwhelming detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He defended and spread the Madhhab of Ahlul Hadith and Salafis through his numerous works. He was a prolific author and wrote books in Arabic and Urdu which number more than 65. Some of them include,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jam&#8217;a al-Quran wal-Hadith, Qadhiyatul Hadith Fi Hujjatul Hadith, Husul al-Maram, Kitab ar-Radd Ala Abi Hanifah &#8211; an rendering of the work of the Ahlul Hadith Muhaddith Imam Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Shaybah, Arba&#8217;in Muhammadi, Hidayatus Sa&#8217;il Ila Ahadith Wa&#8217;il, Naf&#8217;i al-Ahnaf, Hal Mushkilat Bukhari in 3 volumes also known as Kawthar al-Jari Fi Jawab al-Jarh Alal Bukhari, al-Amr al-Mubram Li-Ibtal Al-Kalam al-Muhkam, al-Siyar al-Hathith Fi Barah Ahlul Hadith, Ijtilab al-Manfa&#8217;a Liman Yatal&#8217;ih Ahwal Ai&#8217;matul Arb&#8217;a, 5 more books refuting the Hanafi muqallid who attacked Sahih al-Bukhari and many more.

The very same teachers who who rejected and shunned taqlid and lived their life accordance with following and obeying ie Ittiba of the Quran and Sunnah, they gave me their asanid and ijazat”. </em>(Aqidah Firqatun Najiyyah p.23-27)</p>

<span class="artBlue">Al-Hasan bin Saheb Ash-Shashi</span> said: &#8220;I asked Abu Dawud As-Sijistani (11) about Uthman bin Saeed, so he said: &#8216; From him we learned Hadith.&#8217; &#8221; (12)<br />
<span class="artBlue">Abu Hamid Al-A&#8217;mashi said:</span> &#8220;I have not seen from the Muhaditheen anyone like Muhammad bin Yahya, Uthman bin Saeed <span class="artTakhrij">[Ad-Darimi]</span>, and Ya&#8217;qbu bin Sufyan.&#8221; (13)</p>
<p>Abu Uthman As-Sabuni narrated with his own chain that Imam Qutaibah bin Saeed said at the end of his book &#8220;al Iman&#8221;:<br />
&#8220;If you see a man loving Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Malik bin Anas, Al-Awza&#8217;i&#8230;&#8221; and he mentioned a number of Imams, then he said: &#8220;Then know that He is upon the Sunnah.&#8221; Then <span class="artBlue">Abu Uthman As-Sabuni</span> said: &#8220;And I added to those that Qutaibah rahimahulllah mentioned: That whomever loves them, he is upon the Sunnah, from the Imam of Hadith whom are to be followed, and to be upon their guidance&#8230; from them are: Muhammad bin Idrees Ash-Shafi&#8217;i&#8230;&#8221; and he mentioned a number of scholars, from them was: Uthman bin Saeed Ad-Darimi. (14)</p>
<p><span class="artBlue">Adh-Dhahabi</span> said about him: &#8220;The Imam, Allamah, the Hafidh, the Critic &#8230; he was persevere upon the Sunnah, and well-versed in debating.&#8221;<br />
He also said: &#8220;Uthman ad-Darimi was like a tree trunk in the eyes of the innovators&#8217; (15), and it was said that he is the one who stood up against Muhammad bin Karram &#8211; whom the sect al-Karramiyah are attributed to &#8211; and exiled him from Herat.&#8221; (16)</p>
<p><span class="artBlue">Taj Ad-Deen As-Subki</span> said about him: &#8220;One of the Trustworthy scholars, and whom was mentioned by Al-Abbadi in his &#8220;Tabaqat&#8221; saying: &#8216; The Imam of Hadith and Fiqh&#8230;) (17)</p>
<p><span class="artBlue">Al-Hasan Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Abdoos</span> said:<br />
&#8220;When I wanted to travel to Uthman bin Saeed Ad-Darmi, I came to Abu Bakr Muhammad b. Ishaq b. Khuzaimah, and I asked him to write to him for me, so he wrote to him. I entered Herat in Rabee&#8217; al Awwal, 280 H. I went to Uthman bin Saeed, and delivered the letter to him. He read it and welcomed me, and asked me how Abu Bakr Ibn Khuzaimah was doing, then he said to me: &#8216;When did you arrive?&#8217;<br />
I said: Tomorrow.<br />
He said: &#8216;My son, go back to them, for you haven&#8217;t come yet.&#8217;<br />
so I got embarrassed.<br />
Then he said: &#8216; Don&#8217;t be shy my son, for I have resided in your country for two years, and your shaikhs at that time were able to bear from me things like this.&#8217; &#8221; (18)</p>
<p><span class="bold">His Works:</span><br />
&#8211; A large Musnad (19)<br />
&#8211; Ar-Rad ala al-Jahmiya (Refuting Jahmiya)<br />
&#8211; Naqd or Ar-Rad ala Bishr al Mirrisi (Replying to the heretic Bishr al Mirrisi d. 218 H.) (20)</p>
<p><span class="bold">His Death:</span><br />
He passed away in Dhul Hijjah, 280 Hijri.</p>
<p><span class="artRedTitle">His Statments in Some Matters of Belief (Aqeedah)</span> :</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">&#8211; Tawheed:</span><br />
Uthman Ad-Darimi said: &#8220;And the meaning of Tawheed in the Ummah is saying: &#8216;La Ilaha Illa Allah Wahdahu La Sharika Lahu&#8217; (21).&#8221; (22)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">&#8211; Istiwa and Allah&#8217;s Elevation:</span><br />
He said:<br />
&#8220;And the Muslims have agreed that Allah is above His Throne, above His Heavens.&#8221; (23)<br />
&#8220;And we knew, with no doubt, that Allah is above His Throne, above His Heavens, like He described Himself, separate from His creation.&#8221; (24)<br />
&#8220;For Allah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;la is above His Throne, above His Heavens, separate from His creation, so whoever doesn&#8217;t know Him like this, then he doesn&#8217;t know His God Whom he worships.&#8221; (25)<br />
He said in regards to Allah&#8217;s saying -translation of the meaning-: <span class="artAya">{And Pharoah said, &#8220;O Haman, construct for me a tower that I might reach the ways * The ways of the heavens, so that I may look at the God (Ilah) of Moses, but indeed, I think he is a liar.&#8221;}</span> <span class="artTakhrij">[40:36-37]</span> :<br />
&#8220;In these ayat is a clear explanation, and an obvious indicator that Musa was calling Fir&#8217;awn (Pharoah) to know that Allah is above the heaven, and because of that, he (Fir&#8217;awn) ordered to build a big tower, and wanted to see Him (Allah Ta&#8217;ala).&#8221; (26)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">Allah being with His creation -Ma`iyyah-</span>:<br />
He said: «Some of them said: Let&#8217;s put aside the interpretation of scholars, we only depended on the Quran for evidence, so bring the Book of Allah. We said: ‘yes … however, you are ignorant of its meaning, so strayed from the straight path, and you clung to the middle of the ayah, and deliberately overlooked its beginning and its ending, because Allah –Azza wa Jal- began the verse with His knowledge of them, and ended it with that, He said: <span class="artAya">{Have you not seen that Allah knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth? There is no Najwa (secret counsel) of three, but He is their fourth&#8230;}</span> until His saying: <span class="artAya">{and afterwards on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they did. Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of everything}</span>, so this is evidence that He meant His knowledge of them and their deeds, not that He Himself is in every place with them as you claim.» (27)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">On Tashbih in Allah&#8217;s Attributes</span>:<br />
He said:<br />
<span class="artAthar">«As there is nothing like Him (Allah), thus there is no hand like His Hand.»</span> (28)<br />
<span class="artAthar">«As there is nothing like Him, there is no hearing like His Hearing, nor sight like His Sight, and there is nothing in creation that they can be compared, or likened or resembled to.»</span> (29)<br />
<span class="artAthar">«All of these ahadeeth, and even more than it, mention the descending of the Lord, Most High; and the people of Fiqh and knowledge from our scholarly teachers are upon believing in them; none of them deny any of these ahadeeth or refrained from narrating them until this group (i.e. jahmiyyah) appeared, who then opposed the ahadeeth of the Messenger of Allah and expended great effort to oppose them, so they questioned: ‘How does He descend?’, to which we replied: ‘We were not commanded to know how He descends in our Religion, and our minds cannot comprehend/grasp it, and there is no creation that is equal to Him that we may equate His acts or attributes with.»</span> (30)</p>
<p><span class="artGreenTitle">On Seeing Allah in the Hereafter</span>:<br />
«When Allah put a restriction for seeing Him in the Hereafter with His saying: <span class="artAya">{Looking (ila) at their Lord (Allâh)}</span> (i.e. with the preposition “ila” which means to/towards), we knew that it is the seeing of the eyes.» (31)</p>
