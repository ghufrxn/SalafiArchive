<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Umar Fullatah may Allah have mercy upon him said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: Eesa (Jesus) the son of Maryam; Allah created him from a mother and he does not have a father. Similarly Allah created Adam without a father or a mother. And likewise Allah created Hawwa (Eve) with a father and no mother. Thus the affair is not strange. Allah said in His glorious Book:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">إِ`</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our father Adam—peace be upon him—Allah created him from soil, from sounding clay like the clay of pottery, from an adhesive soil. After that Allah ordered that a soul be blown into him with the statement, ‘Be’. Thus Adam was.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Where is the mother of Adam? Where is the father of Adam? The father of mankind—Adam—does not have a father or a mother. Thus the All-Knowing, the Most Great, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise, the One who does whatever He wants and chooses, created Adam without a mother or a father. And the affair is not like Darwin (upon him is the curse of Allah) says; the theory of Darwin which states the origin of mankind is from monkeys, and they evolved. The theory of evolution, says that monkeys evolved through stages until it became Adam. And that Adam is not from soil but rather he is an animal who evolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah the Exalted said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">إِ<strong>نَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَى عِنْدَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ آدَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِنْ تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Verily, the likeness of Eesa (Jesus) with Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from soil, the He said to him ‘Be’ and he was. (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:59)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Hawwa (Eve); Allah created her from a rib from Adam. She does not have a mother while she has a father. Thus Allah the Exalted wanted to create Eesa (Jesus) so He created him from a mother, and she is the virgin Maryam, the untouched; may the best prayers and peace be upon her and upon our Prophet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">She is Maryam the daughter of Imraan, the one whom Allah described with His statement:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">ا<strong>لَّتِي أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The one who guarded her chastity (Soorh At Tahrim 66:12)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In this is a testimony from the Creator, the Exalted, that she surely guarded her chastity and she was not a lewd woman, peace be upon her.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Her father was a righteous man, a worshipper. Her mother became pregnant with her, meaning with Maryam, so she dedicated her to the service of Allah. (Her intent was) if Allah blessed her with a son, she would dedicate this son to the Masjid, worship and the obedience of Allah. But Allah decreed the mother of Maryam was to give birth to Maryam; a girl and not a boy who would take care of the affairs of the Masjid and worship Allah in the Masjid.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thus when she gave birth to a girl she wanted an excuse with Allah, she said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">فَلَمَّا وَضَعَتْهَا قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَضَعْتُهَا أُنْثَى وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا وَضَعَتْ وَلَيْسَ الذَّكَرُ كَالْأُنْثَى وَإِنِّي سَمَّيْتُهَا مَرْيَمَ وَإِنِّي أُعِيذُهَا بِكَ وَذُرِّيَّتَهَا مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Then when she delivered her [child Maryam], she said: “O my Lord! I have delivered a female child,” – and Allah knew better what she delivered, – “And the male is not like the female, and I have named her Maryam, and I seek refuge with You (Allah) for her and for her offspring from Satan, the outcast.” (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:36)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Exalted said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">فَ<strong>تَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ وَأَنْبَتَهَا نَبَاتًا حَسَنًا وَكَفَّلَهَا زَكَرِيَّا كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا الْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِنْدَهَا رِزْقًا قَالَ يَا مَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هَذَا قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So her Lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of Zakariya. Every time Zakariya entered upon her in the prayer chamber, he found with her provision. He said, “O Maryam, from where is this [coming] to you?” She said, “It is from Allah. Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without account.” (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:37)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maryam—while she was still young—was honored by Allah. The provision that Zakariya found with Maryam—and Zakariya was from her closest guardians—he would come and find the fruits which only grow during the summer months with her during the winter months; and he would find with her the fruits which only grow during the winter months with her during the summer months. She was blessed, righteous, pious, throughout her youth and when she reached womanhood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yusuf the carpenter asked for her hand in marriage, and he was from her relatives. He desired to marry her. And she was righteous; dedicated to her prayer area, dedicated to obedience to Allah and worship. The entire community of that time period testified to her righteousness and piety. And for this reason when she became pregnant (they said to her)</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">يَا أُخْتَ هَارُونَ مَا كَانَ أَبُوكِ امْرَأَ سَوْءٍ وَمَا كَانَتْ أُمُّكِ بَغِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">O sister of Harun, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.”       (Soorah Maryam 19:28)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">How did you get pregnant with this boy? Where did you get this boy from?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Verily this boy was a miracle from Allah the Exalted. Allah wanted for her to have this son, so an angel came to her. The angel informed her that Allah had sent him to her.</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">لِأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلَامًا زَكِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(To announce) to you the gift of a righteous son (Soorah Maryam 19:19)</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَتْ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لِي غُلَامٌ وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِي بَشَرٌ وَلَمْ أَكُ بَغِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">She said: “How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?” (Soorah Maryam 19:20)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">How can I have a son, I do not have a husband and I have not been unchaste nor committed fornication? So how can I have a son?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And it is from the way of Allah the Exalted that the child is not born except by two parents, between a husband and a wife, man and a woman. He (the angel) informed her that this is what Allah wanted.</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَتْ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَنِ مِنْكَ إِنْ كُنْتَ تَقِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">She said: “Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Beneficent (Allah) from you, if you do fear Allah.” (Soorah Maryam 19:18)</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَ إِنَّمَا أَنَا رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لِأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلَامًا زَكِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(The angel) said: “I am only a Messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son.” (Soorah Maryam 19:19)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah commanded him (the angel) to blow into the sleeve of her outer garment. Allah the Exalted commanded the angel Jibreel to blow (into the sleeve of her outer garment) the word ‘Be’. Thus Jibreel came with a command from Allah. Thus Jibreel blew the word ‘Be’ that Allah had sent him with (into the sleeve of her outer garment) and thus Maryam became pregnant with Eesa (Jesus) may the best prayers and peace be upon her and our Prophet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And I remind you and I say to you, this affair is not strange. Because Allah created Adam peace be upon him, without a father or a mother, and we are all offspring of Adam, peace be upon him. This because Adam is the father of all mankind, except for those who follow the Darwin theory of evolution, so if they are not the children of Adam then they are the offspring of monkeys. But as for us, then we are the offspring of Adam; the one who Allah created with His Hands. And Allah breathed a soul into him. And Allah caused him to live in paradise, and Allah created from his rib Hawwa (Eve). After He entered them into paradise He forbade them to eat from the tree. When they ate from the tree He expelled them down to the earth. Thus this has been the linage since Allah created Adam and Hawwa up until this day of ours, and until Allah inherits the earth and all those upon it.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Shaykh ‘Umar ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad Bakr al-Fallaatah</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the Faqeeh (the scholar of jurisprudence) , the Muhaddith (the scholar of Hadeeth), the Mufassir (the explainer of the Quraan) , the Noble Shaykh ‘Umar ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad Bakar al-Fallaanee, popularly known as Fallaatah. And al-Fallaanee refers to the tribe of al-Fallaanah, which is well-known and widespread in most of Western Africa. And according to some historians, his lineage goes right back to ‘Uqbah ibn Naafi’ or Ibn ‘Aamir or Ibn Yaasir, however, it is most probably another ‘Uqbah and not the great companion of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) who conquered Africa.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>His Birth</b></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was born in 1345 A.H. (1925 C.E) near Makkah, during his parents hijrah from Africa which took them approximately a year. Regarding this, the Shaykh mentions: “Allaah willed for them to begin their journey and they were two, and when they completed their journey they/(we) were three”.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>His Education</b></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1346 A.H. they moved to al-Madeenah an-Nabawiyyah, where he grew up and began his education with what were known in those days as al-Kuttaab, by the name of Muhammad Saalim, under whom he memorised the first few chapters of the Noble Qur.aan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Later, he entered the Daar al-‘Uloom ash-Shar’iyyah in Madeenah and studied there until he was approximately 7 years old. There, he graduated from his primary education and completed the memorisation of the Qur.aan.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>His Work</b></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1365 A.H. (1945 C.E.) he taught at the Daar al-Hadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to this, he taught the the Daar as-Sa’oodiyyah in 1373 A.H. (1953 C.E.) as he was appointed an assistant to the principal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1375 A.H. (1955 C.E.) he taught hadeeth and it’s fundamentals in al-Ma’had al-‘Ilmee until 1378 A.H. (1958 C.E.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1377 A.H. (1957 C.E.) the Daar al-Hadeeth was placed under his principalship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1385 A.H. (1965 C.E.) he was appointed assistant secretary of the Islaamic University of Madeenah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1395 A.H. (1975 C.E.) he was appointed general secretary of the Islaamic University of Madeenah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1396 A.H. (1976 C.E.) he was appointed an assistant lecturer in the Faculty of Hadeeth as well as maintaining his position as general secretary of the Islaamic University of Madeenah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Later, he became the principal in charge of the Centre for Da’wah Affairs at the Islaamic University of Madeenah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1406 A.H. (1986 C.E.) he was appointed principal in charge of the Centre for the study of the Sunnah and the Prophetic Seerah at the Islaamic University of Madeenah, which was actually setup by the Shaykh himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After he retired, he went back to the Daar al-Hadeeth.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>His efforts at Daar al-Hadeeth</b></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Daar al-Hadeeth was setup by one of the scholars from India by the name of Shaykh Ahmad ad-Dahlawee (rahima-hullaah) who was a scholar from amongst the Ahlul-Hadeeth, who opened up the Daar al-Hadeeth in 1350 A.H. (1930 C.E.) by permission of King ‘Abdul-‘Azeez (rahima-hullaah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A kind donor from India by the name of Shaykh Muhammad Rafee’ (rahima-hullaah) donated a building for the Daar al-Hadeeth which was near the al-Masjid an-Nabawee. It was named Maktabah Ahlul-Hadeeth and also Madrasah Daar al-Hadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">While the Shaykh was teaching at the Daar al-Hadeeth in 1367 A.H. (1947 C.E.) he also attained a higher certificate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was close to his Shaykh, the great noble Shaykh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan al-Ifreeqee, who took over principalship of the Daar al-hadeeth after Shaykh Ahmad ad-Dahlawee (rahima-hullaah) died in 1375 A.H. (1955 C.E.). And when Shaykh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan al-Ifreeqee (rahima-hullaah) died in 1377 A.H. ( 1957 C.E.) Shaykh ‘Umar assumed principalship of the Daar al-hadeeth thereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And when the project of the extension of al-Masjid an-Nabawee began, the Daar al-Hadeeth had to be knocked down to make way for the necessary extension, and appropriate compensation was paid to those responsible at the Daar al-Hadeeth. With this money, Shaykh ‘Umar strived hard to find an appropriate piece of land to buy and build the new Daar al-Hadeeth and the Maktabah. Finally he purchased a piece of land and in 1413A.H. (1993 C.E.) work began on building the new Daar al-Hadeeth and was completed in 1417 A.H. (1997 C.E.). The new Daar al-Hadeeth incorporated a school, a library (Maktabah Daar al-Hadeeth), a masjid, a department for hadeeth, a large lecture theatre which could hold a thousand students, housing accomodation for students, a business centre, housing accomodation for visitors and a car park.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the building was finally finished, it was something of a sight, so much so that it won a prize for its design.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the Shaykh was extremely attached to the Daar al-Hadeeth and held it very dear to him, and used to extend much assistance to it.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>His Shuyookh</b></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh said: “I met more than seventy scholars at the masjid of the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) and they were in truth inheritors of the Prophet”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh, the muhaddith Muhammad Ibraaheem al-Khatanee, who was a student of the muhaddith, Shaykh Muhammad ‘Abdul-Baaqee al-Ayyoobee al-Madanee. He studied under him at the Daar al-‘Uloom ash-Shar’iyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ‘Ammaar al-Jazaa.iree, under whom he also studied at the Daar al-‘Uloom ash-Shar’iyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Yoosuf ibn Sulaymaan al-Filisteenee, under whom he also studied at the Daar al-‘Uloom ash-Shar’iyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saalih az-Zughaybee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad ‘Alee al-Harakaan, who was previously the assistant secretary of the Muslim World League. He studied the majority of ((Saheeh al-Bukhaaree)) under him, along with it’s explanation, ((Fat.h al-Baaree)). And this was while he was teaching in al-Masjid an-Nabawee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh As’ad Muhiy ad-Deenal-Husaynee, under whom he read the Noble Qur’aan, thereby further strengthening his memorisation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Jaatoo al-Fallaanee, under whom he studied a number of texts of the Maalikee madhhab, and some their explanations. He also studied ad-Dimishqee’s explanation of ((Mukhtasir Khaleel)), along with some of ((Aqrab al-Masaalik)), and then completed the rest under Shaykh ‘Ammaar al-Jazaa.iree.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh, the muhaddith Muhammad ibn Ahmad as-Soodaanee al-Madanee, under whom he studied some books of poetry and Arabic grammar and some aspects of Usool al-Fiqh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh, the muhaddith Muhammad al-Haafidth ibn Moosaa Humayd.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh, the muhaddith ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Yoosuf al-Ifreeqee, who had a tremendous effect on his personality, such that there became a great similarity between them, as Shaykh ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-‘Abbaad mentioned in his lecture about Shaykh ‘Umar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He studied ((Buloogh al-Maraam)) under Shaykh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan along with ((Subul as-Salaam)) and some major books of hadeeth suc</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">h as ((al-Muwatta,)) of Imaam Maalik, and also in tafseer and the science of hadeeth, while also hearing him respond to the questions of the people seeking fataawa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh, the muhaddith Saalim ibn Ahmad Baajnidaan al-Hadramee, the renowned muhaddith from Indonesia</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>His teaching in al-Masjid an-Nabawee</b></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh began teaching in al-Masjid an-Nabawee in 1370 A.H. (1950 C.E.), when he had attained a permit to teach from the Presidency of Judges of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Shaykh thereby taught for approximately 49 years in al-Masjid an-Nabawee, and his teaching place used to be very close to what is popularly known as “Riyaadh al-Jannah” (the Garden of Paradise) which is the area stretching from the Prophet’s house (current resting place) to his mimbar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many students of knowledge used to attend his lessons, as well as the visiting pilgrims. And many of his lessons were recorded and are available free of (recording/copying) costs from the recording library in al-Masjid an-Nabawee. As an example, his explanation of ((Saheeh Muslim)) stretches to 817 audio cassettes, and that is a complete recording of the Shaykh’s explanation. And his explanation of the ((Tafseer of Ibn Katheer)) stretches to 720 audio cassettes, but this is incomplete. And his explanation of ((Sunan Abee Daawood)) stretches to 576 audio cassettes, and this is also incomplete. In total, all his audio cassettes amount to approximately 2,253.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>His Manners</b></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was of excellent manners, and was very concerned about the benefitting and assisting the Muslims. He was extremely humble and noble to his guests as he would greet them with a cheerful face, enticing the guests to feel full of cheer as a result. He used to enjoy assisting the people, whether old or young, considering he was himself worthy of receiving assistance because of his position and knowledge and old age. So as a result of his impeccable manners, he was loved by those who knew him and those who did not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Shaykh al-Albaanee praised him much for his good neighbourly conduct and his impeccable good manners when he was a neighbour of Shaykh ‘Umar during the time he spent teaching at al-Jaami’ah al-Islaamiyyah (Islaamic University) in Madeenah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the Shaykh was extremely wise in his opinions and sharp-witted at the many issues which people brought to his attention, as those who spent time with him in his tent during Hajj and the different da’wah centres he would visit would well know.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In conclusion to all this, Dr. Marzooq az-Zahraanee, who was previously the principal of the Centre for Prophetic Studies mentioned: “The Shaykh was complete in his manners, complete in his uprightness, complete in his manhaj and complete in his taqwa…”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the Shaykh was blessed with impeccable manners as has been mentioned, even when he faced those who disliked him for his manhaj or manner, and he was able to affect them with his good manners in such a way that they would correct their ways and ahere to the true path and manhaj, which is based upon the Noble Qur.aan and the authentic Sunnah according to the understanding of the pious predecessors. And all this was whilst he was teaching in al-Masjid an-Nabawee.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>His ‘Aqeedah and Manhaj</b></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh adhered steadfastly to the Noble Qur’aan and the authentic Sunnah as understood by the pious predecessors and he invited to this path with wisdom and maturity. He also used to encourage others to understand the evidences, and used to detest the opposing manaahij.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>His Hajj Journey</b></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh was blessed to have performed Hajj a great number of times, with his first ever Hajj being in 1365 A.H. (1945 C.E.), and from that time until 1418 A.H. (1998 C.E.) he performed Hajj every single year except once when he was ill. So he performed Hajj a total of 53 times, as he also performed ‘Umrah a great number of times too. May Allaah (Subhaanahu wa Ta’aala) accept from him, aameen.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>His Travels</b></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh travelled to many countries for da’wah purposes, either with the Islaamic University or to setup Summer camps. From amongst the countries he visited were: Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, India, Pakistan, and many African countries.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>The Scholars praise of him</b></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Amongst the many scholars who praised him were:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albaanee, who pra</strong>ised him much for his good neighbourly conduct and his impeccable good manners and knowledge, such that when in 1395 A.H. (1975 C.E.) <em><b>Shaykh al-Albaanee was asked as to who should be referred to when seeking fatwa, Shaykh al-Albaanee advised that Shaykh ‘Umar should be referred to for all fatwa-seeking questions.</b></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, Shaykh ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-‘Abbaad described him as: <strong><em>“…a great man, a rightly-guided scholar, one who possessed noble manners and praiseworthy characteristics. And that he was upon the manhaj of the pious predecessors adhering to what was transmitted from Allaah and His Messenger (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam).”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Shaykh ‘Abdul-Muhsin mentioned that since he first met Shaykh ‘Umar way back in 1381 A.H. (1961 C.E.) love had entered into his heart for Shaykh ‘Umar.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>His Death</b></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh had great desire to die in Madeenah, and Allaah permitted his wish to be met as he died in Madeenah on Wednesday 29 Muharram 1419 A.H. (17 March 1999 C.E.) after having received medical treatment and returning from Riyadh just a day before his death. The Shaykh was 74 years of age. His funeral prayer was performed after Salaatul-‘Asr and he was then buried in the graveyard of Baqee’, near al-Masjid an-Nabawee. Many attended his funeral from amongst the scholars and the judges and lecturers and teachers from the universities along with many students, and pilgrims and those who simply loved him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allaah (Subhaanahu wa Ta’aala) have Mercy upon his soul, aameen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh left behind him one wife, seven sons: Dr. Muhammad (a member of the teaching staff at the Islaamic University of Madeenah), ‘Abdur-Rahmaan (a member of the teaching staff at the Primary school within the Islaamic University), ‘Abdul-Haadee (a member of the teaching staff at the Arabic Language Institute within the Islaamic University), ‘Abdul-Kareem, ‘Abdur-Razzaaq and Anas, and two daughters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh bequeathed his entire library to Daar al-Hadeeth, and his bequest was carried out after his death.</span></p>
