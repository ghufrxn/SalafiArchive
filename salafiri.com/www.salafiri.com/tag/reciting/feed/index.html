				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 align="center"><span style="color: #0000ff">An Explanation By Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff">of the book  ‘<em>Sifat</em> <em>as-Salah</em>’ By <em>Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah </em>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani</span><br />
Translated by Umm Yahya</h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">Shaykh Albaani Wrote:</span></p>
<p align="center">The Imam Saying <em>Ameen</em> Aloud After Reciting <em>Fatiha</em></p>
<p>When the Messenger of Allaah  had completed his recitation of <em>Surah</em> Fatiha he would say: ‘<em>Ameen</em>’ raising his voice and he would elongate it.</p>
<p>He would command those praying behind him to say <em>Ameen</em> loudly just after the Imam said it.</p>
<p>The Prophet  would say: ‘If the Imam recites: <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt; </strong> then say: ‘<em>Ameen</em>, for verily the Angels say<em>Ameen</em> and verily the Imam says <em>Ameen</em>,’</p>
<p>And in other wording: ‘If the Imam says <em>Ameen</em> then say <em>Ameen</em>, whoever says it and it coincides with the <em>Ameen</em> of the Angels, (and in other wording if one of you says<em>Ameen</em> in his prayer and it coincides with the other) all his previous sins will be forgiven.’</p>
<p>In another Hadeeth: ‘Say <em>Ameen</em> and Allah will love you.’</p>
<p>And the Messenger of Allaah  also said: ‘The Jews do not envy you about anything more than they envy you of saying <em>Salaamu</em> <em>alaykum</em> (salutations) to each other and saying <em>Ameen</em> behind the Imam’</p>
<p>______________________</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool explained:</span></p>
<p>This chapter of saying <em>Ameen</em> has a few issues, which will be discussed below.</p>
<p><strong>Firstly</strong></p>
<p>The linguistic meaning of ‘<em>Ameen’</em> is ‘O Allaah respond / answer.’</p>
<p>It has also been said it means ‘<em>Subhanaka</em> <em>Ya</em> <em>Allaah’</em> (How far you are from imperfection) and it has been said it means ‘O Allaah’.</p>
<p>So when one who prays behind the Imam hears the Imam recite <em>Surah</em> Fatiha and reaches the part that says: <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong>  Then it is the Sunnah for him to say <em>Ameen</em> after this, as the Messenger of Allaah would say. This is due to the general statement of the saying of the Prophet : ‘Pray as you have seen me praying.’</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong></p>
<p>The saying of <em>Ameen</em> is Sunnah for the Imam and those following him. It is the Sunnah for the Imam in those prayers that are audible and he says <em>Ameen</em> audibly/ with a raised voice after he recites Surah Fatiha. It is also the Sunnah for those praying behind him to say <em>Ameen</em> after he finishes reciting <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong></p>
<p>The scholars -may Allaah have mercy upon them- have mentioned that this is the point at which the saying of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> of both the Imam and those following him coincide.</p>
<p>I asked Shaykh Al-Albaani -may Allaah have mercy on him- during his visit to the Kingdom in the year 1410 A.H. regarding the matter of the Imam saying <em>Ameen</em> and those who follow him, and the Shaykh -may Allaah have mercy on him- said that it is upon those who are following the prayer to say <em>Ameen</em> just after the Imam, to the count of one or two letters, as the saying of <em>Ameen</em> will then be after the Imam and they will join in saying some of the letters of the word. Therefore, if the Imam says<em>Ameen</em> then those following say it in order for some of the letters of the word to coincide with one another, and at the same time the Imam will precede in one or two letters of the word. Thus in this manner the Imam saying <em>Ameen</em> and the followers will coincide in some of the letters and the end result will be that the saying of <em>Ameen</em> by the follower will be just after the <em>Ameen</em> of the Imam.</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly</strong></p>
<p>The virtue of saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>. The author -may Allaah have mercy on him- mentions from the Messenger , that if the Imam says <em>Ameen</em> and the Angels say <em>Ameen</em> and those following say <em>Ameen</em>, and they coincide with one another Allaah will forgive them all their previous sins.</p>
<p>Another virtue is that Allaah –<em>Subhanahu</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>– answers your saying of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> because it means ‘O Allaah answer \ respond.’</p>
<p>The third virtue is what the Messenger  mentioned in his saying: ‘The Jews do not envy you about anything more than they envy you of saying <em>Salaamu</em> <em>alaykum</em>(salutations) to each other and saying <em>Ameen</em> behind the Imam.’</p>
<p>This is why it is incumbent upon us, to ensure we say <em>Ameen</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Fourthly</strong></p>
<p>Due to what is mentioned with regard to the coinciding of saying <em>Ameen</em> of the Imam and those following him in prayer necessitates that those following are attentive in their prayer whilst following the Imam and the Imam’s recitation to ensure that he does not miss saying <em>Ameen</em> in the correct place. If he misses saying <em>Ameen</em> he loses great reward and recompense, which is mentioned in this hadeeth.</p>
<p>And this summons the presence of the heart and humility of the soul and the body whilst in prayer behind the Imam, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p><strong>Fifthly</strong></p>
<p>I would like to bring to attention that which is relevant to this discussion of saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, which is, once one is aware of the meaning of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, (O Allaah answer or O Allaah). Some people, whilst the Imam reads <em>Qunoot</em> and Exalts Allaah, Praises Him –<em>Subhanahu</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>– and glorifies Him, stop saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, replacing it by saying ‘<em>Subhanak’</em> (Glory be to You) or similar words. This clearly opposes the Sunnah as the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> is sufficient for all supplication regardless of whether it is<em>Dua’</em> praising Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> or <em>Dua’</em> of asking from Him or declaring Allaah’s Majesty and Greatness.</p>
