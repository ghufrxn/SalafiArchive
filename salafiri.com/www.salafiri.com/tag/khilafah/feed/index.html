				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="storytitle">Narration of Malik al Dar, evidence for Tawassul by the living &amp; not by the Prophet after his death</h3>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><em>Bismillah, wal-hamdulillah was-salatu was-salamu ‘ala Rasulillah.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The incident mentioned in the narration of Malik al Dar happened during the Khilafah of Umar radiyallahu anhu, during the time of drought, and so did the incident of Umar bin al Khattab’s (radiyallahu anhu) tawassul through the Prophet’s (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) uncle, Al Abbas radiyallahu anhu.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">I have come across many discussions in regards to this narration, and all of them were concentrating on the “authenticity” of the narration, discussing its chain.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">But I have not come across any discussions on the text of the hadith itself, the story,<br />
except for some quotes here and there from some current shaikhs, sited in ahl alhadith forum, and those 2 or 3 points mentioned by those shaikhs led me to research the story of the hadith in classical books of past scholars, and I have found it very interesting and informative.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The things I discovered and read show a totally different understanding of the hadith, than what is understood by many Muslims today including some scholars, it only needs for one to go deep and see where the scholars of the past quoted the narration, in which chapter and what they said before quoting it to understand the real meaning of the hadith.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">I will go straight to the points that I have regarding the text and story of this narration of Malik al Dar. After that I will mention some logical arguments in reply to the ones who use this narration as evidence for tawasul that is “<strong>asking the Prophet</strong> <strong>(sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) to make duaa to Allah for us AFTER HIS DEATH</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>The text of the narration:</strong><strong><br />
</strong><br />
It is related from Malik al-Dar, `Umar’s treasurer, <em>that the people suffered a drought during the time of `Umar (his khilafah), whereupon a man came to the grave of the Prophet and said: “O Messenger of Allah, ask for rain for your Community, for verily they have but perished,” after which the Prophet appeared to him in a dream and told him: “Go to `Umar and give him my greeting, then tell him that they will be watered. Tell him: You must be clever, you must be clever!” The man went and told `Umar. The latter said: “O my Lord, I spare no effort except in what escapes my power!””</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Scholars’ understanding of this narration</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Hafidh <strong>Ibn Hajar al Asqalani</strong> –<em>rahimahu Allah</em>– in his books “<em>Fath al Bari</em>” (vol 3 pg. 441):</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">He sites it in chapter “<em>The people asking the Imam to do istisqa’ in times of drought</em>,” in the chapter heading section, in which he quotes ahadith that have relevance to the chapter heading, and that connect it with hadiths that come under that chapter.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Amongst those narrations he mentions the narration of Malik al Dar, and he only quotes part of the narration, he stops at “go to Umar”. He used this as evidence that people ask the imam to do istisqa (<em>ask for rain</em>) for them in times of drought.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">He didn’t mention the rest of the hadith because it has nothing to do with the chapter heading, he only quoted what he believed fits the chapters title, for he says at the end of the section, after mentioning this narration:</p>
<p>“<em>From all of this appears the relevance of the chapter heading to the origin of this story</em>“<br />
so, al Hafidh Ibn Hajar <em>rahimahu Allah</em> understood from this hadith that the Prophet <em>sallallahu alayhi wa sallam</em> was directing the man to go ask the Imam, during that time (Umar <em>radiyallahu anhu</em>), to do istisqa’ for them.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Hafidh <strong>Ibn Kathir</strong> –<em>rahimahu Allah</em>-:<br />
He sites it in his book “<em>al Bidayah wan Nihaya </em>” (vol7 pg.104 <em>), </em>in which he mentions some narrations, right before he mentions Malik ad Dar’s narration, which explain the meaning of the narration.<br />
The narrations before it are by Sayf Ibn Umar, and in them is the mentioning of Umar radiyallahu anhu, after hearing about the man’s dream (who is said to be Bilal al Harith), asking the people on the minbar if they have seen anything bad from him, and then he tells them about the dream that Bilal saw, so they told him:</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">“Bilal has spoken the truth, <strong>so make istiqatha (seek or ask for help) to Allah</strong>, then the Muslims”. So then Umar radiyallahu anhu does istisqa’ through al Abbas radiyallahu anhu.<br />
In the second narration, they said “he found you slow in doing istisqa’, so <strong>do istisqa’ for us</strong> “, so he did.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">(Note: these 2 narrations could be weak, but the point is that al Hafidh Ibn Kathir rahimahu Allah mentioned them right before the narration of Malik, showing what it is about, which shows what he understood it to mean, same as what Ibn Hajar (r A) understood from it).</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Ala’ ad Deen Ali al Mutaqi al Hindi al Burhan Furi</strong> (d. 975) in his book <em>“Kanz al Ummal“:<strong><br />
</strong></em>He sites it in chapter of (<strong>salat al Istisqa’ – prayer for rain</strong>),</p>
<div>
<p>and what the man did at the grave of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was asking for dua, not istisqa’ prayer, and salat al Istisqa’ was done by Umar radiyallahu anhu, when he made tawassul through Al Abbas radiyallahu anhu, thus both narrations are connected to each other, as shown in the previous points.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> That the story of Malik al Dar’s narration is connected to the hadith about Umar’s tawassul through al Abbas, all leading to doing istisqa’ through the living, and not through the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam after his death.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Narrations with an addition.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">There are narrations of the same story, with an addition, if they are authentic (the authenticiy is not known to me so far), they would give very strong support to the understanding of the above scholars.<br />
and it also shows what the scholars who sited the narrations believed the narration to mean.<em><br />
<strong><br />
</strong></em>Imam Ibn Abd al Bar al Maliki in his book “al Isti’ab fi ma’rifat al As-hab”:<em><strong><br />
</strong><br />
</em>The people suffered a drought during the time of ‘Umar (his khilafah), whereupon a man came to the grave of the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) and said:”O Messenger of Allah, ask for rain for your Community, for verily they have but perished,” after which the Prophet appeared to him in a dream and told him: “Go to ‘Umar <strong>and tell him to do istisqa’ (ask Allah for rain) for the people,</strong> and that they will be watered. And tell him: You must be clever, you must be clever!” So, the man went and told ‘Umar, and Umar cried and said “O my Lord, I spare no effort except in what escapes my power!” <em><br />
</em><br />
Ahmad Abdullah at Tabari (d. 694 ) in his book “ar Riyadh an Nadhirah fi Manaqib al Ashara”:Anas bin Malik narrated:<br />
The people suffered drought during Umar’s time, whereupon a man came to teh grave of the Prophet (Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam), and said: “O Messenger of Allah, ask for rain for your community, for verily they have but perished,”, he said so the Messenger of Allah came to him in a dream and told him “Go to ‘Umar <strong>then tell him to do istisqa’ (ask Allah for rain) for the people,</strong> and that they will be watered. And tell him: You must be clever, you must be clever!” So, the man went and told ‘Umar, and Umar cried and said “O my Lord, I spare no effort except in what escapes my power!”. narrated by al Baghawi in al fada’il and Abu Umar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>Logical Arguments</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The ones who use this hadith for this type of tawassul say that Umar radiyallahu anhu did not rebuke the man who did istisqa’ at the grave.<br />
<strong>Reply</strong>: There is no clear evidence in the hadith indicating that the man told Umar of him going to the grave, but clearly he did tell him of the dream, telling him the message of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.<br />
so to say that he told him about his istisqa’ at the grave is an assumption, and we can’t use assumptions as evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>It didn’t rain until after Umar radiyallahu anhu made istisqa’ by al Abbas radiyallahu anhum</strong>.<br />
If the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was capable or had permission to do du’aa to Allah after his death, when asked by others, then it would have rained immediately after the man asked the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam at his grave, but it didn’t until after Umar’s istisqa’ through the duaa of Al Abbas radiyallahu anhu.<br />
This shows that the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was guiding the man to ask the Umar to do istisqa’ and not him, hinting to Umar by saying to him “<strong>be clever!</strong>“, and when Umar did istisqa’ by al Abbas (radiyallahu anhuma) it immediately rained..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If going to the grave of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to ask him to make duaa to Allah was permissable, Umar radiyallahu anhu would have done that when wanting to do istisqa’ instead of doing it through the uncle of the Messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, who was alive, and Umar’s (r.a) saying “<strong>we used to</strong> make tawassul through your Prophet’s duaa, and now we do tawassul through the uncle of your Prophet…”, indicates that they don’t make tawassul through the Prophet’s (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) duaa after his death, and only when he was alive, or else <strong>why would he say “we used to”</strong>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If what the man did (wether it was Bilal ibn al Harith radiyallahu anhu or someone else) was correct\permissable, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Why didn’t any of the scholars I quoted mention the narration in a chapter titled (tawassul by the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) or some title indicating that the narration is EVIDENCE for permissibility of that type of tawassul?<br />
Instead they title the chapter in which the narration is in (salat al istisqa’- the man didn’t do salat al Istisqa’ at the grave, only did duaa, while Umar rA did salat al istisqa) , (The people asking the Imam to do istisqa’ in times of drought),  wouldn’t it be more important to point out the permissibility of tawassul through the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam after his death, which is stronger than doing tawassul through the righteous and ahl al bayt?<br />
Instead they ignored that part , <strong>showing no importance to it at all</strong>.<br />
So if they believed that the narration indicates the permissibility of such a tawassul, why didn’t they at least <strong>hint</strong> to it by the chapter title or a comment like they did to show that it meant to do intercession through saliheen and ahl al bayt, and ask the imam to do istisqa?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">What was the point of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam telling Umar r.A “<strong>be clever</strong>“?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If the man told Umar that he went to the grave, and then told him about the dream, why would Umar do salat al istisqa’ when the man already asked the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to do istisqa’ and he told him that they will be watered?<br />
<strong>Isn’t the istisqa’ of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam sufficient?<br />
</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">If the action of the man was correct (to ask the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam to do istisqa), and the Prophet S.A.W answered his request, then why didn’t it rain immediately after the dream, and instead came down immediately after al Abbas’s (radiyallahu anhu) duaa?<br />
<strong>Who is higher in status, the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam or his uncle?</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Muhamad Ibn Jubayr) in Ibn Khuzaimah (1/258, 259 hadith no.514)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/78 hadith no.168, book 3, chapter 5, hadith no.23), at-Tamhid (9/145), al-Istidhkar: (no.148)    </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.765) and Muslim (no.463) from the hadith of Malik</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) It is established (that the Prophet Sallalaahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) recited Surah at Tur and Surah Mursalat in the Magrib prayer. See hadith no.49</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) It is narrated from Abu Abdullah as-Suna Nakhi that, “I came to Madinah during the time of Abu Bakr’s Caliphate and I prayed the Magrib behind him. He recited Surah Fatihah and the short mufasil (detailed) Surahs in the first two rak’ats then in the third rak’at he recited Surah Fatihha and one ayah, “Our Rabb, let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us and grant us from Yourself mercy. Indeed, You are the Bestower.” (al-Muwatta 1/79 hadith no.170, and its chain is authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From this truthful’s athar there are two issues that are known: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">First: Surah Fatihah should be prayed in every rak’ah therefore those who say “if nothing is recited in the last two rak’ahs then the salah is valid” then this saying is false.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Two: Apart from reciting Surah Fatihah it is allowed to recite from the Quran in the third (or fourth) rak’ah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) A summary of Ibn Umar’s athar is that (in the prayers that have four rak’ah) in the four rak’ahs he prayed Surah Fatihah and one Surah and sometimes he prayed two or three Surahs in one rak’a. (see al-Muwatta 1/79 hadith no.171, and its chain is authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) In some chains of this narration when Jubayr Ibn Mut’im heard the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) recite Surah Tur in Maghrib prayer then at that time he wasn’t a muslim. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From this the scholars have been able to extract the issue that if a non muslim becomes a muslim then he can say narrations whilst he is a muslim and they will be accepted on the condition that this narrator is trustworthy during his time in Islam. (whilst he is a muslim).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) This is also a refutation of those who say that the time for Maghrib Salah is very small and only small Surahs can be recited. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this article we wish to present the verification of the famous ḥadīth of “Prophetic Khilāfah will be for 30 years” so that the general people are aware of it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Dawūd as-Sijastānī in his Kitāb as-Sunan 2/290 Kitāb as-Sunnah, Bāb Fil-Khulāfa no.4646), Imām Abū Eesā Tirmidhī in Kitāb as-Sunan 2/46, Abwāb al-Fitan Bāb Mā Jā Fil Khilāfah no.2226), Imām Abū ʿAbdur Rahman Nasā’ī in Kitāb as-Sunan al-Kubrā 5/47 no.8155, Kitāb al-Manāqib Bāb 5, Imām Abū Ḥātim bin Ḥibbān Bastī in as-Ṣaḥīḥ (al-Ehsān no.6623, 6904, Mawārid az-Zamān no.1534,1535 and many other scholars of ḥadīth via various chains from Saʿīd bin Jamhān from Safīnah Abū ʿAbdir Rahman the servant of the Messenger of Allāh narrates</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Messenger of Allāh said “The Prophetic khilāfah will remain for 30 years and the Allāh will give power to whom He Wills. Saʿīd said Safīnah said to me “count the years, 2 years of Abū Bakr and 10 years of Umar and 12 years of Uthmān and Alī so on (i.e. 6 years). Saʿīd said “I said to Safīnah these people say that Alee was not a khalīfah to which he replied “The backs of Banū Zarqā and Banū Marwān have lied.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the wording of Abū Dawūd which differs slightly from the others  however the meaning is the same.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Concerning this Ḥadīth Imām Tirmidhī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth is Ḥasan.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Ḥadīth of Safīnah concerning the Khilāfah is authentic and it is my position regarding the Khulāfa.”</em> [Jāmʿe Bayān al-ʿIlm Wa Faḍilihi [2/225], see also Kitāb as-Sunnah of ʿAbdullāh bin Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal [2/590 no.1400]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Abī ʿĀṣim said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth in terms of being written is </em><em>established. Saʿīd bin Jamhān narrates from Ḥamād bin Salamah, a-ʿĀwām bin Ḥaushab and Ḥashraj (bin Nabātah)”</em> [Kitāb as-Sunnah [2/549-550 no.1181,1185]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Ibn Taymīyyah has also graded this narration to be authentic [as-Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/744] of Shaikh al-Albānī]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ḥākim also graded it authentic [al-Mustadrak [3/71]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The narrator Saʿīd bin Jamhān was declared to be trustworthy Imam Yaḥya bin Maʿīn, Imam Nasā’ī, Imam Ibn Ḥibbān and Imam Aḥmad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abū Dawūd also declared him to be trustworthy</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdīyy said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“According to me there is no harm in him”</em> [Tahdhīb ut-Tahdhīb [1/14]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ḥāfiẓ Dhahabī said</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Truthful from the middle (level of narrator).</em>” [al-Kāshif [1/282].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Truthful individual”</em> [Taqrīb ut-Tahdhīb no.2279]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In contrary to these Imāms, Imām Abū Ḥātim ar-Rāzī said, <em>“Write his ḥadīth but he cannot be used evidence.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This criticism is rejected due to a number of reasons:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] This opposes the praise of the majority</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] Zailaʿī’s Naṣb ur-Rāyah mentions [2/439]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abū Ḥātim’s saying “He is not evidence” is not harmful because he has not mentioned the reason for this criticism, he has used these words for many of the trustworthy and established narrators of the authentic books of ḥadīth without mentioning the reason, e.g. Khālid al-Ḥada and others, and Allāh knows best.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Dhahabī said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When Abū Ḥātim declares someone to be trustworthy, then hold onto it because he only declares someone trustworthy who is in the Ṣaḥīḥ Ḥadīth. Similarly when he declares someone to be weak or if he he says “he cannot be used as evidence” then hold back until you know what others have said. If someone says they were trustworthy then do not take Abū Ḥatīms criticism as he was firm with regards to the narrators. He has said about a group of narrators from the Ṣaḥīḥs they were not evidence and not strong and other similar statements.”</em> [Siyar Āʿlām an-Nabūla [3/260]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence this criticism is rejected.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Some scholars have alleged Imām Abū Ḥātim was harsh hence his statement is rejected compared to Imām Aḥmad bin Ḥanbals statement who was balanced and investigative.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Sājī&#8217;s statement, <em>&#8220;His Ḥadīth have no supports.&#8221;</em> Is also general and it is rejected because it is not detailed neither is it severe jarḥ. When someone’s honesty is established not being supported does not affect him. As it has already been established that Saʿīd bin Jamhān is trustworthy with definitive evidences, him being alone in reporting this Ḥadīth does not affect it it anyway.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Deceit of the Ḥadīth Rejecters.</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The real aim and objective of the Ḥadīth rejecters through their deceitful plots and treachery it to show the authentic Ḥadīth of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) are fabricated. This is to lead the general Muslims away from the fundamentals of the dīn and to create doubts so that the people begin to think the dīn as unreliable and then they eventually stray from the straight path.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With this they then want to express and impose their deficient opinions amongst the people, which will eventually lead to no one acting on the Qurān or Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One person from amongst the rejecters and deniers of Ḥadīth is Tamannā ʿAmādī Phalwārī, he writes in his fabrication of a book, &#8216;Intizār Mahdī Masīh&#8217; [Awaiting The Mahdī Messiah] whilst vilifying and rebuking this very same Hadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;You have seen the name of Ḥashraj bin Nabātah Al-Kūfi with regards to these narrations. He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl, he is not evidence and rejected in Ḥadīth and you do not generally find any supports for his Hadīth.&#8221;</em> [pg.57]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like to say regarding Hashraj bin Nabātah Imām Ahmad said, <em>&#8220;Trustworthy.&#8221;</em> And Ibn Ma&#8217;īn said, <em>&#8220;Good, trustworthy and there is no harm in him.&#8221; </em>Abū Zurʿah said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him and he is grounded in Ḥadīth.&#8221;</em> Ibn ʿAdīyy said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him.&#8221;</em> Tirmidhī graded his Ḥadīth Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the other hand Abū Ḥatīm said, <em>&#8220;Good write his Ḥadīth but he is not used as evidence.&#8221;</em> as-Sājī said, <em>&#8220;Weak.&#8221;</em> Ibn Ḥibbān said, <em>&#8220;He has a few Ḥadīth, his narrations are rejected and it is impermissible to use his reports as evidence when he is alone in reporting them.&#8221;</em> Nasā‘ī said he is not strong and criticised him another time he said there is not harm in him and praised him. [Summarised from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥākim and Dhahabī authenticated one of his Ḥadīth. [Mustadrak [3/606], ʿAlī (I think Ibn Al-Madīnī) also declared him to be trustworthy [Mizān Al-‘Eitidāl [1/551]. Hāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr said, <em>&#8220;Truthful but errs.&#8221;</em> [Taqrīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The conclusion is, this narrator is trustworthy and truthful according to the majority of the scholars of Ḥadīth. Hence, Tamannā ʿAmādī is a liar in his claim that, <em>&#8221; He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are so many lies in Tamannā ʿĀmādī’s book that a collation of them would result in a book. For example in the same book on [pg.54] this individual writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Muʿammar bin Rāshid of Yemen was a freed slave who died in the year 154H. He was active in compiling and collating Ḥadīth, he would narrate from the well known liar Ābān bin ʿAbbās. Whilst narrating from him he would put forward the name of Thābit al-Banānī instead [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101] yet the scholars of Ḥadīth still considered him to be trustworthy.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say let us look at the referenced page from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb and it clearly says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Khalīlī has transmitted in in al-Irshād with an authentic chain from Aḥmad that he said to Yaḥya ibn Maʿīn when he was copying the manuscript of ʿAbdur Razzāq from Muʿammar from Ābān, “You are writing this when you know Ābān is a liar?” He (Ibn Maʿīn) replied, “May Allāh have mercy on you Oh Abū ʿAbdullāh, I am writing it in order to memorise it so that when a liar (like Tamannā ʿĀmādī) narrates on Muʿammar from Thābit from Anas, I will say to them you have lied the chain is via Ābān (and not Thābit).”</em> [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask the readers now, why is Muʿammar to blame here and what is his fault? What he heard he narrated it in the same way, when he heard from Ābān he would say Ābān and when he heard from Thābit he would say Thābit. If he scholar of Ḥadīth do not consider him to be trustworthy what should they consider him (meaning he was honest)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of Tamannā ʿĀmādī are liars whose tongues and pens are free, if they want to, they can try to prove the day as night and night as day but they must remember a day will come when there will most definitely be punishment. On that day one will be taken to account for every deed big or small.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this was the research into the correct position of Ḥashraj bin Nabātah, it must be remembered here that he is not alone in reporting the Ḥadīth, rather the following individuals support him</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] ʿAbd al-Wārith [Abū Dawūd no.4646]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] al-ʿAwām bin Ḥūwshab [Abū Dawūd no.4647]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Ḥamād bin Salamah [Musnad Aḥmad [5/220-221]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus the criticism against Ḥashraj is rejected from every angle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islām Ibn Taymīyyah said concerning this Ḥadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This Ḥadīth is well known from the narrations of Ḥamād bin Salamah, ʿAbd al-Wārith bin Saʿīd and al-ʿAwām bin Ḥūwshab and others on the authority of Saʿīd bin Jamhān. Imām Aḥmad relied on this narration for evidence for the Khilāfah of the four Khulāfa ar-Rāshidīn and he also authenticated it. He would also use it as evidence against those people who would remain silent with regards to the Khilāfah of ʿAlī as the people began to differ. To the extent that Aḥmad said, “Whoever does not consider ʿAlī as the fourth Khulāfa is more astray than is domestic donkey.” He also forbade in establishing wedlock with such people. This issue is agreed upon by the jurists, scholars of the Sunnah, the people of knowledge and insight and the righteous people, this is also the position ie madhab of the general people. Some of the people of desires have opposed them in this, from them are the people of theological rhetoric and like them the Rāfidah who rebuke and censure the first three Khalīphs. Likewise, the Khawārij who abuse the Khilāfah of two son in laws ie Uthmān and ʿAlī (of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) or like some of the Nāṣibīs who attack the Khilāfah of ʿAli or like some of the ignorant ones upon the Sunnah who remain silent of the Khilāfah (of ʿAlī)”</em> [Majmūʿa Fatāwa [35/18-19]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The following scholars graded the Ḥadīth to be authentic and strong,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] at-Tirmidhī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Ibn Jarīr at-Ṭabarī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4] Ibn Abī ʿĀsim</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5] Ibn Ḥibbān</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6] al-Ḥākim</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7] Ibn Taymīyyah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8] ad-Dhahabī</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9] Ibn Ḥajr al-ʿAsqalānī (Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/745 no.459] All praise be to Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some scholars have mentioned two supporting narrations for this Ḥadīth</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[1] On the authority of Abī Bakra (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) as transmitted by Baihaqī in Dalail an-Nabūwwah [6/342] the chain is weak due to ʿAlī bin Zaid bin Jadʿān</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[2] On the authority of Jābir bin ʿAbdullāh (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) [al-Wāhidī in al-Wasīṭ cited from as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/745] and its chain is weak.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Benefit</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the later people claim this Ḥadīth of Safīnah opposes the Ḥadīth of Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim which Jābir bin Samurah (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) narrates from the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This affair will not cease until there are 12 Khalīphs…. And all of them will be from the Quraish.”</em> [Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, Kitāb al-Imārah, Bāb an-Nās Tabʿa Li-Quraish Wa Khilāfah Fil Quraish [no.1821] and its origin is in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī [no.7222-7223]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is lack of knowledge on the part of the claimants because both authentic Ḥadīth can be reconciled. The Ḥadīth of Safīnah refers to the Khilāfah of the Khulāfa Rāshidīn and the Khilāfah on the Prophetic Manhaj and the Ḥadīth of Jābir refers to the unrestricted Khilāfah. Thus the first Ḥadīth restricts and negates any more years than the 30 years of the Khilāfah of the Khulāfa ar-Rāshidīn and the second Ḥadīth establishes the Khilāfah of the non Rāshidīn hence there is contradiction between the two Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr has alluded to this reconciliation in Fath al-Bārī [13/212 under Ḥadīth no.7223] as well as Hāfiẓ Ibn Taymīyyah in Majmūʿa Fatāwa. This is what is correct and for further details refer to Shaikh Muḥammad Nāṣir ud Dīn al-Albānī’s book Silsilah as-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ [1/742-749 no.459] as he has discussed this issue in great detail.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hāfiẓ Zubair ʿAlī Zai</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">23-7-1993  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[JazakAllāh Khair to brother Shehzad Anwar Sattar for his help]</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[The following is an extract from a longer article of Shaikh Zubair Ali Za&#8217;i on the verification of the ḥadīth of Khilāfah for 30 years.] </span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Deceit of the Ḥadīth Rejecters.</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The real aim and objective of the Ḥadīth rejecters through their deceitful plots and treachery it to show the authentic Ḥadīth of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) are fabricated. This is to lead the general Muslims away from the fundamentals of the dīn and to create doubts so that the people begin to think the dīn as unreliable and then they eventually stray from the straight path.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With this they then want to express and impose their deficient opinions amongst the people, which will eventually lead to no one acting on the Qurān or Ḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One person from amongst the rejecters and deniers of Ḥadīth is Tamanna Amadi Phalwārī, he writes in his fabrication of a book, &#8216;Intizār Mahdī Masīh&#8217; [Awaiting The Mahdī Messiah] whilst vilifying and rebuking this very same Hadīth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;You have seen the name of Ḥashraj bin Nabātah Al-Kūfi with regards to these narrations. He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl, he is not evidence and rejected in Ḥadīth and you do not generally find any supports for his Hadīth.&#8221;</em> [pg.57]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like to say regarding Hashraj bin Nabātah Imām Ahmad said, <em>&#8220;Trustworthy.&#8221;</em> And Ibn Ma&#8217;īn said, <em>&#8220;Good, trustworthy and there is no harm in him.&#8221; </em>Abū Zurʿah said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him and he is grounded in Ḥadīth.&#8221;</em> Ibn ʿAdīyy said, <em>&#8220;There is no harm in him.&#8221;</em> Tirmidhī graded his Ḥadīth Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the other hand Abū Ḥatīm said, <em>&#8220;Good write his Ḥadīth but he is not used as evidence.&#8221;</em> as-Sājī said, <em>&#8220;Weak.&#8221;</em> Ibn Ḥibbān said, <em>&#8220;He has a few Ḥadīth, his narrations are rejected and it is impermissible to use his reports as evidence when he is alone in reporting them.&#8221;</em> Nasā‘ī said he is not strong and criticised him another time he said there is not harm in him and praised him. [Summarised from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥākim and Dhahabī authenticated one of his Ḥadīth. [Mustadrak [3/606], ʿAlī (I think Ibn Al-Madīnī) also declared him to be trustworthy [Mizān Al-‘Eitidāl [1/551]. Hāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr said, <em>&#8220;Truthful but errs.&#8221;</em> [Taqrīb]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The conclusion is, this narrator is trustworthy and truthful according to the majority of the scholars of Ḥadīth. Hence, Tamanna Amadi is a liar in his claim that, <em>&#8221; He is a weak in Ḥadīth according to almost all of the Imāms of Rijāl”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are so many lies in Tamanna Amadi’s book that a collation of them would result in a book. For example in the same book on [pg.54] this individual writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Muʿammar bin Rashid of Yemen was a freed slave who died in the year 154H. He was active in compiling and collating Ḥadīth, he would narrate from the well known liar Ābān bin ʿAbbās. Whilst narrating from him he would put forward the name of Thābit al-Banānī instead [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101] yet the scholars of Ḥadīth still considered him to be trustworthy.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We say let us look at the referenced page from Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb and it clearly says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Khalīlī has transmitted in in al-Irshād with an authentic chain from Aḥmad that he said to Yaḥya ibn Maʿīn when he was copying the manuscript of ʿAbdur Razzāq from Muʿammar from Ābān, “You are writing this when you know Ābān is a liar?” He (Ibn Maʿīn) replied, “May Allāh have mercy on you Oh Abū ʿAbdullāh, I am writing it in order to memorise it so that when a liar (like Tamannā ʿĀmādī) narrates on Muʿammar from Thābit from Anas, I will say to them you have lied the chain is via Ābān (and not Thābit).”</em> [Tahdhīb at-Tahdhīb [1/101]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask the readers now, why is Muʿammar to blame here and what is his fault? What he heard he narrated it in the same way, when he heard from Ābān he would say Ābān and when he heard from Thābit he would say Thābit. If he scholar of Ḥadīth do not consider him to be trustworthy what should they consider him (meaning he was honest)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of Tamanna Amadi are liars whose tongues and pens are free, if they want to, they can try to prove the day as night and night as day but they must remember a day will come when there will most definitely be punishment. On that day one will be taken to account for every deed big or small.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">When Did the Khilāfah Finish</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Hizb ut-Tahrīr and Muhājirūn</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Thumma &#8220;Qulu Bidatun-Dalālah&#8221;</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;And Every Innovation is Misguidance&#8217;</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">First Published 1999</span></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A great majority of the the members, sympathisers and advocates of Hizb ut-Taḥrīr and al-Muhājirūn or whatever names they coin for themselves have always been under the delusion that the Khilāfah was destroyed in 1924. So when the aḥadīth regarding the period of Khilāfah are presented to them, they are shocked and astonished to the existence of such authentic aḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Their responses after these aḥadīth presented to them vary, but almost every time they say, <em>&#8220;Brother give us the reference, we will check it out&#8221;</em> or <em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Brother we need to look at the</span> chain of the ḥadīth because&#8230;.&#8221;</em> assuming the aḥadīth maybe weak and by this they try to avoid the real point of dispute.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These aḥadīth which clearly mention the time when the Khilāfah finished are thorns in the hearts of Hizb ut-Tahrīr and al-Muhajiroon as you will notice their dismay and disapproval when the aḥadīth are mentioned. These aḥadīth clearly elucidate the time when the khilāfah finished and when kingship would begin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If we look at these aḥadīth from Hizb ut-Tahrīr and al-Muhājirūn&#8217;s position, we will acknowledge quickly that their <strong>CALL </strong>to the Khilāfah will be in vain hence the lack of knowledge regarding its existence. The ḥadīth is in different words but the meanings are the same.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Saʿīd bin Jamhān</strong> from <strong>Safīnah</strong> who said the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu alayhi wasalam) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Khilāfah after me will be thirty (30) years.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This ḥadīth is <strong><em>Ṣaḥīḥ</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ṭayālisī (no. 1107), Musnad Aḥmad (5/220-221), Faḍail as-Ṣahābah (nos. 789-790, 1027) of Imām Aḥmad, Kitāb as-Sunnah (2/573, 591-592 no&#8217;s 1348, 1402-1407) of ʿAbdullāh bin Aḥmad, Nasāʿī in Kubrā in the chapter of Manāqib as mentioned in Tuḥfatul-Ashrāf (4/22), Abū Dawūd in as-Sunnah (4/36 no.4646), Aʿun al-Maʿbūd Sharḥ Sunan Abī Dawūd (12/259-261 no.4633), Jām&#8217;e at-Tirmidhī (4/436 no.2226) Ṣaḥīḥ at-Tirmidhī (2/486 no.2226) of Allāmah Muḥammad Nāsir ud dīn al-Albānī, Kitāb as-Sunnah (p.557, no’s 1181, 1185) of Ibn Abī ʿĀsim, as-Sahābah (no. 108) of Khaithamah ibn Suleimān, Mushkil al-Āthār (4/313) of Ṭaḥāwī, al-Eḥsān Bi-Tartīb Ṣaḥīḥ Ibn Ḥibbān (8/227 no.6623, 9/48 no.6904 and no&#8217;s 1534-1535 &#8211; Mawārid az-Zamān), al-Kabīr (no&#8217;s 13, 136, 6442-6444) of Ṭabarānī, Mustadrak al-Hākim (3/156 no.4697), al-Mudkhil (6/2) of Baihaqī also in his al-Eʿtiqād (nos. 932, 934, 1047) Sharḥ us-Sunnah (14/74-75), Aqīdatus-Salaf Aṣhābul-Ḥadīth (p.86) of Imām Ṣabūnī, Silsilah Aḥadīth as-Ṣahīḥaḥ (no&#8217;s 459, 1534-1535), Tarīkh al-Khulafā (p.9) of Imām Suyūtī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Tirmidhī there is an addition to it; narrated <strong>Aḥmad bin Munīʿa</strong> who narrated from <strong>Suraij bin Nuʿmān </strong>who narrated from <strong>Hashraj bin Nubātah</strong> on the authority of <strong>Saʿīd bin Jamhān</strong> who said, Narrated <strong>Safīnah</strong> who said, the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu alayhi wasalam) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Khilāfah in my Ummah will be thirty (30) years, and then after it there will be kingship.&#8221; </em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan at-Tirmidhī (2/486 no.2226) Imām al-Albānī said, <strong>&#8220;Ṣaḥīḥ&#8221;</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Tirmidhī adds,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This ḥadīth is hasan, it is narrated by more than one person from Saʿīd bin Jamhān&#8230;”</em> (Jāmʿe at-Tirmidhī (4/436), Auʿn al-Maʿbūd (12/260)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Suyūtī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Imām Aḥmad has bought from Ḥamād ibn Salamah, Saʿīd ibn Jamhān and Safīnah that they heard the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu alayhi wasalam) say, The Khilāfah in my Ummah will be thirty (30) years, and then after it there will be kingship.&#8221; the authors of the Sunans have mentioned this and Ibn Ḥibbān and others have authenticated it. It is the position of the majority of the scholars that the era of the four companions and including that of Imām Ḥasan (Radiallaah ta&#8217;ala anha) was a period of thirty (30) years.”</em> (Tarīkh al-Khulafā (p.9-10), al-Alqamī reported the same from his teacher (Auʿn al-Maʿbūd (12/259), see also Fath al-Wadūd.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Suyūtī further said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Imām Bazār has mentioned from Muḥammad bin Sakīn from Yaḥyā bin Ḥisān from Yaḥyā ibn Hamzah on the authority of Makhūl on the authority of Abu Thaʿlabah on the authority of Abū Ubaidah bin Jarrāh who said the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu alayhi wasalam) said, “The dīn began with prophethood and mercy, then there will be Khilāfah and mercy then there will be kingship and force. This ḥadīth is ḥasan.&#8221;</em> (Tarīkh al-Khulafā (p.10)</span></p>
