<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Question: </span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is the correct opinion about the stories narrated from one of the famous Soofee leaders, as-Sayyid Ahmad ar-Rifaa’ee,<span id="more-1284"></span> which say that he visited al-Masjid an-Nabawee (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) in Madeenah and made du’aa at his grave, and the Messenger (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) reached his hand out to him and he kissed it? This is a widespread belief among the followers of his tareeqah (sect) and it is a belief they hold firmly, even though he lived in the 6th century AH. How true is this story?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Answer</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">This is false(hood) and has no basis of truth, because the Prophet (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) died as decreed by Allah and as Allah said:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;" align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">{Verily you (O Muhammad sallallahu alayhe wassallam) will die and verily, they (too) will die}</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000000;">(Glorious Qur’aan: Surah Az-Zumar, 39: v30)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">According to a Saheeh hadeeth, the Prophet (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;" align="justify"><em><span style="color: #000000;">«Allah has angels who travel about in the earth and convey to me the salaams (prayers and salutations) of my Ummah»</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">And he (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;" align="justify"><em><span style="color: #000000;">«There is no one who sends salaams (prayers and salutations) upon me but Allah will restore my soul to me so that I may return his salaam»</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">And he (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;" align="justify"><em><span style="color: #000000;">«The best of your days is Friday, so send more blessings (salaah) upon me on that day, for your blessings will be shown to me.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, how will they be shown to you when you (your body) have disintegrated?” He said, “Allah has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets»</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">And there are many ahaadeeth which say similar things, but it is not narrated anywhere that the Prophet (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) said that he would shake hands with anybody. This indicates that this story is false. Even if we were to assume that it is true, then it could be that was a Shaytaan (devil) who shook hands with him in order to deceive him and lead him and others astray. What all Muslims have to do is to fear Allah and to adhere to His Sharee’ah, which is indicated in His Book and in the Sunnah of His trustworthy Messenger, and to beware of anything that goes against that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah reform the Muslims and grant them understanding of His religion and cause them to adhere to His Sharee’ah, for He is the Most Generous.</span></p>

<h4 class="entry-title" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aboo Eeman Zakariyya Brown</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="entry-title" style="text-align: center;"></h4>
<p class="entry-title" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this article Shaikh Dr. Abduls-Salaam bin Burjis (may Allaah have mercy  him), discusses the issue of the difference between general and specific tabdee’ (declaring someone to be an innovator).</span></p>
<div class="entry">
<p class="p2 ft2" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The second point that we will speak about is the term “Ahlul Bid’ah” (the people of innovation); there is a difference between general tabdee’ and speciﬁc tabdee’<span class="ft5">.</span></span></p>
<p class="p2 ft2" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An example of general tabdee’ is if we said: <em>“whoever say ‘my pronunciation of the Qur’aan (when I recite it*) is created’ then he is an innovator (mubtadi’)<span class="ft5">.</span>”</em> This is tabdee’ generally<span class="ft5">.</span></span></p>
<p class="p2 ft2" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for an example of speciﬁc tabdee’, then if we said: ” such and such, the son of such and such said such and such so he is an innovator<span class="ft5">.</span>“</span></p>
<p class="p2 ft2" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The difference between the two expressions is that there is nothing wrong with general tabdee’, nor is it dangerous to say: “whoever says such and such innovation is an innovator” without pinpointing the individual – this is general tabdee’<span class="ft7">. </span>As for speciﬁc tabdee’, then this is different to the general in it being a forbidden initially; <span class="ft8">so it is impermissible for us to pinpoint an individual and say “this person is an innovator completely until the proof has been established upon him</span><span class="ft7">. </span>If the proof is established on him and he rejects it then now it becomes permissible for us (i<span class="ft7">.</span>e<span class="ft7">. </span>the scholars who are grounded*) to identify him with the name of the innovators – and this is the ruling for the speciﬁc because perhaps in the ﬁrst instance he was someone who was making an interpretation, or maybe he was ignorant, so if he is informed and he is stubborn and rejects and it is known that he is pleased with these innovations then only now is it permissible to declare him to be an innovator<span class="ft10">.</span></span></p>
<p class="p2 ft2" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the speech regarding pinpointing – whether it be in takfeer (declaring someone to be a disbeliever), tabdee’, or tafseeq (declaring someone to be an evil doer) – is very extensive and Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah (may Allaah have mercy upon them)<span class="ft12"> </span>have extended speech on this topic and exhausted lengthy and detailed research about it, however I will bring an example of something that is less than tabdee’ in the ﬁeld of pinpointing<span class="ft13">. </span>That is that the prophet <span class="ft12">&#8211; </span>cursed the one who drinks alcohol (generally) and this is well known and established<span class="ft15">. </span>Despite that, when Abdullaah Ibn Himaar (may Allaah have mercy upon him) was brought to him and he used to drink alcohol, some of the companions(may Allaah have mercy upon them)<span class="ft16"> </span>said: “May Allaah curse him, how frequently has he been brought to you with this!”<span class="ft15">. </span>The prophet <span class="ft16">&#8211; </span>became angry upon hearing this and he replied “do not curse him because indeed he loves Allaah and His messenger<span class="ft5">.</span>“</span></p>
<p class="p7 ft4" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the prophet <span class="ft19">&#8211; </span>cursed the drinker of alcohol generally but he prohibited us from pinpointing<span class="ft5">.</span></span></p>
<p class="p7 ft4" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So that which results from this is that pinpointing (individuals) in the declaration of tabdee’ is prohibited until the proof has been established upon him and if the proof is established and he is stubborn and rejects it, then it now becomes permissible in the religion to place the term of “innovation” on him<span class="ft5">.</span></span></p>
