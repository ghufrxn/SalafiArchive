<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah al-Rajihi said in his explanation of <em>Asal as-Sunnah wa I’tiqad ud-Din</em> wherein Imam Ibn Abi Hatim mentions from Imams Abu Hatim Razi and Abu Zur’ah ar-Razi,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[11]</strong> <strong>Allah, The Blessed and Exalted, will be seen in the Hereafter; the People of Jannah will see Him with their sights.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The believers will see their Rabb, The Exalted, as transmitted by texts from the Book of Allah and the Prophets Sunnah. So, Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah affirm the believers will see Allah with their sight in the Hereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Affirming the seeing of Allah on the Day of Resurrection is an attribute which is disputed between Ahlus Sunnah and the people of innovation. The same applies to the attribute of Kalam – Speech and the attribute of Uluww and Istiwa – Highness and rising over the Throne.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These three attributes are a distinguishing sign and a distinction between Ahlus Sunnah and Ahlul Bid’ah. So, whoever affirms these attributes is from Ahlus Sunnah and whoever rejects them is from Ahlul Bid’ah. Whoever affirms Allah’s Istiwa – rising over The Throne and his Highness over his creation, and whoever affirms Allah’s speech is with words [with] meaning, sound and letters and whoever affirms the seeing of Allah in the Hereafter is from Ahlus Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The believer has the Aqidah that Allah will be seen in the Hereafter and the believers will see Allah with their eyesight. This is established and proven from the texts of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[Evidence from the Quran and Sunnah Affirming the Seeing of Allah]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Quran says,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> “On that Day some faces will be bright, looking at their Lord.” (Surah al-Qiyamah: 22-23)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He added they will be looking at his Face by the addition of “ila” denoting they will be looking at the Face of Allah, The Magnificent with the eye(s) of their face (i.e. head). So, the statement of Allah is free of any factors that oppose the true reality of this matter. This then proves the believers will see Allah with their eyesight.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Glorious said,<strong> “There they will have whatever they desire, and with Us is even more.” (Surah Qaf: 35)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The explanation of this ayah mentions, <strong>“Mazid – Even more”</strong> means looking at the face of Allah, The Benevolent.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Glorious said,<strong> “Those who do good will have the finest reward<sup>1</sup>and </strong><strong>˹</strong><strong>even</strong><strong>˺</strong><strong> more.” (Surah Yunus: 26)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Ziyadah – even more”</strong> means looking at the face of Allah, The Benevolent. This is proven and established from the explanation of this as mentioned in <em>Sahih Muslim</em> when the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was asked about az-Ziyadah he said, <em>“</em><em>Looking at their Rabb.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> “Undoubtedly, they will be veiled from their Rabb on that Day.” (Surah al-Mutaffifin: 15)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning the disbelievers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam ash-Shafi’i used this ayah as evidence to affirm the believers will see Allah in the Hereafter. He said, <em>“When Allah veiled them in anger, then there is evidence in this that they will see Him in delight.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, when the disbelievers were veiled, it proves the believers will see Allah. If they (the believers) do not see Allah, they and their detractors would be in a state of confusion regarding the veiling.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, and similarly, there are texts in the Mutawatir Sunnah that affirm the seeing of Allah. Allamah ibn al-Qayyim said, <em>“As for the ahadith from the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and his Companions which evidence the seeing of Allah are mutawatir.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> and he followed this up by transmitting 30 such reports in Hadi al-Arwah.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From such reports are the following,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Abu Hurayrah RadiAllahu Anhu when a group of Companions said, <em>&#8220;Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam! Will we see our Rabb on the Day of Resurrection?” The Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said, “Do you have any difficulty seeing the Moon when it is a full moon?” They said, “No, Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.” He said, “Do you have difficulty seeing the Sun when there are no clouds?” They said, “No, Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.” He said, “So you will see Him in the same way…”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><strong>[5]</strong></a> </em></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Hadith of Jarir bin Abdullah al-Bajali RadiAllahu Anhu when the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw the moon on the 14<sup>th</sup> night he said, <em>“</em><em>Certainly you will see your Rabb as you see this moon and you will have no trouble in seeing Him.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Abu Musa al-Ash’ari RadhiAllahu Anhu who narrates from the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who said, <em>“(There will be) two Paradises of silver and all the utensils and whatever is therein; and two Paradises of gold, and its utensils and whatever therein, and there will be nothing to prevent the people from seeing their Rabb except the Cover of Majesty over His Face in the Paradise of Adan.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Where Will the Believers See Allah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahlus Sunnah affirm the believers will see Allah in the Hereafter. As for seeing Allah in this world, then no one holds this to be correct. Furthermore, there is no dispute among Ahlus Sunnah in this regard (that anyone can see Allah in this world) except concerning our Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam when he ascended on the Night Journey. Ahlus Sunnah agree that he (The Prophet Sallalalhu Alayhi Wasallam) did not see Allah on earth, but they differed whether he saw Allah on the night of ascension and there are two views regarding this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[The Disagreement of the Scholars Whether the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam Saw Allah on the Night Journey and There are Two Views]</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The first view:</strong> He saw Allah with his normal eyes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The second view:</strong> He saw Allah with the eyes of his heart. This is the correct view due to the following reasons.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The statement of Ai’shah RadhiAllahu Anha when Masruq asked her, <em>“Did Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam see Allah”? She said, “My hair stood up by what you said! Then she said, “Whoever says to you that Muhammad saw Allah, has indeed lied.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Abu Dharr in <em>Sahih Muslim</em> when the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was asked did you see your Rabb (Allah) he said, <em>“Nur is all that I saw.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning, the Nur was his veiled barrier which prevented him from seeing him.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Abu Musa RadhiAllahu Anhu from the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who said, <em>“Allah, The Exalted and Mighty does not sleep, and it does not befit Him to sleep. He lowers and raises the scale. The deeds in the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day, and the deeds of the day before the deeds of the night. His veil is the Nur – light.” In another narration it mentions “The Fire. If he withdraws it (the veil), the splendour of His countenance would consume His creation so far as His sight reaches.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a></em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu alayhi Wasallam is included in the generality of the creation of Allah, The Exalted.    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Correct View is what the Researchers (Scholars) are Upon</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(they say) the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam did not see Allah on the Night of Ascension, but he heard the speech of Allah from behind the veiled barrier without an intermediary and he spoke with Allah as Musa spoke with Allah. Allah said, <strong>“It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by Revelation, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His Leave. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise.” (Surah ash-Shura: 51).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some scholars reconciled these texts like Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> so the scholars who held the view that the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw Allah based on the report of Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma who said, <em>“He Saw His Rabb (Allah) The Exalted.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> and what is transmitted from Imam Ahmad that the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw Allah as well and including all the texts and reports which affirm the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw Allah, are taken and understood as seeing with the heart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for what has been transmitted by the way of texts and reports which negate seeing Allah, are to be taken and understood as the negation of seeing Allah with the eyes. In this way the evidence is reconciled, and it is not contradictory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Those who held the view the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw Allah with his eyes include an-Nawawi, al-Qurtubi and a group of other scholars.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answering the Narrations Which Mention Seeing Allah with the Eyes</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">As for what has been transmitted from Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma that he said, <em>“He saw His Rabb (Allah) The Exalted.”</em> Then this is general and brief. It is also transmitted from him that he said, <em>“He saw with his heart.”</em> So, the first narration is unrestricted which the second narration is restricted or confined and the restricted is taken over the unrestricted.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly the same applies to what was transmitted from Imam Ahmad when he said, <em>“He saw (Allah)”</em> as it was transmitted from him that he said, <em>“He saw with his heart”</em>, so the restricted is taken over the unrestricted.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the seeing of Allah in this world, the scholars are agreed that no can see Allah, and no one differs with this except when our Prophet ascended on the night journey.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No consideration or importance is given to some of the people of innovation like the Sufis who say it is possible to see Allah. They engulf themselves in every danger when they believe it is possible to see Allah and this is the most futile of futilities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Seeing (wanting to see) Allah in this world is permissible but also an impossible and not a reality. It might be possible rationally but invalid and unreal according to the Shari’ah. As for the Hereafter, it is rationally permissible, valid, and real according to the Shari’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The evidence that supports the view that seeing Allah in this world is impossible is when Musa Alayhis Salam asked Allah to see Him. He said, <strong>“Oh my Rabb! Show me (Yourself), that I may look at You.” </strong>So, if it was possible to see Allah Musa would not have asked, and so in order to see Allah he asked. However, he heard the speech of Allah and wanted more and wanted to see Allah. Allah said, <strong>“You cannot see Me.”</strong> Meaning he did not have the capable power to see Allah due to the weakness of humans. So, when he said, <strong>“Oh my Rabb! Show me (Yourself), that I may look at You.&#8221;</strong> Allah said, <strong>“but look upon the mountain; if it stands still in its place then you shall see Me.&#8221;</strong> So, when Allah appeared to the mountain it was crushed to dust and Musa fell unconscious.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> As Allah said, <strong>“So when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He made it collapse to dust, and Musa fell down unconscious. Then when he regained consciousness, he said: “Glory be to You, I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.&#8221; (Surah al-A’raf: 143)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the Salaf said, <em>“He only appeared except the size of the tip of the little finger.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the Aqidah of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah regarding seeing Allah. As for the Day of Resurrection Allah will recreate the believers stronger and it would be possible for them to see Allah. A person decays when he dies, and he becomes dust except the tailbone.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> On the day of Resurrection Allah will send rain and the bodies of mankind will sprout. Allah restores human matter through transformation and thus recreates believers stronger which affirms the believers will see Allah. So, mankind is same of and in themselves, but their attributes have changed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>In Summary</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No one can see Allah in this world, nor the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam or anyone else. Seeing Allah is eternal bliss for the people of Paradise, and it is the greatest pleasure given to the people of Paradise that they will see Allah, as Allah said,<strong> “Those who do good will have the finest reward and even more.” (Surah Yunus: 26) </strong>and he said<strong>, “and with Us is even more.” (Surah Qaf: 35)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, when the believers see Allah in Paradise, they will forget the eternal bliss they are in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Religious View of the People of Innovation in Seeing Allah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, concerning the people of innovation they deny the seeing of Allah in this world and in the Hereafter. This is the belief of the Jahmiyyah, the Mu’tazilah and Asha’irah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mu’tazilah: They explain away the seeing of Allah as knowledge. They say the meaning of the statement of Allah, <em>“</em><em>So verily, you shall see your Rabb as you see the moon like on a night with a full moon.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> Meaning you will see your Rabb is to have knowledge of it without difficulty and without any doubts just as one knows the moon is the moon just as Allah says, <strong>“Have you not seen how your Rabb dealt with the owners of the Elephant?” (Surah al-Fil: 1)</strong> So, the seeing of Allah here means [having] knowledge of it i.e. meaning to have knowledge of how the owner of the elephants dealt with them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This explanation is absolutely futile and it renders the meaning invalid. The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said in a hadith. <em>“Like you see the Moon…like you see the Sun.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a> This is seeing with the eyes and not having the knowledge of seeing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the Asha’irah they affirm the seeing of Allah, but they reject the direction in which they will see Allah. They say we will see Allah but not in a specific direction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you say to them: Will you see Allah above, you? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him below you? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him on your right? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him on your left? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him in front of you? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him behind you? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So where will you see Him? They say: We will see him but not in any direction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is batil because whatever is seen must be facing opposite to what is seeing it. This is why the intelligent people laughed and mocked the position of Asha’irah: that we will see Allah but not in a specific direction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, with this approach they (the Asha’irah) wanted to be on the same position as the Mu’tazilah in rejecting Allah’s Uluww and direction while wanting to be on the same position of Ahlus Sunnah in affirming seeing Allah. However, they were unable to do this and resorted to arguments of sophistry, they saw these are valid arguments when they were not at all. This is the reason why the Asha’irah are hermaphrodites (transgendered) as Shaykh ul-Islam, <em>“The Mu’tazilah transgendered into philosophers and the Asha’irah transgendered into the Mu’tazilah.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning they are not with them or others in the issue of seeing of Allah and the same applies to many other issues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mu’tazilah and the Jahmiyyah reject the seeing of Allah and the Asha’irah affirm the seeing of Allah but negate the direction in which He will be seen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The correct and the true position is that of Ahlus Sunnah, that Allah will be seen on the Day of Resurrection while looking up and above. The hadith of Jabir RadhiAllahu Anhu in Sunan Ibn Majah which has some weakness to it. The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“While the people of Paradise are enjoying their blessings, a light will shine upon them, and they will raise their heads, and they will see their Rabb looking upon them from above. He will say: &#8220;Peace be upon you, Oh people of Paradise.&#8221; This is what Allah says in the ayah: &#8220;Salam (peace be upon you) &#8211; a Word from the Rabb (Allah), The Most Merciful.&#8221; He will look at them, and they will look at Him, and they will not pay any attention to the delights (of Paradise) so long as they look at Him, until He will screen Himself from them.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Synopsis of the Khawārij</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">In the modern world today, various groups, organisations and movements have emerged that have misrepresented and manipulated the image of Islam, this is not to say the media hasn’t played its unscrupulous role. There has been considerable destruction, loss of innocent life and the lives of millions have changed due to the events of the last two to three decades. The devastation faced by the Muslims has been distressing and disturbing. A great part of the blame rests with modern day groups and sects, which have and are still evolving with new and dangerous narratives. In the following series of articles, we will look at the origins and emergence of the Khawārij sect and the many strands they take in current times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Who Are the Khawārij?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Khawārij are those who primarily rebelled against the Sunnah and the Jamāʿah (i.e. Ahl al-Sunnah waʾl Jamāʿah or the Muslim Community) and they left or abandoned the greater body of the Muslims. Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Kathīr (d.774H) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">They are called Khawārij because they stopped obeying the ruler (the Imām) and therefore they became independent of the Sharīʿah of Islam.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">al-Shahrastānī (d.548H) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Imām or ruler – upon whom the whole Ummah is agreed upon and is united behind, so whosoever does Khurūj i.e. rebels against them, will be called a Khārijī. This is whether the Khurūj is during the time of the Ṣaḥābah, during the time of the rightly guided Khulafāʾ or even after their time from amongst the Tābiʿīn or whether it is in the era of any Muslim ruler.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajar (d.852H) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">Khawārij is the plural of Khārijah, these people are innovators and they were called Khawārij because they left the Dīn of Islam, they rebelled and made Khurūj against the best people of the Muslim Ummah.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Imām Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr (d.463H) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Khawārij are the people who distort the Book of Allāḥ and made thr blood of the Muslims lawful and they want to declare Muslims to be un believers due to their sins. They raise the sword against them and they opposed the Jamāʿah. The declared the prayer to be obligatory upon the menstruating woman, they also believed there was no rajam (stoning) of the adulterer and they were of the view to lash them 100 times. They also held the view that ritual purity could only be achieved by using flowing water or water that was in very large quantities. They had many other issues in which they opposed the Jamāʿah of the Muslims i.e. Ahl al-Sunnah. Similarly, they innovated many new things in the Dīn and they left the Dīn just as an arrow leaves its prey.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">Here we find the Khawārij have been described with a few characteristics, that have been repeated by many Scholars. For example, they went to extremes and eventually left the religion. The example of attaining ritual purity was a prime example. The Khawārij also had other hallmarks and it is these signs and characteristics that are rampant and evident on a whole array of people in our midst who claim to be upon the path of Ahl al-Sunnah. Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) describes them further with another sign, he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">One of the first innovations spread in Islam was the Bidʿah of the Khawārij.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">So, the Khawārij were the first sect of Islam who rebelled and made Khurūj against the body of the Muslims i.e. Ahl al-Sunnah, while raising the sword due to their false beliefs, defective methodology and tyrannical oppression of the Muslims. Imām Ibn Taymiyyah further said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003300;">The very first people of innovation who separated from the Jamāʿah of the Muslims were the Khawārij.<a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003300;">The Khawārij have historically always troubled and harmed the Muslims in every era and century. This is why, from Divine texts we find they were condemned and we were commanded to fight them. Aḥadīth transmitted in this regard are so numerous that they reach an overwhelming level. An example of this is the ḥadīth:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Abū Ghālib reported: Abū Umāmah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, The Khawārij are the worst of those slain under the heavens, and the best of those slain are those who were killed by them. They are the dogs of Hellfire. They were Muslims and then became unbelievers.’ I said, ‘O Abū Umāmah, is this something you say?” Abū Umamah said, ‘No, rather I heard it from the Messenger of Allāh Sallalalhu Alayhi Wasallam</span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>.’</strong><a style="color: #003300;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled and Annotated by </span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Dr. Muhammad Aslam Mubarakpuri</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated by</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Question:</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Shawq Nimawi quoted in Athar al-Sunan [1] that Allamah Ibn Taymiyyah graded the hadith of Qulatayn as weak [2], whereas in the Fatawa of Ibn Taymiyyah he graded it authentic [3], therefore is the grading of weak that is attributed to Allamah Ibn Taymiyyah correct or not? Also, has only one part of Abkar al-Minnan Fi Tanqid Athar al-Sunnan been published?</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Answer:</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As far as I know the first person to quote that Imam Ibn Taymiyyah Rahimahullah weakened the hadith of the Qulatayn was Ibn Nujaym, (al-Hanafi), the author of al-Bahr al-Ra&#8217;iq, refer to al-Bahr al-Ra&#8217;iq (1:86) and the late Shaykh Abd al-Hayy Lucknowi quoted it from him in al-Sa&#8217;ayah (1:373). It is possible that Nimawi wrote this whilst relying on these two quotes, however neither does al-Bahr al-Ra&#8217;iq nor al-Sa&#8217;ayah reference this to any of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this regard al-Bahr al-Ra&#8217;iq quotes a lengthy passage from Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah [4] and it is therefore it highly unlikely that he fabricated this, however having said this, we haven&#8217;t been able to find this statement in any of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s books to date.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reference of the [Majmu&#8217;a] al-Fatawa which you quoted is correct [5] however, the views of the scholars often change while researching such issues. It is difficult to ascertain what his early view was and what is latter view was.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Only one part of Abkar al-Minnan has been printed, most of the contentions issues were in this part and therefore there was not really any need to answer second part.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nazir Ahmad Rehmani Amlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">23rd October 1959</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[1] Athar al-Sunan, 1:3.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[2] The hadih of the Qulatayn is:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span class="arabic_sanad arabic">عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ عُمَرَ، قَالَ سُئِلَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم عَنِ الْمَاءِ وَمَا يَنُوبُهُ مِنَ الدَّوَابِّ وَالسِّبَاعِ ‏.‏ فَقَالَ ‏</span><span class="arabic_text_details arabic">إِذَا كَانَ الْمَاءُ قُلَّتَيْنِ لَمْ يَحْمِلِ الْخَبَثَ ‏</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of &#8216;Abd Allah bin &#8216;Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma: &#8220;The Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was asked about water and how some animals and carnivorous beasts might drink from it. He said: If the water is more than two Qullahs, it will not be affected by the impurity (ies) (filth).&#8221; Imam Ahmad, Musnad, 2:27; Abu Dawud, in the book of Taharah, chapter: what makes water impure, no.63, Tirmidhi, no.329, Nasa&#8217;i no.52, In Majah, no.517-518 and others in their respective books of Sunan. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[3] Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, Majmu&#8217;a al-Fatawa, 21:41.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[4] al-Bahr al-Ra&#8217;iq, 1:86.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[5] The passage in the Majmu&#8217;a Fatawa of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah is: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the hadith of the Qulatayn then most of the people of knowledge of hadith graded the hadith Hasan Sahih and used it as evidence.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah wrote in Mukhtasar Fatawa Misriyyah, 12.:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the hadith of the Qulatayn, most (of the people of knowledge) graded is Hasan and used it as evidence and they answered the disparaging statements concerning it. Abu Abd Allah Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahid al-Maqdisi wrote a Juzz answering and refuting (the position) of Ibn Abd al-Barr.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In summary: The hadith of Qulatayn is Hasan Sahih and the likes of Imams Tahawi, Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Hibban, Daraqutni, Hakim, Ibn Mandah, Bayhaqi, Ibn Hazm, Khattabi, Dhahabi, Nawawi, Hafiz Ibn Hajr Asqalani and Shaykh al-Albani all graded it Sahih-authentic. (al-Irwa&#8217;, 23). Abu Abd Allah Muhammad b. Abdul Wahid Maqdisi refuted Ibn Abd a-Barr&#8217;s weakening of it.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sufi Shaykhs, while attracting people to Sufism, they were and are responsible for preparing new members for Sufi mystic training, taking them through various stages i.e. Maqamat and States i.e. Ahwal. They perform regimental type exercises and activities until they become proficient and thus move on to the next stage. For example, whirling and dancing like the whirling dervishes, the Naqshbandis, who say Haqq Allah repeatedly, others say Allah Hu while attempting to reconcile the chanting to coincide with their heartbeat, others use Qawwali Music, some use musical instruments like bells and flutes etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The new recruits would believe while being brainwashed into thinking that these Sufi Shaykhs could work miracles known as Karamat.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The state they would reach while having passed this stage is called fana&#8217;, which is known as individual self passing away in Allah commonly known as annihilation with Allah. (astagfirullah). The next stage is baqa&#8217;,<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> which is known as self abiding in Allah, in other words permanent stay in Allah (La Huwla Wa La Quwwata Illah Billah). This state of baqa&#8217; is the final stepping stone towards ACTUAL union with Allah i.e. the person becoming one with Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This also led them to develop other elements of belief, for example Wahdat al-Wujud and Hulul. Wahdah al-Wujud is when the created i.e. khalq becomes al-Haqq and thus the essence of existence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the individual self became united with Allah, they would experience the ecstatic contemplation of divine beauty.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> This ecstasy also known as Dhawq was the final end stage of a mystic, which every Sufi yearns to attain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Other writers have mentioned that the Sufi had an innate desire to attain and experience ecstasy i.e. Dhawq which always resulted in the union with Allah i.e. fana’, also known as annihilation with Allah.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They had developed Sufi rituals that they used to reach Ilm al-Haqiqah i.e. esoteric knowledge. Rituals for instance, Sufi dancing known as Raqs, listening to music and Sufi type odes and poems known as Sama’ as well as chanting. They would try to achieve Dhawq i.e. ecstasy through incessant recitation and remembrance of Allah ie Dhikr while dancing.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This eventually led the Sufis to assert and claim exemption and relief of religious Islamic duties when they reached the end stage of Ecstasy &#8211; Dhawq and or sometimes defined as Hāl, a mystical state, where they would be United with The Divine essence.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They also gave this exemption of obligatory  religious duties the name of Ibaha, and interestingly this was due to the influence and while drawing from Hindu Vedantic teachings.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was this so called exemption, the various states and the concepts of Sufism which Imam Ibn Taymiyyah heavily criticised.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">YET, they have the audacity to claim Imam Ibn Taymiyyah was a Sufi! The sheer disregard for any Islamic research has led these claimants to concoct such fallacious lies. The strongest argument against these claimants and their slanderous accusations, is that not a single Sufi from the era of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah ever claimed Sufism for him, the same way they practise it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some writers have misconstrued the explanatory words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and given the false impression that he promoted and held some of the beliefs highlighted above. He, as usual explained and delineated his views and understanding of Sufism and offered an explanatory discourse. His method of explanation was often to use terminology that was used by detractors or the masses, in order for them to understand his viewpoint. Some writers have latched onto al-Ba’labakki (d.734H), the Hanbalite student of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah as a means to portray him as a Sufi, for the former was trained in the Sufi way. Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but this is not what Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah was about.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The definition of ecstasy generally means (emotion), a trance or trance-like state in which a person transcends normal consciousness Religious ecstasy, a state of consciousness, visions or absolute euphoria, Ecstasy (philosophy), to be or stand outside oneself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also please note, that I have quoted individuals who the Sufis themselves look up to, they are those whom the western academic world readily accepts and takes from!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>READ <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/clearing-the-allegations-and-attack-on-allamah-rabbani-shaikh-muhammad-nasir-al-din-al-albani-1420h-part-1-the-hanafi-fiqh-channel/">Part 1</a>, <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/clearing-the-allegations-and-attack-on-allamah-rabbani-shaikh-muhammad-nasir-al-din-al-albani-1420h-part-2-the-hanafi-fiqh-channel-hanafi-asharis-on-the-hadith-in-sahih-mus/">Part 2</a></span></strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Hanafi Fiqh Channel have produced two videos showing that Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani weakened ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari. As I mentioned in the previous part, we will address the issues a little later In Shāʿ Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Following on from the previous part where I showed the position and outlook of Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah and his understanding of Sahih Muslim-the authenticity of the hadith contained therein, it showed his blind fanaticism for the hanafi madhab and his true position of the hadith in Sahih Muslim. This was an answer to the second video produced by the Hanafi Fiqh channel wherein the speaker talks about Sahih Muslim. (please refer to part 2)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both speakers in their respective parts digress to mention some comical points throughout their videos. They contained cheap shots and immature presentation of points. For example, they said we know the Salafi group attacks the four Imams, we did not know they would attack Sahih al-Bukhari and other such illiterate type of points. We assure you, do not worry, since you have opened this closet your hanafi skeletons will most certainly come to haunt you. More on this In Shāʿ Allāh in the forthcoming parts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will however overlook these points and not stoop to their level, whereas our intent is to bring clarity to these matters and the mindset, these young brothers wish to portray of Shaikh Allamah Rabbani Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here is another example how juvenile and childish these people are. When they mention Shaikh al-Albani’s name they say Nasir ud Din, when we all know the Shaikhs full name is Muhammad Nasir ud Din. This is the level of these people, such is their hatred and animosity that they can not even bring themselves to say the name Muhammad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Anyway, Shaikh al-Albani talks about the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and he looked at how some of the hadith which did not fulfill the criteria. He talks about Imams before him, like Imam Daraqutni, Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Hafiz Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, Hafiz Ibn Hajr and Hafiz al-Mundhiri, who also spoke about some of the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and their wording.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani gives three examples to highlight what he refers to when he did a generic gloss of the Sahihayn, and it is not as the detractors make out, that he scrutinized and analysed the whole of Sahih al-Bukhari. Shaikh al-Albani clearly says his contention is with just about 10 ahadith and that Imam Daraqutni questions 12 or so hadith from the Sahih of Imam Bukhari.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani clearly said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Therefore, it is not wisdom or knowledge for me to focus on critiquing the Sahihayn and abandon the hadith in the 4 sunans.” (watch video)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If a person questions my judgements of some of the hadiths, then they can look at Fath al-Bari and they will find many many things that are criticized by Hafiz Ahmad bin Hajr al-Asqalani.” (watch video)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“This Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani clarified in his Sharh (Fath al-Bar) many mistakes in the ahadith of Bukhari…” (watch video)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the three examples Shaikh al-Albani talks about is the hadith of Ibn Abbas radiAllahu Anhuma concerning the marriage of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to Maymunah radhiallahu anha while he was in ihram, he said the hadith is authentic in terms of its chains but the interpretation is of Ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhuma. Other ahadith that are critiqued are based on the narrators in the chain, this is the second type. With the third type being additional words added to the hadith to indicate a meaning that were not actually transmitted, like the hadith of the limbs radiating light due to being frequently washed in Wudu.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These are just some of the points that relate to this intricate science, and it is most certainly not for every individual to delve into it. This is more applicable and pertinent to those who proudly claim and openly attest they are hanafi muqallids ie in other words, they are strikingly ignorant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This being said, other modern day writers in academia have also alluded to Shaikh al-Albani weakening hadith in Bukhari, at least three different writers. Yet the same writers have strangely overlooked and ignored the criticism and views of Hafiz Ibn Hajr in his al-Fath and Imam Daraqutni’s queries. One of the aforementioned writers, in all fairness did look at Daraqutni’s queries and presented his arguments. Interestingly a fourth writer asserts Sahih al-Bukhari is the backbone of Salafi Islam, as the writer suggests. This is not far from the truth as Shaikh al-Albani was one of the most famous proponents of Salafiyyah, since when have the modern day Hanafi Ash’arites shown any care or love for Sahih al-Bukhari, except they worked on it to defend their Madhhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such writers and others like Hamza Malyabari and of his ilk suggest Shaikh al-Albani’s critical analysis of hadith was not in line with the methods of the earlier scholars. This is another farcical allegation which has been rebutted by many writers. The following book, being just one example dismantles and dismisses this embarrassing claim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-8087 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=386%2C685" alt="DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=169%2C300 169w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=768%2C1365 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=576%2C1024 576w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?w=1152 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zakariyyah bin Ghulam Qadir Pakistani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">(pp.280, Riyadh: Maktabah al-Ma&#8217;arif Lil-Nashr wal-Tawzi&#8217;a, 1431H/2010ce) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being, such matter are based of Ijtihad in relation to understanding the intricacies of this magnificent science, and only those who are free from the shackles of extreme blind partisanship and destructive fanaticism can look at such matters objectively. This excludes the extreme muqallids who vehemently acknowledge they are ignorant and are obligated to perform taqlid, yet they are the ones making youtube videos, reading the ahadith from Bukhari to show the inconsistencies and approach of the Salafi’s but they themselves reject the hadith in Bukhari when it is time to accept and act on them. This is most reprehensible!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Low and behold, here is the clarification from Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani when he was asked if he graded hadith in Bukhari weak and if the Scholars before him preceded him in it. Please watch it and be sincere without bigotry or sectarian partisanship.</span></p>
