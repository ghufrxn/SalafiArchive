				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This fatwa of the great Ahl al-Hadith Shaykh, Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan shows the methodology of the Ahl a-Hadith. He clarifies mixing and sitting with people who hold such belief and ideas, let alone cooperating with them. And if Shaykh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan is not from the Akabarin, then I don&#8217;t know who is! Let me warn you dear readers, this Fatwa is not for the faint hearted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Sayyid Nawab Muhamamd Siddiq Hasan Khan Rahimahullah (d.1370/1890) was asked:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) Will the scholars of the Din and the Shari’ah clarify: the muqallidin group who perform taqlid of only one Imam, are they considered to be from Ahl al-Sunnah or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) And is the prayer behind them valid or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Is it permissible or impermissible to let them enter our Masjid and to have sittings and mixing with them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muqallidin of this type in India who have the obvious trait of having enmity and hatred against the people who act on Hadith, hurling slanderous lies and false accusations against them, being irritated with them for saying Amin loudly, raising their hands, placing the hands on the chest and reciting al-Fatihah behind the Imam, which are all established and proven from the authentic ahadith, that are not abrogated and are from raised reports that are not figuratively explained. Likewise, those who commit innovations like Milad, Urs (annual commemorative celebrations for saints) and going into seclusion for 40 days (like Sufis do for meditation and maraqabah) as well numerous other innovations, then they are out of the fold of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah and are like the other deviated sects like the Jahmiyyah, Murjiyyah and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is because they oppose Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l Jama’ah in hundreds of issues, in both Aqidah and actions. In fact, at times some of their beliefs and actions seem to be exactly like that of the Jahmiyyah and the Murji’ah, which will not be hidden from the reader of this treatise. What is to follow, are a few example of the issues, with regards to their Aqidah and actions (a few examples from a whole catalogue) in order to support my claim concerning them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Aqa’id</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They believe Iman does not increase or decrease, in fact they believe the Iman of an open wicked sinner, the Iman of the Prophets and the Angels is on the same level and equal, which is the Madhhab of the Murji’ah, which is a sect from among the misguided deviated sects as Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal as written in his treatise on Aqidah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>SECONDLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They believe that in all issues of the Din it is obligatory and compulsory to do taqlid of only one Imam, even if it opposes and contradicts the Quran and Hadith, whereas the Hanafi scholars have declared this type of taqlid to be shirk and have discoursed this under the ayah, <strong>“They took their rabbis and monks as lords beside Allah.”</strong> (Surah al-Tawbah, 9:31).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THIRDLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we find from Tafsir Mazhari of Qadhi Thanullah Panipati that the doors of ijtihad were closed with the four Imams and no one can be a mujtahid now, as Fatawa Durr al-Mukhtar mentions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>FORTHLY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Isa Alayhis Salam descends, he will do taqlid of Imam A’zam (i.e. Abu Hanifah and this point is mentioned in Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:34.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We see refuge in Allah from these corrupt beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ACTIONS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(They say and hold the view)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1) It is permissible for the Muslims to take interest from the non-Muslims in Dar al-Harb (a land that Muslims are at war with) (Sharh Waqayah, 3:130 Urdu) as it is also mentioned in the Farsi translation of Hidayah, published in Nawal Kishore, 3:96. (Durr al-Mukhtar, 3:149-Urdu, 1:43-Arabic).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2) If someone has a nose bleed and the bleeding does not stop, then it is permissible for him to write the Quran on his forehead with either urine or blood. This is their respect for the Qur’an (Alamghiri, Delhi Print, 5:134, Arabic 1:154, Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:120-Urdu, Alamghiri, 3:404)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3) Masturbation does not break the fast as Fatawa Qadhi Khan states as mentioned in volume 1. (Qadhi Khan, 4:361)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4) If a person is very aroused and fears fornication, then masturbating is obligatory as Radd al-Mukhtar the notes to Durr al-Mukhtar, Mujtabia Delhi print, p.165.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5) If a man wraps his private part (male organ) in a cloth and has sexual intercourse with a woman while fasting and if the cloth is strong, he doesn’t have to repeat the fast nor have a bath for ritual impurity, as is mentioned in Barahana printed Matb’a Husami Lahore, 2:18.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6) If a man conducts a wedding ceremony, marrying a man from the west to a woman from the east (meaning there is a difference of one year of journey time by walking) and then the women gives birth in 6 months, the man from the west will be considered to be the father and this will be considered his karamah (i.e. Miracle) even though the man and woman have not met. As mentioned in Fath al-Qadir in the notes to Hidayah, Nawal Kishore, 2:338. (Tablighi Behshiti Zewar, p.240 Lahore)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7) Any animal bred while eating pig meat, is Halal as Ghayatul Awthar urdu translation of Durr al-Mukhtar, Nawal Kishore print, 4:196, mentions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8) The revenue generated from fornication (i.e. prostitution) is lawful as Chalpi notes to Sharh Waqayah, Nawal Kishore Print mentions, p.298 in the footnotes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9) Tanning pig skin purifies it and selling it is also permissible, as Muniyyah al-Musalli, Lahore print, p.32 states (Arabic edn. P.49, Mujtabai print).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10) the permissibility of doing tricks with Zakat. Meaning that if a person gives his wealth to either his wife or gifts it someone else, before the year is complete with the intentions that he doesn’t need to pay zakat, and then the wealth is returned to him after the year is complete, then this is permissible. Imam Abu Yusuf used to do this (Ihya al-Ulum, Arabic Nawal Kishore, 1:11, Durr al-Mukhtar, 1:505, Alamghiri, 10:334-335)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">11) If a man enters (i.e. sexually) a four legged (i.e. Animal) or a dead person and he does not ejaculate, it does not break his fast nor does he have to make ghusl, as Fatawa Qadhi Khan states, Nawal Kishore print, 1:105.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">12) Legal punishments ordered by the Qadhi are implemented inwardly and outwardly. For example, if a person claims that another mans wife is his wife and he gives a false testimony and then wins the trial, the woman will be his. Therefore, she will be lawful for him according to Allah’s law and the people and it is permissible for him to sleep with her and he will not be imprisoned according to Allah’s law. (Hidayah Matba Mustafai, 2:125, Sharh Waqayah, 3:59),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">13) If a person deliberately passes wind after reciting the Tashahhud, his prayer will be complete. (Sharh Waqayah Arabic Matb’a Nawal Kishore, 1:43, urdu 1:401).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">14) If someone borrows someone’s female slave and then commits fornication with her, there is no legal punishment on him despite knowing the female servant is unlawful for him i.e. an illicit sexual relationship. Hidayah Farisi translation, Nawal Kishore, 2:302-303.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 2</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The prayer behind such muqallidin will not be permissible, because we find from what has preceded that the beliefs and actions of these people oppose the way of Ahl al-Sunnah, in fact some beliefs and actions necessitate shirk and some corrupt the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point 3</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Letting such muqallidin into your Masajid is impressible according to the shari’ah according to the ayah <strong>“</strong><strong>Expel them from wherever they have expelled you.”</strong> (Surah al-Baqarah, 2:191) and according to the command in the ayah, <strong>“Then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people.”</strong> (Surah al-An’am, 6:68). Therefore, mixing with them, sitting with them, marrying them, being with them in times of sadness and other interactions and connections are all unlawful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be clearly noted the commissioner of Delhi reconciled both parties and also issued a written tract which both parties agreed too, curbing the animosity and to pray behind each other as long as the prayer in not invalidated in order to preserve peace and prevent chaos. However, the muqallidin rejected this reconciliation again and concocted some baseless points. So, they returned to their original ways and began issuing posters and treatise against the people of Tawhid without caring for the reconciliation agreement.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>[3]</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Imam Muhammad Fakhir Za’ir Ilabadi</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>1120H-1164H</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(1708c-1751c)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari </strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His full name is Muhammad Fakhir and known as Za’ir, the son of Shaikh Muhammad Yahya. His title is as ash-Shaikh al-Alim al-Kabir al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir bin Muhammad Yahya bin Muhammad Amin al-Abbasi Ilabadi. (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence is Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir bin Shaikh Muhammad Yahya Ilabadi. (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.334)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had two brothers, one was Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Ilabadi who was a reputable scholar of the Din. His maternal grandfather was Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi, whose lineage could be traced back to Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhu).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find that Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was from a family of learning who valued and gave Islamic education great importance. The family were known amongst the people for their knowledge and attachment to the sacred Islamic sciences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From an early age Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir started learning from his father, grandfather and older brother and benefited greatly from them. It led him to acquire knowledge quickly and thereby becoming highly proficient and competent in the sacred Islamic sciences. (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>A Brief Overview of his Family</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(1) His father; Shaikh Muhammad Yahya Ilabadi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a major scholar of his day and the author of <em>Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram</em> praised him by saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was an ocean of knowledge in the sciences, once that sent waves of this knowledge resounding with the people and he authored a number of books and treatises.” (</em>Ma&#8217;athir Al-Kiram (2:218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had three sons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(i) Shaikh Muhammad Tahir</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(ii) Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(iii) Shaikh Shah Muhammad Hasir Afsali</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All three sons and father were keen poets and enjoyed poetry.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(2) His grandfather; Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No detailed information could be obtained regarding his biography.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(3) His brother; Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Ilabadi (b.1110H &#8211; d.1143H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the older brother of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir, he was a person of knowledge and virtue, Shaikh Muhammad Ra&#8217;is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was upon the Salafi Madhab and an Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith just like his brother as we find from his writings.&#8221;</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.193)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hasani said he was well aware and acquainted with the Madhabs of the Salaf and Khalaf and that his brothers sought knowledge from him. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:332-333 no.615)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Seeking the Knowledge of Hadith from Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi [1163H]</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir studied with Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi in the year 1149H when he travelled to the 2 sanctuaries and visited Madinah. At the time Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami was also studying with Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi and hence both were of similar stature in terms of their sittings. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339-340), Taqsar Junud al-Ahrar Min Tazkar Junud al-Abrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Fakhir studied and read <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em> on Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi to the extent that he gained great credibility and heights which conjured up immense love for Hadith in his heart, such was the case that he became rigid and firm on the Quran and Hadith his whole life. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.141)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi also gave him Ijazah for the two Sahihs as well as other books. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349), Sarwar Azad (p.213), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.141)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Under the Tutelage of Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir studied with Shaikh Azad Bilgirami, as another beneficial point it is sufficient to note that Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlavi also studied under Shaikh Azad Bilgirami, meaning that Shaikh Azad Bilgirami was a teacher of both of them however their period of study was different. (Sarwar Azad (p.213+), Itihaf an-Nabula (p.406-407), Ma&#8217;arif (22:339)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Stay in The Two Blessed Sanctuaries</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir had special love for the 2 blessed lands and hence for the purpose and intent of seeking and consolidating his knowledge he remained there for a few years. During this period, he performed 2 Hajjs. After returning to India, he intended to perform his third Hajj in the year 1154H and whilst he set out, some goons captured him near Surat and stole all of his belongings except his books and eventually gave him a ride to the city of Surat. (Sarwar Azad (p.214), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He attempted to perform Hajj again in the year 1156H and whilst travelling by ship, the journey was short lived due to ship wreck. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir ended up residing in Bandar Faha for a few days and then eventually reached his destination of Hijaz safely in the same year and then finally returned back to India in 1159H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In one of his journeys to Hajj he returned with an edition of <em>Sahih Muslim</em>, which was copied by Mawlana Ruh al-Amin Khan, which is preserved in Habin Ganj library. (Ma&#8217;arif (23:91-92), Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349), Sarwar Azad (p.214), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335, 340).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After seeking the traditional knowledge and sciences he began to teach his students with great vigour and fervour. He was known to have reached the status of being a Muhaddith at a very young age and thus a large number of people benefited from his knowledge and understanding.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This can easily be deduced and understood from the fact that when Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan sent Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati to study with Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlavi, he later sent him to Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir to seek knowledge of Hadith and its sciences. This clearly shows Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was a great scholar of Hadith of his era and was highly proficient as a Hadith master.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From his students were his two sons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Shaikh Qutb ud-Din (1187H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(2) Shaikh Muhammad Ajmal (1236H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and also</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Shaikh Qadhi Thanullah Pani Pati (1225H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Shaikh Murtaza Bilgirami (al-Zabidi) (1205H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Shaikh Ghulam Haidar Khan Kakawri (1252H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(6) Shaikh Ghulam Safdar Khan (1283H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(7) Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi (1234H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(8) Shaikh Muhammad Nasih</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(see Mashahir Kakawri (p.300), Tazkirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140), Siratul Bukhari (p.37-38).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Shaikh Qutb Al-Din bin Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir (b.1138H &#8211; 1187H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the Shaikhs eldest son, and was often responsible for teaching the people as well delivering regular lessons, he essentially took over his father’s role in teaching, more so when his father would travel to perform Hajj. He has been mentioned with great virtue with regards to his command of the various sciences and disciplines, especially the knowledge of <em>Fiqh</em> and its principles ie <em>Fiqh</em> and <em>Usul al-Fiqh</em> and other areas of learning. He died while he travelled to Makkah to perform Hajj and was thus buried there. He also authored some books. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:235-236 no.437).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra&#8217;is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was upon the way of his father and uncle, on the Madhab of Ahl al-Hadith.&#8221;</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.192)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The affect of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir on his students was so profound that it was manifest in their writings. This was more so in adhering and abiding by the ahadith and rejecting any form of blameworthy and rigid staunch Taqlid which is prevalent with the muqallidin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An example of this is what Shaikh Qadhi Thanullah Pani Pati said in his will, in that Surah Fatihah is to be recited after the first takbir and opening supplication even though he is famously attributed to the hanafi madhab. (<em>Wasiyat Nama</em> printed with <em>Majmu&#8217;a Wasaya</em> Number 4 (p.146).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi (1234H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi authored a book on raising the hands in the prayer titled, <em>&#8216;Nur Al-Aynayn Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain.&#8217;</em> This maybe an addendum to his Shaikh work or his own personal work and Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is said about him that he was exemplary and unmatched in speaking the truth and being vocal in this and he spent a large part of his life strictly following the Quran and Hadith and adhering to the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says in one place in his book, <em>&#8216;Nur Al-Aynayn Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain&#8217;,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When I have obeyed and followed the Messenger of Allah </em><em>ﷺ</em> <em>I am totally unconcerned with the statements of Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Sufyan ath-Thawri and Imam at-Zuhri.&#8221;</em> (Tarajim Ulama Hadith (p.383), Tazkirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (pg.142), Siratul Bukhari (p.37-38)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Will</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was firm and strong in adhering to the Quran and Sunnah and thus vehemently abhorred grave worship and so he willed that he was to be buried next to Shaikh Abdul Latif in Burhanpur. This was due to the fact it was only his grave that was not venerated and worshipped. Hence, according to his wish he was buried next to Shaikh Abdul Latif.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Status and Position</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was a mujtahid, a Salafi and not a muqallid. We find by looking at his books that he was undoubtedly an Ahl al-Hadith and refrained from doing Taqlid of anyone. He was a mujtahid in his own right and this supported by the statement of Shaikh Abdul Hay al-Hasani which is to proceed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah blessed Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir with a great station and status.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He studied with numerous teachers and began teaching at the tender age of 20. He achieved the title of Shaikh. He then went to Haramayn Sharifayn in 1149H to perform Hajj and Umrah. He visited The Prophets Masjid and eventually sought knowledge of hadith and other disciplines from the Shaikh of the Shaikhs, Muhammad Hayat Sindhi and eventually returned back to his native land. He would visit Haramayn Sharifayn numerous times.”</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh (p.195)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Author of Risalah Najatiyyah of Shaikh al-Fazil Al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir with the title of Za&#8217;ir Ilabadi.&#8221;</em> (Ittihaf an-Nabula (p.84) Also refer to Intiqad at-Rajih (p.84), Taqsar Junud al-Ahrar Min Tazkar Junud al-Abrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At another instance Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He detested venerating the holy men ie the pirs and he would write in refutation of them. He would encourage adhering to the Quran and Sunnah. It is sufficient testimony for Shaikh Muhammad Fakhirs trustworthiness and uprightness that Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan and Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami bore witness to his great virtue, immense noble character and extensive knowledge.&#8221;</em> (Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said at another place,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was the Imam of the Imams of the followers of the Sunnah in India and he was from amongst the Shaikh of the Shuyukhs from the major and well known scholars.&#8221;</em> (Taqsar al-Junud al-Ahrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ismail Salafi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is apparent from the authors poems that he was a fearless caller to Tawhid and the Sunnah, and at the same instance he would rebuke the customary staunch bigoted Taqlid. This would inevitably lead to some harshness but nonetheless he was very intelligent and the scholars would respect him highly.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Azad Bilgrami said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan said, &#8220;I have seen many notable people but after 11 hundred years I saw the likes of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir and I found him to conform and agree with the Quran and Sunnah.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram Fi Tazkirrah Ulama Bilgiram (2:218), (Sarwar Azad (p.218), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.337)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He (ie Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan) would would visit me with respect but with Shaikh Fakhir he was even more respectful and humble.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan would go to visit Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir Ilabadi himself which was not the norm for him.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati praised Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir with the following words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ash-Shaikh al-Ustadh Muhammad Fakhir al-Muhaddith Rahimahullah said that it was unlawful to make a masjid next to a grave whilst deducing from the Hadith of Abi Lahaij in Sahih Muslim.&#8221;</em> (Tafsir Mazhari (6:23)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati undoubtedly, was a non staunch open minded Hanafi Scholar searching for the truth such that the current day Hanafis would not bat an eyelid except to shun and ostracise him and label him as a pseudo Hanafi as the word pseudo is often used and accustomed on the tongues of the bewildered retractors. So despite this Shaikh Thanullah Pani Pati would would still have great respect for him despite him being an Ahl al-Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whereas in our times it is the total opposite and the present day Hanafis have left the teachings and mindset of their forefathers and abuse the Ahl al-Hadith. (Refer to Nur us-Sunnah (p.5-6)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Abdul Hayy al-Hasani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ash-Shaikh Al-Alim Al-Kabir Al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir bin Muhammad Yahya bin Muhammad Amin Al-Abbasi al-Salafi Ilabadi, one the well known and famous scholars.&#8221;</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349 no.641)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;All the people were agreed in praise of him and his noble characteristics, he was someone who was referred to in such affairs. He did not restrict himself to only one specific madhab nor did he do taqlid of anyone in the affairs of the Din rather he followed the texts of the Quran and Sunnah and did Ijtihad which he was well qualified and capable to do.&#8221;</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:350)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Atthar Mubarakpuri said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was a major Muhaddith of his era.”</em> (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is Nadwi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“…We can see just from the titles of his books that it is apparent he was Ahl al-Hadith and upon the Salafi Madhab, he would openly say he was an Ahl al-Hadith and would spread the Manhaj of Ahl al-Hadith…..In summary, this Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith of the twelfth century, who was accepted and praised by whose who were not from the Ahl al-Hadith. The Imam was an outspoken, formidable and fervent propagator of the Madhab of Ahl al-Hadith, coupled with the fact that he was accepted by both the Ahl al-Hadith non Ahl al-Hadith, thus it is not impossible a large group of the muqallidin did not adopt and change to the Madhab of the Ahl al-Hadith due to the arduous efforts of this Imam of Ahl al-Hadith.”</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.196)     </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Allamah Azad Bilgrami&#8217;s (1294H) Praise for Imam Muhammad Fakhir.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Azad Bilgrami wrote a poem in Farsi on the death of Imam Muhammad Fakhir&#8217;s in respect of him and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was known as Za&#8217;ir (in the poets circles) and his name was Muhammad Fakhir, the son of Shaikh Muhammad and the grandson of Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi, and we empowered the three, he assumed the role of the Musnad of his elders. In doing so he was very noble, virtuous and reached a high rank as well as having lofty characteristics.&#8221;</em> (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>An Expert Master in the Sciences</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was an excelled master in the Islamic principles and far ahead in the sciences of texts and their comprehension from his counterparts, this was also applicable to some of the scholars prior to his era.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir excelled and was a specialist in Hadith and its various sciences as well has having the rank of a mujtahid in issues of <em>fiqh</em> ie jurisprudence.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Writings and Works</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir authored a number of treatises. The Hanafite biographer, Shaikh Abdul Hayy said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He authored a number of books in spreading the Sunnah.”</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:350)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">some of them are</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(1) Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqa&#8217;id Al-Hadithiyyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the scholars referred to this book as <em>Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqa&#8217;id Al-Athariyyah</em>. There is probable cause for this as Imam Muhammad Fakhir authored this book on the methodology Ahl al-Hadith and hence the Athari creed. It has only been printed twice and Walillahil Hamd we have published it for a third time.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Risalah Najatiyyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we have already mentioned some scholars referred to this book with two equally interchangeable names. This classical 12th century text on Salafi creed was authored by Imam Muhammad Fakhir when he had to reside in Chittagong in Bangladesh for between 3-4 months in the year 1161H ie 3 years before his death. The original book is preserved in Mawlana Abdul Ghani al-Baqi’s library in Dinajpur in Bengal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treatise as also mentioned before is based purely on the Salafi Creed and Manhaj and hence the Quran and Sunnah and it is from Imam Muhammad Fakhir last works. One can gauge the importance and significance of this book from the fact that Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan translated the book from Farsi into Urdu as Farsi was the original language it was written in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-8048 alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=306%2C343" alt="najatiyyah old" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=268%2C300 268w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=768%2C861 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=913%2C1024 913w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?w=1040 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan produced a summarised transation and included it in his book <em>&#8216;Al-Mu&#8217;taqad Al-Muntaqad&#8217;</em> which was printed in the year 1305H from Matba&#8217;a Al-Ansari in Delhi. Furthermore, he included the whole book in Farsi in the beginning of another book, <em>&#8216;an-Nahj Al-Qubul Min Shara&#8217;i ar-Rusul.’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the importance of the status of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir, if a great scholar of the likes of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan summarized his book and reproduced them in his books of Aqidah, it for sure shows his status and calibre.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was an accomplished poet in Arabic and Farisi. Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan summarised Shaikh Muhammad Fakhirs poems in his two books, <em>&#8216;Nafah at-Tayyib&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;ar-Rawdh al-Khasib&#8217;</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is authored in poem form in Farsi. Imam Muhammad Fakhir addressed the issue of Raf ul-Yadain in a scholarly manner and proved the raising of the hands in the prayer and refuted the weak evidences for not raising the hands.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is Nadwi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Most of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhirs books were in poetry form. He died and was buried in Burhanpur in Maharashtra. We can see just from the titles of his books that it is apparent he was Ahl al-Hadith and upon the Salafi Madhab, he would openly say he was an Ahl al-Hadith and would spread the Manhaj of Ahl al-Hadith.”</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.196)     </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>The Scholars of During Imam Muhammad Fakhirs Era</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir was calling to the the Quran and Sunnah without Taqlid and adhering to the Salafi Manhaj at a time when the people and the scholars of the era were engrossed in Taqlid or the madhahibs. It also shows the status of Imam Muhammad Fakhir as well as his call based on the notable and praiseworthy scholars that were around during his era, it includes the likes of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab (1114H-1206H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(2) Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlavi (1114H &#8211; 1176H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi (d.1163H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati (1145H &#8211; 1225H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Shaikh Abul Hasan Sindhi (d.1138H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(6) Shaikh Abdullah Salim al-Basri (d.1134H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(7) Shaikh Ibrahim al-Kurdi (d.1145H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(8) Shaikh Murtaza al-Zabidi Bilgrami (1145H &#8211; 1205H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(9) Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il bin Amir San’ani (d.1182H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(10) Shaikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Saffarini (d.1188H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also very plausible that he may have met Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab during his visits to Makkah and Madinah.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>When Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir Met Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is also a well known incident when Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir met Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi. The incident mentions that once when Imam Muhammad Fakhir visited Delhi, while praying he said Amin loudly in the prayer in the Jamia Masjid. This was a disturbing event in Delhi. The general people because angry and began to oppress Imam Muhammad Fakhir to the extent they were on the verge of beating him. Imam Fakhir explained to them that this was established from the Sunnah and if you were to go to any of your major scholars of Hadith they will affirm this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the end they took Imam Muhammad Fakhir to the gathering of Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi and mentioned the incident to him.  So Shaikh Shah Waliullah told the people that this was also established from the Sunnah and the people were silenced. Thereafter Imam Muhamamd Fakhir said to Shaikh Shah Waliullah what don&#8217;t you tell these people openly what the Sunnah is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To which Shaikh Shah Waliullah replied that if I was to tell these people openly about such issues how would I have saved you today. Meaning that the people were so engrossed and staunch in the Hanafi madhab and fixed in their ways that they failed to accept anything else. (Taqsar al-Junud al-Ahrar (p.115), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339), Mawj Kawthar (p.63) of Shaikh Muhammad Akram)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Death</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1164H Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir prepared for Hajj again but became very ill, he had just reached the town or Burhanpur when he breathed his last and returned to our creator on the 11th Dhul Hijjah 1164H. Shaikh Azad Bilgirami expressed his sorrow and sadness at the demise of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir. (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218), Sarwar Azad (p.218), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.336)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This formidable Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith, spent his very short life in spreading Tawhid and the Sunnah, reprimanding grave veneration, grave worship and blind taqlid. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir spent almost quarter of a decade in calling to adhering to the Quran and Sunnah in an era which was filled with ardent bigoted hanafi muqallids, who were ferociously vicious and violent. The legacy of this Imam of Ahl al-Hadith who was upon the Madhab of the Salaf still remains as radiant and bright as ever around the globe even after 250 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The existence of this impressive Scholar of Ahl al-Hadith, his efforts and struggles are a testimony and a tremendous rebuttal of the modern madhabists who claim the Ahl al-Hadith are a new sect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah have mercy upon Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir and forgive his sins, Amin   </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Everyone Should Say Amin Loudly</strong></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Allamah Muhammad Shams ul-Haq Azimabadi (1329H-1911)</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></p>
<p>In recent times a fatwa of his eminence, Allamah Imam Abdul Aziz Ibn Baz was rendered into English, highlighting the permissibility of saying Amin quietly in order to preserve muslim unity and to bring the people closer to the Sunnah etc etc. We do not want debate the fatwa of the great Allamah, however there must be more scope and discussion of the fatwa. For example the Shaikh refers to the caller ie the Da’ee and it is possible the Allamah may have been referring to such instances when a Da’ee is in such gathering etc.</p>
<p>The fatwa was rendered into English and but we find in the west that we have a number of Masaajid that clearly and comfortably allow us to say Amin loudly and raise our hands, therefore are we to abandon these practices in the smaller masajids. Allah knows best the motives of the translator, however translating such Fatawa without contemplating the greater benefit for the readers is something that should always be borne in mind especially by the newcomers. How are we supposed to teach the smaller masajid the Sunnah. Yes if there is greater harm and fitan then it is probably better to pray in a masjid that allows you to practice and propagate the Sunnah.</p>
<p>It is not the case that by applying such principles we will abandon the Sunnah and those we want to bring closer are adamant in their denial and rejection. Dear reader please note this is not a critique of the fatwa or questioning the legitimacy of it, in fact far from it and the contrary, that such a fatwa must come with some stipulations and no doubt this fatwa should be understood in conjunction with other Fatawa of Allamah Ibn Baz. It would have been better for the translator to have been fair to Allamah Abdul Aziz ibn Baz and have also translated other Fatawa so that the readers become versant and well acquainted with the love and firmness Allamah Ibn Baz had with the Sunnah. Much can be said, we leave you with a fatwa of The great Hadith master from the sub continent…..</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Is it authentically established from the non abrogated marfu hadith (ie from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) for the Imam, the congregation and the one who prays on his own to say Amin loudly in the loudly recited payers.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Saying Amin loudly has been established from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) as transmitted by Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said, “When the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) would finish his recitation of the Quran he would raise his voice and say Amin.” Transmitted by ad-Daraqutni who graded it Hasan and Hakim who graded it Sahih as cited in Bulugh al-Maram.</p>
<p>On the authority of Wa’il ibn Hujr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said, “I heard the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) recite Ghairil Magdhubi Alayhim Waladh-Dhaleen, he would say Amin by raising his voice.” Transmitted by at-Tirmidhi.</p>
<p>So both ahadith prove the validity for the Imam to say Amin loudly, however this ruling pertains to the person praying on his own and the Imam is always a single person (ie he is responsible for the congregation) which is established from the authentic marfu Hadith. Therefore when it is established and proven for the Imam (to say Amin loudly) then the same rule applies to the individual praying on his own.</p>
<p>As it relates to the members of the congregation ie those praying behind the imam, then we say it is also established from the marfu Hadith for them to say Amin loudly. This is narrated by Ibn Abbas (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) that the Messenger of Allah Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “The Jews do not envy you for anything more than they envy you for the Salam and (saying) amin, so say amin abundantly.” Transmitted by Ibn Majah.</p>
<p>It is thus evident that unless Amin is not said loudly and the sound does not reach the ears of the Jews they will not be jealous or envious.</p>
<p>And Imam Bukhari has transmitted in the <b>“Chapter: The Congregation To Say Amin Loudly”</b>  (in his Sahih) from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said that when the Imam says “Waladdaalleen” then you say Amin, for if your Amin coincides with the Amin of the angels, his previous sins will be forgiven.” Transmitted by Bukhari.</p>
<p>Thus the words “you say Amin” means to say Amin loudly and this is supported by the practice and action of Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) which Shaikh Badr ud deen Ayni has transmitted in his book Umdatul Qari Sharh Sahih Bukhari from Baihaqi that, “Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) used to announce the call to prayer for Marwan ibn al-Hakam, stipulating that the latter would not get to “Wa Ladalin” unless he knew that Abu Hurairah had entered the row. So when Marwan said “Wa Ladalin”, Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) would say Amin, prolonging it. He also said, “When the Amin of those on the earth coincides with the Amin of those in the heaven, they are forgiven.” Transmitted by Baihaqi as cited by al-Ayni.</p>
<p>And Imam Tirmidhi said after citing the Hadith of Wa’il Ibn Hujr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), “Abu Esa said the Hadith if Wa’il Ibn Hujr is a Hasan Hadith and a number of people of knowledge from amongst the companions of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam), the successors and those after them have said the same that a person should raise his voice and say Amin (ie loudly) and not quietly, this is also the saying of ash-Shafi, Ahmad and Ishaq.”</p>
<p><strong><em>(Fataawa Shaikh Shams ul-Haq Azimabadi, pg.153 rendered by Shaikh Muhammad Uzair 1989ce, also refer to Fataawa Naziriyyah 1/145-146)</em></strong></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Sa’id and Abu Salamah: Two Ahadith</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[18] And with the same chain of narration that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, “When the Imam says &#8216;Amin&#8217;, say &#8216;Amin&#8217;, for the one whose &#8216;Amin&#8217; coincides with the &#8216;Amin&#8217; of the angels &#8211; his previous wrong actions are forgiven.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000080">Ibn Shihab said, “The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) used to say &#8216;Amin&#8217; (extending it).”</span></strong></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> <span style="color: #000000">– [SAHIH]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing this hadith (from Sa&#8217;id Ibn Musayab and Abu Salamah Ibn Abdirahman) here (in this hadith by saying, “He reported to me…” <em>[Akhbaraahu]</em>)</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (1/87 hadith no.191, book 3, chapter 11, hadith (2/44), at-Tamhid (7/8) and al-Istidhkar (no.167)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.780) and Muslim (no.410) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) Imam Abul Abbas Siraj reported from Imam Zuhri with an authentic chain that, “When the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) prayed ‘Wa Ladhalin’ then he would say Amin loudly” (hadith as-Siraj, written by me (pg.35))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) The noble muhadithin have used this hadith to establish the issue of reciting Amin loudly. See Sahih Bukhari (no.780) and Sahih Ibn Khuzaimah ((1/286) hadith (no.570)) and Sunan Ibn Majah (no.852) and Sunan an-Nasa’i ((2/144) hadith (no.929))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) Wail Ibn Hujr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrated that he prayed behind the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) and he prayed Amin loudly. (Sunan Abu Dawud: (no.933), al-Khilafiyat of Bayhaqi, written by me (pg.1/51) and its chain is [Hasan] good)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Putting this type of narration into consideration Imam Muslim says: “All the narrations that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said Amin loudly are mutawatir” (book of tamyiz written by me (pg.9), published (pg.40))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The narration where Imam Shu’ba mentioned Amin (being said) quietly is weak according to the noble muhadithin because of it being [Shadh] strange. Even if this narration was authentic then this only meant that in the quiet prayer Amin should be said quietly. Remember that there is an ijma to say Amin quietly in the quiet prayers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) The companions and tabi&#8217;in (in the loud prayers) used to say Amin loudly. See Sahih Bukhari (before hadith (no.780)) and Mussanaf Ibn Abi Shaybah ((2/425) hadith (no.7963) and its chain is [Hasan] good)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">It is the action of the Jews being jealous of the salam and Amin. See Sunan Ibn Majah ((no.856) and its chain is authentic and Ibn Khuzaimah authenticated it: (no.1585), and Busiri in Zawa’id Ibn Majah, and Mundhiri in Targhib Wa Tarhib (1/328)) also see my book “al-Qawlul Matin Fi Jarh Bita’min”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) Some people take from this hadith this issue that, “The Angels say Amin quietly because their voice is not heard therefore Amin should be said quietly”. So we stress and request the question that do you see or hear other actions of the Angels? and by not hearing Amin you result in giving a flawed fatwa that Amin should be said quietly? This is just equivalent to ‘resorting to sinking straws’ (meaning trying to achieve something that can’t be done, straws float and can’t sink)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) The virtue of praying Amin in the prayer is a means of forgiveness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) From this hadith it is established that if the latecomer has recited a part of Surah Fatiha or is going to start reciting Surah Fatiha, and the Imam says Amin then he (the latecomer) should also say Amin and finish reciting Surah Fatiha after. Now if he has reached his Wa Ladhalin and the Imam is reciting (another surah) after saying Amin then he will not say Amin rather he will stay quiet just how it is established from other general proofs.</span></p>
