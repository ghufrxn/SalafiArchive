				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Difference Between The Salafi&#8217;s and The Ashari&#8217;s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Translated, Compiled and Annotated</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Who Are The Ahlus Sunnah?</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Sijzi (444AH) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ahlus Sunnah are established upon the creed that they had established from the Salaf us-Saliheen who took it from the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam. They took from the companions because they were scholars and we must follow the narrations from the companions and we have been ordered to follow their way. Therefore it is necessary to hold onto the way of the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam and the companions and to have belief upon that and in this you can have no doubt.”</em> (Ar-Rad Ala Man Ankaral Khuruf Wa Sawt lee Sijzi (pg.9)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn ul-Jawzee defines Ahlus Sunnah by saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If someone asks that Sunnah is something which is praiseworthy and bid’ah (innovation) is something which is not, but what are Sunnah and bid’ah? We say, every innovator claims that he is from within Ahlus Sunnah, so we answer them by saying that in the arabic language Sunnah means ‘a way’ and in the Sharee’ah it will mean that those who are the Sunnis will be upon the way of the Messenger of Allah, the companions and those which have followed them. They are the Ahlus Sunnah and in that way there is no room for innovations for these came about after the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam and the companions </em>(Talbees Iblees of Ibn al-Jawzee vol.1 pgs.135-136)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Specifically, the term Ahlus Sunnah refers to the Ahlul-Hadeeth and this is because they are included within Ahlus sunnah for they have firm belief in the attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and they affirm them, they say that the Qur’an is the speech of Allah not created, they believe that on Yaum al-Qiyaamah the believers will see Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and they accept all the other established principles of creed other than this and these principles are known between the Ahlus Sunnah and Ahlul Hadeeth.” </em>(Minhaaj as-Sunnah of Ibn Taymiyyah vol.2 pg.221)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, the great Imaam Qawaam as-Sunnah Imaam Abul Qasim al-Asbahaanee (d.535H) Rahimahullah discussed in his very valuable book <em>al-Hujjah</em> the term Ahlus Sunnah, Ahlul Hadeeth and its various implications. Imam Asbahaanee said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We saw the Ashaabul Hadeeth, and they travelled far and wide to collect the narrations, then they sifted out the weak ones from the authentic narrations, they compiled them and they memorised them. The Ashaabul hadeeth (Ahlul Hadeeth) then acted upon these narrations and they promoted and spread these narrations this being their dawah and they used the narrations of the Messenger of Allah </em><em>sallahu alaihi wasallam to refute the mukhaalifeen (the opposers). These Ashaabul Hadeeth had with them a vast amount of authentic narrations just like the cloth seller has clothes, the one who sells dates has dates, and the one who sells perfume has perfume! So the one who sold dates becomes known as the date seller and the one who sells clothes  becomes known as the clothes seller and the one who sells perfume becomes known as the perfume seller, then similarly the Ashaabul hadeeth and the scholars of hadeeth became known as the Ahlul Hadeeth. When these Ahlul Hadeeth saw people going away from the ma’roof (that which was known by way of necessitating and following the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam) and they could see people leaving the authentic narrations and they could see people from the various sects making tanqeed and making disparaging remarks against the narrations the scholars of hadeeth began to refute these people and began to warn against them in their gatherings. The ahulul hadeeth began to mention the real meanings of the words of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam as they ought to have been understood.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So it is fair to say from this evidence that the scholars of hadeeth who authored all of the works in promoting the ittiba (following) of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam in reality they are the <strong>Ahlus Sunnah </strong>and have more of a right to call themselves the <strong>Ahlus sunnah </strong>then any other person or group and this is because according to the scholars the real meaning of Sunnah is to follow the authentic chain of narration (hadeeth) from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam concerning the Ahkaam and to act upon that and to stay away from that which has come by way of a forbiddance in these narrations. Thus this is a clear evidence to say that the ahlul hadeeth, ashaabul hadeeth are actually none other than the Ahlus Sunnah themselves.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>If someone was to say that if this is the case then every other sect other than the Ahlul Hadeeth also mention various narrations as evidences for their beliefs and their actions then what do we say about them? Then our response is, that those which in opposition to an authentic narration bring a weak narration, in opposition to a complete narration, bring a mursal (an incomplete) narration, in opposition to a marfoo’ narration (a narration that reaches with complete chain the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam) bring a mawqoof narration (that which does not reach the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam but a companion) then they cannot be on the same level as the Ahlul Hadeeth whichever sect they may be from! The one who follows the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam based on the authentic narrations he is the one who is following a clear evidence and he is the one who is taking his understanding from the authentic narrations, not from the weak or the incomplete narrations which cannot be in comparison to those narrations which are authentic. Thus it is clear that the Ahlul Sunnah is the one who will follow the authentic narrations and go out of his way to follow the authentic narration over and above any other narration or saying, whereas those who are Ahlul Rai (people of opinion and conjecture) they only follow the narrations which fit well within their hearts and minds.” </em>(Al-Hujjah Fee Bayaanil Mahajjah vol. 3 pgs. 413-414)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The sects which have split from the Ahlul Hadeeth split due to a difference in the Usul and fundamentals by leaving authentic narrations as reported by the Salaf and choosing another path, such as  the Ashaa’irah and those like them who have deviated concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah and the true understanding concerning them, thus leaving the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah for verily they have taken their own distortions, their own minds and hearts, weak narrations, narrations which are unclear and understandings which are futile, over and above the absolutely clear cut authentic Ahadeeth which are proven from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So with which face can the Ashaa’irah of the past or today claim that they are from the Ahlul Sunnah when it comes to the Names and Attributes of Allah? It has expounded on this matter in some great detail and it is sufficient to say that the saying of imam Asbahaanee is a tremendous saying in showing:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A) The fadhal and greatness of the people of hadeeth and those who accept the authentic narrations whether it be in Aqeedah or other than it and the fallacy of those who oppose the authentic narrations who in essence have also opposed the Ahlul hadeeth. Further, no doubt this statement also shows that Aqeedah and creed is based upon authentic narrations and not narrations which are weak or dubious to say the least. So why is it then that the Ashaa’irah and those upon their way do not see that clinging to the way of Ahlul hadeeth is the way of salvation!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">B) It was the Ahlul Hadeeth who made it their routine to record, preserve, accurately narrate, spread and make actions upon the authentic Ahadeeth of our beloved master Muhammad and the best of the Ahlul Hadeeth were the companions in this regard may Allah be pleased with them all and the likes of the Ashaa’irah are far removed in their belief in opposition to the salaf and thus cannot be counted amongst the saved sect the Ahlul Hadeeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">C) It is obligatory to admonish and warn the people about keeping their Aqeedah free from the deviancy and innovated principles in Aqeedah from the likes of the Ashaa’irah and the Manhaj and methodology of doing so is to be taken from the Salaf, Aimmah of Ahlul Hadeeth and in it is a tremendous benefit if only the people knew!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">D) The Ahlul Hadeeth have always been known through the eras by their clinging and making dawah to the authentic Ahadeeth of our master may our parents be sacrificed for him Muhammad and the Athaar of the companions. So just like this the other sects who left the way of Ahlul Hadeeth like the Ashaa’irah have always been known for using spurious baseless arguments based upon there own weak intellects and analogies over above the clear texts established in the Ahadeeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">E) the litmus test of sifting out the deviant Aqeedah and corrupt principles of the likes of the Ashaa’irah is to test their sayings against the authentic narrations of the beloved Muhammad and none other will do this accept the Ahlul Hadeeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">F) Not everyone who narrates a Hadeeth will have the correct understanding of it, especially if he is a bigoted blind follower of a sect (such as the Ashaa’irah) for all that he will desire is to prop up his Madhab and way to the masses not knowing if what he is saying was actually the way of the best of generations after al-Aaqib Muhammad.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">G) There is great importance attached to the isnaad (chain of narration and seeing whom one takes knowledge from} in the religion of al Islaam. The sects that left Ahlus sunnah did so due to their inherent weakness of not paying attention to the difference between the weak and authentic narrations and many followed none other than their desires and opinions. Herein lays a fundamental difference between the Ahlul Hadeeth and the Ashaa’irah in that the Ahlul Hadeeth call to authentic narrations whereas the Ashaa’irah do not. Had it not been for the Ahlul Hadeeth then every sect would have said what it wanted about the Deen of Islaam and it would have been impossible to judge which sect was upon the way of the Salaf. So the Ashaa’irah and other than them are upon beliefs which do not have an authentic sanad (chain and connection) back to our master Muhammad and the Salaf.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">H) Before the innovations and distorted beliefs of the various sects like the Ashaai’rah and other than them the Ummah was united and one upon the way of the messenger and the companions. Thus the various sects split from the Jamaah and it is obligatory upon them to leave their falsehood and come back to the Quran, Sunnah upon the understanding of the companions and their successors, the Salafee, Atharee, Ahlul Hadeeth way and in it is salvation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great Imaam and scholar of Hadeeth Khateeb al-Baghdadi said in his tremendous book <em>Sharf Ashaabul hadeet</em>h concerning the Ahlus Sunnah and the Ahlul Hadeeth that they have a very special characteristic in that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Ahlul Hadeeth always search for the authentic narrations over and above anyone’s opinion and Qiyaas (analogy), the hadeeth is sufficient for them. This is because the Ahlul Hadeeth have the correct Aqeedah due to their reliance upon the authentic narrations for verily the Aqeedah will not only be found in the Qur’an but will be found extensively in the Sunnah also and this is why all basis and types of worship, for example, the principles of Tawheed, the punishments for those who disobey, the Sifaat (the Attributes of Allah </em><em>Subhanahu wata’ala), the kayfiya and description of the Paradise and Hellfire, and the Aqeedah concerning the Angels and the Books and the Prophets and other than this from the principles and fundamentals of Aqeedah are found in the authentic Ahadeeth. Those who take their analogy and their opinions and their understandings over and above the Hadeeth then they do not attain the benefit of this correct Aqeedah. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Every group which is outside of Ahlul Hadeeth leans more towards giving precedence and returning to opinion and analogy over and above the authentic narrations except for the Ahlul Hadeeth for the Hadeeth of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam is the paramount consideration for them in all that they do and all that they preach and they only accept the sayings of the scholars of past and present if that saying is in accordance with the Book of Allah and the authentically proven Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammed sallahu alaihi wasallam and this is why many of the sects of ahlul bid’ah have had no choice but to verbally agree with the creed of the Ahlul Hadeeth but inwardly they have always utilised their analogy and Qiyaas to follow their own Madhahibs and sect. Those in the past and the present up until the Day of Judgement who oppose the Ahlul Hadeeth creed and aqeedah which they are upon, then, Allah Subhanahu wata’ala will humiliate them, those who have enmity towards them then Allah Subhanahu wata’ala will humiliate and punish them further and those which separate from them will never be successful because the people are in need of the Ahlul hadeeth to give them the authentic narrations concerning their beliefs and other than that.” </em>(Sharf Ashabul Hadith pgs 36-37)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we can see further from this saying that the likes of the Ashaa’irah unfortunately have left the way of the Ahlul Hadeeth and instead when it comes to the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala they began to use their own analogy and their own opinions over and above the authentically proven narrations from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam and the companions. No doubt this was a grave reason for their leaving the ahlul sunnah wal jama’ah thus leading to their humiliation.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Difference Between The Salafi&#8217;s and The Ashari&#8217;s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise is for Allah the one with whose face the believers will be immensely rewarded in the hereafter as they will see his glorious face and between them and Allah there shall be no covering or barrier. We ask Allah with the waseelah of all of his tremendous names and attributes that he makes us from amongst those who will be honoured with such a blessing and not from those who deny and explain away that he does not have a face thus inviting the punishment of Allah upon themselves, misguiding themselves and misguiding others. May there be infinite blessings and salutations upon our master Muhammad and all those who follow him with righteousness until the last day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To proceed:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this short introduction to the book concerning the Ashaa’irah we will be discussing some of the fundamental points that the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah have alluded to when they have analysed the various sects that have reared their heads splitting away from the saved sect, the Ahlus Sunnah, The Ahlul Hadith, the Ahlul Athar, Salafiyeen. We will also be exploring the basic definition and implications of the term “Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah,” especially in relation to the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wa-Ta’ala and the stance of Ahlus Sunnah concerning those that have gone far away from the Ahlul Sunnah concerning their position on the Names and Attributes such as the Asha’irah and Mu’tazilah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will also attempt with the aid of Allah o delve into how some of the deviated sects such as the Asha’irah have tried to use the Qur’an and sometimes the Sunnah for their own benefit and have in fact even gone further in creating principles and rules when it comes to the Names and Attributes of Allah and the reader will come to know that these principles are based upon innovations which they have established  so that they can beguile other people whilst also fooling themselves!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The reader will come to realise that the Asharis and those splinter sects outside of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah have those from amongst them that even went to the extremities of lying upon the Messenger of Allah Salllahu alaihi wasallam and we shall discuss some examples where ahadeeth have been fabricated so that the Madhab and innovated principles of the Ashari’s can be pushed forward to the people concerning making Ta’weel (interpretations) in the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala which have not been accepted by the salaf being primarily the companions and the successors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Blessed are the Salaf and from amongst them the first and foremost the Messenger of Allah Sallalhu alaihi wasallam and the Companions May Allah be pleased with them all for they understood the Arabic language as it was meant to be taken and thus they accepted without any doubt whatsoever all the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wa ta’ala not having the need to make ta&#8217;wil, tamthil, ta&#8217;til or even ilhaid. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Blessed are the companions and their successors for none argued or disputed amongst themselves concerning the acceptance of the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and indeed they had a consensus concerning this issue and this is a consensus which was adhered to by the remaining Salaf of this ummah up until today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam said concerning the Khawarij and their father Dhul Khuwaisarah: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>They will read the Qur’an but it will not raise higher than beyond their throats and they will leave the religion the way an arrow leaves its prey.” </em>(Sahih Muslim hadith number 2316.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith is evidently about the Khawaarij but in it is a deeper meaning and that meaning is that the sects of the past and present who have gone away from the Madhab and the way of the Sahabah and the Salaf have clearly misunderstood the meanings of the Quraan and Sunnah, that is the religion, for the hadeeth in Saheeh al-Bukhaari says that they will read the Qur’an meaning outwardly they would profess Islaam and outwardly they would read the Book of Allah and even they will read the narrations of the Prophet Muhammad sallalahu alaihi Wasallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However this reading of theirs will be distorted and will be of no consequence to them in relation to benefitting them in their Aqidah because they will not be reading it with the understanding and eyesight of the Companions and the Salaf. No doubt this was one of the fundamental reasons for the deviations of the various sects who left the way of Ahlul Hadeeth like the Khawaarij who ended up making mass takfir upon many of the Muslims on account of major sins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly we can see that the Asha’irah and the Mu’tazilah and the modern day Deobandis, Barailwis, Sufis, Qadiris, Chishtis, Naqshbandis, Shadhilis, Habashis, and all the others including the Shi’ahs. ([1] The reader can refer to the excellent books by Shaikh Taalib ur Rehman, this one such book, and the books of the Allaamah Ehsaan Elaahee Zaheer, al-Barailwiyyah, ash-Shia was-Sunnah and at-Tassawuf)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They read the Qur’an and they tell the people that they read the hadeeth and they try to provide evidences from the sources of the Qur’an and hadeeth but they have their own interpretations and this is what this hadeeth refers to, reading the Qur’an or reading the hadeeth is not sufficient if it does not penetrate the heart or does not even go beyond throats and the only way that the hadeeth and the ayah of the Qur’an will be of benefit and penetrate the hearts and be part of Iman based actions upon the limbs is if the understanding and the fahm is taking by the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam, the blessed companions and the Salaf of this ummah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How beneficial would it have been for the past and the current day sects especially the Asha’irah to reflect upon and understand the tremendous saying of the Imam, the Zahid Imam Zuhri (Rahimahullah) who said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Islaam means, for Allah (</em><em>Subhanahu wata’ala)</em><em>to make the bayaan by way of revelation, for the Messenger of Allah (</em><em>sallahu alaihi wasallam) </em><em>to make the balaagh by way of spreading, explaining and conveying that revelation, and for us is the taslim, that is to accept without any hesitations and conditions.”</em> (Zuhd of Ibn Abi Aasim (pg.78), Hilyatul Awliyah of Abu Nu’aym (3/369), Aqidatus Salaf Wa Ashabul Hadith of Abee Isma’il as-Sabuni and Ibn Hajr has also recorded this in his al-Fath with an authentic chain.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we have some of the old Ashaa’irah in the past, so it is important to distinguish between the previous scholars who were influenced by the Ashari creed yet they affirmed Allah being above the Throne and many of his Attributes as they have come to us by way of the Salaf, whilst erring in some methodologies concerning the same, such as, Qadi Abu Bakr al-Baqilani, Imam Abu Bakr al-Baihaqi, Abul Hasan Ibn Mahdi at-Tabari, Abul Hasan al-Ashari, Ibn Kullab and the modern day Ashari’s who are not actually Ashariyyah but more Jahmi, Sufi, Mu’tazili and Murji.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All rolled into one, such as the Jahmite Zahid al-Kawthari, Abu Guddah Abdul Fattah, the Ghumari clan and leaders of the modern day Deobandi’s and Barelvi’s who are outright Mufawwidah and Mu’attilah rejecting the sublime attributes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The modern day Asha’irah who make various claims and arguments about why they feel the need to make interpretations in the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and they attempt to attribute their innovation back to the Salaf who of course are absolutely free from such beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> One of the things which the Asha’irah of past and present have tried to hide behind is the term Ahlus Sunnah and they claim that <em>“to make Ta’wil (metaphorical and figurative interpretations) of Allahs attributes and to make Tafwidh (not giving the attributes a meaning that was understood by the Salaf as they have come)  is the way of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah”</em> and in this they try to beguile the common people by making them think that this way is the way of the Sahabah and the first three generations. So we ask who are the Ahlus Sunnah? How did the Salaf understand this term and in general, what does it entail?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Rajab defined ‘Sunnah’ by saying </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“it is a way which is established in the beliefs and actions and it is a way that the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam and the rightly guided Khulafah were upon, this is known as Sunnah tul-Kamilah (the complete Sunnah) and this is what the Salaf would call Sunnah and it would all be included within this definition.” </em>(Jam’e al-Ulum Wal Hikam of Ibn Rajab (pg.282)</span></p>
