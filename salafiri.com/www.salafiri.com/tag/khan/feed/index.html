<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Taken from: <strong><span style="color: #000080;">al-Barelwiyyah; Their History and Beliefs Volume 2, <em>Expounding The Belief of the Pious Ancestors and Ahl al-Sunnah w’al Jama’ah</em><em> </em><em>&amp; </em><em>What Opposes it from the Wicked Deviation of the Barelwi Renegades</em></span></strong></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Historical Overview &#8211; Sufi Barelwi Renegades &amp; Their Origins in Extreme Terror and Kharijism; The Barelwi Ancestry and Lineage</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We begin by looking at the Barelwi Ash’arite and Sufi Churchfathers and their affect on the muslim society. It is common knowledge and a specific and particular hallmark of the Barelwi underlings and global sufi sympathisers that the Saudi Wahabis are government funded, they rebel and murder people, Khawarij and all sorts of fallacious delusional points.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will show how the Barelwi forefathers were themselves upon the methodology of killing innocent Muslims and how they colluded against the Muslims. We will also show how some of them were renegades themselves,  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the lineage of Ahmad Raza Khan Barelwi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Naqi Ali Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Raza Ali Khan son of  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Kazim Ali Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Azam Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’adat Yar Khan son of</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sa’idullah Khan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Zafar al-Din Qadri Bihari, <em>Hayat A’la Hazrat</em>, (Karachi: Maqtabah Rizviyya, 1:2 Muhammad Sabir al-Qadiri Nasim al-Bastawi, <em>Ahwal wa Athar Hazrat Mujaddid Islam</em> (Lahore: Raza Academy, 1998) p.34 </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Sa’idullah Khan</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He hailed from Kandahar which in present day Afghanistan, he was a pathan belonging to the Barech tribe. He eventually migrated to Lahore with Sultan Muhammad Nadir Shah as part of his war expeditions. He was given prestigious and high ranking positions within Nadir Shahs Safavid Dynasty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then moved to Delhi whilst he was minister of a department. He received the accolade and title of ‘Bravery of war,’ an official title from the Ruler, ie Muhammad Nadir Shah for his bravery and ardent loyalty (Muhammad Sabir al-Qadiri Nasim al-Bastawi, <em>Ahwal wa Athar Hazrat Mujaddid Islam</em>, p.34) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Nadir Shah (d.1747) was the ruler or Iran of the Safavid Dynasty and had the title The Shah of Iran. He was, naturally of Iranian descent belonging to the Afshar tribe hailing from Khurasan. He was born a Shi’i as an Itha Ashari and was an ardent follower of the Jafari school of thought. Due to the political turmoil at the time he would often say to people he was also sunni in order to keep his cohorts to support him and also to keep the opposing Ottoman empire from fighting him. In fact, numerous people serving and working with him failed to highlight whether he was sunni or shi’i, such was his deception</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He attempted to mix the two and made his own madhab called the jafari madhab so that the ottomans would accept him. His aim was to allow the persians to perform Hajj which was under Ottoman control and administration, and his only aim behind this was to make this a revenue stream. (Michael Axworthy&#8217;s, <em>The Sword of Persia</em> (I.B. Tauris, 2006), Tucker, Ernest, &#8220;Nadir Shah and the Ja&#8217;fari Mazhab reconsidered&#8221;, in <em>Iranian Studies</em>, vol. 27, 1-4 (1994), pp,163-179.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He continued to fight for the Safavid dynasty which was in decline at the period and thus Nadir Shah seized the opportunity to launch his own house. Nadir Shah continued to lead numerous military expeditions throughout the lands, which he was successful in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the time Ghilzai Afghans had control of the southeast regions, namely Kandahar. This was later controlled by the Hotaki dynasty. Nadir Shah defeated the Hotaki dynasty in approximately 1738 and took control of Kandahar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is where Sa’idullah Khan joined Nadir Shah and became a part of his dynasty war campaign for domination. Nadir Shah then went onto fight the Mughals and their empire and in the process captured cities like Ghazni, Kabul, Peshawar, parts of Sindh and Lahore.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Nadir Shah’s history and campaign were a far cry from innocence, one only needs to read the annals of history and they will come to know the wicked and evil nature of his deviation, theologically and socially.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The aim is not to present a reading into the evil actions of certain individuals or a history lesson but to show if one makes erroneous and fabricated claims against Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and al-Saud family, the closet will yield some home truths! (For further reading on the generosity and life of Muhammad Nadir Shah Read, Michael Axworthy&#8217;s, <em>The Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from Tribal Warrior to Conquering Tyrant</em>. (I.B. Tauris, 2006), Ernest Tucker, <em>Nadir Shah&#8217;s Quest for Legitimacy in Post-Safavid Iran</em> (Florida, University Press, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the likes of whom the forefathers of Ahmad Raza Khan colluded with, to cause havoc and rampage in muslim territories, the atrocities, genocide, pillaging land, and philandering of wealth and woman of unprecedented levels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to ask the barelwi sympathisers what do they make of the claim, which they often hurl at Ahl al-Sunnah, petrol dollars, the illegal al-Saud state, corroborating with the British, killing innocent muslims, mass murdering and declaring Muslims to be disbelievers. Of course this is sheer nonsense which has been answered in great detail, however the ignorant wandering mind will always have difficulty focusing on the truth and facts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This said, Barelwi Sufi narrow mindedness and genius level of reasoning fails to see and acknowledge how the forefathers of their Ala Hazrat Ahmad Raza Khan were part of such acts which were absolutely heinous and catastrophically evil.  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[6] Taqlid Aur Amal Bil-Hadith </strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Nawab Syed Mahdi Ali Khan Bahadur (1325H)</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Practice of the People Before The Advent of The Four Madhabs</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During the time of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) there were no other books or texts other than the Quran that were consulted with regards to issues pertaining to the Shariah, the ahadith and rulings. At the time no books of ahadith were authored nor did any companion compile a book about issues of Fiqh and their rulings and nor did any scholar pen anything on Usul or Qawa’id.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the time there was just actions of the companions, they would see the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) perform an action and they would then just do the same. They did not intend to focus on Usul al-Fiqh and its compilations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) would issue a legal edict or answer a question, the companions would listen and remember them. The custom of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) in terms of his actions and completion of the acts of worship etc would differ at different times and not all of the companions would be with him all of the time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, whichever companion saw an action he remembered it and when the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said something they would memorise it. Any particular reason or specific circumstances evolving around those instances, they kept to themselves not thinking any thing of them and they continued like this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From amongst the zealous and keen companions, they would endeavour to seek more knowledge and learn more about the finer details. They would ask one another and so on. So some of these companions became stronger jurists. The companions who spent more time with the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) learnt more and became more knowledgable in relation to others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the time of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) passed and it was the era of the companions, they would act on their knowledge as well as what they had heard directly from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If a new matter arose they would ask the other companions and if they were unable to find a clear answer from the Quran and Sunnah they would look at other similar issues that had been transmitted via the Quran and Sunnah and make deductions based on them. If they faced a difficult issue they would consult and seek advice from one another and resolve the matter in this way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people who were born in this era or those who accepted and reverted back to Islam, this is how they learnt the knowledge of the din, exactly the same way the companions had learnt from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). In other words, whenever a companion would meet each other, they would be jurists in their own right (because of what they knew in relation to the other companion in terms of hadith or rulings) and took issues of the shariah from them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Taqlid Aur Amal Bil-Hadith (pg.8-9)</span></p>
