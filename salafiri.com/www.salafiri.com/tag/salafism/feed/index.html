<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point by Point on Debunking Yasir Qadhi (ism) In light of his DISPATCH: Yasir Qadhi on Salafis and Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab, Science and Miracles, Yajuj and Majuj.</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Part 4</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Timestamp 1:00</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Host Mahin Says: I have heard, there is a guy in our WhatsApp group that calls him Sheikh ul-Islam of America, Ali al-Boriqi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Host SIM: oh Ali is very learned as well Mashallah that’s a huge compliment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Comment</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says in the glorious Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">[And they should consider that] when those who have been followed disassociate themselves from those who followed [them], and they [all] see the punishment, and cut off from them are the ties [of relationship], Those who followed will say, &#8220;If only we had another turn [at worldly life] so we could disassociate ourselves from them as they have disassociated themselves from us.&#8221; Thus will Allah show them their deeds as regrets upon them. And they are never to emerge from the Fire. (Surah al-Baqarah:166-167)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a prime illustration of how individuals like this Ali al-Boriqi, who are fanatical followers, fall into extremism, the very thing they irresponsibly accuse others of! This level of praise is if at all only for the major scholars of this Ummah. In fact, we don’t even find the students of the major scholars of our times referring to them with such loaded titles of eminence. How is then the case for someone who is only 45 and and has perhaps only studied Islamic sciences for around a decade, with most parts being centered on a corrupt methodological approach anyway.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We then see Yasir Qadhi at this moment of sheer humility letting off a smug smirk lasting for a good few seconds. There is obviously no uproar, nor a dare I say quote unquote remark, actually there isn’t even a weak sigh or gasp of dismay at the utterance of such a chilling testimony. This is Yasir Qadhi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Compare Yasir Qadhi to the humility of Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan. Yasir Qadhi during the course of the podcast stated that he started to deliver sermons when he was 16 and that he has been lecturing preaching and teaching for almost three decades and during this moment of enlightened self-amazement, he says “wow, Subhanallah” (Time stamp 11:15).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us now compare him to who the real scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah are, why? Because he has repeatedly asserted that the west should refer to the Scholars of the WEST. Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan was born in 1933 and in 1950 he was appointed as a teacher in a school in Buraydah. Therefore, Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan has been teaching the Islamic sciences, issues legal edicts ranging from creed to governance and so on for the best part of 69 years, yes dear readers 69 years. I am quite certain the intelligent person will see the enormous disparity between precision, depth and accuracy in the knowledge of Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan and the other scholars of our times and between the insignificant role Yasir Qadhi actually has in the West. Moving on, a scholar who has taught Islam, the true “strand” of Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah, Salafism or as Yasir likes to define as the Najdi Da’wah said the following when:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Questioner praises Shaykh Fawzan for his defence of the Islamic Aqidah and Shari’ah. He says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“May Allah show goodness to you, this questioner calls Allah to witness, as well as those present here, that he loves you for the sake of Allah, he asks Allah, The Exalted, The Most High that He forgives you, gives you Tawfiq and rewards you on Behalf of Islam and the Muslims, due to what you do in defending the Aqidah and the Shari’ah.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan replies:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Firstly we ask Allah that He loves you, just as you love us for His sake, as for your statement that I defend Islam, then in reality I am not of this rank. I am less than this, I am deficient and I Seek the forgiveness of Allah, however we hope in Allah, that he gives victory to Islam, a victory from Himself and He forsakes the enemies of Islam by his Honour and His Ability, may He Be Glorified, the Most High.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Example &#8211;  Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The questioner says: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah grant you good. How does one reach the level of knowledge possessed by Shaykh Ibn Baz and You?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan replies:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I don’t have knowledge! As for Shaykh Ibn Baz, yes he had knowledge, may Allah forgive him and have mercy on him. As for us, we are poor (in terms of knowledge) like you. However, it is obligatory upon us to learn.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(YouTube: The Humility of the Noble Scholar – Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, Translated by Abu Abdillah Nasir Hussain. Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwJXSFuYsEc)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwJXSFuYsEc)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allahu Akbar, May Allah have mercy on the noble Scholars Ahl al-Sunnah, just look at their humility and simplicity, a true sign of knowledge which leads to Taqwa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Third Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A host introduces Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan during a lecture and he continues to praise him for almost one and a half minutes. When Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan finally speaks he says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim, Alhamdulillah Wassalatu Wassalam Ala Rasullillah Wa Ala Alihi Wa Sahbi wa Man Wala, to proceed: Indeed, you have EMBARASSED me, where you have lifted me to a place I have not reached, I’m to say the least just a seeker of knowledge just like one of you. Rather, perhaps amongst you there are those who greater and more noble.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(YouTube: The Humility of Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan After one Praised Him. YouTube. Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKM-a3pVWmg)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKM-a3pVWmg)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fourth Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yasir Qadhi goes onto mention his Islamic achievements that he wrote books and delivered lectures on this i.e in defence and propagation of the Najdi Da’wah, like Kitab al-Tawhid, Kashf al-Shubuhat and Qawa’id al-Arba’a and propagation of the Najdi Da’wah. He goes onto say I quote unquote:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Quote <span style="color: #ff0000;">“Dare I say to this day NOTHING (emphasis his) has been written in the English language that is more of an advanced defence of the Najdi da’wah then my critical analysis of shirk which is still available in the English language.”</span> Unquote (Timestamp, 12:50)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan was asked:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Allah has blessed you to author many books; are there any books you deem better?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: which books?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Questioner Your Books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: (with some concern) You want me to praise my own book? (The Shaykh chuckles)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: I deem all of my books to be weak.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fifth Example –Shaykh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A host introduces Shaykh al-Albani for approximately two and a half minutes. Shaykh al-Albani while following the Sunnah of Allahs’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam begins by reciting the Khutbatul Hajah. He then thanks the host for his words and praise and then says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I have no answer to it except to follow the example of the First Khalifah, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq RadhiAllah Anhu, who was the first and true Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. When he heard someone praising him, and it is my belief that no matter how much the one who is exaggerating in his praise (it was the truth) since he was the Khalifah of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam yet. (THE SHAYKHS STARTS CRYING from timestamp 4:29 until 5:00 and in between says Allahul Musta’an and then continues) Yet he used to say “Oh Allah don’t hold me responsible for that which say, make me better then that which they think of me and forgive me for that which they don’t know” (The Shaykh is still shaken and upset) This is what the great Siddiq said. What is there for us to say after him? So I say Following his example (while the Shaykh is still upset) Oh Allah don’t hold me responsible for that which say, make me better then that which they think of me and forgive me for that which they don’t know” The truth is and I say the truth, I am not the person that was described by our noble brother but I am merely a student of knowledge, nothing else.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(YouTube: The Humility of Sheikh Al Albani. Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFzTPHR3Ukk)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFzTPHR3Ukk)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Sixth Example –Shaykh Muhammad b. Saleh al-Uthaymin</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yasir Qadhi proudly claims he was the student of Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin, is this the case? I will scrutinise this claim later. Let us look at the humility of Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin. A host asks Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin if it was permissible for a person to recite a poem, so Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin grants them permission. He starts reciting:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“My Ummah after this night comes</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Dawn that its light spread across the world</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Good is awaited and the opening is soon</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the truth will be victorious despite of the efforts of evil</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By a revival that Allah has blessed</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That is pure and free of any defects</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as Ibn Saleh (i.e. Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin) is amongst us</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as Ibn Saleh is amongst us</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh of our revival</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With his likes we wish for support and victory</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin interjects and says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I do not agree with this line, no I do not agree because I don’t want the truth to be attributed to individuals. Everyone makes mistakes and if we attribute the truth to individuals and then that person dies, the people will fall into desperation. If you wish (i.e) change that line to “As long as we have the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of his Messenger” It would be better.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reciter then continues his recitation:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as we have the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of his Messenger</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Uthaymin…</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin then interjects again: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“No Oh Shaykh (like I just told you) Don’t say this, no no, stop, stop.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reciter continues and it seems like he does not understand what the Shaykh is trying to point out:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Jurist..</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin stops them and they say let us continue by the will of Allah. Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“No, by Allah I don’t want, no I am not joking, you only have this? Then ask your question. The poem was absolutely uncalled for. I advise you from now and after, not to tie the truth to men. Firstly, men can deviate even Ibn Mas’ud RadhiAllahu Anhu said: “Whoever is to follow someone then follow those who have passed away because those who are alive are not safe from trials.” If you attribute the truth to men a person could be deceived by himself, we seek refuge of Allah from that and adopt wrong ways. Therefore, I advise you not to attribute the truth to men. Firstly, a man is not safe, I ask Allah to make us firm, a man is not safe from mistakes and trial. Secondly, he will die, no one remains alive, “We granted not to any human being immortality before you then if you die, would they live forever (Surah al-Anbiya, 21:34). Thirdly the sons of Adam, humans may be deceived if he sees people honouring and flocking to him. He might be deceived, he might think he is infallible or claim that he is and believe everything that he does is the truth and that every path he takes is permissible. This could lead him to destruction, a man praised another man a the presence of the Messenger of Allah Salallahu alayhi Wsallam, The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam told him: Woe to you, you have cut the neck of your friend (his back). I thank the brother in advance though I have not heard what he says about me to what he expresses of his feelings towards me I ask Allah to make me as he best sees me no more but I don’t like being praised, I will reward you inshallah and so I ask Allah to reward you and to recompense you”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(YouTube: Don’t Tie the Truth to Men – The Humility of Ibn Uthaymin. Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfKeWwSILvE)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfKeWwSILvE)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After these illustrative examples showing how our scholars displayed humility and how Yasir Qadhi displays the direct opposite. It would be most pertinent to remind the readers secondarily and Yasir himself primarily concerning the issue of Riya- the hidden shirk or polytheism. Yasir Qadhi is usually very quick in listing the names of his books relevant to the Sunni Salafi Aqidah but rarely if at all ever mentions his book on Riya – showing of. On page 43 of the book he mentions how the dangers of riya are the destruction of the Ummah and then on page 45 the love of praise and the most important on page 32, it increases misguidance. It seems likes Yasir Qadhi has not only left Salafism and the Najdi Da’wah but also the basic concepts of self rectification and personal purification of the soul and it is a must that he reads his book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly in this part I would like to leave the readers with words of Shaykh Abd al-Razzaq al-Badr where in he states and the aim to highlight the idea of being humble</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Mutarif ibn Abdillah ibn ash-Shik-kheer who was a scholar from Tabi’in, he saw a man wearing a cloak and walking or strutting boastfully. So, he said to the man: “Oh slave of Allah, this is the type of boastful walking or strutting of those whom Allah hates.” The man replied, “Don’t you know who I am? This man was wearing this beautiful cloak and his appearance was attractive and he was strutting, and someone has the nerve to speak to him in this manner?! Thus he replied, Don’t you know who I am?! Meaning if you knew who I was you would not speak to me like this. Mutarrif said: “On the contrary, of course I know who you are!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You started as a sprinkled drop of sperm</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You will end up as a soiled corpse</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in the meantime you are carrying faeces around (in your intestines)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So I know who you are</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the man went about his way and he no longer strutted and these words of Mutarrif taught this man some manners.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(YouTube: How to humble an arrogant person – By Shaykh Abdur Razzaq Al-Badr. Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee. Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv62pV2BOXw)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv62pV2BOXw)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The purpose of knowledge is that is saves a person from disobeying Allah and his Messenger. Allah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error. (Surah al-Ahzab:36)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hasan al-Basri said: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">there are two types of knowledge, one that which is in the heart which is beneficial knowledge. The second type of knowledge is that which is on the tongue which is Allah’s evidence against mankind. (Sunan al-Darimi, 1:350 no.374, Dar al-Tasil)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With this being said, it is first and foremost for us to be humble and know our status in terms of ilm. Secondly for my fellow Muslims, brothers and sisters to to sit back a little and realise that true scholarship, academia and knowledge is with the Rabbani scholars of this Ummah, their virtue and status is well universal and agreed upon. Thirdly, do not be naïve and let people play with your emotions and Islam, for indeed you alone are responsible for your actions when you have to stand before Allah without any leader, scholar or interpreter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the subsequent parts I will highlight many inconsistencies, contradictions and the true reality of Yasir Qadhi, InshaAllah.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ḥibbān, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Rumaiṣah &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</span></strong></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993366;">[Taken from the introduction of the Forthcoming SRI Publication,</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"><em>With What Reasoning and Religion Can Bombings and Destruction Be Considered as Jihād?</em></span></strong> <span style="color: #993366;">– Shaykh ʿAbd al-Muḥsin b. Ḥamad al-ʿAbbād al-Badr and an overview of Jessica Stern &amp; J.M Berger&#8217;s</span>, <strong><span style="color: #000080;"><em>ISIS, The State of Terror</em></span></strong><span style="color: #993366;">]</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>ʿAudhu Billāhi min ash-shayṭān al-rajīm, Bismillāh al-Raḥmān al-Raḥīm. </em><em>Alḥamdullilāhi Rabbil ʿalamīn, waṣalatu wassalām ʿala Rasūlillahil karīm, wa ʿala alihī wa aṣḥābī wa man tabiʿahum bi-iḥsān ilāʾ yawm al-dīn</em>; wa baʿḍ. All Praise belongs and is directed to the <em>Rabb</em> of everything that exists, praise and salutations be upon His final beloved Messenger, Muḥammad Salallahu alayhi wasallam, his revered family and his noble Companions and upon all those who follow them in good, until the end of times, to proceed,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Modern writers have directed multifaceted attacks on Saudi Arabia by spreading a calculated smear campaign and all sorts of malicious allegations, ranging from; Saudi Arabia promotes terror and violence, it harbours extremists, sponsors militant Islam worldwide and is responsible for the global threat against humanity through radicalisation and terrorism. This is and are, indisputably shameless lies that only emanate due to a lack of knowledge and a deliberate concerted effort to malign Saudi Arabia and ultimately Salafiyyah, whereas the concise truth and reality could not be furthest from the truth in relation to these baseless allegations. Cdr Youseff H. Aboul-Enein writes:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Saudi Kingdom as a government has tamed Militant Islamists and settled back to Salafi Islamists trends, spreading its peculiar and intolerant brands of Islam through <em>dawa</em> and not violence.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This contradicts the views and claims of other writers, that Saudi Arabia promotes violence, this in of itself shows the fallacy of their arguments. Some writers have expanded on this discourse while explaining key facts associated with Saudi Arabia. They say Saudi Arabia is known to spread Salafism and according to the definition of Salafism, which I must add, is self concocted and a fabrication, in order to justify their narrative and an understanding that conforms to their falsehood. In reality, all such terms related to Salafism are false as there is only one type of Salafism. I am referring to terms like ‘Quietist Salafism,’ ‘Political Salafism’ and Jihadi Salafism,’<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> which, undoubtedly apart from minor fact of being conjured up to categorise modern trends, is outright erroneous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We can deliberate on this later, but when Jessica Stern; a research professor out of Boston University and who also served on the Clinton administrations National Security Council Staff and J.M Berger; a fellow with George Washington University’s programme on extremism, explained these terms,<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> whilst borrowing them from Quintan Wiktorowitz.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> According to their definition of ‘Quietist Salafism’ they say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The quietist faction is, in a sense, the strain of Salafism that has responded the least to the world events of the twentieth century. Individuals in this group understand their central project to be the purification of Islam and do not participate in politics.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Though there are quietists Salafis across the Muslim world, the center of gravity for this movement is the existing religious establishment in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is somewhat atypical for a country in the Muslim world, but the very things that make it unique have made is hospitable to the quietists.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On one hand, many like J. Stern and J.M. Berger, the example here; argue that Saudi Arabia has been an influential champion of Salafism, and we know from the first principles of Salafism; that it vehemently denounces, rejects, refutes and openly warns against terrorism, extremism and militancy. However, both writers, naively allude to:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It suggests, in a sense, that Saudi Arabia is responsible for movements such as ISIS because of the role that the Saudi Arabian government played in facilitating the spread of Salafism across the region.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As injudicious and untruthful as it sounds, which is undoubtedly the case, this diatribe would have been just ridiculed and brazenly dismissed as a very poor judgement of error, but to add insult to injury, they quote an article of Ed Hussain as evidence!<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> This article is a culmination of half truths and some rudimentary information, spun to give a repulsive intent; the authors quote it to suggest a colossal claim, this has but except caused them stern embarrassment. Furthermore, both writers have themselves defined Salafism as:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Salafism is a loosely organised movement within Sunni Islam…but there are core features to the movement. Salafism is call for a return to the beliefs, practises and sincerity of early Islam. In fact, the term “Salafism” is a direct reference to these early years, and refers to the first few generations of Muslims, known as the <em>salaf</em>. Salafis prefer the Islam of these early Muslims and believe that centuries of human interpretation – influenced by pre-existing religious traditions, cultural biases, political agendas and individual self-interests – have corrupted Islam and led to decline across the Muslim world.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, should it not be the case for anyone who <em>“suggests,”</em> that at the very least they look at the teaching, ideology and methodology of the Salaf, who the Salafis ascribe to, with regards to the modern trends and themes and labelling Salafism and thus Saudi Arabia being responsible for the terrorist group, ISIS?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is this not a huge leap over clear facts and perhaps total disregard for the truth while ignoring fundamentals precepts of Salafism. We find further contradictions in the understanding of these modern writers, and this is the case with most of them. They, Cdr Youseff H. Aboul-Enein argue that Saudi Arabia spread Islam through daʿwah and not violence, where as Stern and Berger argue Saudi Arabia exported their brand of Salafism which ultimately and by default led to the formation of ISIS and their activities. However, when have ISIS ever been at the forefront of giving daʿwah and in a non violent manner, in fact the total opposite. ISIS have killed Muslims openly, is this the daʿwah that is being referred to? These basic points are indeed sufficiently adequate to show the intelligent mind – the fallacy of these points suggested and hypothesized by these writers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some writers have focussed on the Wahhabīs as a movement and have also obviously projected a vivid view of the association between them and Salafism. Malise Ruthven labels the Wahhabīs as fundamentalists and asserts they formed close ideological ties with the Muslim Brotherhood from around circa 1960 to spread Wahhabī fundamentalism.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> This is also a gross error chronologically and also false because their ideology and the ideology of the Wahhabis and Salafis is poles apart, in doctrine and in methodology (<em>Manhaj</em>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even in recent times, when Saudi Arabia has continued its efforts in curbing radicalisation and fighting terrorism, ISIS continues its campaign of terror in the Kingdom and there have been at least Nine separate incidences of violence and terror attacks carried out with ISIS claiming responsibility. So much so that even the holy sanctuary of Madīnah and the Prophet H‘s mosque was not spared by these mindless terrorists, while the people were preparing to pray and break their fast in the Holy month of Ramaḍhān.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Saudi Arabia has seen terrorism and violence in its Kingdom prior to 9/11, from around 2000, with an increase in the violent terrorist attacks year by year, with the most recent being July 2018. Does a country subject its citizens and its visitors, who are protected and under the safety of the sovereign state; to violent terrorism, suicide bombings, destruction of property and life, indiscriminate senseless killings? Of course not! Then how do these modern writers, without any regard for the truth and respect for the dead, hurl baseless and false allegations at Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism and Salafism for the spread of violent terrorism. Foreign secret services although implicated, were surprising cleared by the police of their country, very conveniently of any involvement, but the allegations of foreign involvement in destabilising Saudi Arabia with a relentless campaign of terror are very much still on the table.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This short treatise of the Saudi Arabian Salafī scholar, Shaykh ʿAbd al-Muḥsin b. Ḥamad al-ʿAbbād al-Badr is a repudiation of the people whose ideology is to cause corruption and chaos throughout the lands. They cause destruction and devastation physically; to life and property as well as emotional and psychological trauma to all those affected by their reckless killing, suicide bombings and indiscriminate killing under the satanic principle of ‘collateral damage’. In current times various groups and organisations have arisen, whose intent is to kill innocent civilians, Muslims and non-Muslim, the elderly, women and children. Such heinous crimes are severely reprimanded in Islam and they also oppose its pristine teachings based on divine scriptures. These wicked and evil people distort and manipulate the scriptural texts, so that they conform to their whims and desires.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treatise, <em>‘</em><em>With What Reasoning and Religion Can Bombings and Destruction Be Considered as Jiḥād?’</em> of Shaykh ʿAbd al-Muḥsin addresses the important issues of killing innocent people, suicide bombings and senseless destruction, which was authored after the Riyadh bombings in 2003. This treatise also clarifies the Salafist view on the unlawfulness of suicide bombings, violent terror, the killing of innocent people and the sanctity of human life, which the Salafis have always advocated. Let this treatise also serve as a reminder to the detractors, who exert considerable effort to discredit the teachings of Salafiyyah, which is free from the so called brands of Salafism. We pray that individuals affected with the ideas of the Khawārij and extremists, benefit from this treatise while reading it with an open and sincere mind.  </span></p>
