				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question: </strong>How can we make a combination between the report <strong>&#8220;with His left Hand&#8221;</strong>, mentioned in the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa, in <em>Saheeh Muslim </em>and his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, saying: <strong>&#8220;And both His hands are right-handed?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>There is no contradiction between the two hadeeths that is apparent on the outset. Thus his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, saying: <strong>&#8220;And both His hands are right-handed&#8221; </strong>is an affirmation of Allaah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]
<p>So this description, which the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has informed us of is an affirmation of Allaah&#8217;s removal from any anthropomorphic qualities. Thus, the hand of Allaah is not like the hand of a human being – left-handed and righthanded.</p>
<p>On the contrary, <em>both </em>His hands are right-handed, may He be far removed from any defects.</p>
<p>As for the other point, then it is that the report: <strong>&#8220;with His left hand&#8221; </strong>is <em>shaadh</em>,<sup>1</sup> as I have clarified in the checking of &#8220;<em>Al-Mustalahaat-ul-Arba&#8217;ah Al-Waaridah feel-Qur&#8217;aan</em>&#8221; (no. 1) of Al-Mawdoodee.</p>
<p>What further supports this is that Abu Dawood also reported this hadeeth and (in it, he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said, <strong>&#8220;with His other hand&#8221; </strong>in the place of <strong>&#8220;with His left hand.&#8221; </strong>This report is in conformity with his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, other saying: <strong>&#8220;And both His hands are righthanded.&#8221; </strong>And Allaah knows best.</p>
[<strong><em>Al-Asaalah</em></strong>, Issue #4]
<p>Footnotes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Translator&#8217;s Note: A <em>shaadh </em>hadeeth is a hadeeth reported by a reliable narrator, which contradicts (the report of) a narrator that is more trustworthy than him.</li>
