				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is correct that the one who intentionally abandons the prayer is a disbeliever and that his fast, as well as other acts of worship, are not correct (i.e., accepted) until he repents to Allah (Exalted is He), due to the saying of Allah, Mighty and Majestic:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُوا لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;But if they associated partners [with Allah], all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them.&#8221; </strong><em>(Surah Al-An&#8217;am, 6:88)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Additionally, the meaning of this Ayah is supported by numerous other Ayat and Ahadith which indicate that the actions (i.e., worship) of the one that abandons the prayer are fruitless. Some of Ahlul-&#8216;Ilm (the People of Knowledge) took the view that the one who acknowledges the obligation of the prayer, but leaves it off due to laziness and carelessness, then his fast and other acts of worship are not in vain (i.e., they consider him to be a Muslim). However, the first position is correct &#8211; the one who intentionally abandons the prayer is a disbeliever, even if he acknowledges its obligation, due to the numerous evidences for this position. From these evidences, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><strong>&#8220;Verily between a man and between shirk (polytheism) and kufr (disbelief) is the abandonment of the prayer.&#8221; </strong><em>(Sahih Muslim no.82)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">and he ﷺ also said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px"><b>&#8220;The covenant between us and between them (the disbelievers) is the prayer, so whoever abandons it has disbelieved.&#8221; </b><em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi no.1621, Sunan ibn Majah no.1079, Sunan An-Nasa&#8217;i no.464, Musnad Imam Ahmad 5:346)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This hadith has been narrated by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa&#8217;i, At-Tirmidhi and ibn Majah through the path of Buraydah bin Al-Husayb Aslami (may Allah be pleased with him) with a sahih sanad (authentic chain of narration).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from ‘Ahkam wa Masa’il Ramadan’ (p.51,52)</em></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>TN</strong>: Imam Al-Sabuni mentions, <strong>&#8220;And the Ahlul-Hadith differed over the Muslim that intentionally abandons the obligatory prayer, so Ahmad bin Hanbal and a group from the scholars of the Salaf (may Allah have mercy upon them) made takfir of him on account of that, and removed him from Islam, due to the authentic narration: &#8216;Between the slave and between Ash-Shirk is the abandonment of the prayer.&#8217; And the way Ash-Shafi&#8217;i, his companions, and another group from the scholars of the Salaf took is that he has not disbelieved (major disbelief), as long as he continues to believe in its obligation.&#8221; </strong><em>(Aqidatus Salaf wa Ashabul Hadith p.279, Dar Al-&#8216;Asimah edn.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Shaykh ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;Verily he does not disbelieve except by abandoning the prayer permanently, meaning he has settled himself upon the abandonment of the prayer, so he does not pray Dhuhr, nor &#8216;Asr, nor Maghrib, nor &#8216;Isha, nor Fajr, then this is the one who has disbelieved. So if he prays one or two of the obligatory prayers, then he has not disbelieved, because this is not the one who has abandoned the prayer, and surely the Prophet ﷺ said, &#8216;Between a man and between Ash-Shirk and Al-Kufr is the abandonment of the prayer&#8217; and he did not say: &#8216;abandonment of a prayer.'&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sharh Al-Mumti&#8217; 2:27, Dar ibn Al-Jawzi edn.) </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Regardless, those that abandon a single prayer should be aware that they have fallen into a grave matter, Imam Adh-Dhahabi narrates that Ibn Hazm said, <strong>&#8220;There is no sin, after Shirk, more severe than abandoning the Prayer until its time ends and killing a Muslim unjustly.&#8221; </strong><em>(Kitab Al-Kaba&#8217;ir p.91, Dar Al-Mirath An-Nabawi edn.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And Allah surely knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muḥammad ʿUzayr Shams in his introduction to the verification and checking of <em>Ghayatul Maqṣad Fī Zawā’īd Musnad al-Imā</em><em>m Aḥmad</em> by Shaykh Irshād ul-Ḥaq al-Atharī, wrote concerning the efforts of the Subcontinent scholars, their works and efforts on the Musnad of Imām Aḥmad. This was authored on the 9/1/1435H from pages <strong>ز</strong> to <strong>ف</strong> compromising 11 pages <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. Thinking of the benefits, I summarised the main points and omitted parts unrelated to the Ahl ul-Ḥadīth scholars. I also added relevant annotations where necessary and I will, In-Shāʾ-Allāh continue to develop this writing as time progresses. Any additional words by myself to the writing of Shaykh ʿUzayr Shams have been designated with parenthesis [xxx], for example, dates when scholars died or complete titles of book. Any further annotations by me are clearly demarcated with my name in parenthesis [Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī xxx]. As updates continue, the annotations will continue at the end of this writing. Finally, where possible and available, I have added relevant photos.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the scholars of the Subcontinent who first transmitted the Musnad of Imam Aḥmad </span><span style="color: #000000;">and expounded its importance, was Shaykh Shāh Walīullāh al-Dehlawī (d.1176H) and he transmitted it through his chain. (<em>Ittihaf an-Nabiyyah</em>, 188-190, translated to Arabic by Shaykh Muḥammad ʿUzayr Shams (Lahore: al-Maktabah as-Salafiyyah, 1424)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Nawāb Ṣiddīq Ḥasan Khān (d.1307H) discussed the Musnad in his book <em>al-Ḥiṭṭah Fī Zikr as-Ṣiḥāh as-Sittah, </em>402-409 (Beirut: Dār al-Jīl, 1408H). This book was first published in 1283H. He discussed the importance of the Musnad, the number of Ḥadīth therein, the Thulāthiyāt in it, the reports added by his son, ʿAbd Allāh, its refinement and arrangement.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Mubārakpurī (d.1353H) talked about it in his <em>Muqaddimah Tuḥfatul Aḥwadhī</em>, 88-91 (India: 1359H) while relying on the books of Shaykh Shāh ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz and Shaykh Nawāb Ṣiddīq Ḥasan Khān as well as other books on Ḥadīth and Rijāl which discussed the Musnad, its conditions, it’s status amongst the books of Sunnah and the status of its aḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><img class=" wp-image-9029 alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hittah-1.png?resize=142%2C210" alt="hittah 1" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hittah-1.png?resize=203%2C300 203w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hittah-1.png?w=430 430w" sizes="(max-width: 142px) 100vw, 142px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muḥammad ʿAtāʾullāh Ḥanīf al-Bhojiyānī [d.1407H] made academic discussion in Urdu in attributing the Musnad to Imām Aḥmad, while refuting the enquiries of Tamanna al-ʿAmadī. This was published in the <em>al-ʿItiṣām</em> magazine published in Lahore, volume 7 issue number 28 in 1956, 55-63 and it was reprinted in 2010, 173-199. Shaykh al-Bhojiyānī was preceded by Shaykh al-Albānī (d.1420H) in his book, <em>al-Dhab al-Aḥmad ʿAnn Musnad al-Imām Aḥmad</em>, in which he refuted the queries of Ustādh ʿAbd al-Quddūs al-Hāshimi, where he questioned the attribution of the Musnad to Imām Aḥmad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ʿAbd ar-Raūf Ẓafar wrote about the Musnad of Imām Aḥmad in Urdu book, <em>ʿUlūm al-Ḥadīth – An Academic, Intellectual and Historical Analysis’</em>, 402-411. (Lahore: Nashriyāt, 2006)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Zubayr ʿAlī Zaʾī [d.1435H] wrote a paper on the status of Imām Aḥmad according to the Scholars of Ḥadīth, meaning the Muḥaddithīn and defended the Musnad. Refer to his <em>Maqalāt</em>, 1:339-403. (Lahore: [Maktabah Islāmiyyah] 2010).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī: This has been translated into English and will be published in due course, In-Shāʾ-Allāh]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><img class=" wp-image-9027 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mishkat.jpeg?resize=132%2C201" alt="mishkat" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mishkat.jpeg?resize=197%2C300 197w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mishkat.jpeg?w=592 592w" sizes="(max-width: 132px) 100vw, 132px" data-recalc-dims="1" />ʿAbd al-Ḥakīm al-Naṣīrābādī (d.1337H) arranged the Aḥadīth in the Musnad according to the chapters in <em>Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī</em> in 7 volumes. Then the aḥadīth in it were referenced by al-Muḥaddith ash-Shaykh Aḥmad Ḥasan ad-Dehlawī (d.1338H), who was the author of <em>Tanqīh al-Ruwāh Fī Takhrīj Āḥadīth al-Mishkāt</em>. Then Shaykh Abū Saʿīd Sharf ud-Dīn ad-Dehlawī (d.1381H) began penning an explanation of it and annotations which was to be printed through Jamʿiyyah Ahl ul-Ḥadīth of Delhi. The first 56 pages were printed in 1936CE when the printing began but this stopped for unknown reasons, neither do we know where the manuscript is, while it has been said, it is in a private library in Delhi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Khālid as-Salafī authored <em>Tahdhīb al-Musnad</em> in 6 volumes and his methodology was to organize the name of the Companions from the various Masānīd in the Musnad alphabetically and then list all the Ḥadīth of a Companion through his chains and words in one place. He also collated and differentiated between the Masānīd of Companion whose narrations would be mention in the Musnad of another Companion. He also organized the aḥadīth of the Musnad of a Companion under chapter headings. Indeed, the author exerted great effort in organizing and adding chapters in this work on the Musnad. He compiled this work by changing the photocopied edition of the Musnad published by al-Maymaniyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Khālid as-Salafī also authored, <em>Miftāh al-Musnad</em>, which was printed in Pakistan in one volume of 653 pages. It is essentially an index of the Aḥadīth in the Musnad organized under chapter headings. This is then followed by the name of every Companion who narrated something concerning the said chapter, while cross referencing all the places the ḥadīth has been transmitted in the Musnad and in the <em>Tahdhīb Musnad</em> (of the same author). This index is very beneficial as it saves a lot of time trying to find aḥadīth with specific words or similar narrations in the Musnad which may have differing words. I have not found an index book like this that with any edition of the Musnad and therefore it should be reprinted in the Arab countries so that the students of hadith can benefit from it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><img class=" wp-image-9032 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/manhaj-asad-cov.png?resize=150%2C190" alt="manhaj as'ad cov" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/manhaj-asad-cov.png?resize=236%2C300 236w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/manhaj-asad-cov.png?w=716 716w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Then Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh Nāṣir ʿAbd al-Rashīd al-Reḥmānī indexed the ḥadīth in the Musnad and he called it, <em>al-Manhaj al-Asʿad Fī Tartīb Āḥadīth Musnad al-Imām Aḥmad</em>. This was printed in 1411H by Dār Ṭaybah, Riyadh in 4 volumes. The author categorized his work into 3 categories,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>First:</strong> Aḥadīth that were statements of the Messenger of Allāḥ Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam which he organized alphabetically.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Second:</strong> Aḥadīth associated with a statement for example the aḥadith which mention the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam commanded us or he forbade us from, or if something was unlawful, cursed or a covenant or a concession, or a promise or information, of attributes or characteristics, or a prohibition and other similar things. So, such aḥadīth were mentioned that first talked about a command, then a prohibition and so on.</span><span style="color: #000000;"><img class=" wp-image-9031 alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/manhaj-al-asad-vol.png?resize=95%2C190" alt="manhaj al-as'ad vol" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/manhaj-al-asad-vol.png?resize=150%2C300 150w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/manhaj-al-asad-vol.png?resize=512%2C1024 512w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/manhaj-al-asad-vol.png?w=570 570w" sizes="(max-width: 95px) 100vw, 95px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Third:</strong> Are the aḥadīth related to actions, in which the Companions mentioned the actions of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. These are organized first on the Masānid of the Companions and then on subject matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><img class=" wp-image-9048 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cover-Musnad-AhmadShaker.jpg?resize=132%2C194" alt="Cover Musnad Ahmad(Shaker)" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cover-Musnad-AhmadShaker.jpg?resize=204%2C300 204w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cover-Musnad-AhmadShaker.jpg?resize=768%2C1128 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cover-Musnad-AhmadShaker.jpg?resize=697%2C1024 697w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cover-Musnad-AhmadShaker.jpg?w=1089 1089w" sizes="(max-width: 132px) 100vw, 132px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><span style="color: #000000;">There are cross references to the Maymuniyyah edition by volume and </span><span style="color: #000000;">page number, to the edition of ʿAllāmah Aḥmad Muḥammad Shākir [d.1377H] and to the edition of <em>al-Fatḥ ar-Rabbānī</em> of [Aḥmad ʿAbd </span><span style="color: #000000;">ur-Raḥmān Bannāʾ] al-Sāʿātī [d.1378H].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first thing printed of the Musnad was from India, a small part with medium sized letters in 280 pages. It was printed by al-Matbaʿa al-Ḥaydiriyyah in Bombay in 1308H from the first book to the Musnad of Sa’īd b. Zayd b. ʿAmr b. Nafil just like the al-Maymuniyyah edition which was 190 pages and was printed in 1313H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Darussalam in Lahore reprinted the Musnad with grading of the ahadith which were summarized. Shaykh Khubayb Aḥmad worked on this, who is a close student of Shaykh Irshād ul-Ḥaq al-Atharī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Idārah Anṣār as-Sunnah who are based in Lahore, translated the <em>al-Fatḥ ar-Rabbānī</em> in Urdu under the supervision of Shaykh ʿAbd us-Sattār Ḥammād.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The book, <em>al-Ikmāl Fī Zikr Man Lahu Riwāyah Fī Musnad Aḥmad Min ar-Rijāl Siwa Min Zukira Fī Tahdhīb al-Kamāl</em> of Ibn Ḥamza al-Ḥussaynī (d.765H) which was checked by al-Ustādh ʿAbd Allāh Sarwar and printed in Riyadh in 1412H. Shaykh Fayḍh al-Raḥmān al-Thawrī [d.1417H] also added some beneficial notes to this book and its manuscript is in Jalālpūr (Pakistan).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The book, Khaṣāʾiṣ al-Musnad of Abū Mūsā al-Madīnī (d.581H) which was published by al-ʿAllāmah Muḥammad Shākir in his introduction of the Musnad. This was reprinted with the checking of the two Ustādhs ʿAbd ar-Raūf Ẓafar and Nighat Ḥashimī which was printed in Bhawalpūr (Pakistan) in 2000CE.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book, <em>Ghāyatul Maqṣad</em> <em>Fī Zawāʾid al-Musnad</em> of al-Haithamī [d.807H] was printed by Shaykh Irshād al-Ḥaq al-Athari.</span></p>

The <em>Ghāyatul Maqṣad</em> are Zawāʾid, or narrations that are in Musnad Aḥmad but </span><span style="color: #000080;">not in the 6 canonical books of Ḥadīth. The <em>Ghāyatul Maqṣad</em> of Imām al-Haythamī therefore essentially form a portion of his <em>Majmaʿ az-Zawāʾid</em> which was at the behest and instructions of his teacher, Shaykh Zayn ud-Dīn al-ʿIrāqī (d.806H).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The <em>Ghāyatul Maqṣad</em> <em>Fī Zawāʾid al-Musnad al-Imām Aḥmad </em>was checked and annotated by Shaykh Irshād ul-Ḥaq al-Atharī and this is yet another remarkable checking of the Shaykh, who has already checked works like, <em>Musnad Abū Yaʿlā</em>, <em>Muʿajam Abū Yaʿlā</em>, <em>Musnad as-Sirāj</em>, <em>al-ʿIllal al-Mutanhiyyah </em>of Ḥafiẓ Ibn al-Jawzī and many more. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Shaykh ʿAbd al-Ḥaq al-Ḥashimī also devoted great time and effort to the Musnad of Imam Ahmad and he authored no less than three detailed works on it, <em>Sharḥ Musnad al-Imām Aḥmad</em>, <em>Fahrisah Musnad al-Imām Aḥmad</em> and <em>Tarājim Rijāl Musnad Aḥmad</em>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of Abu Hurairah RadiAllahu Anhu the Messenger of Allah Sallalalhu alayhi Wasallam said, <em>&#8220;Whenever one of you performs wudu for Salah, he should not do tashbik with his fingers (after he has completed the wudu)</em> (al-Sahihah no.1294, transmitted Tabarani in al-Awsth (1:4-5).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tashbik is interlocking the fingers of both hands, ie putting the fingers on one hand into the fingers of the other hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith as narrated by Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri RadiAllahu Anhu said, <em>&#8220;When one of you is in the masjid, do not do tashbik for verily tashbik is from the Shaytan.&#8221;</em> (Musnad Ahmad (3:43).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Isma’ll b. Umayyah said, <em>“I asked about a man who intertwines his fingers while he is engaged in prayer. He said that Ibn ‘Umar had said: This is the prayer of those who earn the anger of Allah.”</em> (Abu Dawud no.993) Shaikh al-Albani graded its chain to be authentic (Irwa 2:103)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Thumamah al-Hannat said that Ka&#8217;b ibn Ujrah met him while he was going to the mosque; one of the two (companions) met his companion (on his way to the mosque) And he met crossing the fingers of my both hands. He prohibited me to do so, and said: The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said: If any of you performs ablution, and performs his ablution perfectly, and then goes out intending for the mosque, he should not cross the fingers of his hand because he is already in prayer. (Abu Dawud (no.562), Sahih Abi Dawud (1:168 no.562), Ibn Majah (no.967)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari established the following chapter heading in his Sahih, <strong>“Chapter on interlocking the fingers in the Masjid and elsewhere” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then brings a hadith from either Abdullah ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) or Abdullah ibn Amr bin Aas (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) interlocked his fingers. (Bukhari no’s 478-479)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the following hadith the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said to Abdullah Ibn Amr al-Aas (RadhiAllahu Anhu), <em>&#8220;O Abdullah bin Amr! What will be your condition when you will be left with the of (worst) people?&#8221; (and he indicated by interlocking the fingers of his two hands). </em>(Bukhari no.480)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of Abu Musa al-Ash’ari (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who narrates the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “<em>A faithful believer to a faithful believer is like the bricks of a wall, enforcing each other.&#8221; While (saying that) the Prophet (</em><em>ﷺ</em><em>) clasped his hands, by interlocking his fingers.” </em>(Bukhari no.481)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith in this regard is the long hadith of Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu about the story of Dhul Yadayn, it mentions the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, <em>“went and stood by a piece of wood that was set up in the masjid, and leaned against it as if he was angry, and he placed his right hand on his left and interlocked his fingers…”</em> (Bukhari no.482, Muslim no.573)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari brings this ahadith to show the permissibility of clasping the hands and interlocking the the fingers. The prohibition is because this is ie interlocking of the fingers a futile and useless act. However, there is no harm if there is a specific reason for a person to do this as in the hadith above the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) used the interlocking of his fingers to illustrate or explain a particular point.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr has explained despite one of the narration being in note form, Ibrahim Harbi has cited a continuous chain for it in his Gharib al-Hadith. Imam Bukhari’s intent in establishing this chapter heading is to elucidate and show the permissibility of clasping the hands and interlocking the fingers. As for the ahadith which mention prohibition of interlocking the fingers they are specific and in relation to the prayer or whilst preparing for the prayer and or most of them are not even authentic. (Fath al-Bari (1:565)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr further said whilst reconciling between these ahadith, the ones cited above and the ones that mention the prohibition, that <em>“al-Isma’ili reconciled between them by noting that the prohibition is limited to when one is in prayer or is intending to pray, because the one who is waiting for the prayer comes under the same ruling as one who is praying… Then al-Haafiz said: The report which says that this is forbidden so long as one is in the mosque is da’eef (weak) as we have stated above.” </em>(Fath al-Bari (1:565)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people whilst in a state of prayer may interlock their fingers in an attempt to crack them. This is unnecessary movement and a distraction from concentrating on the prayer. It was narrated by Shu’bah that he said, <em>“I prayed beside Ibn Abbas and cracked my fingers. When the prayer finished, he said, “May your mother lose you! You crack your fingers when you are in prayer?” </em>(Ibn Abi Shaybah (2:344). Shaikh al-Albani said in Irwa al-Ghalil (2:99), its chain is Hasan.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is another report in which is very weak according to Shaikh al-Albani in Ibn Majah (no.965) that Ali (RadhiAllahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, <em>“</em><em>Do not crack your fingers during the prayer.”</em> (Irwa ul-Ghalil (2:99 no.367) al-Bawsiri declared a narrator in the chain to weak. (al-Zawa’id (1:63). Shaikh al-Albani follows this with another narration from Mu’adh bin Anas (Ahmad (3:438), Daraqutni (no.64), Baihaqi (2:289) who said one of the narrators was not strong.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams ul-Haq Azimabadi also offers similar explanations and alludes to the fact that there are no contradictions in the aforementioned narrations. He cites further ahadith from Ibn Hibban in the prohibition of interlocking the fingers whilst on the way to the masjid to prayer. He also cites a narration from Hakim from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) when one of you performs wudu in his house and then he comes to the masjid, he is in a state of prayer up until he returns and he should not interlock his fingers. Hakim said the hadith is authentic on the conditions of the two Shaikhs. He goes onto cite another narration from Ibn Abi Shaybah’s Musannaf, that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said when one of you prays, he should not interlock his fingers for verily interlocking the fingers is from Shaytan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams ul-Haq goes onto say The Hadith of Ka’b has been authenticated by Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibban and that some scholars have differed over the authenticity of its chains and have thus rendered it to be weak. They (the scholars of hadith) have said there is no contradiction between these ahadith. They are understood to mean that a person is not to interlock their fingers after wudu and whilst on their way to the masjid to pray or whilst praying. The hadith of Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) in Sahih al-Bukhari refers to after the prayer and not during the prayer or from the time leading to the prayer. He then goes onto to cite the view of Ibn al-Munir, al-Ayni and al-Khattabi. (Au’n al-Ma’bud Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud (2:188-190 no.558) </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AN ABANDONED <em>SUNNAH</em> THAT MUST BE REVIVED</span><sup>1</sup></strong></h4>
<p>There are many authentic <em>ahaadeeth</em> from the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em> concerned with the command to straighten the rows (for congregational prayer), so this is rarely hidden from any of the students of (Islamic) knowledge let alone their teachers. However it remains unknown to many that straightening the rows requires straightening it with the feet, not just the shoulders. Indeed we have often heard some of the Imams of the <em>Masaajid</em> (Mosques) pointing out &#8211; when ordering the people to straighten the rows &#8211; that the <em>Sunnah</em> is to do so with the shoulders to the exclusion of the feet! Since this is contrary to what is established in the authentic <em>Sunnah</em>, I thought it necessary to mention some <em>ahaadeeth</em> that exist on this topic, as a reminder for whoever wishes to act in accordance with the authentic <em>Sunnah</em>, not being deceived by the widespread customs and habits present in the <em>&#8216;Ummah</em>.</p>
<p>There are two authentic <em>ahaadeeth</em> on this topic: The first is the <em>hadith</em> reported by &#8216;Anas, and the second is that reported by an-Nu&#8217;maan ibn Bashir, <em>may Allah be pleased with them both</em>.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Hadeeth of ‘Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him)</u></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As for the <em>hadith</em> of &#8216;Anas, then it as follows; The <em>hadith</em> of &#8216;Anas ibn Malik. [The Prophet <em>ﷺ</em> said:]
<p><em>&#8220;Straighten your rows and come close together, for indeed I see you behind my back&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>The hadith is reported by al-Bukhaari (2/176 &#8211; <em>al-Fath</em>, <em>Boolaaq</em> edition), Ahmad (3/182 and 263), and al-Mukhallis in <em>al-Fawaa&#8217;id</em> [1/10/2], all of them reporting via a number of transmission paths (<em>turuq</em> sing. <em>tareeq</em>) from Humayd at-Taweel who said &#8216;Anas ibn Maalik narrated to us saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;The call for commencing of <em>salaah</em> was made, the Messenger of Allah <em>ﷺ</em> turned to us and said&#8230;&#8221; (then he mentions the above <em>hadith</em>).</p>
<p>Al-Bukhaari adds in one narration of this <em>hadith</em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;(He turned to us and said) before pronouncing the opening <em>takbir</em>&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Also adding at the end</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;&#8230; each of us would adjoin his shoulder with that of his companion (standing next to him) and his foot with that of his companion.&#8221;</p>
<p>This addition also occurs in the report of al-Mukhallis and Ibn Abi Shaybah [1/351] with the following wording: &#8216;Anas said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;&#8230; so I saw each of us adjoining our shoulder with those of our companions and also (adjoining) our feet with those of our companions, but if you were to practice this today, a person would flee (from you) like a restless mule.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its chain of narration (<em>sanad</em>) is also <em>sahih</em> according to the conditions stipulated by the Two Shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim).</p>
<p><em>Al-Haafidh</em> (Ibn Hajr) ascribed this wording to Sa&#8217;eed ibn Mansoor and al-Isma&#8217;eelee. Al-Bukhari gave a chapter heading for this <em>hadith</em> by saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Chapter: Adjoining the shoulder with the shoulder and the foot with the foot in the row (for prayer).&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><u>The Hadeeth of an-Nu’maan ibn Basheer (may Allah be pleased with him)</u></strong></p>
<p>As for the <em>hadith</em> of an-Nu&#8217;maan (ibn Basheer) then it is as follows:</p>
<p>The <em>hadith</em> of an-Nu&#8217;man ibn Basheer. [The Prophet <em>ﷺ</em> said:]
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Straighten your rows (he said it three times), by Allah either you straighten your rows or Allah will cause conflict between your hearts.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The <em>hadith</em> has been selected by Abu Dawood [no. 662], Ibn Hibban [no. 396], Ahmad [4/276] and ad-Doolaabi in <em>al-Kunaa</em> [2/86] from Abul-Qasim al-Jadalee Husayn ibnil Haarith who said; I heard an-Nu&#8217;man ibn Basheer say:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allah<em> ﷺ</em> turned to us and said &#8230;&#8221; (then he mentioned the above <em>hadith</em>).</p>
<p>Then an-Nu&#8217;man ibn Basheer added:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;&#8230; so I saw each man joining his shoulder; knee and ankle with that of his companion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <em>sanad</em> of this <em>hadith</em> is <em>sahih</em>, al-Bukhaari quoted it in discontinuous (<em>mu&#8217;allaq</em>) form in a decided manner (indicating that he considered it authentic). Ibn Khuzaymah also connected its chain of narration in his <em>sahih</em> [1/82,83] and al-Mundhiree [<em>at-Targheeb</em> 1/176] and al-Haafidh [<em>al-Fath</em> 2/176] both confirmed this. Ibn Hibbaan selected the <em>hadith</em> in his <em>Sahih</em> [14/396 &#8211; Mawaarid] reporting through the <em>tareeq</em> of Ibn Khuzaymah.</p>
<p>The text of the <em>hadith</em> is also reported by ad-Doolaabi by way of Baqeeyah ibnil Waleed who said: &#8220;Hurayz narrated to us saying: I heard Ghaylaan al-Muqri&#8217; narrate from Abee Qutaylah Marthad ibn Wadaa&#8217;ah (who said: I heard) an-Nu&#8217;man ibn Basheer say &#8230;&#8221;, (then he mentioned the <em>hadith</em>).</p>
<p>There is no problem with the sanad for the purpose of supporting reports (<em>mutaab&#8217;aat</em>), its reporters are reliable apart from Ghaylaan al-Muqri&#8217; . Perhaps he is Ghaylaan ibn &#8216;Anas al-Kalbee (their <em>mawlaa</em>) ad-Dimishqee. If that is the case then his condition (as a reporter) is unknown. A group of the reporters have narrated from him and <em>Al-Haafidh</em> (Ibn Hajr) said about him: &#8220;He is acceptable (<em>maqbool</em>).&#8221; Then it became clear that identifying this reporter in the <em>sanad</em> as al-Muqri&#8217; was a mistake, as al-Bukhaari and ibn Hibbaan had said, and that in fact he is Ghaylaan ibn Ma&#8217;shar al-Muqraa&#8217;ee [<em>Lubab</em> 3/237]. Ibn Abi Haatim [7/53] has given a biography for him, mentioning that a number of people have reported from him, and Ibn Hibbaan [5/290] declared him reliable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE <em>FIQH</em> OF THESE <em>AHADITH</em></strong></p>
<p>In these two <em>ahaadeeth</em> there are a number of important points of benefit and <em>fiqh</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>The obligation to straighten the rows for <em>salaah</em>and to stand close together in them, due to the command mentioned in the <em>ahaadeeth</em>. The rule concerning such commands is that they constitute an obligation (<em>wujoob</em>) except if accompanying evidence (<em>qareenah</em>) proves otherwise as is well established in the science of <em>fiqh</em> The <em>qareenah</em> here in fact emphasizes the obligation, and that is in the saying of the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>, <em>&#8221; &#8230; or Allah will cause conflict between your hearts&#8221;</em>, since such a warning is never given for leaving that which is not obligatory as is quite clear.<sup>2</sup></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>The forming and straightening of the rows mentioned in the <em>hadith</em>is only achieved by joining the shoulder and the side of ones foot with the shoulder and foot of the adjacent person. This is because that is what the Companions, <em>radiallahu &#8216;anhum</em>, did when ordered to straighten the rows and stand close together in them. Hence <em>Al-Haafidh</em> (Ibn Hajar) said in <em>al-Fath</em> after mentioning the additional saying of &#8216;Anas in the first <em>hadith</em> that I have quoted above:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">&#8220;This (wording) is an explicit explanation that the mentioned action (of the Companions) was done in the time of the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>. With this in mind the usage of this action as a pretext for explaining what straightening the row means becomes complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is regrettable that many Muslims have neglected this <em>Sunnah</em> of straightening the row, or rather they have lost it altogether, except for a few of them. For I have not seen this practiced by any group amongst them except <em>Ahlul-Hadith</em> (the People of the <em>Hadith</em>). I saw them in Makkah in the year 1368H enthusiastic and concerned with adhering to the <em>Sunnah</em> as with other <em>Sunan</em> of <em>al-Mustafah</em> (Muhammad the Messenger of Allah) <em>ﷺ</em><em>.</em> This contrary to others from the followers of the <em>madhaahib</em> &#8211; and I do not exclude the <em>Hanaabilah</em> (Hanbalis), for this <em>Sunnah</em> has become utterly forgotten amongst them. In fact they have consecutively abandoned and turned away from it. This is because most of their <em>madhaahib</em> state that the <em>Sunnah</em> in this regard is that a space of four fingers width should be kept between ones feet, and more than this is disliked, as is detailed in <em>al-Fiqh &#8216;alal-Madhaahib al-Arba&#8217;ah</em> [1/207].</p>
<p>This spacing has no foundation in the <em>Sunnah</em>; rather it is based on mere opinion. If it were correct then it would be necessary to restrict this practice to the <em>Imam</em> and the one praying on his own so that the authentic <em>Sunnah</em> (of standing close in the row) would not be opposed with this practice, as the fundamental principles of <em>fiqh</em> (<em>al-Qawaa&#8217;id al-&#8216;Usooleeyyah</em>) necessitate.</p>
<p>In short I appeal to the Muslims &#8211; especially the Imaams of the <em>Masaajid</em>, those who are concerned to follow the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>, and to acquire the virtue of reviving his <em>Sunnah</em>, I appeal to them to act by this <em>Sunnah</em>, have concern for it, and call the people to it until they unify upon it, and by what they will be saved from that warning <em>&#8221; … or Allah will cause conflict between your hearts.&#8221;</em><sup>3</sup></p>
<p>I add in this addition<sup>4</sup> (of my book): It has reached from one of the callers to Islam (<em>du&#8217;aat</em>) that he belittles the status of the <em>Sunnah</em> that the Companions practiced, and which they did so with approval of the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>. He insinuates that the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em> did not teach them this practice. So he has not realized &#8211; <em>and Allah knows best</em> &#8211; that</p>
<ul>
<li>this was their understanding and that</li>
<li>the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>approved of their understanding and their practice. This is sufficient amongst <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> to affirm the legitimacy of this practice, because the witness sees what the absent does not, and the Companions are people whose followers will never be wretched (unsuccessful).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>In the first <em>hadith</em>there is an affirmation of a clear miracle (<em>mu&#8217;jizah</em>) given to the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>, and that was his ability to see behind him without turning his head. However it should be known that this was exclusively for the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em> when he was in <em>Salah</em> since nothing exists in the <em>Sunnah</em> that states that he used to see behind him without turning his head outside the <em>Salah</em>. <em>And Allah knows best</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">(i) this was their understanding and that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">(ii) the Prophet <em>ﷺ</em>approved of their understanding and their practice. This is sufficient amongst <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> to affirm the legitimacy of this practice, because the witness sees what the absent does not, and the Companions are people whose followers will never be wretched (unsuccessful).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>In the two <em>ahaadeeth</em>there is a clear proof for something that many people do not know about, although it has become recognized in the field of psychology, and that is the fact that outer (apparent) evil and corruption affects inner evil and corruption and vice versa. There are many <em>ahaadeeth</em> about this; perhaps we will undertake the task of gathering and referencing them at some later opportunity if Allah, <em>The Most High</em>, wishes.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>The entering of the <em>Imaam</em>into the opening <em>takbeer</em> for prayer when the <em>mu&#8217;adhin</em> says <em>&#8216;The Prayer is about to start,&#8217;</em> (“…qad qaamatis salaah…”) is an innovation in the religion (<em>bid&#8217;ah</em>) due to its contradicting the authentic <em>Sunnah</em>, as these <em>ahaadeeth</em> prove &#8211; especially the first one. The <em>ahaadeeth</em> show us that after the <em>iqamah</em> has been called there is a duty upon the Imam which he must fulfil, and that is commanding the people to straighten the rows, reminding them of that, for he is responsible for them and will be asked. <em>“&#8230; And all of you are shepherds and all of you will be asked about your flock.&#8221;</em></li>

<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Translated from <em>Silsilah al-Ahadith as-Sahihah</em>of <em>Shaykh</em> Muhammad Nasir ud-Din al-Albaani, vol. 1, pp. 70-74, <em>hadith</em> 31 and 32</li>
<li><strong>TRANSLATORS NOTE</strong> ~ Standing close in the row, filling the gaps and straightening the line carries a great reward and virtue as well as being obligatory. This is mentioned in a number of ahaadeeth, like the following: <em>&#8220;The best of you are those who stand with their shoulders closest </em>(to the one standing next to them)<em> in the salaah, and there is no step greater in reward than that taken by a man toward a gap in the row thus filling it.”</em>Reported by at-Tabaraanee in al-Awsat, refer to Saheeh at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb (1/200).<em>&#8220;Whoever fills a gap in the row, Allaah raises him up due to it a rank and builds a house for him in al-Jannah.”</em>Reported by at-Tabaraanee in al-Awsat and al-Asbahaanee in at-Targheeb, the hadeeth is Saheeh as occurs in Saheeh at-Targheeb (no.505).</li>
<li><strong>TRANSLATORS NOTE</strong> ~ There are a number of ahaadeeth that explain the virtue of reviving the Sunnah and calling the people to guidance and righteousness. For example the Prophet (ﷺ) said: <em>“Whoever calls to guidance will have the same reward as all those who follow him in that guidance but this will not take anything away from their reward. Whoever calls to untruth will carry the same sin as the sins of all those who follow him in that, but that will not take anything away from their sins.”</em>Reported by Ahmad in his Musnad, Muslim in his Saheeh and others.</li>
