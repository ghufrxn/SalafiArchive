<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>READ PREVIOUS PART  &#8211;</strong> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-36-fact-not-fiction-the-mawlid-was-not-celebrated-by-the-salaf-us-saleh-a-reply-to-the-barelwi-asrar-rashid/">The Mawlid Papers – Part 36 – Fact not Fiction: The Mawlid Was Not Celebrated by the Salaf us-Saleh; A Reply to the Barelwi Asrar Rashid</a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bukhīt al-Mutī‘ī Al-Hanafī the Qadī of Alexandria (Egypt) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When Umar bin Al-Hasan famously known as Abū Khattāb bin Dahiyyah whilst on his travels to Khurasān in 604H visited Irbil he saw the the kind Malik Mu&#8217;azam Muzaffar Al-Dīn bin Zain Al-Dīn was liked the Mawlid Al-Nabi. So with the intention of pleasing the king he authored a book called &#8216;al-Tanwīr Fī Mawlid Al-Sirāj Al-Munīr&#8217; which he read to the King himself. When he authored the book, Malik Mu&#8217;azam gave him 1000 Dinars.&#8221;</em> [Ahsan Al-Kalām Fimā Yata‘laq Bil-Sunnah Wa&#8217;l Bid‘ah Minal Ahkām [pp.70]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Sufi authored a book whilst hiding the truth and cloaking it with futile interpretations in establishing and the virtue of the Mawlid. He called it <em>&#8220;Al-Tanwīr Fi Mawlid Al-Bashir an-Nazir&#8221;</em> and eventually received 1000 dinars. Refer to Al-Bidāyah wan Nihāyah (13:124), Al-Hawī lil-Fatâwa (1:189), Wafyat al-A&#8217;yān (4:119). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The sufi&#8217;s full name was Umar bin Al-Hasan Abu Khatāb Dahiyyah Andalusī. As for his affair Imām Dhahabī said about him, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He is accused of lying even in the things he copies.&#8221; </em>(Mīzān (3:186)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Dhiya al-Maqdisi said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I did not like his affair in that he would tarnish the Imāms and then Ibrahim Sanhawari  informed that the scholars of Maghrib wrote concerning him in that they criticised and weakened him.&#8221;</em> [Mizān [3:186] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Najjār said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I saw that the people were united and agreed on him being a liar and weak, likewise and similarly his claim t<span style="color: #000000;">he people he heard from when he never heard from them and those who he claimed to have met when he never met them.&#8221;</span></em> [Liīsān Al-Mizān [4:295]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was of the Zahiri madhab who would tarnish and degrade the honour of Imāms and Scholars of the Salaf, he had a vile tongue, he was a fool with utmost arrogance and very little insight in the affairs of the Dīn and very lazy.&#8221;</em> [Līsān Al-Mizān [4:296]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some researchers have speculated his attribution to the Zahiri Madhab was due to his Andalusian roots, where the Zahiri Madhab featured prominently. They also said the Maliki&#8217;s at the time conformed to their roots and adhered to the thoughts of the school in Fiqh and otherwise. Likewise the concept of any offshoot from the norm in those days would be attributed to the Zahiri Madhab due to its approach of independent reasoning. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This does not however mean he was a propagator of the madhab. This is often the case, you will find ardent Sufi&#8217;s claiming to be Zahiri&#8217;s or an an attribution to the Zahiri Madhab because of their need to be free and independent of the legislated rulings, however this is a direct contradiction of the Zahiri Madhab, which is strict adherence and rigorously conform to the Divine Texts. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Suyūti said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Besides his knowledge and memory he was ver</span>y immature in citing texts. He would make bold audacious claims and would say &#8216;he narrated to us&#8217; in his ijazahs.&#8221;</em> [Tabaqāt al-Huffāz [pp.498]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Taqī al-Dīn Ahmad bin Alī al-Maqrizī [845H] said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Fatimid Khaliphs would celebrate a number of Eīds and other special days in a year. They would celebrate at the end of the year, at the beginning of the year, the day of Ashurah, the Milād (birthday) of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, the Milād of Alī bin Abī Tālib, the Mawlid of Hasan, the Mawlid of Hussain, the Mawlid of Fatimah and the Mawlid of the current ruler, the first night of Rajab, the night of the Middle of Rajab, the first night of Sha&#8217;bān, the night of the Middle of Sha&#8217;bān&#8230;&#8221;</em> [al-Muwā&#8217;iz wa&#8217;l Ei‘tibār Bi Zikr al-Khitat wa&#8217;l Athār [2:436]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Processions and other acts during the six Milād son different days. They were the Milād of the Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, Amīr al-Mu&#8217;minīn Alī bin Abi Tālib, the Mawlid of Fatimah Alayhis Salām, the Mawlid of Al-Hasan, the Mawlid of Al-Hussain Alayhuma Asalām  and the Mawlid of the current Khaliph.&#8221;</em> [al-Muwā&#8217;iz wa&#8217;l Ei‘tibār Bi Zikr al-Khitat wa&#8217;l Athār [2:333]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When the 12th of Rabī Al-Awwal would come they would prepare sweet dishes from 20 plates of sugar which would then be put on 300 silver plates and this would be the day of the Mawlid.&#8221;</em> [al-Muwā&#8217;iz wa&#8217;l Ei‘tibār Bi Zikr al-Khitat wa&#8217;l Athār [2:334]</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some brother, Muhmmad Moin has compiled a response to an article of Shaikh Zubair Ali Zai’ Rahimahullah on the narrator Mu’mall bin Isma’il. The article is titled ‘<strong>Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel: A look at the research of Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai regarding him,’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without going into the polemics of this ‘looking’ nor trying to address each and every point, I thought it would be somewhat beneficial to shed some light into this looking and the research presented. I do not have much time as I would have liked to address each and every point however this being said, in Sha Allah each and every point has been already addressed in other research, which will, by the permission of Allah be presented in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The brother begins by saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">“Some brother Raza Hassan has translated an urdu article by Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai proving Tawtheeq of Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel. I had read it in the book ‘Ilmi Maqalaat (1/417) by the author. After comparing the translation and the article present in Ilmi Maqalaat, it is clear to me that the brother has quoted it from the urdu Islamic magazine Al-Hadeeth vol.21. This same article was later published in ‘Ilmi Maqalaat (collection of Shaykh Zai’s articles) where he retracted a lot of things he claimed previously (this will be notified during the course of this writing). The title of the article is “Ithbat at-Ta’deel fi tautheeq Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Some people may think why Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel is so much discussed among hardcore muqallids and hardcore ghair-muqallid. There are two reasons for it, Muqallids call him Munkar ul-Hadith because (1) he is the narrator of the tradition which mentions that the Musalli should place his hands over his chest, (2) and he is the narrator of some criticisms of Sufyan Thauri against Abu Hanifa. These are the same two reasons why some harsh Ahle Hadith scholars made Tautheeq of Mu’ammal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai has special methodology of analyzing conflicting statements of Jarh and Ta’deel. He counts the number of criticism and praise, and rejects the minority based on majority. This seems good, but this was not the methodology of scholars of hadith, not even single of them. Rather they would prefer explained Jarh over general Tautheeq, and reject unexplained Jarh against established Ta’deel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">There are several problems with his methodology, and we shall see them during the course of this refutation, Insha Allah. After this brief introduction, let us proceed with the article by Shaykh Zai.-</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Let us examine some of these points. The reader should be aware that author or writer will always amend and change his works due to new information or understanding, this is well known amongst those who write, especially those who write and research issues pertaining to rijal and Jarh wa’t Ta’dil etc.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When this is the case Shaikh Zubair published the said article in his monthly journal, al-Hadith in February 2006 (issue no.21) and we also know the Tahqiqi Ilmi Maqalat volume 1 was printed in 2010, where the treatise is in (1:417-438), giving the Shaikh a total of 4 years to make any necessary changes, retractions and or clarifications if needed and this is not something which is defective, but rather something praiseworthy and highly encouraged as the truth is always beloved to us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair Ali also dates the article in the Ilmi Maqalat (1:438) as 14<sup>th</sup> Sha’ban 1427H which corresponds to September 2006, which therefore shows amendment after approximately 8 months and it appears this is the amended version that was included in the Ilmi Maqalat. Point being there were amendments in a period of 8 months where as 4 years is a very long time and highly likely and very plausible that contents of any article or book can change.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, in our rebuttal of Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmad’s critique of Shaikh al-Albani’s research on the hadith related to placing hands of the chest in his Sifah Salah, we compiled a response titled, <em>‘Answering the Lies on Imam al-Albani -The Issue of placing the hands on the Chest – al-Jawab ar-Rabbani Raf al-Kadhibah Anil Imam al-Albani’ </em>which can be accessed here</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.salafiri.com/answering-the-lies-on-imam-al-albani-the-issue-of-placing-the-hands-on-the-chest-al-jawab-ar-rabbani-raf-al-kadhibah-anil-imam-al-albani/">http://www.salafiri.com/answering-the-lies-on-imam-al-albani-the-issue-of-placing-the-hands-on-the-chest-al-jawab-ar-rabbani-raf-al-kadhibah-anil-imam-al-albani/</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In it, on p.19 we cite this research of Shaikh Zubair as,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“</em><em>Based upon and abridged from the treatise, ‘Ithbaat ut-Ta’deel Fee Tahqeeq Mu’ammal ibn Ismaa’eel’ (manuscript form) of Shaikh Zubair Alee Za’ee.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our rebuttal was published in January 2004, ie 2 years before it appeared in the al-Hadith monthly journal, Shaikh Zubair Rahimahullah provided this paper prior to 2006, which was in manuscript form. It was years later when it was finally published in the magazine and much later in the Ilmi Maqalat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point here is to illustrate the period when this treatise of Shaikh Zubair was first written to the time it was last published with any amendments. We have shown this period at the very least exceeds 6-7 years and also that it is very common and that any individual can appreciate the possibility and need for correction due to a plethora of reasons.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, the authors words,</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">“This same article was later published in ‘Ilmi Maqalaat (collection of Shaykh Zai’s articles) where he retracted a lot of things he claimed previously (this will be notified during the course of this writing)”</span> <span style="color: #000000;">have no relevance and should not be given any importance except but to understand the norm of changes over a period of time particularly when it is concerning such intricate sciences of hadith and mustalah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> We know as Muslims arrogance and pride are destructive traits which have been severely censured in the Prophetic Ahadith. Shaykh Zubair through his works has shown his retractions and clarifications on possible mistakes or errors he may have made and this is the true sign of scholarship, integrity and trustworthiness. This is not an ayb ie something bad or defective but rather something which should be respected, appreciated and praised.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author, Muhammad Moin, should have noticed on the very last page of the al-Hadith monthly journal (Issue no.21, p.25) and no doubt he would have observed this due to his admittance of referring back to the journal, that Shaykh Zubair has a subheading titled, <em>“Announcing a Retraction”</em> where the Shaykh mentions one of his books was composed for publication and after revising the book he graded a narration to be weak after having graded it Hasan in an earlier issue of the al-Hadith journal (Issue no.4 p.40). Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Therefore, I retract from my previous research and grading and May Allah forgive (me)”</em> (13-12-2005) (al-Hadith; Issue no.21, p.25).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This therefore, shows the Shaykhs methodology in referring and retracting back to the truth and this is the Asal of the Sunni, Salafi and Ahl al-Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author goes onto say,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">“Some people may think why Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel is so much discussed among hardcore muqallids and hardcore ghair-muqallid. There are two reasons for it, Muqallids call him Munkar ul-Hadith because (1) he is the narrator of the tradition which mentions that the Musalli should place his hands over his chest, (2) and he is the narrator of some criticisms of Sufyan Thauri against Abu Hanifa. These are the same two reasons why some harsh Ahle Hadith scholars made Tautheeq of Mu’ammal.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The terminology used is crass. obtuse and well lets just say following bandwagon trends, with the least of the issue being deplorable, grossly incorrect and outrageously divergent from the truth. It is enough to satisfy any reader that Mu’mmal bin Isma’il is a narrator of other ahadith in the various books of the Sunnah. In fact, Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i cites every hadith Mu’mmal narrates which shows the reality is totally different from the two reasons inappropriately cited above.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mu’ammal is a narrator of hadith and reports just as equal as other narrators and the Ahl al-Hadith Scholars most certainly do not have tahazzub or ta’assub for particular issues as the author asserts. The truth of the matter is that the very same scholars have defiantly repelled the staunch and bigoted blind imitation ie taqlid prevalent in common society and popular culture. There are a catalogue of incorrect notions and assertions juxtaposed in the authors words, one example being. “some harsh Ahle Hadith scholars…”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Zubayr also mentions the other books of hadith and their respective authors who used Mu’ammal ibn Isma’il as a narrator, like Bukhari no.2700, 7083, Tirmidhi no. 415, 672, 1822, 1948, 2145, 3266, 3525, 3906, 3949, Nasai in al-Sughra no.4097, 4589 and Ibn Majah no.2013, 2919, 3017. Bukhari using Mu’ammal holds great value and importance which is perhaps beyond the scope of this reply but in sha Allah it can be expounded upon later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author continues and says,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">“Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai has special methodology of analyzing conflicting statements of Jarh and Ta’deel. He counts the number of criticism and praise, and rejects the minority based on majority. This seems good, but this was not the methodology of scholars of hadith, not even single of them. Rather they would prefer explained Jarh over general Tautheeq, and reject unexplained Jarh against established Ta’deel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">There are several problems with his methodology, and we shall see them during the course of this refutation, Insha Allah. After this brief introduction, let us proceed with the article by Shaykh Zai.-“</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known to the beginner student of knowledge that an author is likely at times to use general or mujmal phrases with the mindset the reader is perhaps familiar with the sciences of hadith since he is reading such issues which revolve around these detailed sciences. It is also known to such elementary students that an author will also sometimes explain his general statements with a more detailed and comprehensive explanation whereas sometimes he will leave his statement general. So for a third party to clutch onto the general statements of an author and ignore his multitude of detailed statements, is in serious need of improvement to present such research.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It will also be very lengthy to present all of the detailed statements of Shaykh Zubair in this regard who emphatically holds on to and utilizes the methodology of the Scholars of Hadith in investigating, verifying and grading ahadith and he most certainly did not employ a new or special methodology as the author asserts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i says answering a question,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Authentic and weak narrations are of two types. The first type; narrations which are unanimously agreed upon in being authentic or weak.  Hafiz Abu Hatim al-Razi (d.277H) said, “And the agreement of the Ahl al-Hadith on something constitutes evidence.” (Kitab al-marasil p.192 no.703, under the entry of Muhammad bin Muslim al-Zuhri)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah al-Harrani (d.728H) said, “So when the people of jurisprudence unanimously agree on a statement then is not except but considered the truth and if the Ahl al-Hadith unanimously agree in the authentication of hadith then it is not considered except but the truth.” (Majmu’a Fatawa 1:9-10).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So we find accepting a hadith unanimously agreed upon is not an issue of ijtihad but rather the ijma is to be followed. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The Second type: The ahadith which are differed over, whether they are authentic or weak, then in such affairs giving precedence to the view of the majority is an issue of ijtihad. One must remember is incumbent to act upon whatever principle is adopted otherwise contradiction in statement and action is hypocritical. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Note Well (1): Taj al-Din Abdul Wahhab bin Ali al-Subki (d.771H) wrote, “So if the number of disparagers/criticisers are greater in number, the criticism is given precedence.” (Qa’idah fi jarh wa’t ta’dil p.50)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>so we find the narrator who is considered to be disparaged by the majority of the scholars of hadith is also considered to be disparaged according to the later scholars. The authentication and weakening of hadith is an issue of ijtihad. However, this does not mean hanafi’s grade hadith they require to be authentic and render other hadith to be weak. Therefore, it is preferable to give precedence to the position and view of the majority of the scholar of hadith (al-Hadith Issue no.10, Muharram 1426H/March 2005, p.18-19, Fatawa ilmiyyah al-ma’ruf tawdih al-ahkam 2:293-295)</em> End of Shaykh Zubair’s words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My edition of the <em>‘Qa’idah fi jarh wa’t ta’dil’ </em>contains the addition of ‘the ones who praise’ <em>“So if the number of criticisers is greater in number than those who praise, then the criticism is given precedence.” </em>(Taj al-Din al-Subki,<em> Qa’idah fi jarh wa’t ta’dil, ed. Abdul-Fattah Abu Guddah, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. </em>(Beirut: Dar al-Quran al-Karim, 1400H/1980c) 50)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is very beneficial and filled with principles pertaining to the science of Jarh wa’t ta’dil and thus the avid reader is recommended to refer to it. So we find some of the scholars from the mutaqadimin generally used the idea of majority for either praise or agreement and even criticism and Shaykh Zubair was not the only one and there are many example of this in the books on the science of hadith and narrators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the earlier scholars like Imam Yahya ibn Ma’in (d.233H) used majority and minority to determine the Dhabt ie precision of narrators and the mistakes of Hammad ibn Salamah, who was a great Imam of Ahl al-Sunnah. Imam Ibn Ma’in rejected the minority of the students of Hammad ibn Salamah over the majority who narrated from him, which was based approximately on 18 narrators. (Ibn Hibban, <em>Kitab al-majruhin minal muhadithin</em>, ed. Hamdi Abdul Majid al-Salafi. (Riyadh: Dar al-Sami’i, 1420H/2000) 1:34-35)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The brother went onto say,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">This seems good, but this was not the methodology of scholars of hadith, not even single of them. Rather they would prefer explained Jarh over general Tautheeq, and reject unexplained Jarh against established Ta’deel.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again this is poor understanding of Shaykh Zubair’s methodology and highly incorrect to present it in this way. Everyone is agreed on the principle of detailed criticism takes precedence over general praise and no one differs with this especially Shaykh Zubair as we will show. Shaikh Zubair’s presented this approach only when there were statements of praise and criticism and neither were detailed or specific and it was thus difficult to ascertain the reliability of the narrator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example, Hafiz Ibn Abdul Barr had a unique methodology in that anyone who is well known to possess knowledge of such affairs (ie hadith) was considered to be upright unless criticised. (al-Tamhid, (Morocco: 1378H) 1:28), Cf. Ibn Kathir, <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em> explanation of Dr Abdul Aziz al-Saghir Dukhan as <em>al-Sai’ al-hathith</em>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (San’a: Maktabah al-jil al-jadid:1421H/2001) 304, Ibn Kathir, <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith, </em>explanation Shaikh Ahmad Muhammad Shakir, <em>al-Ba’ith al-hathith</em> (Alexandria: Maktaba Dar al-Aqidah 1428H/2007) 77)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Although this has no relevance to majority of minority point, it does however show the uniqueness of every scholar. Naturally Hafiz ibn Salah answered Hafiz ibn Abdul Barr and said this approach was rudimentary and substandard. (Ibn al-Salah, <em>Muqaddimah</em>, ed. A’ishah Abdur Rahman (Cairo, 1990) 288), Cf. E’la al-Din Maglatai, <em>Islah kitab ibn salah</em>, (Cairo Maktaba Islamiyyah, 1428H/2007) no.90, 149)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Moreover, Imam Khatib al-Baghdadi was of the view only one critic is required to disparage a narrator. (Khatib al-Baghdadi, <em>al-Kifayah fi ilm al-riwayah </em>(Cairo, 1988) 84).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again the intent here it so the unique and exclusive views of some of the scholars of hadith of the past ie the mutaqaddimin and therefore singling out Shaykh Zubair for having lone methods needs to be looked at, despite this not being the case as we shall mention. Hafiz Ibn Kathir presents his arguments and puts forth the view that statements of criticisms from these Imams who are experts in this field should be accepted without the reasons for the criticism. He also clarifies if criticism and praise conflict each other, then the criticism has to be detailed. (Ibn Kathir, <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em> with <em>al-Sai’i al-hathith</em>, 304-305, <em>al-Ba’ith al-hathith, 78</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is incorrect and the scholars of hadith were not of this view, in fact this view is very unique and exclusive to the one who said it. So the authors statement,</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">“but this was not the methodology of scholars of hadith, not even single of them. Rather they would prefer explained Jarh over general Tautheeq, and reject unexplained Jarh against established Ta’deel.”</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Should also be applied to Hafiz Ibn Abdul Barr, Imam Ibn Kathir and others and we are sure such examples clearly illustrate our point.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hafiz Ibn Ahmad al-Hakami (d.1377H) mentions if there is conflict between criticism and praise, the former is given precedence and this is the preferred view according to the majority of the scholars of research and there is no difference in this whether those who praise and validate number many or a little. Some have argued if the number of scholars praising and validating are greater in number then their praise is to be taken. However, this is incorrect as the one invalidating or criticizing is aware of the hidden defect in the narrator. It should be clear, this applies and refers to detailed criticism. (Hafiz al-Hakami, <em>Dalil arbab al-falah li-tahqiq fan al-istilah</em>, ed. Khalid bin Qasim al-Raddadi (Madinah: Maktabah al-Ghuraba al-Athariyyah, 1414H/1993) 204-205)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti, Shaikh Ahmad Muhammad Shakir and Shaikh Adam Eithiopi have also mentioned something similar, even if the ones praising are greater in number. He also cites Imam Khatib al-Baghdadi who mentioned this to be the view of the majority of the scholars. Again, this refers to detailed criticism not if the jarh is mubham. (<em>Asa’afu dhul al-watir bi-sharh nazam al-durrar fil ilm al-athar – Sharh al-fiyyah al-suyuti fi ilm al-hadith</em> (Cairo: Dar ul-Athar lil Nashr wal-Tawdih, 1429H/2008) 1:338-339)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Adam Ethiopi also said when there is conflict between jarh wa’t ta’dil the criticism takes precedence when it is detailed and praise takes precedence over vague criticism and then he goes into detail regarding the types of critics. (Adam Ethiopi, <em>Aydah al-sabil fi sharh ittihaf al-nabil bi-muhammat ilm al-jarh wa’t ta’dil </em>(Riyadh: Dar ibn al-Jawzi, 1429H) 49+)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Zubair adds a note to the aforementioned statement of Imam Ibn Kathir and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In criticism and praise, the detailed and specific positions are given given precedence over the vague and general positions…”</em> (Zubair Ali Za’i, urdu trans. <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em>, with verification and notes, fn.1, 60)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He went onto say, clarifying his position which is in line and in accordance with the methodology of the scholars of hadith, he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Benefit (1): &#8211; when both criticism and praise are ambiguous or they are both detailed and reconciliation is not possible then the view of the majority of the Muhaddithin is given precedence.”</em> (Zubair Ali Za’i, urdu trans. <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em>, fn.1, 60)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Kathir goes onto ask a rhetorical question, is this (detailed criticism) given precedence?  Or alternatively is the majority view given precedence (over the minority view) or those who are specialists and experts in this field? He answers it himself and says that there is a well known difference of opinion in Usul al-fiqh, issues of fiqh and in the science of hadith and Allah knows best. Then he says, <em>“The statement of a single person whether criticism or praise is sufficient.” </em>(Ibn Kathir, <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em> with <em>al-Sai’i al-hathith</em>, 305).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Zubair also added a note here and said in response to the rhetorical question posed by Hafiz Ibn Kathir that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The correct view is that if the criticism is detailed it will always be given precedence.” </em>(Zubair Ali Za’i, urdu trans. <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em>, 61)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh then adds a note further explaining what he means by detailed criticism and when the view of the majority of the scholars of hadith and experts is given precedence. (Zubair Ali Za’i, urdu trans. <em>Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith</em>, fn.1, 61)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Dhiya al-Rehman al-A’zami discusses this issue whilst citing the chapter heading, <strong>“If a person has criticism and praise, which one is given precedence.” </strong>He then goes onto cite three main views. (1) criticism takes precedence over praise, (2) Praise takes precedence over criticism and (3) To give precedence to the position that achieves greater clarity. Then he goes onto cite the statements of the early pious ancestors explaining and evidencing each view.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then brings another chapter titled, <strong>“Not every criticism takes precedence over praise.” </strong>And then the Shaykh evidences this. Such discussions and points add further information and clarity on these issues, especially for the avid reader and student of the discipline. (Muhammad Dhiya al-Rehman al-A’zami, <em>Darasat fi jarh wa’t ta’dil </em>(Varansi: Jamia Salafiyyah, 1403H/1983) 203-207).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The preceding discussion absolves any alleged allegations and or incorrect notions of understanding any reader may have had regarding the precedence of criticism over praise and that Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i did not have a new methodology in scrutinizing ahadith. Furthermore, that he was upon the methodology of the Ahl al-Hadith in verifying and authenticating hadith</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muzaffar al-Dīn would get up such acts ranging from engaging and promoting music and musical instruments, gathering Qawalī gatherings, dancing, oppressing his people etc. The Milād gatherings were organised under such pretences and under such anti-Islamic atmosphere. These gatherings also commonly known as Mehfils were not based on anything from the Qurān or Sunnah but rather everything that was organised was totally contradictory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muzaffar al-Din inadvertently advocated and pushed the ideas of Wahdah ul-Adyān ie the unification of religions. He attempted to push the concept of syncretism ie synchronising the different religions as well as pre Islamic practices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to Neşet Çaǧatay, she argues and says the origins and roots of Milād are Pre Islamic of Turkish persuasion and custom, which have been essentially modified over the centuries to take on an Islamic appearance. She says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-5623 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/turkish-religion1.png?resize=394%2C240" alt="turkish-religion1" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/turkish-religion1.png?resize=300%2C183 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/turkish-religion1.png?resize=768%2C469 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/turkish-religion1.png?w=945 945w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Neşet Çaǧatay, <strong>The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey</strong>, [pp.129 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This clearly shows how pre Islamic Turkish custom and practices were utilised introduced with other innovations to be something praiseworthy and rewarding, however they are pure innovations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In current times the Mawlid or Milād celebrations have become more heretical with the extravagant lighting, the music and dancing which is very much open without any shame of the vulgarity. This is evident from some of the videos on youtube.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again we find this is nothing new, although Neşet Çaǧatay makes some assertions, not all of them are entirely correct or on point in fact they are just emotions and personal opinions. Nonetheless she asserts,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mevlevi2.png"><img class=" wp-image-5624 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mevlevi2.png?resize=417%2C217" alt="mevlevi2" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mevlevi2.png?resize=300%2C156 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mevlevi2.png?resize=768%2C400 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mevlevi2.png?w=939 939w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Neşet Çaǧatay, <strong>The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey</strong>, [pp.130 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī was also instrumental in pushing the idea of the Mawlid. He was famous poet and Sūfi Master who was the Sūfī patron of the Melviyyah (Mawlawi) who often referred to as the whirling dervishes. They believed in making zikr and dancing at the same time which is known as Sama in Sūfī terminology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Melviyyah would whirl continuously and lose their minds in an abstruse trance in an attempt to achieve unison and unity with Allāh which is again known as Wahdah ul-Wajūd in Sūfī terminology. This shows the Sūfī’s, especially the whirling dervishes known as the Melviyyah (Mawlawiyyah) and their head, Maulāna Jalāl al-Dīn al-Rūmī were instrumental in shaping the Mawlid we see today,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, during the Mawlid or Milād season, you will find heavy involvement of music, clapping of the hands to create sounds and rhythmic beats, drums and tambourines. In other parts of the world professional singers and musicians are hired for the festive to play religious esoteric trance type of music, commonly known as Qawalis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Most of the ardent and staunch supporters of the Mawlid hail from the sub continent and whilst settling in the western world, they have progress and evolved in such an alarming rate that they forced us to produce more Mawlid papers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Highlighting the regression of these people, in the western world Eid Milād al-Nabī was unheard of. There were no lights, no processions and no such gatherings. Such practices were unheard until recently in the last 5-10 years. This yet again is another outright evidence and reality that Mawlid and Milād celebrations are clear innovations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ottomans further spread the Mawlid during their reign and further designated specific customs and practices. Neşet Çaǧatay highlights in the following words</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-5625 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kadi-Darir3.png?resize=449%2C199" alt="kadi-darir3" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kadi-Darir3.png?resize=300%2C133 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kadi-Darir3.png?resize=768%2C341 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kadi-Darir3.png?w=939 939w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Neşet Çaǧatay in her paper asserts the Shī’te leaders of the Fatimids had such Mawlids recited for the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and ʿAlī RaḍiAllāhu Anhu, this is precisely the Mawlid and Milād celebrations we have today. The Shīʿtes also have their own ideas and concepts of Milād, which they celebrate, in fact there is not much difference between how the Barilwī’s, Sufī’s and Shīʿtes celebrate the Milād, two faces of the same coin. She says under the heading of the history of the recitations of Mawlid,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The historian Ibn Khalkān also enforces this view, he gives a firsthand account of what used to really happen at a Mawlid gathering in his <em>Wafyāt</em>, which will be cited later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yāqūt al-Hamawī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He would seriously oppress his people and subjugate them, he would always be inclined to forcefully take their wealth without reason. Similarly he would also feed the poor and destitute and offer them charity. He would also spend a lot of money to free those enslaved by the disbelievers.”</em> [Muʿajam al-Buldān [1:138]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muʿjam al-Buldān goes on to mention a couplet of a poet where he says, he was similar to the prostitute woman who gives charity from the money she earns, oh Woman woe to you, neither commit Zina nor give in charity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The first person to innovate (the Milād or Mawlid) was the ruler or Erbil, Malik Muẓaffar Abū Sa</em><em>ʿ</em><em>īd al-Kaukabūrī.”</em> [al-Ḥawī Lil-Fatāwa [1:189]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It must be noted here that Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭi’s assertion and support of the Mawlid  in his <em>‘Ḥusn al-Maqsid Fī A</em><em>ʿ</em><em>mal al-Mawlid’</em> which is a part of his <em>‘al-Ḥawī Lil-Fatāwa’</em> was mere reciting of poems and narrating ahadith and athar of his virtue ie his Shamaʿil and nothing of the nature of the current day corruptive heretical practises.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, the Barailwī’s and Sūfī’s scampering and scuttling in order to shield themselves behind Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭī is futile because he did not advocate nor propagate any of the things this lot gets up to. It must be said based on what we know of Ḥafiẓ Suyūṭi and giving him the benefit of the doubt and with books like ‘Miftaḥ al-Jannah Bi-Ihtijāj al-Sunnah’ and al-Amr al-Ittiba etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Neşet Çaǧatay further presents Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭī’s opinion which also ties in with what other historians have stated with regards to the origins and beginnings of the Mawlid.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is what Shaikh Ibn Khalkān said after witnessing a gathering of Mawlid and Milād celebrations and festivities. This is a first hand direct account, he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“His people were well aware of his extravagance and belief in the Milād and the people from the surrounding towns and areas ie Baghdād, Moṣul, Jazirah, Sinjār, Naṣibīn and other neighbouring countries would visit him. From amongst these people were Jurists, the Sūfi’s, admonishers, reciters and poets. The people would begin visiting him from Muharram and this would continue until Rabī al-Awwal. Malik Muzaffar al-Dīn Kaukabūrī would instruct his people to make 20 wooden mobile dome and each dome would have 4 or 5 levels. He would reserve one for himself and the remaining ones would be for his ministers and advisers. He would decorate them making them flamboyant, he would place musical instruments on them, from the Tabla and other violin based instruments on the different levels of the domes. The people would close their businesses and visit the festivities and celebrations. The domes would be lined in an open area starting from his palace and ending at the Khanqah (Sufi Convents). Sulṭān Muzaffar al-Dīn would visit every dome on a daily basis after Asr, he would listen to the music and look at the drama. He would eventually retire to the Khanqah where gatherings of Music (Qawali – Shirki trance esoteric type of music) would be in full swing and then eventually after the morning prayer he would go hunting. He would return to his Palace before Ẓuhr and this would be his norm during the Milād days. He would celebrate the Milād on the 8<sup>th</sup> of Rabī al-Awwal one year and then on the 12<sup>th</sup> of Rabī al-Awwal in the following year due to the difference of opinion regarding the Prophets birthday. A few nights before the Milād, he would march into the open field with his musicians, camels, cows and other animals. He would then sacrifice them and then instruct various types of dishes to be cooked. Then after Maghrib on the evening of Milād he would organise a gathering, thousands of candles lit, some of them were huge which he would use in the procession. The Palace would be decorated and he would make a grand entrance. The huge candles would be places on a platform supported by a person which would eventually make their way to his chambers via procession for the festivities.”</em> [Wafyāt al-A’yān Wa Anbā Ibnā al-Zamān [4:117]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sabṭ Ibn al-Jawzī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“A person who visited the Milād gathering and celebrations of Muzaffar al-Dīn Kaukabūrī said the food entailed 5,000 cooked goats, 10,000 hens, 100 horses and 100,000 plates of sweets and 30,000 plates of sweet pudding. Well-known and famous learned men and Sūfīs would visit his Milād gatherings, who would be gowned with specific dress wear. He would generously gift them and would also organise sittings of music infested Qawalis from Ẓuhr until Fajr for the Sufīs. He would participate and dance with them. He would spend approximately 300,000 Dinārs every year on the Milād gathering.” </em>[Mirāh al-Zamān [8:681], see also Suyūti, al-Ḥawī Lil-Fatāwa [1:189-190]. Ibn Kathīr, al-Bidāyah Wan-Nihāyah [12:124] and Subl al-Hadī al-Rashād [1:362].</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;And Every Innovation is Misguidance&#8217;</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">First Published 1999</span></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A great majority of the the members, sympathisers and advocates of Hizb ut-Taḥrīr and al-Muhājirūn or whatever names they coin for themselves have always been under the delusion that the Khilāfah was destroyed in 1924. So when the aḥadīth regarding the period of Khilāfah are presented to them, they are shocked and astonished to the existence of such authentic aḥadīth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Their responses after these aḥadīth presented to them vary, but almost every time they say, <em>&#8220;Brother give us the reference, we will check it out&#8221;</em> or <em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Brother we need to look at the</span> chain of the ḥadīth because&#8230;.&#8221;</em> assuming the aḥadīth maybe weak and by this they try to avoid the real point of dispute.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These aḥadīth which clearly mention the time when the Khilāfah finished are thorns in the hearts of Hizb ut-Tahrīr and al-Muhajiroon as you will notice their dismay and disapproval when the aḥadīth are mentioned. These aḥadīth clearly elucidate the time when the khilāfah finished and when kingship would begin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If we look at these aḥadīth from Hizb ut-Tahrīr and al-Muhājirūn&#8217;s position, we will acknowledge quickly that their <strong>CALL </strong>to the Khilāfah will be in vain hence the lack of knowledge regarding its existence. The ḥadīth is in different words but the meanings are the same.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Saʿīd bin Jamhān</strong> from <strong>Safīnah</strong> who said the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu alayhi wasalam) said,</span></p>
