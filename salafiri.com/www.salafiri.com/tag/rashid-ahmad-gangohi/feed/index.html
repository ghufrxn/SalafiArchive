				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Deobandi Elders Rashid Ahmad Gangohi and Ashiq Ilahi Meerthi – Divinty and Jahmi Kufr Taweelat of Allaahs Sifaat</strong></p>
<p><em>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</em></p>
<p>Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, a deobandi hanafi sufi churchfather who is considered one of the pillars of the deobandi sect had a biography written about him. It was per his sons instruction Masood Ahmad and the chief contributors and annotators were also deobandi sufi churchfathers in their own right from them were the likes of Ashiq Ilahi Meerthi, Abdul Qadir Raipuri and Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri (or Ambethvi – the author of Muhannad). It was essentially penned by Ashiq Ilahi and Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri annotated it. Then Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri took it upon himself to publish this biography.</p>
<p>2 points to be noted</p>
<p>There is ample evidence this book (ie Tazkirrah ur-Rashid) was published in Rashid Ahmad Gangohis lifetime, so he saw it, read it and might have even checked it. Although this is not exactly certain as there is no publication date on the book and neither does the intro indicate anything.</p>
<p>Secondly some deobandi quarters and “innocent sympathisers” may argue that Rashid Ahmad Gangohi never actually wrote this. So we answer and say this is not problematic from a number of angles. The first being his close students, murids, disciples and sympathisers compiled and penned the book and they were aware of his Aqidah and what it conformed to ie essentially what his aqidah was. secondly, these compilers are the pillars of the deobandi sect themselves and hold enormous weight so this is detrimental in itself. Thirdly this book is his memoirs ie his thoughts, what he presented to the people, how the people saw him and in what light and his general teachings. At the very least we should understand and hold this as a deobandi aqidah.</p>
<p>So what do they say, and it indeed this type of belief and aqidah sends shivers up the spine. In the same token let this be a reminder to the deobandi sympathisers, when will you stop defending such anti Islam and idolatrous aqidah.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tazkaitur-rashid-cover.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6374" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tazkaitur-rashid-cover.jpg?resize=220%2C300" alt="tazkaitur-rashid-cover" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tazkaitur-rashid-cover.jpg?resize=220%2C300 220w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tazkaitur-rashid-cover.jpg?w=700 700w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/text-tr.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6375" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/text-tr.jpg?resize=300%2C86" alt="text-tr" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/text-tr.jpg?resize=300%2C86 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/text-tr.jpg?w=700 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Tazkirah ut-Rashid (2/322)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">“during the era his opposers (ie Rashid Ahmad Gangohis) were causing commotion concerning the issue of Imkaan al-Kadhib (the possibility of Allaah lying) and issued a legal edict of his takfir. In a gathering of Sian (a reverend saint) Tawakul Shah Anbalwi a moulvi mentioned the divine and holy Imams name and said he believed that Allaah could lie. On hearing this Sian Tawakul Shah lowered his head an began to meditate (in a trance) for a while and then lifted his head and said  in punjabi, “What are you people saying!!! I am seeing the pen of Maulana Rashid Ahmad (Gangohi) writing above and beyond the (Allaahs) Arsh .”</span> <strong>(Tazkirah ut-Rashid (2/322) (this was the outcome of his meditation)</strong></p>
<p>One begs to ask, what was Mr Gangohi Rashid Ahmads pen doing there? What is this notion implying? We know Allaah Jallo Wa A’la rises above his throne but here we find Mr Gangohis pen. This jahmi aqidah is despicable as on one hand they claim they make ta’weel of the sifaat and here they are claiming elements divinity and this wont be the first time they have done this.</p>
<p>Does it not suggest that Mr Gangohis pen is traversing above the Throne is meddling with core elements of divinity. We have not even begun the address the seriously grave mistakes in aqidah in this passage. Mr Sian Shah knowing the unseen and meditating. There is also a staunch and horrid smell of infallibility lurking in this passage.</p>
<p>This is the dangerous aqidah  of the deobandis we warn the people about. What was Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri doing during his annotation and was Ashiq Ilahi Meerthi day dreaming when he was writing this. Where is the basic element of Eemaan and Tawheed here. So please all of those who are giving the deobandis excuses, lets us all save ourselves first. This is a clear Jahmi aqidah. They also accuse us of all sorts from anthropomorphism and from the mushabihah etc but here Rashid Ahmad Gangohis QALAM is above the throne. I mean how do we take this, are they saying Mr Gangohis qalam is the law, are they say Mr Gangohi is a deity that he writes everything. Was Mr Sian Shah saying that as Mr Gangohis pen is writing how can Allaah lie because he is……</p>
<p>This is clear shirk and kufr and if these deobandi elders died upon such beliefs then Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilayi Raajioon</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We the Ahlul Hadith have learnt the Quran, Aqadah, Hadith and Fiqh as part of our Islamic responsibility so that we can serve this Deen in a manner that best suites this Ummah. In response to our dedication and efforts the hanafis deobandis of Bury and Dewsbury decided to setup Tablighi organisations against the Salafi Dawah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The efforts of Ahlul Hadith was spreading by Allahs mercy and in the year of 2000-2001, the elder generation of the deobandis felt the need to arrange emergency meetings to discuss ways of creating counter measures in an attempt to curb the Salafi Dawah. Such meetings or conferences were held in India and the UK to address this situation. It is therefore intriguing to contemplate if Mr Yasir is aware of this history but decided to conceal it just like Mohammad Ilyas sahib concealed the true founder of the 6 principles of the deobandi Manhaj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a historical fact that the people of truth are always less in number but their Dawah is very effective and consequently the deobandi contingency become very fearful of this threat. In a desperate and cheap attempt, the Deobandis decided to approach the masses and make false statements against the Salafis, such as <em>“oh the Salafis will drive you away from the taqleed of the imams and the burzugh… how can we allow our children to abandon the Deen of our forefathers of Deoband.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was at this point this these people promoted the term <em>ghair muqalid </em>in reference to Ahlul Hadeeth.  It was light of these crocodile tears that the deobandis had the apparent justification in setting up institutions around the UK.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this one may ponder how the Salafi Dawah is gaining strength if they lack the Madaris as Mr Yasir claims. A further point to note is to ponder how is it that Hanafis are embracing the Salafi Dawah and not the reverse? We can conclude that Mr Yasir is a victim of the inferiority complex, to make statements such as “<em>they hardly have any proper madaris</em>” shows he has no intelligence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a known fact that the Salafis have always propagated their Manhaj with small quantities of people but the large number of deobandi and hanafis from the subcontinent along with their kosher money have led to their institutions. This followed with an influx of migrants from the subcontinent who are mainly hanafi and heobandi who have contributed to the numbers in the UK. This has now become a point of argument by those who lack in concrete proof in defence of the deobandi hanafi sect which is corrupted with Shirk and Bid’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be noted here that the vast majority of these migrants are the laymen and do not possess a concrete understanding of the correct Aqidah and it is very cunning of Mr Yasir in using this to promote a false argument highlighting that the Salafis are weak in number. We should also emphasise that if success is judged by numbers then the Sahaba would have been on the brink of failure during the battle of Badr, but it was because of their correct Aqidah and firm Iman that won the battle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir further states </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“<em>it’s funny how they chant one word salaf when they have no link to the pious salaf as salaf means that came before us.”</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have addressed this comment previously and revisiting this would be unnecessary. It is very ironic that Mr Yasir uses the word chant as this is a term his Sufi Manhaj promotes in their circles of zikr, this is because the deobandis are essentially Naqshabandi who are well known for their methods of worship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It seems Mr Yasir was excluded from these circles of remembrance where they CHANT like individuals intoxicated with harmful substances. In light of this we do not follow the Salaf and if we choose to, then it needs to be substantiated with evidence and this is easy for us. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi as his name suggests claims to be hanafi, therefore please attempt to highlight the current day deobandi belief &amp; practices from the manhaj of Imam Abu Hanifah. This is a challenge which will be met with certain failure. Meanwhile we the Salafis can bring forward our proofs which emphasises that our Manhaj and Aqidah has not been diluted but rather it is a mirror reflection of the Companions, Tabieens and Taba-Tabieens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have previously stated examples such as books of Aqidah i.e creed issues as Mr Yasir phrases it. Furthermore, he has misunderstood the word Salaf in terms of what it denotes, and the meaning that it draws. This is a further example demonstrating the ignorance of Mr Yasir who embarrasses himself by spitting at himself whilst attempting to spit at the sun in the presence of his deobandi devotees.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One may contemplate how an overly enthusiastic deobandi is capable of such diabolical profanities whilst his senior counterparts would seek refuge in such foolish statements. Mr Yasir should realise that the term Salaf cannot be restricted to an era but rather it must align with the principles of the Quran and the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore any individual whose beliefs, madhab and opinions do not conform and agree with the Quran and Sunnah or that they oppose the people of truth will be upon misguidance. A manifestation of this situation can be understood in the case of Ma’bad al-Juhani 70H, the leader of the Qadiriyyah, Ghilan Dimashqi 105H, the head of the Jahmis, Jahm ibn Safwan 128H, Ja’d ibn Dirham 124H and Wasil ibn A’ta 131H, the head of the Mu’tazilah (Refer to Qadiyah Way-Ta’weel).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The aforementioned individuals were from the leaders of the Salaf of Mr Yasir. We urge him to investigate his own Salaf, the likes of Jahm, Wasil to name a few. Mr Yasir is a very confused individual who claims to be an Ashari but in reality he and his sect are Kullabis which is derived from the Jahmi’s. In light of this we cannot consider Mr Yasir a serious student of knowledge from whom knowledge can be taken from (this is for those who belong to his sect).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Safarini has stated that the Salaf must be upon righteousness and truthfulness so that knowledge can be sought from them. Their character must be of good conduct and individuals who strongly oppose the people of innovation. He further states in regards to the Salafis,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“They are labelled or titled with names that are not linked by the people like the Khawarij, Rawafidh, Qadariyyah, Murjiah, Jabariyyah, Jahmiyyah etc”</em> (Lawamah Al Anwar 1/20)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir further states </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Yes they do follow the misguided Salaf”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Only one needs to read the books of rijal and history to understand the Salaf within the deobandis and hanafis. For instance we can study the example of Abu Mute’a al-Balkhi and his beliefs (Refer to Lisan ul-Mizan Vol. 2, Mizan ul-E’tidaal Vol. 1 and Kitab al-Kunna Vol. 2 of ad-Daulabi).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A further example to look at is the E’tizaal and Irja and their respective origins. Al-ikmaal (1/252-253) of ibn Makaula is yet another example to look at wherein it provides information on the individual who pulled the reigns of the horse of the wife of Jahm Ibn Safwan. Much more can be stated about Mr Yasir’s Salaf and therefore he needs to address the matters of his own house before he chooses to attacks others with foolish remarks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir further states </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“By changing your name, the reality doesn’t turn into gold.”</span> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ironically this is the very point Ahlul Hadith have been driving forward. To label oneself as a hanafi does not imply that one is now amongst the hanafi scholars of the classical era who were free of the deviant beliefs as those hanafis of today. The same principle can be applied when choosing to label oneself as an Ashari or Maturidi who also did not share the deviant practices as Mr Yasir, such as seeking aid from the deceased or from the souls of the righteous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It only takes one to study the statements of their respective hanafi deobandi scholar to realise that he has more right to ilm to label himself a hanafi, and claims that he is a muqallid of Imam Abu Hanifah in trivial matters of the deen. Whilst in matters of Manhaj and Aqidah they choose to acknowledge Imam Abul Hasal al-Ashari and Imam Abu Mansur Maturidi (Muhannad Ala Mufannad Page 22).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore we ask Mr Yasir to present his sufi beliefs from these scholars i.e. their elders from whom they take their knowledge from and emulate. In light of this if Mr Yasir is not fully versed with Muhannad Ala Mufannad then this a clear sign of ignorance in his knowledge and a classical example of someone to have some shame and regret.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However if on the other hand My Yasir is completely unware of this book then we would highlight that this book does not fall short in being the ultimate reference guide for the Sufi deobandi forefathers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Yasir should be familiar with the calibre and the number of the deobandi elders who satisfied the beliefs and the fundamental principles of this book. Nonetheless, addressing the original point, labelling oneself a hanafi whilst the heobandi doctrines are derived heavily from the Greeks and Hindus and in addition to having the ideas of Jahm Ibn Safwan, Ja’d Ibn Dirham and Wasil Ibn Alta is a matter that needs to be reflected upon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is intriguing to see that Mr Yasir has the audacity to present himself in front of an audience to critique Ahlul Hadith whilst the state of his own affairs is a disgrace. If he truly believes that he is surely upon truth then we ask him to highlight the concepts of wahdatul wujood, seeking aid from the deceased, seeking aid from the living in a manner that is beyond the capacity of a person, holding the belief that calamities can be alleviated from the creation of Allah and so forth from the works of Imam Abu Mansur Maturidi and Imam Abul Hasan al-Ashari. This is a challenge that he will fail miserably.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the final tirade then it amounts to nothing but an overly excited child with sweets. We eagerly await your response. With regards to the flapping, then we say that once Ahlul Hadith have dealt with Mr Yasir al-Hanafi, he will not be able to crawl back to deoband let alone flapping, that is if he is not disowned by the real academics amongst them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the very deoband which was established in a Hindu city where their respective goddess would be worshipped and venerated. It is also the very deoband which was formed through the donations of Hindus and the British East India Company.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our advice for Mr Yasir before he chooses to undertake his long journey back to Deoband where the goddess of Durga was worshipped i.e. Devi van, Devi gan or Devi Vandan is to equip yourself with pen and paper so that you can actually acquire the knowledge of your forefathers in Devgand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also a JazakAllah Khair to Abu Hashim for his diligence and efforts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Written by the two weak slaves of Allah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise be to Allah lord of the worlds to whom we praise and seek his aid and assistance without any intercessors. May there be abundant salutations upon the noblest messenger, his family, his companions and all those Muslims who follow until the last day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Very recently some proponents and ardently staunch followers of the Hanafi Deobandi Madhab under the guise of the Hanafi Fiqh  have made some slanderous remarks which were based on bigoted ignorance, deliberate opposition of the true reality, state of affairs and malicious misrepresentation of the facts through social media platforms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The perpetrator of these remarks were carried out by neonate, new kids on the block with new found levels of testosterone, namely Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi. Our aim is not to entertain the mind-set of this individual or his scathing remarks as this will lengthen this brief response. Rather we wish to highlight some key points to show the slanderous lies and ignorance of this individual.     </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I also like to request our Sunni brothers to refrain from uploading any youtube videos, creating articles against the likes of the Hanafi and Deobandi sect including their overly exaggerated teachers such as Maulana Qasim Nanautwi, Ashraf Ali Thanvi and Rashid Ahmad Gangohi who are not well versed with this sect and their school of thought. The brothers should understand that attempting a refutation against the aforementioned individuals, the Deobandis and Hanafis will result in a subsequent response from them which may be difficult for those brothers to rebut and thereby causing embarrassment on behalf of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah. It is indeed easy quoting what Ashraf Ali Thanvi said etc but when accusations are levied against us these brothers are no where to be seen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The effects of this scenario will make our brothers look weak and defeated. In summary, it is very simple to upload videos which make criticism of the Deobandi Manhaj by our zealous brothers however any response from the opposition is met with silence. Therefore our brothers should realise their respective limits when dealing with such matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us proceed and analyse the confused statements of Mohammad Yasir Al Hanafi. He stated the following…</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>“Salafis” </em><em>Who are very new to this ummah, maybe a hundred years or so, though they take many of their creed issues from Hafiz Ibn Taymiyyah, bin Baz, Uthaymin et al who were nowhere near the salaf</em>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Response: We do not know if we are to laugh at this statement or cry at the Jahala of this individual. Such statements have become so monotonous or repeated that it is deemed as ignorance to even raise such a point. This statement has demonstrated the childish and immature behaviour and pathetic mind-set of this person</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If we are to accept his statement that the Salafis existed for no more than 100 years or so then consider the following.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir died in 1164H (approximately 272 years ago). He wrote in his refutation of the Ashari’s which mentions Allahs Kalam Nafsi (i.e. the incorrect Aqidah),</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“(They say) Allah does not speak but they are internal sounds!!! Then you cannot even find the smell of this in the Quran and Sunnah” (Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqaid an-Hadithiyyah (also referred to as Athariyyah pg.21). </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this Mohammad Yasir has either demonstrated his poor mathematical skills or he has shown poor understanding of the Salafis and Ahlul Hadith. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir died in 1164H refuting the Asharis but also the fact that he was a bona fide scholar of the Salafis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should be noted critically here that during this period Deoband was not even in existence and therefore we should redirect the statements of Muhammad Yasir on the forefathers of the Deobandi sect which did not exist over 100 years ago until the intervention of the British Empire through the East India Trading company.  (Refer to our treatise, The Deobandis &amp; The British Government. At the following link <a href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-deobandis-the-british-government/">http://www.salafiri.com/the-deobandis-the-british-government/</a>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is clearly apparent from this short analysis that Mr Yasir is having a hard time grasping basic mathematics, books of the Salaf and History. What reliance can we have in his short outburst?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He states</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Salafis”, <em>who are very new to this ummah, maybe a hundred years or so</em>”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">in this case we him to consider the following.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Sam’ani (562H) said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Salafi, they are those who are attributed to the Salaf and following the Madhab of the Salaf, as I HAVE HEARD FROM THEM” (al-Insab 7/723)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Ibn Athir (630H) adds to the statement of Allamah Sam’ani and says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“A group (of people) are well known with this Nisbah (i.e. attribution of being a Salafi)” (al-Ikmal (4/471-470) of Ibn Makaula, al-Tashabha Fir Rijal (1/364) and al-lubab (2/126).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If we accept Mr Yasir’s statement that the Salafi’s are a century old then please explain with your amazing mathematical mind, how Allamah Samani stated he heard from the Salaf that they followed the Madhab of the Salaf during the 6<sup>th</sup> century Hijri? And that Allamah Ibn Athir stated that he saw a group calling themselves Salafi during the 7<sup>th</sup> century Hijri?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not wish to invest too much time educating Mohammad Yasir of the definition of Salafi, however we ask him to refer to his own Ashari Scholar Ibrahim bin Muhammad Baijauri (1277H) in regards to the definition of Salaf (Refer to his Tuhfatul Murid).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known to most people that the Salafi’s are the ones who adhere to the way of the Salaf and their Madhab and it is for this reason that we label ourselves as Salafis. We should emphasise here that being a prerequisite of being a Salafi is NOT to follow Shaikh Bin Baz, Shaikh ibn Uthaymin and Imam Ibn Taymiyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather Allamah Safarini has explained that the later scholars who adopted the way of the companions, Tabieen and Taba Tabieen are known as the Salaf (Lawameh al-Anwar (1120).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taimiyyah (728H) and Hafidh ibn Rajab (795H) have included Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal (241H), Imam Shafi’ee (204H), Ishaq Ibn Rahawaihah (221H) and Imam Abu Ubaid (224H) to be from amongst the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some authorities have stated that the first three generations was the period of the Salaf. This can be confirmed within at-Tahaf Fi Madhab  as-Salaf (pg.117-118), Lawameh al-Anwar (1/20), Dar Tarudh an Aql Wan Naql (1/207 &amp; 7/134) of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Fadhal Ilm as-Salaf Alal Khalaf (p.60) of Hafidh Ibn Rajab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Ajurri superseded them in this and included Imam Ahmad and the scholars of his era from amongst the Salaf (ash-Shariah (p.14)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this, the intelligent reader will acknowledge with certainty that we take our creed issues </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">from Imam Ahmad (241H) from his Usul us-Sunnah and as-Sunnah as narrated by his sons and students</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nuzul, as-Sifat and ar-Ru’ayah all of Imam Daraqutni (385H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Ibanah Aan Shari&#8217;atil Firqatun Najiyyah and Sharhul-Ibaanah Aan Usul us-Sunnah Wad-Diyanah of Battah al-Ukbari (387H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Kitabut-Tawhid and ar-Radd Alal Jahmiyyah both of Ibn Mandah (395H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and the list continues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of this, the slanderous accusations highlighting that we take our matters of creed from the likes of Shaikh Bin Baz, Shaikh Ibn al-Uthaymin and Imam Ibn Taymiyyah is a disgraceful and fabricated lie. One would contemplate as to where does Mr Yasir take his issues of creed from?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Does he take them from his Imam Abu Mansur al-Maturidi or the Ashaa’irah? Further to this, one would ask to what extent did the former of these individuals understood their creed with respect to the Salaf. Mr Yasir labels himself as an Ashari but yet he has not been able to substantiate the origins of his Aqidah, whether this be early or late Ashari or the Kullabiyyah. Furthermore, your Deobandi Church forefathers have stated in their respective books such as Maulana Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri, Qari Tayyab and Maulana Yusuf Binnori that they adopt and follow the Aqidah of Abu Hasan al-Ashari and Abu Mansur al-Maturidi however they choose to follow Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahimahullah) in fiqh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is astonishing to see that they abandon the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah in favour of their Deobandi forefathers, we ask you, what is wrong with the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah? Whilst you follow the Aqidah of the Khalaf? Also can you explain which book of the Salaf or their teaching did the Deobandi’s acquire the Sufi tariqah, Chistiyyah or the Naqshbandiyyah from?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is difficult to fathom as to how Mr Yasir chooses to follow a diluted Aqidah and yet have the audacity to claim that the Manhaj of Ahlul Hadith is no more than 100 years old. An intelligent student of knowledge would come to terms with the fallacy and fictitious nature of My Yasir’s baseless statements and his corrupted diluted Madhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> At the very least he could have adopted the Aqidah of Imam Abu Hanifah as cited in Fiqh ul-Akbar or in his Wasiyyah Al-Imam Abu Hanifah. It is clear that Mr Yasir evidently has no shame in labelling himself as a Hanafi whilst he follows the Aqidah of his Deobandi forefathers. So either deny the attribution of these books to Imam Abu Hanifah and the Aqidah contained therein or accept the words of your own Imam, the same Imam you spend your lives defending his fiqh and yet on the other hand you turn a blind eye to his beliefs, this is the most hypocritical manipulation of the worst dimension.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We therefore stress that he should spend some useful time in reading Imam Abu Hanifah’s Aqidah in Wasiyah (p.38) (We would be surprised to say the least if he has even heard of this book) or Imam Abul Hasan al-Ashari’s Al-Ibanah (p.55). In light of these references we would expect Mr Yasir to revert to making claims that Imam Abul Hasan Al-Ashari’s Al-Ibanah has been tampered when he fails to provide an educated response.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further states in his allegations</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“<em>Also the fact that in this country they have hardly any proper madaris, except for a few crash course “Halaqas”</em>”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a further lie, the Salafis and Ahlul Hadith have been teaching in their respective madrassahs for years well before Bury and Dewsbury appeared on the scene. Madrassah’s were and are well established throughout the United Kingdom with names like Madrassah Salafiyyah. We would surely know as we studied in them in the early 80’s and the teaching was regular and consistent from the mid 70’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The level and methods of teaching were evident and widespread where students would deliver lectures and sermons as training in the annual conferences. The evidence is in your face yet due to his vehement bigoted and staunch animosity for the Ahlul Hadith he is so blind to the truth when it is right in front of him and even if it was to slap him in the face, he would still be upon his farcical and slanderous absurdities. The videos are on Youtube, may be when he has time from his repugnancy he might have a look!!! All this when deoband was still in deoband on paper!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also a JazakAllah Khair to Abu Hashim for his diligence and efforts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Written by the two weak slaves of Allah</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b><i>The Rest Of The Deobandi Elders…</i></b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With the recent “Arab Spring” has given another group of dissident and fractioned individuals some power in their poor effort in disparaging the Madhab Ahlul Hadeeth, so much so that they think by misspelling the name it will give them some credibility in a shambled attempt to dissociate them from the true Ahlul Hadeeth. In reality these people have enough time to rant their toddler cries on so called “Ahlul Hadeeth forums” with their self formulated, desire based and individual unqualified opinions – the very same concept they think they are refuting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fact is these individuals are lost and confused due to following their own intellects and have in recent years unsuccessfully lashed out at the well known established madhab of Ahlul Hadeeth. It has not been long that they just left their shackles of blind following themselves and have realised, “Oh there is a difference of taqleed and taqleed Shakshi” which is is really a failed ploy to mislead the masses. More will be discussed about these free thinking individuals later as well as their modernistic madhabee approach, neither are we afraid to mention names, at this moment we ask let them address us directly and then watch this space “WHOEVER THEY ARE”<span id="more-2237"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such unwarranted relentless attacks on the Salafis and Ahlul Hadeeth have emanated from a number of individuals, some hiding behind organisations and forums and others promoting clear deviants. Some of the people do not have the slightest idea of what they are saying yet because it is an attack on the Salafis and the Ahlul Hadeeth. Some of these people due to their ignorance equate us to having a fight with the deobandis or barailwis based on difference, yet these very same people are accepting and accommodating of their beliefs. The ignorant people should shut up and cause less damage and iftiraaq in the Ummah based on their whims and desires, anyway</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some have been recently advocating the Salafis and Ahlul Hadeeth were dropping like flies in the subcontinent and the DEO-KATS were holding it down!!! If only people were honest and just to themselves. Furthermore the individual says this in a disparaging and censurable way and belittling the Salafis and Ahlul Hadeeth. He says,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What does he mean by holding it down, well holding it down is performing Jihaad against the British Colonial Raj and the rest of them were dropping like flies!!! OK. Most of the readers who are well versed with the subcontinent history and its struggle are probably getting hysterical or just shocked due to the gravity of this erroneous statement and this is putting it mildly. Our response at this moment in time is not who was doing what as much has been writing about this and inshaAllaah we can highlight this at a later date.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We intend to show how these DEO-KATS were exactly holding it down and why their is this mad respect for the DEO-KATS. Firstly the stepbrothers of the DEO-KATS, the BAR-DOGS (Barailwi) (We apologise for using the word dog as some people might find this offensive and we apologise again but the fact is the barailwis call themselves the dogs of Madeenah and the dogs of “Gauth-Pak or Gauth-Azam” ie of Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee). The Sufis, their ardent adherents and the anti wahhabis have been having mango kulfis for years as early as 1872 see here&gt;&gt;&gt;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2013/05/28/the-wahabis-zainee-dahlans-real-opinion-the-british/">https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2013/05/28/the-wahabis-zainee-dahlans-real-opinion-the-british/</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lets have a look what the Deobandis (WHO ARE CLEAR SOOFEES) were doing, whether they were having mango kulfis with the British Colonial Raj or holding it down,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>MADRASSAH DAR UL-ULOOM DEOBAND</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ayub Qadiri in his biographical note on Maulana Muhammad Ahsan Nanotvi writes an account of a British spy and his time at Madrassah Deoband. The Deobandis have sugar coated it in the following way <strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.deoband.net/1/archives/12-2012/1.html">SEE HERE</a></strong> however the reality is a little different as can be seen below it says, the lieutenant Governor sent John Palmer as a spy to report on the activities of Madrassah Deoband, he reports,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“The efforts and activities that are being achieved (Is passive idle behavior against the British Raj) in the colleges by spending thousand of rupees on them is being done here out in pennies (figure of speech denoting almost next to nothing). The activities and efforts the Principal (of these colleges in pacifying the masses against revolt) is being paid thousand of rupees in monthly salary the moulvis here are doing for 40 rupees  a month as a salary, THIS MADRASSAH IS NOT AGAINST THE BRITISH RAJ BUT RATHER IT IS AGREEMENT, PRAISING AND IN A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BRITISH RAJ (GOVERNMENT)… then he goes onto say it is the best learning institute for any muslim and there can not be any better and even the non muslims should come and learn here…” (Maulana Muhammad Ahsan Nanotvi (pg.217), see also Fakhar al-Ulama (pg.60) of Sayyid Ishtiyaaq Azhar)</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">so…. holding it down with 40 rupees and mango kulfis….hmmmm</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>MAULANA ASHRAF ALI THANWI ON 600 RUPEE DRINK MONEY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another deobandi Sufi Churchfather Ashraf Ali Thanwi, lets see how he was holding it down and not dropping like a mango kulfi !!! He says in his daily discourses,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“He said in a discourse that a person asked me how would you behave and work with the british if you had government? I (Ashraf Ali) replied, “I will govern them because since Allaah would have given me the government I will govern over them but with this we will look after them with ease and comfort because they have given me comfort (ie looked after me comfortably). This is also the teaching of Islam and the teachings of Islam can not be found in any of the world religions therefore this is divine teaching to the extent that even the rights of non muslims have been sanctified….etc.”</strong> <strong>(Malfoozat Hakeem al-Ummat (6/102 discourse no.87) (also known as al-Afadhaat al-Yaumiyyah Minal Afadaat al-Qawmiyyah)</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It appears the British Colonial Government gave Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi comfort and kept in ease and comfort. On its apparent meaning this does not seem much and your probably thinking whats the point? Well lets move onto the next point which highlights what this comfort was,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This comfort was a monthly salary of 600 rupees from the British Colonial Government, yes meaning Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi was on the payroll. There was officially no verbal acceptance of this but it was well known amongst most quarters and especially the deobandis, who were presumably holding it down and not dropping!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>THE JAMIAT ULAMA HIND (JUI) </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the monthly journal of the Jamiat Ulama Hind and Jamait Ulama Islam (JUI), who were and still are a deobandi extension on the political front known as Makalamah as-Sadrain published from Deoband, they say,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Look Hazrat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi was our and your muslim elder and leader, the people have been heard saying about him that he would get paid 600 rupees a month from the (British) Government. With this they would also say the Maulana was unaware the government was giving him the money but the government would give him the money in such a way that he would not suspect anything.” (Makalamah as-Sadrain pg.9)</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So now we know where the money was coming from for the mango kulfis and why, how and WHAT the deobandis were holding down.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Jamiat Ulama Hind (JUI) known current as Jamiat Ulama India who over decades have been unleashing all kinds poison and venomous against the Ahlul Hadeeth and Salafis in every possible manner and even organised international conferences in England against the Salafis. For example the current Ustadh of Hadeeth in Dar al-Uloom Deoband is Sayyid Arshad Madani (Son of  Hussain Ahmad Madani Deobandi, a founding father) who is also the President of Jamiat Ulama Hind. They openly admit that they too were on the payroll of the British Government. Reading the following passage from the Makalamah</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Makalamah as-Sadrain (pg.7)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>JAMAAT UT-TABLEEGH ON THE BRITISH COLONIAL PAYROLL</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Makalamah Sadrain journal goes onto mention even the leader of Jamaat ut-Tableegh ie Maulana Ilyas Khandelvi was also getting money from the British government via Haji Rashid Ahmed which was later stopped. The passage also goes on to say a hindu gained an administrative position within the British Colonial Raj and thereafter informed the government the money being spent on these sufi deobandis and tableeghis was useless and wasteful. (Probably because they were sitting and having mango kulfis with the Raj imperialists in agreement)</span></p>

In one part of the second volume Maulana Muhammad Tayyab adds a note which does not necessarily apply to Maulana Qasim Nanotvi but rather to the Deobandi elders!!! He says,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“He had no interest even in the affairs of the city and this was also the affair of the individuals who were old employees and getting pensions from the government and hence they had no reason to doubts them at all (with regards to their loyalty).” (Sawaaneh Qasimi (2/247)</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maulana Ashiq Ilahi Meerthy writes about Maulana Qasim Nanotvi,</span></p>
<blockquote>

So he took a step forward and looked at his foot behind (and then whilst intending to lift it) he said, “He was just here” and then carried on walking!!! This is how brave they were and how they were HOLDING IT DOWN, he could not even speak the truth</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://i1.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/t2.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2172" src="https://i1.wp.com/ahlulhadeeth.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/t2.jpg?resize=550%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="t2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the British Colonial Government because apprehensive and vigilant with regards to the revolts post 1857 they kept a close eye on everyone and in this regard they went looking for Maulana Rasheed Ahmed Gangohi to question him. So Maulana Rasheed Ahmed Gangohi wrote,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“When in reality I have been obedient to the government, the false accusation (of revolt,opposition or disloyalty) will not harm me at all and even if I was to be executed, the government is the master and can do what it likes.”(Tazkiratul Rasheed (1/80)</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furtheremore Tazkiratul Rasheed is riddled with the idea of waging Jihad against the renegades, those who were revolting against the British Government, to the extent they even said the one fighting the renegades and those revolting in favour of the British Government will die as martyrs. There is further reference to Maulana Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi and his spiritual guide Hafiz Zamin fighting with these renegades and those who were actually Holding it down!!! (Tazkiratul Rasheed (1/74-75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Moving on, the scavenging deceptive Deo-Kats have always had a close loving relationship with the colonial British Raj. In the 1912, then the viceroy of British India was Charles Hardinge who was attacked by a group of Hindu revolutionaries who threw a home made bomb at him in New Delhi. The viceroy was injured but escaped with flesh wounds. The Deobandi scholars issued the following statement in their monthly journal, the editor was Habeeb ur Rehmaan but what he says is utterly shocking and this shows the reality of the Deo-Kats having mango kulfis and how they were holding it down,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“An Attack on HIS EXCELLENCY THE VICEROY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(after some waffle……..  unfortunately with the progression of western education in India, bomb (making and or throwing) is also progressing. A number of incidents have occurred in the last few years but the one most worthy to be hated from them all and the one that disturbed the peace was the tragedy in which HIS EXCELLENCY Lord Hardinge, such a compassionate and merciful viceroy(!!!) was injured when an unknown assailant threw a bomb at him when he was making his imperial entrance into Delhi (whilst changing the capital of the British rule from Kolkatta to Delhi) on the 23rd Decenber 1912 (Which was the first day of the new era of India). HIS EXCELLENCY VICEROY was severely injured.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Shura, the teachers, the current students and the old students (ie Jamiat Ulama Hind [India]) of Dar al-Uloom (deoband) all feel the affect of this tragedy. Maulana Muhammad Ahmed (the son of Maulana Qasim Nanotvi) the rector (in charge) of Dar al-Uloom Deoband has on behalf of all of the friends has expressed his sympathy and his anger and hate for such an act. Which was answered with great thanks (by the british government)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>All Praise be to Allaah that HIS EXCELLENCY VICEROY’s life was not harmed and Lady Hardinge was also safe and with the blessing of Allaah the Most High the health of the respected Viceroy is improving on a daily basis. We hope very near HIS EXCELLENCY opens his council in Delhi.” (al-Qasim vol.3 issue 6, 1331 Muharram, the title page even says printed from Madrassah Deoband!!!)</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So i bet now silence, the cat got the Deo-Kats tongue. Making bold statements and feebly attempting to attack the salafis and the Ahlul Hadeeth. So tell us who was having mango kulfis and not holding it down at all!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore when there were</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">internal politics in Dar al-Uloom Deoband and with another modern hanafi educational institute (set up and promoted by the colonial British Empirial Raj) ie Aligarh. 2 well known and prominent deobandi hanafi scholars, namely Maulana Mahmood al-Hasan (the first student of Deoband) and Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi attempted to create an atmosphere of unity between the two whilst both institutes were building up fervour against the british. However the leaders of Deoband and Aligarh were not in favour of this and did not want to upset the government. Hafiz Muhammad Ahmad who was the rector of Deoband (and the son of Maulana Qasim Nanotvi) had already accepted a title of recognition from the British.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is said he would keep the British government rule in Uttar Pradesh (northen India) happy and would also inform them of the activities of Maulana Mahmood al-Hasan (who was getting a little rebellious and bare in mind he was the only one and there was also a reason behind this). He would have good relations with the governor of the area and would often inform them of their activities with the aim of saving Dar al-Uloom from British reprimand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This relationship is further presented when the Governor of U.P. was invited to Deoband and words of praise were presented for him which included the following,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Thanking his honour and the ruler of India, his excellency the viceroy for the title given to Maulana Muhammad Ahmad as being the Light of the Ulama (Shams al-Ulama) their sincere heartly thanks. The action of the government does not only establish that they respect the muslims leaders and guides who are worthy of it but it also answers the objection of the claimants of independence (from the british) that honour and dignity is given to those worthy of it. It is correct and we accept this reality that it is not our natural inclination to gain materialistic or worldly gains nor a part of of our religious obligation. However due to the will of Allaah if our current rulers and government give us any honour or dignity then why should we not accept it…… </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(some waffle) Your Honour today we have gathered here for a special thanking of (your) benevolence and favour not only on the rector but on all of the group and similarly we have in front of us your favours and (Financial) courtesy on the Dar al-Uloom Deoband which the rector (ie Hafidh Muhammad Ahmed  – Son of Maulana Qasim Nanotvi) tells us about regularly. Similarly due to these favourable terms the muslim public will trust on Dar al-Uloom Deoband and our policy will be strengthened which major (army) officers of europe have been praising us about. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>We only have one intentions and only one intention alone and that is the preservation of religious freedom (hmmmm) and nothing but just the preservation of religious freedom. Therefore anything outside this ie rejecting any political movement or accepting it is out of our established unchangeable ideology.” (Refer to Rasheed Ahmed Jalandhari’s journal al-Ma’arif Lahore 1996 Jul-Dec, pg.71-73, also Rasheed Ahmed Jalandhari’s The Teaching Curriculum in British India – Dar al-Uloom Deoband (1/247-248) Islamabad 1989  Edn. National Book Foundation, also The Indian Muslims – A Historical Record (5/51-54) of Shaan Muhammad, also ‘The Expulsion of Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi from Dar al-Uloom Deoband’ in the al-Wali Journal (Vol.15 issue 2 &amp; 3 (pgs.30-32) 1991) by Abu Salmaan Shah Jahanpuri)   </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such words show you the close connection and link between the British and the Deobandi School of Thought. Maulana Sayyid Asad Madani the son of Maulana Hussain Ahmed also says Maulana Mahmood al-Hasan was carelessly inviting the danger of the British government.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dr Barbara Daly Metcalf writes in her book as follows about Rashid Ahmad Gangohi and the Deobandis:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“The Deobandis made sure that they conformed in every way to a posture of loyalty. Rashid Ahmad, for this reason, refused to accept a grant of 5000 Rupees a year from the Shah of Afghanistan for fear that a political link might be suspected. And the school celebrated ceremonial occasions like coronations with appropriate pomp, and observed times of crises, like Queen Victoria’s last illness, with fitting prayers and messages.”</strong> <strong>(<i>Islamic Revival in British India, 1860-1900</i>, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1982) (pages 154-155)</strong></span></p>
