				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many people have authored articles and treatise with regards to this issue, namely of Isbal ie letting one’s garments fall below the ankles. Without the need the address the intricacies of the issue and the overwhelming clarity in the prohibition and unlawfulness of Isbal, we thought it was perhaps important to look at the most common argument often presented in defence of this prohibited action.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people claim it is mustahab ie recommended to raise the garments below the ankle and therefore it is permissible and lawful to let the garments dangle below the ankles, since it is only mustahab. This notion is often pushed by the neo-madhabists and all those on the ‘difference of opinion’ thinking which is later extended to the all inclusive Manhaj, more so in latter times. We are not referring to the view of early scholars who are generally agreed in its prohibition. This needs to be restricted to those who deliberately drag their garments out of sheer arrogance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This accommodation offered by some of the people of the madhabs and they often retort with the words this is the view of the majority in letting the garment fall below the ankles. We must remember, we are referring to this issue with the condition of without arrogance, for even they are agreed with arrogance is prohibited and unlawful, this is unanimous agreed upon by all quarters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We share three hadith which rebut the claim; it is lawful to let garments fall below the ankles if done without conceit or arrogance. It must be noted the hadith of Abu Hurairah RadhiAllahu Anhu in which he narrates the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whatever of the garment falls below the ankles is in the fire.”</em> (Bukhari no.5787)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is general and can only be restricted with clear authentic texts, this restriction has to be real or at least be a limiting factor. Some people claim the hadith which are general ie the hadith quoted above and the numerous other ahadith which talk about punishment and allude to prohibition, which do not mention the condition of arrogance ie Khuyala in letting the garments fall below the ankle are general and therefore should be specified and restricted by the hadith which do mention the condition of arrogance. This has been mentioned by Imam Ibn Abdul Barr and Imam Nawawi as well as others. (al-Tamhid (3:244), Sharh Sahih Muslim (1:71)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn al-Arabi answers this notion and says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is not permissible for a person to let his garments fall below his ankles and say, “I do not have arrogance (in this ie when I let my garment below my ankles I do not do it out of arrogance) as the prohibition incorporates the generality of the wording as well as the reason (ie arrogance). So when such a word incorporates a command or ruling, it is impermissible for a person to say It does not refer to me because the reason does not apply to me (ie I am not arrogant). This opposes the Shari’ah while the claim is unacceptable. Rather is it is exactly due to his arrogance that he lets his clothes and lower garment fall below his ankles and hence his lying is established (ie his claim without arrogance).”</em> (A’ridah al-Ahwadhi (7:238)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr expands on this and further said that isbal (letting garments fall below the ankles) necessitates dragging clothes and dragging clothes necessitates arrogance despite the one wearing the garment does not intend arrogance. (Fath al-Bari (1:264)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>FIRST HADITH</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Juri Jabir bin Sulaym RadhiAllahu Anhu said the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Lift your lower garment to the middle of your shin and if you are unable to do so, then at least to your ankles (ie just above). Beware and be warned from lowering your garment (below your ankles) for verily this is arrogance and Allah does not love/like arrogance.”</em> (Abu Dawud (no.4084), al-Tirmidhi (no.2722) who graded the hadith Hasan-Sahih, al-Sunan al-Kubra (10:236) of Imam al-Baihaqi, al-Mu’ajam al-Kabir (no.6386) of Imam al-Tabarani, Shaikh al-Albani graded it Sahih in Sahih Abu Dawud (2:515-516) and Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi (3:88-89), Imam al-Hakim in his al-Mustadrak (4:186) who graded it Sahih and Imam al-Dhahabi concurred.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The wording of another hadith is,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Beware and be warned from lowering your garment (below the ankles), for verily it is arrogance (/conceit) and Allah does not love/like arrogance.”</em> (Musnad Ahmad (5:63), Sahih Ibn Hibban (1: 364-365 no.511, 1:369 no.522), Mu’ajam al-Shuyukh (no.1491) of Imam Ibn Asakir who said the hadith is Hasan-Gharib)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The authentic variations of this hadith clearly show lowering one’s garments below the ankles is in of itself arrogance and therefore the false notion of whether one does it out of pride or arrogance is dismissed. It is in fact a futile thought based on the words of this clear authentic hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The claim, one can lower his garment below the ankles if done without arrogance, pride or conceit is permissible and the understanding and line of argument of the prohibition, unlawfulness and punishment is only applicable when done out of arrogance and pride is therefore clearly rebutted. This leads onto the view of having the garments above the ankle as being mustahab or recommended, to be null and void but rather is is mandatory and obligatory as the scholars have explained.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #333399;">THE SECOND HADITH</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah Ibn &#8216;Umar narrates,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I happened to pass before Allah&#8217;s Messenger </em><em>ﷺ</em> <em>with my lower garment trailing (upon the ground). He said: &#8216;Abdullah, tug up your lower garment, I tugged it up, and he again said: Tug it still further, and I tugged it still further and I went on tugging it afterward, whereupon some of the people said: To what extent? Thereupon he said: To the middle of the shanks.”</em> (Muslim (no.2086)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another narration the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Abdullah ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Who is this? I said I Abdullah. He replied and said, “If you are Abdullah then lift your lower garment.”</em> (Musnad Ahmad (2:147), Musnad Abu Ya’la (5644) of Qadi Abu Ya’la, Shu’bal Iman (no.6119) of Imam al-Baihaqi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not ask Abdullah ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma his intention or reason with him, he did not ask him if he had lowered his garment due to pride or arrogance or just naturally. Rather he ordered him to raise his garment irrespective of his intent or whether it was done out of arrogance or conceit</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Husn al-Dhan indicates this illustrious companions Abdullah ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma would have always had his garments above his ankles. He was known for his fervor in following the Sunnah. Another possible explanation offered by the scholars is that Abdullah ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma had his garment above his ankles anyway but it was just above the ankles and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ considered this to be dragging and thus asked him to raise his garments further, up to the middle of his shin. Nonetheless the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had love for his companions and knew them like no one else, while being the most aware about them, ie he would have known if his companions had arrogance. Despite knowing Abdullah ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma and Husn al-Dhan dictates that he did not have arrogance, despite this he was commanded to raise his garment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Abdullah ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhuma would issue legal edicts to people who dragged their garments based on this, he would narrate the hadith from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He includes the words due to arrogance, see (Sahih Muslim (no.2085).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, in the main hadith he himself had his garment low, as the text of the hadith indicates, hence the Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked him to raise it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the hadith of Abu Bakr, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Abu Bakr you are not from the people who has arrogance, but despite this Abu Bakr RadhiAllahu anhu would position his garments above his ankles as the wording of the hadith indicates and it would only drop if he did not take care. (Bukhari no.5784)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">None of the Sahabah had their garments below their ankles, the ones who did, had a reason but despite this they still raised their garments. The evidence is the report of Shuraid bin Suwaid when the Thaqafi man was ordered to raise his garment by the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and the Thaqafi man had his garments above his ankles until his death. (Musnad al-Humaidi (no.810), Musnad Ahmad (no.19494)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also Umar bin al-Khattab advised a young companion to raise his garments while he was dying with an open wound on his abdomen (Bukhari (no.3700)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The successor ie Tabi’i, Abu Ishaq al-Sabi’i said he saw many companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who would have their lower garments to the middle of their calves and he mentions, Usamah bin Zayd, Ibn Umar, Zayd bin Arqam and Bara ibn A’zib. (Musannaf Ibn Abi shaybah (8:392-393)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad bin Sirin mentions from the companions he saw; they would all have their garments to the middle of their calves. (Musannaf ibn Abi Shaybah (8:389)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #333399;">THE THIRD HADITH</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah narrates</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“While a man was praying letting his lower garment trail, the Messenger of Allah (</em><em>ﷺ</em><em>) said to him: Go and perform ablution. He, therefore, went and performed ablution and then returned. He (the prophet) again said: Go and perform ablution. He again went, performed ablution and returned. A man said to him (the prophet): Messenger of Allah, why did you order him to perform ablution? He said: he was praying with lower garment trailing, and does not accept the prayer of a man who lets his lower garment trail.”</em> (Abu Dawud no’s 638, 4086, It is also transmitted by Imam Nasa’i in al-Sunan al-Kubra (no.9703), Sunan al-Kubra (2:241) of Imam al-Baihaqi, Sahih Ibn Hibban (2406), Musnad Ahmad (4:67), Riyadh al-Salihin (no.797).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani does grade this hadith to be weak in Da’if Sunan Abi Dawud (p.53 and p.331). Shaikh Salim al-Hilali mentions the reason as Abu Ja’afar, who is in this particular chain of Abu Dawud is unknown ie majhul. (Bahjah al-Nazirin (1:619)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair Ali Za’i graded the hadith as having a Hasan Chain and said it is transmitted by Ahmad (4:67), Abu Ja’afar al-Madani is Hasan (al-Hadith) according to Tirmidhi (no.3448), Ibn Hibban authenticated him in his Sahih (no.2406), Hafiz Ibn Hajr strengthened him in his Takhrij al-Azkar, as did Imam Nawawi in Riyadh al-Salihin, who authenticated his hadith (his words are to follow), Yahya bin Abi Kathir narrates it from Abu Ja’afar and he would only narrate from trustworthy people as Abu Hatim said. (Sunan Abi Dawud (1:496)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair Ali Za’i also indicated its authenticity by not including it in his <em>Anwar al-Sahifah Fil Ahadith al-Da’ifah Min al-Sunan al-Arb’a.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The statement of Imam Abu Hatim can be found in al-Jarh wa’t Ta’dil (9:142) and he adds the words, <em>“Imam.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam al-Dhahabi agreed with this grading as can be seen from his al-Kaba’ir (p.179).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz al-Haithami went onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ahmad transmitted it and its narrators are the narrators of the Sahih.”</em> (MAjma’a al-Zawa’id (5:125)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same people who present Imam Nawawi’s statement that letting the garments below the ankles is makruh if done without conceit or arrogance forget that he authenticated this hadith. Essentially the people who put forward these arguments all agree themselves in the severe punishment as well as the general rule to have the garments above the ankle but at times due to this expansive manhaj and accommodating some of the views of the madhabs say it is only makruh and not prohibited if done for any other reason.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being, despite the fact that the grading of this hadith is disputed, where some have authenticated it based on the different variations of the chain while others have authenticated it. The detractors and hanbali madhab sympathisers present the statement of Imam Nawawi as mentioned above but he himself authenticates the aforementioned hadith, more specifically the chain in his Riyadh al-Salihin (no.797) where he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Transmitted by Abu Dawud with an authentic-Sahih chain on according to the conditions set forth by Imam Muslim.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shafi’i Asharite Muhammad bin E’lan al-Siddiqi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The prayer of the person who lovers his garment below his ankle is not accepted and he should seek forgiveness and repent.”</em> (Dalil al-Falihin (3:232)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, some of the scholars have said the meaning is authentic as it is supported by another hadith as transmitted by Abdullah ibn Mas’ud RadhiAllahu Anhu which states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“</em><em>I heard the Messenger of Allah (</em><em>ﷺ</em><em>) say: He who lets his garment trail during prayer out of pride, Allah, the Almighty, has nothing to do with pardoning him and protecting him from Hell.”</em> (Sunan Abu Dawud no.637), al-Kubra (no.9680) of Imam al-Nasa’i, Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi (no.351), Shaikh al-Albani graded it Sahih in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud (p.189-190)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows, Allah will not accept the prayer of the Musbil ie the one who lowers his garment below his ankles, Allah will not pardon him or protect him from Hell Let us assume for arguments sake, the people who claim it is acceptable if done without arrogance or conceit, then we ask why do they roll up their lower garments or trousers when they pray? Surely the conscious state of not being arrogant and conceited remains within and outside of the prayer!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It they say this last hadith again mentions pride, we say the hadith mentions trailing in prayer however we know no one walks and prays, so the trailing here is understood as general isbal. This means letting your garments fall below your ankles is considered trailing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This view of the prayer not being accepted was also the view held by the pious ancestors. Mujahid the Tabi’i said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It would be said (indicated the general majority view) the salah is not accepted of the one who lets his lower garment touch his ankles.”</em> (Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (8:388)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hussain bin Abdur Rahman, also a Tabi’i said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I heard Dharr bin Abdullah al-Hamdani say, “The Salah is not accepted of the one whose lower garment touches the ground.”</em> (Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (8:388)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn al-Qayyim said while explaining this hadith that</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allah knows best that lowering the garment below the ankles is a sin and whoever commits a sin, he will be ordered to perform wudu and pray because wudu extinguishes the fire of the sin.”</em> (Tahdhib Ala Sunan Abi Dawud (6:50).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn al-Arabi and Shaikh al-Taybi have also mentioned something similar in their respective books. In fact, Hafiz ibn al-Arabi said only the arrogant and conceited person lowers his garment below his ankle whereas when a person prays he is in a state of humility and thus both states are conflicting and contradictory. (A’ridah al-Ahwadhi (7:238) and Sharh al-Taybi (2:268)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers these ahadith especially the last one, of the prayer of the musbil not being accepted is a serious warning to all those who claim the permissibility of letting the garments fall below the ankles if done without arrogance and conceit. Also the severe warning that Allah will not pardon the musbil, how much more severe can it be for us to realise and pretend it is the majority view, which is often just limited to some out of context statements of the later scholars, and even they alluded to the clear cut prohibition of Isbal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are numerous other ahadith which make the heart tremble in the depravity of letting the garments fall below the ankles, the believer is reminded to be humble and lock away his alter ego while garbing himself with the fallacious notion that he is free from arrogance and conceit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, based on the numerous ahadith and the severe punishment which they mention as well as the dire consequences, one should always try to be safe and abstain from views, which are not only unsafe but also lack textual evidence, except some views.  For example, there is not a single clear authentic hadith or report which mentions the permissibility of letting the garments fall below the ankles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers do not be naive and fall the opt-repeated notion of majority view, whereas we have shown the pious ancestors ie the Salaf us-Salah, ie the companions, successors and their successors were unanimous in wearing their garments above their ankles. The earlier statements from the Tabi’in indicate all of the companions were upon this way. If this is the case where has this mustahab view come from and why follow unclear statements which talk about if done without arrogance or conceit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly let any person claim he is free from arrogance and conceit! Anyone, of course not, then why all the gurgle? This issue is as clear as the sun, except those who want to open the doors to this all inclusive manhaj-difference of opinion approach and also in the blind ignorant defence of the position of the madhabs, especially the modern neo-Hanbali Madhabists, who are far away from the methods and way of the great Hanbali scholars. Allahs Aid and refuge is sought. Amin</span></p>

<p><strong>Q4: <em>&#8220;Allah created Adam in His Own Image.[1]&#8221;</em> Does this mean that all the characteristics of Adam are also Divine?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It is authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) that he (peace be upon him) said: Allah created Adam in His own image In a narration by Ahmad and some scholars of Hadith, the same Hadith reads: in the image of Al-Rahman (the Most Merciful). In the first Hadith, the pronoun refers to Allah. Some scholars like Ahmad (may Allah be merciful to him), Is-haq ibn Rahawayh and the Imams of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) said: &#8220;We have to accept the Hadith in a way befitting Allah without Tashbih (comparison), Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation) or Ta`til (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes). It does not necessarily mean that His Image (Glorified be He) is like the image of human beings. Similarly, attributing a face, hand, fingers, feet, leg, anger, and the like attributes does not entail that Allah&#8217;s Attributes are like those of the human beings. He (Glorified be He) is described as what He tells about Himself and what His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) said in a way befitting Him, without being in similitude with any of His Creatures. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: &#8220;There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; [Surah al-Shura 42:11].</p>
<p>We have to accept this in the way that the Messenger intended without Takyif (descriptive designation of Allah&#8217;s Attributes) or Tamthil. The meaning &#8211; Allah knows best &#8211; is that He created Adam in His Image with a face and ability to hear, speak, see and do whatever he wants. It is not necessarily that the image is the same. This is a general rule according to the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream), meaning that the Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and Hadiths speaking about Divine Attributes should be accepted as true without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Takyif, Tamthil or Ta`til. They confirm His Names and Attributes without Tamthil and exalt Him above being similar to His Creatures without Ta`til, contrary to those who commit Bid`ah (innovation in religion) of Al-Mu`attilah (deniers of Allah&#8217;s Attributes) and Mushabihah (those who liken Allah’s Attributes to those of His creation). The hearing, seeing and knowledge of the creature is never like those of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), for none of His creatures can be compared to Him. Indeed, there is nothing like Him, for the Attributes of Allah are perfect and infinite, with no shortcomings. As for the attributes of the creatures, they are finite and imperfect.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p><span style="color: #999999">Fatwas of Ibn Baz&gt; Volume 25&gt; Book on Hadith, First Section&gt; Book on Iman&gt;Degree of the authenticity of the Hadith: Allah created Adam in His own image</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">33- What is the authenticity of the Hadith that reads: <em>Allah created Adam in His Own Image[1]</em>.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: The following Hadith is recorded in the Sahih collection of Al-Bukhari, Book of Asking Permission: Allah has created Adam in His own image It falls within the subject of Asking Permission and the Beginning of Creation. Its exact wording is: <em>&#8220;Allah created Adam in the image of the Beneficent.[2]&#8221;</em> Ibn Hajar (may Allah be merciful to him) commented: It is soundly reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated that Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam in the Image of the Beneficent. How authentic is this Hadith?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This information contained in this Hadith is sound. The Hadith is Sahih (authentic) as confirmed by Is-haq, Ahmad and others. It means that Allah is All-Hearer and All-Seer but it does not conclude that His Hearing or Seeing resemble those of human beings. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <em>&#8220;There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; [Surah al-Shura 42:11]</em>. This denotes that Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam in His Own Image and endowed him with the faculties of hearing, seeing and speech and with hands and feet. Yet, Allah&#8217;s (Exalted be He) Image does resemble that of human beings, High Exalted be He above having likes or peers.</p>
<p>Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; [Surah al-Shura 42:11] And, &#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221; [Surah al-Ikhlaas 112:4] and, &#8220;Do you know of any who is similar to Him?&#8221; [Surah al-Maryam 19:65] And, &#8220;So put not forward similitudes for Allâh (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything).&#8221; [Surah an-Nahl 16:74].</p>

<p><span style="color: #999999">Fatwas of Ibn Baz&gt; Volume 28&gt; Book on subject related to `Aqidah&gt; the Creed of Ahl Al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community)&gt; Questions&gt;Degree of authenticity of Hadith: Allah created Adam in His own image</span></p>
<p><strong>Q9: What is the degree of authenticity of the following Hadith: &#8220;Allah created Adam in His own image.[1]&#8221; Or &#8220;&#8230; In the Merciful&#8217;s image&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it is a Hadith Sahih (authentic Hadith). Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam in His own image i.e. He can hear, see, speak, with eyes, hands, and feet. However, the Hadith does not imply any Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation), for Allah (Glorified be He) states: &#8220;There is nothing like Him&#8221; [Surah al-Shura 42:11] And: &#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221; [Surah al-Ikhlaas 112:4].</p>
<p>This is the explanation of the Hadith by scholars of Ahl-ul-Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah) such as Ahmad, Is-haq and others (may Allah have mercy on them all).</p>

<p>Al-Imaam Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah) discusses the hadeeth: Allaah Created Adam upon His Image</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> A hadeeth has been reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in which he prohibits cursing the face (literally saying &#8216;may Allaah make your face ugly&#8217;), and it mentions that Allaah (Subhaanahu) created Adam upon His Image. So what is the safe belief in reference to this hadeeth?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The hadeeth is confirmed from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), that he said: &#8220;When one of you hits (someone else), then let him avoid the face, for indeed Allaah created Aadam upon His Image.&#8221; And in another wording (of this hadeeth) he said, &#8220;upon the Image of Ar-Rahmaan (the Most Merciful).&#8221; And this (hadeeth) does not necessitate resembling or likening Allaah (to His creatures).</p>
<p>The meaning of it with the people of knowledge is that Allaah created Adam hearing, seeing, and speaking if he wished to do so (i.e. Aadam had these attributes). This is also the description of Allaah, for verily He is Hearing, Seeing, and Speaking if He wishes, and He has a Face, Magnificent and Exalted is He.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean resembling or likeness. Rather, the Image that is for Allaah is not like the image that is for the creation. It only means that He is Hearing, Seeing, and Speaking if and whenever He wishes to do so. And thus did Allaah create Aadam as one who is hearing, seeing, and possessing a face, and a foot. However, the hearing (of one) is not like the hearing (of the other), and the seeing (of one) is not like the seeing (of the other), and the speaker is not like the (other) speaker. Rather, Allaah has attributes that are befitting His Majesty and His Sublimity, and the slave (of Allaah) has attributes that are befitting him. The attributes of the slave (of Allaah) is exposed to cessation and deficiency, whereas the attributes of Allaah are perfect and not exposed to deficiency, cessation of being, or ending. For this reason, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic said, &#8220;There is nothing like Hime, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.&#8221; And He, Glory be unto Him, said, &#8220;And there is none comparable or coequal to Him.&#8221; Thus, it is not permissible to strike the face (of someone), nor to curse the face (saying &#8216;may Allaah make your face ugly&#8217;).</p>
