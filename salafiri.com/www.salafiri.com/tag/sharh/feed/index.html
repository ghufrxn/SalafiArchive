				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>[This is an excerpt from the forthcoming Sharh of Bukhari by Shaikh Muhammad Ghondalwi (1405H), short passages are being presented for the avid reader]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some foolish people think the prophetic hadith was written in the third islamic century and that written hadith did not exist before the advent of Imam Bukhari, ie before he compiled his book. They say the people heard these narrations from different places; centuries later after the Messenger of Allah  ﷺ and therefore hadith has no legal authority in islamic law and neither is it to be relied upon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In reality these people are from the underlings of the rejectors of hadith who lack the mental capacity to comprehend the sciences of hadith and thats why they utter such ridiculous statements and views. The truth and fact of the matter is that numerous books were written and composed before the time of Imam Bukhari and his <em>Sahih</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For instance the teacher of Imam Bukhari, Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal had collated and compiled his large work on hadith famously known as the <em>Musnad</em>. Imam al-Shafi&#8217;i who was the teacher of Imam Ahmad, wrote a book before his time and was considered an early work, famously known as <em>Kitab al-Umm</em> which contained many hadith. Some of the scholars took all of the hadith from <em>Kitab al-Umm</em> and compiled a separate work and called it <em>Musnad al-Shafi&#8217;i</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise and similarly, Imam Malik was the teacher of Imam al-Shafi&#8217;i who also compiled a book on hadith at a very early stage such that it became so famous even until today, which people know as <em>Muwatta Imam Malik</em>. We also had books composed by authors of that era which include the likes of the <em>Musannaf</em> of Imam Abd al-Razzaq and before that the <em>Compendium</em> of Mu&#8217;ammar. We also had the Compendium known as the <em>Sahifah</em> of Hummam ibn Munabbeh, who was the student of Abu Hurairah RadiAllahu Anhu.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The transmission of all of these ahadith traces back to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Therefore, those who say the ahadith were compiled in the third century by here-say and that they had no origin prior to this, is a clear evidence of the ignorance of the rejectors of hadith who are oblivious to the science of hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would also write the ahadith. The companion Abdullah ibn Amr bin al-Aas RadiAllahu Anhu, wrote a compendium called <em>Sahifah Sadiqah</em> and he wrote this compendium by directly listening to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly the companion, Abdullah ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhuma would also write many hadith from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. So much so that when he died his son, Ali bin Abdullah had to organise camel loads of his books and compendiums to them, which shows he had many books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise and similarly there were many companions who would write the ayat and also write the hadith of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Writing in those days was not a common thing (TN &#8211; This was because their norm was to memorise with precision) neither was writing formulated as it is in our times. They also did not utilise I&#8217;rab (i.e. Taskhil) or dots (on letters to distinguish) like we do in our times. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Minhah al-bari sharh sahih al-bukhari 1:.56 (manuscript form), edited and compiled by Shaikh Muhammad Ramzan al-Salafi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Sharh is being Published by Maktabah Quddusia, Lahore, Pakistan)</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">If the Affair of the One Accused of Killing is Unclear, Who Should Issue the Blood Money?</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[525]     </strong>Malik from Abu Layla ibn Abdullah ibn Abd ar-Rahman ibn Sahl from Sahl ibn Abi Hathma that some of the great men of his people informed him that Abdullah ibn Sahl and Muhayyisa went out to Khaybar because extreme poverty had overtaken them. Muhayyisa returned and said that Abdullah ibn Sahl had been killed and thrown in a shallow well or spring. The jews came and he said, &#8220;By Allah! You have killed him.&#8221; They said, &#8220;By Allah! We have not killed him!&#8221; Then he made for his people and mentioned that to them. Then he, his brother Huwayyisa, who was older than him, and Abd ar-Rahman, set out. Muhayyisa began to speak, as he had been at Khaybar. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, &#8220;The greater first, the greater first,&#8221; meaning in age. So Huwayyisa spoke and then Muhayyisa spoke. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, &#8220;Either they pay your companion&#8217;s blood-money or we will declare war against them.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wrote that to them and they wrote, &#8220;By Allah, we did not kill him!&#8221; The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to Huwayyisa, Muhayyisa, and Abd ar-Rahman, &#8220;Do you swear and claim the blood of your companion?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Shall the jews swear to you?&#8221; They said, &#8220;But they are not muslims.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave blood-money from his own property, and sent them one hundred camels to their house. Sahl added, &#8220;A red camel among them kicked me.&#8221;</span></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Agreed Upon, al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/877-878 hadith no.1696, book 44, chapter 1, hadeeth no.1) at-Tamhid (24/150-151) and al-Istidhkar (no.1725)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by Bukhari (7192), Muslim (6/1669) from the hadith of Malik and in the transmission of Yahya bin Yaha it says &#8220;Wa Rijalun&#8221; </span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADEETH]</span></h5>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">From day one the yahud and all the Kuffar have been ardent enemies of the Muslims</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Muslims were very poor at the advent of Islam and then Allah gave them wealth.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A person can take an oath if he is very sure of something but the final decision can only be based on evidence and not on an oath except if an oath is requested</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">One should honour the etiquette of a gathering, for example one should remain silent and listen to the older person or a scholar when they speak.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The right to defend a Muslim is the right of the Islamic Government.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">You cannot issue an edict without witness or evidences if the accused denies the charges.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">An issue from the science of hadith is that for a narrator to be trustworthy he must be a Muslim. Thus, a kafir or mushrik cannot be upright and trustworthy. This hadith confirms this principle.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">If a killer is not apprehended, the family of the deceased are given blood money from the Governments treasury.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">If the kufar are treacherous or unjust or there is a doubt concerning this, then according to indicative factors an agreement can be abrogated.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">If the accused takes an oath and denies the allegation, he is free unless clear evidences are presented.</span></li>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/844 hadith no.1639, book 42, chapter 3, hadeeth no.8) at-Tamhid (24/205) and al-Istidhkar (no.1767)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted al-Nasa&#8217;i in al-Kubra (Tuhfatul Ashraf no,12119), from the hadith of Malik, from the Hadith of Malik as above and it has supports in Bukhari (5602), Muslim (1986) and it is thus Sahih.</span></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since everything intoxicant is haram and sometimes Nabidh made from dates and raisins can become intoxicants, therefore from the perspective of Sadh al-Dhari&#8217; i.e. a means to prevent a harm, we have been prohibited from drinking Nabidh.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Islam is a Din that wishes good for humanity.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Who is the trustworthy narrator referred to here? This is unclear, however in Sunan al-Kubra of al-Nasa&#8217;i (from Tuhfatul Ashraf 9:261 no.12119) and Tamhid (24:206), Amr bin al-Harith who is trustworthy, transmits from Bukayr bin Abdullah ibn al-Ashajj, there are also authentic supporting narrations which support this hadith, therefore this hadith is authentic wa Lillahil Hamd. </span></li>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[1] Umar Ibn Khattab (رضى الله عنه) said the M<span style="color: #000000;">essenger of Allah ﷺ said “Actions are by intentions and everyone will get what they intended, so whoever migrated for the Sake of Allah and His Messenger then he migrated for the Sake of Allah and His Messenger and whoever migrated for this world or to marry a woman then his migration will be for that sake for which he migrated” (Agreed upon)</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[REFERENCES]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bukhari 1, 54, 2529, 3898, 5070, 6689, 6953, Muslim 1907, Imarah 155, Nasai, 2:135 no.3825, al-Ta&#8217;liqat al-salafiyyah 2/135, with its wording with the words &#8220;for the world&#8221; instead of &#8220;to the world&#8221; as is the case in some of the editions of Nasai.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. This Hadith is transmitted via the chain of Yahya Ibn Sa’id al-Ansari from Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim at-Taymi from Alqamah bin Waqas al-Laythi from Umar bin al-Khattab (رضى الله عنه) in Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim and in other books of hadith and it is hadith which is <em>Sahih Gharib</em> and is also Khabar al-Wahid. (i.e. Khabr al-Ahad)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. It is established from this Sahih hadith and other evidences that it is not necessary for a hadith to be mutawatir or mashur for it to be accepted, rather Sahih khabar Wahid also constitutes evidence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. For any action to be accepted it, it has to be based on on the intention, therefore it is obligatory to have an intention for wudu, Ghusl, prayer, fasting, hajj and all other forms of worship. The jurists have an ijma (i.e. unanimous agreement) on this (<em>al-Aydah ann ma&#8217;ni as-sihah</em> (1:56) of Ibn Habirah). The view of Imam Abu Hanifah Rahimahullah was an exception because according to him it is not obligatory to have an intention for wudu, Ghusl of Janabah rather it is Sunnah (<em>al-Hidayah ma’a dirayah</em> (1:20)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4. According to the Arabic language intention is intent of the heart, a mindset and Qasd (firm intent) (<em>Qamus al-wahid</em> (p.1730). Imam Ibn Taymiyyah said ”Niyyah (Intention) is a intent of the heart and Qasd and the place of intent and Qasd is the Heart and not the tongue (<em>al-Fatawa al-kubra</em> (1/1). Uttering the niyyah/intention for the prayer with the tongue is not established or evidenced from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, the companions nor from the great tabi&#8217;in and therefore one should abstain from this action of the tongue. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5. For any action to be accepted by Allah it has to be based on 3 conditions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">i. The Aqidah of the individual has to be according to the Quran and Sunnah and the understanding of the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">ii. The action of the individual should be in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">iii. The action should only be carried out purely and sincerely for the Sake of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6. The intent in citing this hadith in the beginning of the monthly journal &#8216;al-Hadith&#8217; and its understanding is also for the same reason i.e to seek the pleasure of Allah and his forgiveness and not for any wordly benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">7. Some scholars have declared this hadith to be a 1/3 of Islam because all actions are associated with,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">i. The Heart</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">ii. The Tongue</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">iii. The limbs</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since intentions are associated with the heart, this hadith is a 1/3 of Islam.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">8. This hadith is a refutation the innovators (i.e the Murjiah) who claim that Iman is only statement of the tongue without belief in the heart. Ayni said “There is a refutation in this (hadith) against the Murjiah and their statement that Iman is testification of the tongue without belief of the heart” (<em>Umdah al-qari</em> (1:34)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9. In Sahih al-Bukhari the hadith of “actions are but by intentions” does not contain the wording “whoever migrated for the sake of Allah and his Messenger then he migrated for the sake of Allah and his Messenger” which is the first hadith (No.1) whereas they are in the later hadith (i.e No.54 and in  Sahih Muslim) This evidences two issues,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Firstly:- If one narration mentions some words and whilst another does not, it does not evidence negation of those words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Secondly:- additional words transmitted by a trustworthy narrator are reliable and subject to acceptance, which do not oppose other trustworthy narrators or those superior in memorisation and preservation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10. Some scholars have inferred from Imam Bukhari&#8217;s methodology, that by presenting this hadith in the book of” The beginning of Revelation” he establishes two issues</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Firstly:- Hadith is also revelation</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Secondly:- He evidences the beginning of Divine Revelation and the Din of Islam began from Makkah by transmitting this (first) hadith from Imam al-Humaydi al-Makki (who was from Makkah). Likewise and similarly he transmits the last hadith in his Sahih from Abu Hurairah al-Madani  (رضى الله عنه) which is also a deduction that Islam was completed in Madinah.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of Abu Hurairah RadiAllahu Anhu the Messenger of Allah Sallalalhu alayhi Wasallam said, <em>&#8220;Whenever one of you performs wudu for Salah, he should not do tashbik with his fingers (after he has completed the wudu)</em> (al-Sahihah no.1294, transmitted Tabarani in al-Awsth (1:4-5).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tashbik is interlocking the fingers of both hands, ie putting the fingers on one hand into the fingers of the other hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith as narrated by Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri RadiAllahu Anhu said, <em>&#8220;When one of you is in the masjid, do not do tashbik for verily tashbik is from the Shaytan.&#8221;</em> (Musnad Ahmad (3:43).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Isma’ll b. Umayyah said, <em>“I asked about a man who intertwines his fingers while he is engaged in prayer. He said that Ibn ‘Umar had said: This is the prayer of those who earn the anger of Allah.”</em> (Abu Dawud no.993) Shaikh al-Albani graded its chain to be authentic (Irwa 2:103)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Thumamah al-Hannat said that Ka&#8217;b ibn Ujrah met him while he was going to the mosque; one of the two (companions) met his companion (on his way to the mosque) And he met crossing the fingers of my both hands. He prohibited me to do so, and said: The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said: If any of you performs ablution, and performs his ablution perfectly, and then goes out intending for the mosque, he should not cross the fingers of his hand because he is already in prayer. (Abu Dawud (no.562), Sahih Abi Dawud (1:168 no.562), Ibn Majah (no.967)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari established the following chapter heading in his Sahih, <strong>“Chapter on interlocking the fingers in the Masjid and elsewhere” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then brings a hadith from either Abdullah ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) or Abdullah ibn Amr bin Aas (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) interlocked his fingers. (Bukhari no’s 478-479)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the following hadith the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said to Abdullah Ibn Amr al-Aas (RadhiAllahu Anhu), <em>&#8220;O Abdullah bin Amr! What will be your condition when you will be left with the of (worst) people?&#8221; (and he indicated by interlocking the fingers of his two hands). </em>(Bukhari no.480)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of Abu Musa al-Ash’ari (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who narrates the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “<em>A faithful believer to a faithful believer is like the bricks of a wall, enforcing each other.&#8221; While (saying that) the Prophet (</em><em>ﷺ</em><em>) clasped his hands, by interlocking his fingers.” </em>(Bukhari no.481)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith in this regard is the long hadith of Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu about the story of Dhul Yadayn, it mentions the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, <em>“went and stood by a piece of wood that was set up in the masjid, and leaned against it as if he was angry, and he placed his right hand on his left and interlocked his fingers…”</em> (Bukhari no.482, Muslim no.573)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari brings this ahadith to show the permissibility of clasping the hands and interlocking the the fingers. The prohibition is because this is ie interlocking of the fingers a futile and useless act. However, there is no harm if there is a specific reason for a person to do this as in the hadith above the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) used the interlocking of his fingers to illustrate or explain a particular point.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr has explained despite one of the narration being in note form, Ibrahim Harbi has cited a continuous chain for it in his Gharib al-Hadith. Imam Bukhari’s intent in establishing this chapter heading is to elucidate and show the permissibility of clasping the hands and interlocking the fingers. As for the ahadith which mention prohibition of interlocking the fingers they are specific and in relation to the prayer or whilst preparing for the prayer and or most of them are not even authentic. (Fath al-Bari (1:565)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr further said whilst reconciling between these ahadith, the ones cited above and the ones that mention the prohibition, that <em>“al-Isma’ili reconciled between them by noting that the prohibition is limited to when one is in prayer or is intending to pray, because the one who is waiting for the prayer comes under the same ruling as one who is praying… Then al-Haafiz said: The report which says that this is forbidden so long as one is in the mosque is da’eef (weak) as we have stated above.” </em>(Fath al-Bari (1:565)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people whilst in a state of prayer may interlock their fingers in an attempt to crack them. This is unnecessary movement and a distraction from concentrating on the prayer. It was narrated by Shu’bah that he said, <em>“I prayed beside Ibn Abbas and cracked my fingers. When the prayer finished, he said, “May your mother lose you! You crack your fingers when you are in prayer?” </em>(Ibn Abi Shaybah (2:344). Shaikh al-Albani said in Irwa al-Ghalil (2:99), its chain is Hasan.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is another report in which is very weak according to Shaikh al-Albani in Ibn Majah (no.965) that Ali (RadhiAllahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, <em>“</em><em>Do not crack your fingers during the prayer.”</em> (Irwa ul-Ghalil (2:99 no.367) al-Bawsiri declared a narrator in the chain to weak. (al-Zawa’id (1:63). Shaikh al-Albani follows this with another narration from Mu’adh bin Anas (Ahmad (3:438), Daraqutni (no.64), Baihaqi (2:289) who said one of the narrators was not strong.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams ul-Haq Azimabadi also offers similar explanations and alludes to the fact that there are no contradictions in the aforementioned narrations. He cites further ahadith from Ibn Hibban in the prohibition of interlocking the fingers whilst on the way to the masjid to prayer. He also cites a narration from Hakim from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) when one of you performs wudu in his house and then he comes to the masjid, he is in a state of prayer up until he returns and he should not interlock his fingers. Hakim said the hadith is authentic on the conditions of the two Shaikhs. He goes onto cite another narration from Ibn Abi Shaybah’s Musannaf, that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said when one of you prays, he should not interlock his fingers for verily interlocking the fingers is from Shaytan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams ul-Haq goes onto say The Hadith of Ka’b has been authenticated by Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibban and that some scholars have differed over the authenticity of its chains and have thus rendered it to be weak. They (the scholars of hadith) have said there is no contradiction between these ahadith. They are understood to mean that a person is not to interlock their fingers after wudu and whilst on their way to the masjid to pray or whilst praying. The hadith of Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) in Sahih al-Bukhari refers to after the prayer and not during the prayer or from the time leading to the prayer. He then goes onto to cite the view of Ibn al-Munir, al-Ayni and al-Khattabi. (Au’n al-Ma’bud Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud (2:188-190 no.558) </span></p>
