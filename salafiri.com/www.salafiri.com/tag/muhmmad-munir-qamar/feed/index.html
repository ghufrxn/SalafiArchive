				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Ibn Uthaymin -rahimahullah-:<span id="more-1413"></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The shaikh was asked: What is the difference between what is called “The week of shaikh Muhammad bin Abdel Wahhab” -Rahimahullah, and the celebration of the Prophetic Mawlid, as the second is condemned, while the first isn’t?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So he answered: “The difference between them -according to our knowledge- is from two sides:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first is: the week of shaikh Muhammad bin Abdel Wahhab -Rahimahullah Ta’ala- was not done as a means to get closer to Allah -Azza wa Jal-, it is only meant for removing doubts that are in the hearts of some people towards this man, and to show what Allah has blessed the Muslims through this man.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">إhe second is: the week of shaikh Muhammad bin Abdel Wahhab -Rahimahullah- does not reoccur and return (every year) as is the case with ‘Eids; it is something that has been clarified to the people, things were written in it, and the truth regarding this man, that was not known before, was shown to many people, then it ended.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Source: <em>Majmu’ Fatawa wa Rasael Shaikh Muhammad Saleh al-Uthaimeen, volume 16 – Prayer of the two Eids.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said in “Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftooh” :</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>The Question:</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people of innovation say: You commemorate some individuals or like the week of shaikh Muhammad bin Abdel Wahhab – rahimahullah-, they say: what we do is similar to that, and the Messenger -alayhi assalam- is greater than Imam Muhammad?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah is greater than all human beings, but the commemoration of the Messenger (Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) is not specific to to this night. I have mentioned to you before, that every act of worship includes the commemoration of the Messenger -alayhi assalatu wasSalam-, this is from one point, and from another point: the week of Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab, was it made into a eid that reoccurs? we say: it was not made an eid … and an eid is something that returns and reoccurs, you made this (i.e. mawlid) an eid that reoccurs every year, and this is munkar; that is why if someone, one day, stood up and spoke about the mission of the Messenger – alayhi asSalatu wasSalam- and his visiting, we would not call him an innovator, but to make it into an eid that reoccurs every year like a the religious eids such as Eid al Fitr and Eid Al-Adha, then this is munkar; and if we assume that the week of the Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab was wrong, does that mean we compare a wrong with wrong? we don’t.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled by </span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Abdul Barr</strong><span id="more-1398"></span></span></h5>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise is due to Allaah the Most High, the Lord of the Great Arsh.   May the Peace and Blessing of Allaah (swa) be upon His Final slave and Messenger, the Master of all the Prophets, the Seal of Prophethood, Muhammad.</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Assalaam Alaiykum Wa Rahimathullah Wa Barakaathu</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear Brothers, after listening to the ranting of the Neo Jahmi Asharee Asraar Rashid As-Soofee Barelawi, we can see that he has clear hatred for the dawah of the Ahlul Hadeeth, for its beliefs and principles, its methodology and guidelines, for its call and its callers, and for everyone else that promotes the Dawah to Salafiyyah.</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allaahs Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) </span><span style="color: #000000;">said</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Indeed, the scholars are the inheritors of the prophets” </em> (Jami at-Tirmidhi, Sunan Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban)</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">so it is our duty to defend the deen of Allaah (swa) and the inheritors of this deen from the slanderous speech of Ahlul-Bid’ah and silence the barking dog that is Asraar Rashid.</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) also said</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If Allaah wants to favour someone, He grants him comprehension (understanding) of this religion.”</em> (Sahih Bukhari vol.1:71, Tirmidhi and Musnad Ahmad)  </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet there are some brothers amongst us that feel that we must withhold our tongues and be gentle to those that ridicule the inheritors of the Prophets (Peace Be Upon Them All).  We need to fear the Wrath of Allaah  that He may take away this blessing from us through the death of our scholars if we do not make Jihad by the pen and by the tongue against those who oppose the Sunnah of RasoolAllaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam)</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee (Rahimahullah) said</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The one who refutes the Ahlul-Bid’ah (people of innovation) is a mujaahid, and there is no doubt about this. Since when Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal was told about a man who fasts, and offers salaah, and gives in charity, and performs the i’tikaaf, and does (other) good deeds, and was (then) told about a man who refutes the innovators – implying which of the two was better? He (Imaam Ahmad) said, “Whoever offers salaah and fasts and gives in charity and performs i’tikaaf, then (all of) this is for himself, and as for he who refutes the innovators, then this is for (the benefit of) the people.” </em> (Al-Fataawa al-Jaliyyah ‘anil-Manaahij ad-Da’wiyyah – Page 24, Question 29)</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Taymiyyah (Rahimahullah) said:</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The one who refutes the innovators is a mujaahid.”</em></span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Ibn al-Qayyim (Rahimahullah) said:</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The jihaad with decisive proofs (from the Book and the Sunnah) and the tongue takes precedence over the jihaad with the sword and the spear.”</em> (Al-Jawaab as-Saheeh of Ibn Taymiyyah (1/237)</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The illustrious Shaykh Al-Humaidee (Rahimahullah), the Shaikh of al-Bukhaaree (Rahimahullah), said:</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“By Allaah, that I war against those who reject the Hadeeth of the Messenger (salallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) is more beloved to me than that I should war against the same number of Non-Muslims.”</em> ( Al-Harawi in Dhamm ul-Kalaam)</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Ibn ‘Abdullaah Aalush-Shaykh said</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The refutations upon the people of innovation are from Jihaad in the path of Allaah. They are from safeguarding the Sharee’ah from having other than it attached to it. So writing the books, publishing them and spreading them is the truth and it is a call to the truth and Jihaad in the path of Allaah. So whoever claims that publishing and spreading the books that contain refutation upon the innovators is an innovated affair, then he is upon error, because Allaah the Sublime and Exalted said: O Prophet! Strive hard against the hypocrites and be harsh with them. (Sooratut-Tawbah 9:73)”</em> (Taken from: ar-Riyaadus-Sa’oodiyyah Newspaper (issue no. 12674), dated Friday, the 4th of al-Muharram)</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">My dear brothers, we are facing this fitnah because we have allowed people like Asraar Rashid to promote the Mushrik aqeedah of Ahmad Ridda Khan and other such deviants, fearing that by naming them or being harsh against them we would repel people from the masjids and the madrassas.  What we have done in actual fact is water down the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and so Allaah swa has punished us with this fitnah where Ahlul-Bid’ah mock us at any available opportunity.  We should not fear criticizing and being harsh with those who oppose the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) as</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When some people said to Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah) that they felt uneasy about criticizing people, he replied, ‘If you remain silent and I remain silent, then who will make the ignorant person aware of the authentic from the defective?&#8217;” </em> (Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa of Ibn Taimiyyah (28/231))</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Qudama Al Maqdisi (Rahimahullah) was a stern defender of the Sunnah and he said</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The innovator whose innovation does not make him a disbeliever, then the affair between himself and Allaah is less severe than the situation of the Kaafir without doubt. But in terms of (him being criticised and) detesting what he does (in terms of his innovation) then this is dealt with more severity than the Kaafir. This is because the evil of the Kaafir does not extend (to the Muslims) as none of the Muslims would pay attention to his speech. And this is different than the innovator who calls toward his innovation because he thinks that what he is calling toward is the truth. He therefore becomes a reason for the misguidance of the creation and his evil extends (to the Muslims). Therefore openly displaying enmity toward him, boycotting him, being an enemy towards him, humiliating him, being harsh upon him because of his innovation and running the people away from him becomes more severe.” </em> (Ibn Qudama Al Maqdisi, Minhaaj Al Qaasideen pg. 123, Maktabah Al Islami Print)</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we must take heed of this lesson and implement this principle so that Allaah swa may bestow His Mercy on us once again, and grant us victory against all those who oppose the dawah to Salafiyyah.</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great Imam of Ahlus Sunnah Al-Hasan Al-Basree (Rahimahullah) once said: </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is no backbiting with regard to (talking about) the innovator or the sinner who openly professes his evil.”</em> ( Al-Laalikaa`ee (1/140, no 279)</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as we are harsh to Ahlul-Bid’ah for the sake of Allaah (swa), and we do not seek fame or status from the people then we are traversing the path of the Prophets (as) as mentioned by Abdus-Salaam as-Suhaymi (hafidhahullaah) who wrote that Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (Rahimahullah) said, as he was explaining the permissibility of backbiting an open innovator, that</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“two conditions should be fulfilled before doing so:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1.Knowledge</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. Sincerity</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Tamiyyah said: <em>A person who takes up the task of backbiting an (open) innovator should be knowledgeable and sincere. If a person takes part in backbiting an (open) innovator, but the cause of him taking part in backbiting is to raise his own status in the eyes of the people, or to cause corruption, it doesn’t matter if he is correct in his criticism. He is like a warrior who goes out to fight in a fit of rage (due to his lack of knowledge), showing off (due to his lack of sincerity). On the other hand, if he is backbiting an (open) innovator, sincerely for the sake of Allaah, he is like the inheritors of the Prophets (the Scholars), the successors of the Messengers, (honorably) fighting in the path of Allaah”</em></span></p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Those who came before us would not give up doing so at any cost, even to the extent that Imam Abu Ismaa’eel al-Ansaari (Rahimahullah) said that</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whilst in Haraah: ‘The sword was put to my neck five times (and each time) it was not said to me, ‘Leave your madhhab’ but it was said to me, ‘Remain silent about those who are in opposition to you’. So I would say, ‘I will not remain silent.&#8217;”</em>(Aadaab us-Sharee’ah (1/207) of Ibn Muflih al-Maqdisi al-Hanbali)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam of the Sunnah Shaykh Barbaharee (Rahimahullah) said</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is no permit for anyone to do anything which has been introduced, which the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahualaihi wa sallam) were not upon, nor for any man to call to anything innovated before him by people of innovation; he would then be just like the one who innovated it. So anyone who claims that, or speaks according to it, has rejected the Sunnah, opposed the truth and the Jamaa’ah and has made innovation lawful. He is more harmful to the Ummah than Iblees”</em> (Kitaab Sharh us-Sunnah by Abu Muhammad Al-Hasan ibn ‘Alee ibn Khalaf Al-Barbahaaree (Rahimahullah)  (p38))</span></p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So I say we have been too lenient as it is by calling them dogs as they have been referred to by those more knowledgeable and pious then us as more harmful then Iblees (may the curse of Allaah be upon him).</span></p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The hatred held by the pious predecessors for these innovators due to their opposition to the Sunnah can be seen by their opinions in regards to them such as Al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad (Rahimahullah) who said that</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whoever sits with a person of innovation, then beware of him and whoever sits with a person of innovation has not been given wisdom. I love that there was a fort of iron between me and a person of innovation. That I eat with a Jew and a Christian is more beloved to me than that I eat with a person of Innovation.”</em> (Reported by al-Laalikaa’ee, no. 1149.)</span></p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Layth ibn Sa’d (d. 175H) said,</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If I saw a person of desires (i.e. innovations) walking upon the water I would not accept from him.”</em></span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee then said,</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘He (al-Layth) has fallen short. If I saw him walking in the air I would not accept from him.” </em> (Reported by as-Suyooti in Al-Amr bil ‘lttibaa wan-Nahee ‘anil-lbtidaa. Refer to Chapter Eight.)</span></p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We have merely responded by then pen to these barking dogs, the Imaams of Ahlus Sunnah were even sterner and physically beat the mubtadis as it is narrated about Abdullaah bin Abee Ja’far ar-Raazee (Rahimahullah) from Saalih bin ad-Darees who said</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Abdullaah began beating the head of a relative of his who held the view of Jahm. So I saw him beating him on his head with a sandal whilst saying, “No (I will not stop), (not) until you say Ar-Rahmaan ascended above the Throne, separate and distinct from His creation (ar-Rahmaanu ‘alal-arsh istawaa, baa’inun min khalqihi).”</em> (Mukhtasar al-Uluww of adh-Dhahabee, (p. 172)</span></p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d. 204H) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“My ruling regarding the people of theological rhetoric is that they should be beaten with palm leaves and shoes and be paraded amongst the kinsfolk and the tribes with it being announced, ‘This is the reward of the one who abandons the Book and the Sunnah and turns to theological rhetoric (kalaam).” </em> (Sharh ‘Aqeedatit-Tahaawiyyah of lbn Abil-’Izz, p. 75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If anything, we are doing them a favour as one of the Salaf used to say</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We are more merciful to them (Ahlul-Bid’ah) than their mothers. We are even merciful to them when they are in their graves. We refute them and expose their bid’ah, and by doing so, their sins are lessened”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In conclusion, it is my humble opinion that we, myself first and foremost, are not doing enough to silence these rabid dogs that fight against the Quran and the Sunnah and we must be harsh against those who oppose the dawah to Salafiyyah, and Allaah  knows best.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Eighth Proof</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They utilise Imaam Suyootee mentioning a point of history in his al-Haawee Fil Fataawa that, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In a dream Abu lahab met someone (Abbaas bin Abdul muttalib). Abu lahb said that I am punished every day except for the Monday evening in which my punishment is lessened and I get to drink a few drops of water from between my fingers on that day. This is due to me releasing my slave Thuwaiyabah when she notified me of the birth of Muhammad and she then later also breast feed Muhammad.”</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There many reasons why it is incorrect to use this story as an evidence for establishing milaad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) there is a consensus of all scholars that the dream of other than the prophets cannot be utilised as an evidence, for the prophets dreams are by way of revelation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(2) The one referred to is it the companion Abbaas bin Abdul Muttalib or someone else? Then the one who reports from him does so by mursal form and it is known that the mursal narration cannot be used as part of establishing Aqeedah. (indeed according to the scholars mursal narration cannot be utilised as stand alone evidences in matters other than Aqeedah also such as Ahkaam and rulings).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Even if it was Abbaas then it is highly possible that he saw the dream before he accepted Islaam so can someone’s dream who has not yet accepted Islaam be taken as an evidence in the religion? Bear in mind that even if one is a believer then his dreams are not an evidence in the deen (except prophets) never mind a person who has not yet accepted Islaam!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Most scholars have stated that if a person dies as a non believer then his actions will be of no benefit to him at all.  This is correct.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And We will regard what they have done of deeds and make them as dust dispersed.” (Soorah al-Furqaan:23)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and in [their] meeting Him, so their deeds have become worthless; and We will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any importance.” (Soorah al-Kahf:105)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So it is clear from the above two verses that the one who dies as a disbeliever then no deed of his shall he be rewarded for or have any benefit of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further it is mentioned in a hadeeth that </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ai’shah (RadhiAllaahu Anha) asked about Abdullah ibn Jadaan (who died as a non believer) who would slaughter 1000 camels in charity every hajj, who would clothe 1000 people every hajj and even allowed the use of his house to the prophet,  Would any of these action be of benefit to him? The prophet replied no for he never once in his life sought the forgiveness of Allaah for his sins (disbelief) on the day of judgement</em>” (al-Insaaf of al-Jazaa’iree (pg.41).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus it is clear that the dream concerning Abu lahab or any of his deeds would not benefit him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(5) The happiness of Abu lahab was a natural happiness (that his brother had a child) rather then happiness for the sake of Allaah as part of worship. So any action that is not for the sake of Allaah as part of worship how can one be rewarded for it? So from this angle one can also see the futility and fallacy of this evidence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(6) A believer is always happy at the existence of his prophet. So to innovate Milaad once a year to celebrate the prophets birthday in order to venerate his existence is far fetched.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In essence those who play with texts use these evidences which have no bearing on the innovations that they practice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>From his book</em> <em>‘Celebrating Milaad On the Day Of Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) Died’ (pg.35-38)</em></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Seventh Proof</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They say that the prophet at the time of the farewell pilgrimage sacrificed 63 camels. Then some of them build upon this and take a totally wild shot by saying that he did this in order to make up one sacrifice for every year of his life, thus celebrating his Mawlid!</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is the way of Ahlul Bidah (the people of innovation) that they first introduce an innovation then they attempt to twist and massacre the texts available to suit their own needs. Then it is the same here for the evidence has no connection with the deduction that they draw from it for the following reason,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) It is known that the sacrifices were given at the time of hajj on the 10<sup>th</sup> of Dhul Hijjah, which is the twelfth Islamic calendar month yet the birth of the prophet was in Rabee ul-Awwal, the third Islamic month, so what nexus is there between the sacrifices and Milaad un-Nabi?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(2) If this evidence is to be used as a text for the proof to celebrate milaad then they should this Milaad in Dhul Hijjah rather than Rabee ul-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(3) The prophet gave the sacrifice of 100 camels in Dhul Hijjah, 63 of which he bought with him from Madeenah and 37 which Alee bought with him from Yemen as is mention in <em>‘Sharh Muslim Nawawee’</em> (8/196) as reported from Qaadhee Ayaadh who said, <em>“That Alee bought the 37 camels with him from Yemen as has been reported in Tirmidhee. Then if it is said that why did the prophet then give the 63 camels in sacrifice then this is a baseless question and is it is as has been reported.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Some of the scholars have interpreted the giving of 63 camels as a sign that the prophets life was nearing its end as has been reported in various modes concerning the year the prophet performed the farewell pilgrimage. For example, on the day of arafah in that year the verse <strong>“today I have completed your religion….”</strong> was revealed, On the day of Tashreeq Soorah Fath was revealed, the fact that the prophet continually admonished the people and at times alluding to the fact that it may not be possible that he be gathered with the companions again during pilgrimage and so on. Thus the 63 camels signify that there would be no further years added to the life of the prophet and this is clearly the showing the end of the life of the prophet instead of meaning the start of celebrating his birthday.   Surely they see the difference between the start and end of something?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>From his book</em> <em>‘Celebrating Milaad On the Day Of Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) Died’ (pg.33-35)</em></span></p>
