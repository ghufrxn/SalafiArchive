<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>The Punishment of an Unmarried Slave Girl Who Commits Zina</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center"></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[55] </strong><strong>And from the same chain of narration from Abu Hurayra and Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani (Radi Allahu Anhu) that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) was asked about a slave-girl who committed fornication and was not muhsana (married). He said, &#8220;If she commits fornication, then flog her. If she commits fornication again, then flog her, and if she commits fornication again, then sell her, if only for a rope (Dhafir).&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Malik said: Ibn Shihab added (said), &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether it was three or four times. And adh-Dhafir is the rope.&#8221;  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Ubaydullah Ibn Abdullah Ibn Utba Ibn Mas’ud) in Humaydi (no.812)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [BUKHARI]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 2/826 hadith no.1606, book 41, chapter 3, hadith no.14) at-Tamhid (9/94) al-Istidhkar: (no.1534)  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.2153, no.2154) from the hadith of Malik and narrated by Muslim (33/1704) from the hadith of az-Zuhri.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">1) The Had punishment will be given to the slave girl who commits Zina whether she is muhsana (married) or not muhsana (unmarried) however in actuality the punishment of stoning to death will not be applied on the slaves (maidservants) rather they will be lashed 50 times. Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) gave 50 lashes to slaves who committed Zina. (Muwatta Imam Malik (2/827) hadith (no.1608) and its chain is authentic)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2) There is an ijma that the slave girl who commits Zina will be given half the punishment compared to the free lady who commits Zina meaning she will be given 50 lashes. At-Tamhid (9/98)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">3) Some scholars take the meaning of ihsan to mean islam. At-Tamhid (9/102) Ibn Abas (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, “Then when ahsan (carry out the marriage rights, get married)…then you have married….” (Musanaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (4/394) hadith (no.17574) and its chain is authentic, hathim has done anana from husain connected with hearing and he clarified hearing this hadith in the tafsir of Ibn Jarir (5/16)) Therefore the most correct meaning of muhsana here is a married person.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center"></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[54] And from the same chain of narration from Ubaydullah Ibn Abdullah Ibn Utba Ibn Mas’ud that Abu Hurayra and Zayd Ibn Khalid al-Juhani (Radi Allahu Anhuma) informed him that two men brought a dispute to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam). One of them said, &#8220;Messenger of Allah! Judge between us by the Book of Allah!&#8221; The other said, and he was the wiser of the two, &#8220;Yes, Messenger of Allah. Judge between us by the Book of Allah and give me permission to speak.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; He said, &#8220;My son was hired by this person as a labourer (worker, workman) and he committed fornication with his wife. He told me that my son deserved stoning, and I ransomed him for one hundred sheep and a slave-girl. Then I asked the people of knowledge and they told me that my son deserved to be flogged with one hundred lashes and exiled for a year, and they informed me that the woman deserved to be stoned.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, &#8220;By him in whose Hand my life is, I will judge between you both by the Book of Allah. As for your sheep and slave girl, they should be returned to you. Your son should have one hundred lashes and be exiled for a year.&#8221; He ordered Unays al-Aslami to go to the wife of the other man and to stone her if she confessed. She confessed and he stoned her. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Imam Malik said, “A labourer (workman) is called an Asif”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Ubaydullah Ibn Abdullah Ibn Utba Ibn Mas’ud) in Bukhari (no.6827, no.6828)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [BUKHARI]</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 2/822 hadith no.1597, book 41, chapter 1, hadith no.6) at-Tamhid (9/71, 72) al-Istidhkar: (no.1526)  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.6633, no.6634) from the hadith of Malik and narrated by Muslim (25/1697, 1698) from the hadith of az-Zuhri.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">1) The punishment for the person who is married and commits Zina is stoning to death. Also see hadith (no.41) (of this book)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2) Stoning is not mentioned clearly in the Quran, however it is known from the saying of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam), “I will judge between you both by the Book of Allah (Quran).” that the hadith is also the Book of Allah (Quran) therefore the rejector of stoning is a rejector of the Book of Allah (Quran).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">3) The decision and judgment for all the differences should be in accordance to the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam). Imam Sufyan Ibn Uyayna Maki used to say, “Without a shadow of a doubt the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) is the greatest balance (weigh scale). So everything will be referred back to him. In accordance to his manners, his lifestyle, and his way. So whatever is in accordance to him then that will be the truth and whatever goes against him then that will be false.” (al-Jami’ ul-Akhlaq ar-Rawi Wa Adab us-Sami’ of al-Khatib (1/79) hadith (no.8) and its chain is [Hasan] good)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">4) The unmarried person who commits Zina, along with being given 100 lashes, can also be punished with 1 year of exile. Abu Bakr as-Sidiq and Umar (Radi Allahu Anhuma) both gave 100 lashes and 1 year exile punishment to the person who committed zina (whilst being unmarried). As-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi ((8/223) and its chain is authentic) and al-Jami’ of at-Tirmidhi ((no.1438) and he said, “Gharib” and its chain is authentic) Ali (Radi Allahu Anhu) gave a man (who committed Zina) 1 year exile. (as-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi (8/223) and its chain is authentic) Ubay Ibn Ka’b (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, “The unmarried persons who commit Zina are given 100 lashes and exile, and the married persons who commit Zina are stoned to death” (as-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi (8/223) and its chain is authentic)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">5) Hafidh Ibn Abul Bar used to say, “Most of the people of innovation in the religion reject the punishment of stoning to death and don’t recognise it. These people (the people of innovation in the religion) are not convinced (of the saying) for stoning to death of all types of Zina, whether the person is married or unmarried.”(at-Tamhid (9/83)) It is known from this that rejecting the punishment of stoning to death for the married person is an innovation in the religion.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">6) Some scholars are against exiling the female who has committed zina because of the fear of fitna. at-Tamhid (9/88)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">7) It is not necessary for the person who has committed Zina to confess four times in order for the established Had punishment to occur, rather one confession (declaration) by that person is enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">8) Khabr Wahid is a proof.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">9) The decision and judgment of the Judge is implemented in the rulings.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">10) All decisions and judgements that go against the Quran and sunnah are false and rejected.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.6749) from the hadith of Malik and narrated by Muslim (no.1457) from the hadith of Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It has come in the original from Yahya Ibn Yahya’s narration: Utbah Ibn Waqas and Sa’d Ibn Waqas</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) A man married a woman then after (9 months) the woman gave birth to a boy or girl. This boy or girl has been born from the bed of that man therefore it is established according to this hadith that this boy or girl belongs to this man except if the father denies rejects this or if their is legislated reason for this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Some people say, “So and so person is the son of so and so man. This proof is found by (him) imitating (the other man)” this saying of these people is false because the proof of the son or daughter is found from this authentic hadith (and other Ahadith). When the nikah is established then the children automatically are established (to be from the parents) who have been born after the nikah from the father’s bed. The meaning of the father’s bed is that so and so is that woman’s husband.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Taking precaution and avoiding doubtful things is more virtuous. The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, <em>“Leave what makes you in doubt for what does not make you in doubt.”</em> (Sunan at-Tirmidhi: (no.2518) and its chain is authentic, and Tirmidhi said, “this hadith is authentic” and Ibn Khuzaimah authenticated it: (no.2348) and Ibn Hiban, al-Muwarid: (no.512) and al-Hakim (2/13) and adh-Dhahabi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) The Mother of the believers and noble companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) were always submitted and active (prompt, diligent, alert, efficient) in following of the noble Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) Without (unless there is) a Shari’ah right, actions will be done in accordance to all the apparent texts of the Shari’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) The punishment of zina (illegal sexual intercourse) is rajam (stoning to death) with the condition that the person who has committed zina is married. The hadith, <em>“A child belongs to the household (where he was born) and the adulterer is stoned.”</em> is mutawatir. See Qatful azhar al-Mutanatharah fil akhbar al-mutawatirah (no.82) wa nadhmul mutanathar minal hadith al-mutawatar (no.181). The same way it is also mutawatir that Ma’iz Ibn Malik (Radi Allahu Anhu) was stoned to death because of committing zina. See Qatful azhar (no.83) wa laqtul la ali al mutanatharah fil hadith al mutawatirah (no.47) wa nadhmul mutanathar (no.182) Apart from this there are also a lot more Ahadith therefore it is established that giving the stoning to death punishment for a married person who comitts zina is mutawatir, definite, certain and established from the Ahadith. The denial (rejection) of the punishment of stoning to death by some of the rejecters of hadith is false and rejected. Also see hadith (no.54)</span></p>

<h4 align="center"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[No.6]      From Maalik from Ibn Shihaab that Sahl Ibn Sa’d as-Saae’dee told him that Uwaymir al-Ajlanee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) came to Asim Ibn Adee al-Ansari (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and said to him, “Asim! What do you think a man who finds another man with his wife should do? Should he kill him and then be killed himself, or what should he do? Asim! Ask the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) about that for me.” Asim asked the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) about it. The Messenger of Allah, (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) was revolted by the questions and reproved them until what he heard from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) was intolerable for Asim. When Asim returned to his people, Uwaymir came to him and said, “Asim! What did the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) say to you?” Asim said to Uwaymir, “You didn’t bring me any good. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) was revolted by the question which I asked him.” Uwaymir said, “By Allah! I will not stop until I ask him about it!” Uwaymir stood up and went to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) in the middle of the people and said, “Messenger of Allah! (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) What do you think a man who finds another man with his wife should do? Should he kill him and then be killed himself, or what should he do?” The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) said, “Something has been sent down about you and your wife, so go and bring her.” Sahl continued, “They mutually cursed one another in the presence of the Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) and I was present with the people. When they finished cursing each other, Uwaymir said, ‘I shall have lied about her, Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam), if I keep her,’ and pronounced the divorce three times before the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) ordered him to do it.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Ibn Shihaab said, “That was how the Sunnah of a couple mutually cursing each other was established (li’aan).”</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[GRADING] –</strong> <strong>[ITS CHAIN IS SAHEEH]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[REFERENCES]</strong> – <strong>[AGREED UPON]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/566 hadeeth <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.1232</span>, book 29, chapter 13 (Trans Note: the English translation by A’isha `Abdarahman at-Tarjumana and Ya`qub Johnson says chapter 12) hadeeth <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.34</span>) at-Tamheed (6/183-185) and al-Istidhkaar (<span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.1152</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by Bukharee (<span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.5259</span>) and Muslim (<span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.1492</span>) from the hadeeth of Maalik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADEETH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1)      Li’aan in the Sharee’ah is when the husband takes 4 oaths that I am attributing zina to my wife meaning I am truthful in accusing her of zina and the fifth oath is that if he is a liar in alleging this then he is deserving of the curse of Allah, then the wife takes 4 oaths in saying that the husband is lying and the 5th oath should be that if the husband is truthful then the wife is deserving of Allah’s anger and by saying this she will be free from the punishment of Zina. (al-Qamoos ul-Waheed <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.1478</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2)      The command of Li’aan has been revealed in the Majestic Qur’aan in Surah Noor. (Ayaat 6-7)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3)      It is clearly known from this hadeeth that after Li’aan that the husband and wife don’t automatically separate, rather they separate after the divorce. Imam Bukharee says, al-Li’aan, and divorce after the process of Li’aan. (book of divorce chapter: 29 before hadeeth (<span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.5308</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4)      You should not be shy in asking about issues that are really serious and asking about issues that are not really serious meaning that they are hypothetical (fictitious, imaginary) should always be avoided.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5)      After the Li’aan, unless there is a valid proof legislated in the Sharee’ah, there will be no punishment issued on the (2) parties (husband and wife).</span></p>
