<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alhamdullilahi Rabbil A’lamīn, Wasalatu Wasalam Ala Rasūlillahil Karīm,  Wa Ba’d</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The subject of Jinn possession has been historically documented in the Sirah of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam which is full of wisdoms for this ummah to benefit from. However, in recent times there has been a spout of detractors, a rejuvenated modernistic cult who have incoherently uttered vague and inconclusive weak transmissions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a very sad occasion because these detractors have claimed that there is no such teaching as jinn possession in the clear Quran and Sunnah. It is shocking to the say the least that these individuals have demonstrated a primitive mindset with flagrant loose remarks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Needless to say, the Qur’an is clear and shall always be, the clarity is in this glorious book and the Sunnah of the prophet Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam however it is with great regret that these shameless individuals who proclaim the nobility of the Qur’an have constricted themselves to a madhahib.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people are in clear contradiction who rigidly follow their respective madhab blindly and thereby side stepping the manhaj of the Prophet Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some Mu’tazilites and Jahmites essentially denied the existence of jinns altogether whereas some Mu’tazilites like al-Jabba’i and al-Razi denied jinn possession. [Aydah al-Dalalah Fi Umum al-Risalah from Majmu’a al-Fatawa [19:9-65].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fakhr al-Razi explicitly denies jinn possession and also quotes Jabbai and then offers his explanation [Tafsir al-Kabir [7:88-90]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As does Zamakshari in his al-Kishaf [1:399]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is important to note here is that Imam Abul Hasan al-Ash’ari, those who the modern day Ash’arites and flagrant Kullabites attach themselves to cited an Ijma ie consensus of the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah believing in jinn possession!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These modern, well we do not even know what they are upon and believe because we have just cited the position of Imam Abul Hasan al-Ash’ari on jinn possession. This is also followed up by the position of an 11<sup>th</sup> century Ash’ari Shafite theologian, Muhammad bin Ei’lan al-Siddiqi [1057H].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another Hanafi scholar of the 8<sup>th</sup> century also cites the consensus mentioned by Imam Abul Hasan al-Ash’ari and authored a specific book on the Jinn, he is Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Ashbili al-Hanafi [799H].  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Without further digression, lets discuss the issue in detail and address this in light of the Qur’an and Sunnah, by the will of Allah Almighty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>EVIDENCE FOR JINN POSSESSION FROM THE QURAN</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by shaytan into insanity.” [</strong><strong>Surah Al-Baqarah:275]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Qurtubi said in explanation of this ayah, <em>&#8220;This ayah is an evidence against the people who reject and deny jinn possession and its evil affects, or those who believe a jinn cannot enter a human and roam through his body and rather they say he just has a medical illness.”</em> [al-Jam’e Li Ahkam al-Quran [3:255 no.12] also Mukhtasar Tafsir Qurtubi [1:210] of Basam Ni’mah]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Tabari said in explanation of this ayah, <em>&#8220;The people who consume interest will rise in their graves in the hereafter like the person who has been beaten by satan into insanity ie shaytan chases after him and destroys his mind.&#8221;</em> (Jam’e al-Bayan an-Ta’wil al-Quran (3:101)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Kathir said, <em>“It Means the one who consumes interest will rise up from their graves on the Day of Judgement just like the person who has been possessed by a shaytan, who renders him insane meaning that he stands in a strange and peculiar way in a fit of madness. Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Ibn Abbas said, “One who devours interest will be resurrected on the Day of Judgement insane in a suffocating form of madness.” Ibn Abi Hatim also said that similar commentaries were narrated from Awf ibn Malik, Sa’id ibn Jubair, al-Suddi, al-Rabi Ibn Anas, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan.”</em> (Tafsir Ibn Kathir [1:326] refer also to Tafsir Ibn Abi Hatim [2:544]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Qutaibah said ie the person is insane as in the man is possessed (by shaytan ie jinn) [Tafsir Gharib al-Quran [pp.98]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Baghawi also mentioned the same explanation ie as if the person was possessed by a jinn. [Mu’allim al-Tanzil [1:340]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ulusi has also mentioned the same in his Ruh al-Bayan [3:49]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti also mentions the same in al-Darr al-Manthur Fi Tafsir Bi’l Maithur [2:102]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Rashid Rida also cited the same, he cites the statements of Ibn Atiyyah and Baidhawi with Abu Sa’ud agreeing with him. He also mentions that the mu’tazilah deny jinn possession and some Ahlus Sunnah. [Tafsir al-Manar [3:94-96]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan also mentioned the same is insanity due to jinn possession. [Fath Fi Maqasid al-Quran [2:138]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Shawkani also mentions the same in his Fath al-Qadir [1:338-339]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ali Sabuni the Ash’ari also cited the same [Safah al-Tafasir [1:174]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ali al-Sayas also mentions the same and says this is the position of Ahl al-Sunnah and answers those who disagree [Tafsir Ayat al-Ahkam [1:172]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr has alluded in his Fath al-Bari that disbelieving jinns are Shaytan’s meaning that when the word shaytan is used it means an evil disbelieving jinn. [Fath al-Bari [6:344] and [8:675]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>EVIDENCE FOR JINN POSSESSION FROM THE SUNNAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE NARRATION OF UMM ABAN</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Matar bin Abdur Rahman A&#8217;naq narrates that Umm Aban bint Warz&#8217;a bin Zar&#8217;a bin Amir Abdi, she mentioned to him whilst narrating from her father that her grandfather, Zar&#8217;a , <em>“She said my grandfather Zar’a went to the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and his son or nephew was with him and he was insane. He informed the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam his son or nephew was unwell and thus make du’a for him. At the time the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was with a delegation. The messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam brought himself close to the boy and asked him to turn around. He then proceeded to strike his back and he lifted his arms until the whiteness of his arm pits were visible. He Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam would say “Get out enemy of Allah, Get out enemy of Allah.” I later saw the child in a better state with his eyes in a normal state. I sat the child in front of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who called for some water for hium and wiped his facem then he prayed for him. After the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallm’s prayer there was none in the delegation better than him.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Transmitted by Tabarani, Haithami said, Tabarani transmitted this Hadith however no one else other than Matar narrates from Umm Aban. He also said Ahmad also narrated this hadith in his Musnad in summarized form, which Tabarani cited who said Hind bint al-Wazr’a is in the chain and no one other than matr narrates from her and the rest of the narrators are trustworthy. [Majma’a al-Zawa’id [9:2-3] also cited by Ibn Taymiyyah in Majmu’a al-Fatawa [19:57]. Also cited by Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi. Hafiz Ibn Hajr graded Umm Aban as acceptable ie (Maqbulah) See also Wahid Abdus Salam Bali’s, Waqayah al-Insan Minal Jinn Wa’l Shaytan [pp.57]. Hafiz Ibn Hajr has said no female narrator has been ever disparaged. [Refer to the generals books of Mastalah]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>THE NARRATION OF YA’LA BIN MARRAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah bin Numair narrates from Ya’la bin Marrah who said, “<em>I observed 3 incidences of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam that no individual has witnessed and neither will there be the possibility of any person witnessing such events. I travelled with the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and during the journey we saw a woman sitting beside a child. This woman approached the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and said that this child has been possessed for 7 years and as a result of this we are depressed. She also said that the child would experience 2 fits on a daily due to the possession. Upon hearing this, the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam requested to have the child brought close to him, he proceeded to open the mouth of the child and blew into it 3 times and then said “I am the worshipper of Allah, go away enemy of Allah.” He then returned the child to the lady and requested to meet them again upon our return from the journey in the same location. Upon our return the lady was sat waiting with 3 sheep, the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam asked “Where is the child?” the lady replied “I swear by him who sent you with the truth, we did not see his state change and then she presented the sheep to him. The messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said to me to take one and leave the others with the lady.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Transmitted by Musnad Ahmad [4:173], Darimi [1:15 no.18], Ibn Sunni [pp.299] Dalail al-Nabuwwah [no.294] of Abu Nu&#8217;aym, Dalail al-Nabuwwah [6:18-19] of Baihaqi, Mu’ajam al-Kabir of Tabarani [no.8347], Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah [11:488-496] with some very slight variation. However it should be noted that Yahya ibn Sa’id al-Attar is in the chain and he is weak and the narrator al-Masudi became confused before his death. Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned this in Majmu’a al-Fatawa [19:57-58]. Haithami said <em>“Ahmad transmitted it via 2 chains as did Tabarani. One being through Imam Ahmads chain whose narrators are Sahih”</em> [Majma’a al-Zawa’id [9:5-6]. Shaikh al-Albani cited a variation of it in his Silsilah al-Sahihah [no.485]. Imam Hakim also transmitted it in al-Mustadrak [2:617] via al-A’mash and graded the chain to be Sahih and Imam Dhahabi agreed. We have mentioned elsewhere Imam Hakims authentication and Imam Dhahabi agreeing with him alone is not sufficient unless supported by other scholars. This said, it is not an absolute principle and in every instance the chain shall be scrutinised. This authentication of the later two authorities is further supported by Hafiz al-Munziri who said its chain is good. [al-Targhib Wal-Tarhib [3:158]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The narration of Ya’la ibn Murrah in Imam Ahmads Musnad via Waki is with the following wording <em>“Once a woman bought her child to the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who was insane so he said “Get out enemy of Allah, I am the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam” and thus he was relieved of the Jinn. He further said the woman had 2 male sheep, dried curd (cheese) and fat, which she presented to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who said “Take the dried curd (cheese) and fat and 1 animal and return the other”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Ahmad 4:170-172], Haithami said its narrators are the narrators of the Sahih. [Majma’a al-Zawa’id [9:6]. al-Arna’ut graded this narration to be Sahih ie authentic in his verification of Zad al-Ma’ad [4:68]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ahmad has transmitted this report with a slightly different wording from Abdur Razzaq via Ya’la ibn Marrah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Asakir has transmitted a report from Usamah ibn Zaid RadiAllahu Anhu very similar to the wording of Ya’la ibn Marrah. [Akam al-Marjan Fi Ahkam al-Jan [pp.14]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>THE NARRATION OF JABIR BIN ABDULLAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Jabir bin Abdullah RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates <em>“We were travelling with the messenger of Allah on the expedition to Zat Al Raqa’a until we reached a placed called Harrah when a Bedouin woman came to them with her child and said to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. This is my son who is possessed by a Jinn. He replied bring him closer to me and open his mouth, she opened his mouth and the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam  put some saliva in his mouth and said “Go away oh enemy of Allah I am the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam he said this three times and then he said look after this child and nothing will possess him and nothing will return to him that will harm him.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Darimi [1:10], Haithami said, <em>“Tabarani cited in Al-Awsth and al Bazzar in summarized form and the chain contains Abdul Hakim bin Sufyan, Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned him without disparaging or criticising him and the rest of the narrators are trustworthy.</em>” [Majma&#8217;a al-Zawa’id [9:9] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE NARRATION OF UTHMAN IBN ABI AAS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was narrated that ‘Uthman bin Abul-‘As said, <em>“When the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam appointed me as governor of Ta’if, I began to get confused during my prayer, until I no longer knew what I was doing. When I noticed that, I travelled to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, and he said: ‘The son of Abul-‘As?’ I said: ‘Yes, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘What brings you here?’ He said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I get confused during my prayer, until I do not know what I am doing.’ He said: ‘That is Satan. Come here.’ So I came close to him, and sat upon the front part of my feet then he struck my chest with his hand and put some spittle in my mouth and said: ‘Get out, O enemy of Allah!’ He did that three times, then he said: ‘Get on with your work.’” ‘Uthman said: “Indeed, I never felt confused (during my prayer) after that.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Ibn Majah [no.3548]. Haithami said in Majma’a al-Zawa’id, <em>“The chain is Sahih and its narrators are trustworthy</em>.” Shaikh al-Albani authenticated in Sahih Sunan ibn Majah [3:185 no.2874]. Imam Bausairi said, <em>&#8220;This chain is authentic and its narrators are trustworthy.&#8221;</em> Also refer to Jam’e al-Usul [6:264]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Uthman ibn Abi Aas narrates, <em>“I went to the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam “my memory used to be very good and then something possessed me and I am forgetting things”. So he Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam placed his hand on my chest and said “Oh Allah expel this shaytan from him” Thereafter I had no complaint of memory loss.</em>”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Muslim [no’s. 3, 22], Ahmad Musnad [4:218], Ibn Sunni [pp. 272], there is also a narration from Ubaid bin Rafa’h in the Musnad of Ahmad, Musannaf of Abdur Razzaq and in Ibn Abi Shaybah]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is also another variation of this narration, where Uthman bin Abi al-Aas said to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, <em>“Oh Messenger of Allah, the shaytan came between me and my recitation in the prayer.” The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, “This is a shaytan called Khinzab. So if you feel its presence seek refuge in Allah from it and spit thrice to your left side.” Uthman said, “I did that and Allah The Most Great and Glorious removed it from.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Muslim [no.5463], Musnad Ahmad [4:216]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE NARRATION OF ABDUR RAHMAN IBN ABI LAYLA</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was narrated from ‘Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Laila that his father Abu Laila said, <em>“I was sitting with the Prophet </em><em>Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</em><em> when a Bedouin came to him and said: ‘I have a brother who is sick.’ He said: ‘What is the matter with your brother?’ He said: ‘He suffers from a slight mental derangement.’ He said: ‘Go and bring him.’” He said: “(So he went) and he brought him. He made him sit down in front of him and I heard him seeking refuge for him with Fatihatil-Kitab; four Verses from the beginning of Al-Baqarah, two Verses from its middle: ‘And your Ilah (Allah) is One Ilah (Allah),’ [2:163] and Ayat Al-Kursi; and three Verses from its end; a Verse from Al ‘Imran, I think it was: ‘Allah bears witness that La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He),’ [3:18] a Verse from Al-A’raf: ‘Indeed, your Lord is Allah,’ [7:54] a Verse from Al-Mu’minun: ‘And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allah, any other ilah (god), of whom he has no proof,’[23:117] a Verse from Al-Jinn: ‘And He, exalted is the Majesty of our Lord,’ [72:3] ten Verses from the beginning of As-Saffat; three Verses from the end of Al-Hashr; (then) ‘Say: He is Allah, (the) One,’ [112:1] and Al-Mu’awwidhatain. Then the Bedouin stood up, healed, and there was nothing wrong with him.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Ibn Majah [no.3549], Ibn Sunni [pp.298-299], Hakim said the hadith is Sahih and preserved, however Haithami said, <em>“Abdullah ibn Ahmad narrated it from and the chain contains Abu Janab who is weak, he would do a lot of tadlis. Ibn Hibban authenticated him and the rest of the narrators are the narrators of the Sahih’s”</em> [Majma’a al-Zawaʿid [5:115], Hafiz Ibn Hajr said, <em>“Abu Janab is Yahya bin Abi Hayyah who is weak and also a mudallis, a good narrator and there is speech concerning him and he also opposed his teachers in the chain. It is apparent there is a companion in the hadith and he did not mention his name or kunyah which is contradictory and indicative from the chain.”</em> [Fatuhat al-Rabaniyyah [4:42], Shaikh al-Albani graded it weak in his checking of the Sunan of Ibn Majah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE NARRATION OF ABDULLAH IBN MAS’UD</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is narrated that once Abdullah ibn Masʿud RadiAllahu Anhu recited some ayahs in the ear of someone inflicted or suffering and he regained consciousness. The Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam asked him, <em>“What did you recite in his ear?” He replied and said, “</em><em>Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?&#8221;. </em><em>So exalted is Allah , the Sovereign, the Truth; there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Noble Throne. </em><em>And whoever invokes besides Allah another deity for which he has no proof &#8211; then his account is only with his Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed. </em><em>And, [O Muhammad], say, &#8220;My Lord, forgive and have mercy, and You are the best of the merciful.&#8221; [Surah al-Mu’minun:115-118].

Haithami said, <em>“Transmitted by Abu Ya’la and Ibn Lahiyyah is in the chain who is weak, his hadith are hasan and the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Sahihs.”</em> [Majma’a al-Zawa’id [5:115], Hafiz Ibn Hajr said, <em>“This Hadith is Gharib, Tabarani transmitted it in his book al-Du’a, Ibn Abi Hatim in his Tafisr, however Uqaili said Abdullah ibn Ahmad bin Hanbal said his father (ie Imam Ahmad) said, “It is fabricated, it is a report of the liar.”</em> [Dhuʿfa al-Kabir [2:113], also cited by Dhahabi in al-Mizan [2:185]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Qayyim mentions his teacher and the Shaikh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah <em>“He would recite this ayah in the ear of the insane people. On one occasion he recited it and the possessing jinn said ‘Yes’ in a drawn out voice. So he took and stick and beat him on his veins on the side of his neck until his arm became fatigued the people thought the man was dead from the beating. During the beating the jiin cried out and said, “I love him.” Imam Ibn Taymiyyah said, “He does not love you.” It said, “I want to make Hajj with him,” He replied, “He does not want to make Hajj with you.” It said, “I will leave him in your honour.” He replied, “no, do so in obedience to Allah and his Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.” It said, “Then I will leave him,” The man person sat up and looked left and right and said, “Why did I come to the honourable Shaikh?” The people present said, “What about all the beating your received,” He asked, “For what would the Shaikh Beat me when I have not committed a sin?” He was not aware that he had been beaten. The Shaikh also used to treat people with Ayatul Kurdi and he used to order the possessed as well as the exorcist to read it often, alone with the Muwwadhatain.”</em> [Zad al-Ma’ad [4:67-68]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE NARRATION OF ABDULLAH IBN ABBAS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhu narrates from the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam that he supplicated for a child (inflicted with possession) and stroke his chest with his hand. [Majma&#8217;a [9:2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhuma also narrates a woman bought her child to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and informed him of him being inflicted with mental illness (Jinn possession) and is seized with fits every morning and evening and ruins our lives. The Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam put his hand on the child&#8217;s chest and supplicated for him. He immediately vomited and they found remnants of a black puppy which ran away. The child became well and then left.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Sunan Darimi [no.20] and Musnad Ahmad. Haithami mentioned that one narrator in the chain Farqad is weak however Ibn Ma&#8217;in and al-Ejli said he was trustworthy. Majma&#8217;a [9:2]. [Tabarani, Baihaqi and Abu Nu’aym have also transmitted it, refer also to [Khasais al-Kubra [2:290]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This narration that mentions the child vomited and there were remnants of a black puppy, this addition is not established with an authentic chain. However this narration being weak is not problematic as the issues seems exactly the same and thus reaches the level of Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>THE NARRATION OF IBN ABBAS FROM ATA BIN ABI RABAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Narrated &#8216;Ata bin Abi Rabah, Ibn `Abbas said to me, <em>&#8220;Shall I show you a woman of the people of Paradise?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This black lady came to the Prophet </em><em>Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</em><em> and said, &#8216;I get attacks of epilepsy and my body becomes uncovered; please invoke Allah for me.&#8217; The Prophet </em><em>Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</em><em> said (to her), &#8216;If you wish, be patient and you will have (enter) Paradise; and if you wish, I will invoke Allah to cure you.&#8217; She said, &#8216;I will remain patient,&#8217; and added, &#8216;but I become uncovered, so please invoke Allah for me that I may not become uncovered.&#8217; So he invoked Allah for her.&#8221; </em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The 11<sup>th</sup> century Ash’ari theologian, Muhammad bin Ei’lan al-Siddiqi [1057H] in his explanation of this narration clearly mentions there are two types of epileptic fits (1) due to an illness and (2) due to jinn possession. The later is established from the Quran itself based on the ayah, <strong>“</strong><strong>Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by shaytan into insanity.” [</strong><strong>Surah al-Baqarah:275] </strong>and the hadith in Musnad Ahmad of the mother who bought her possessed child to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam whilst he was travelling and he exorcised the jinn by asking it to leave. The mother offered some gifts in return. This type of possession should be cured through ruqyah by reciting ayah al-Kursi and the Muwadhatain. [Dalil al-Falihin Sharh Riyadh al-Salihin [1:125] <strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The word used in the hadith is epilepsy or convulsing fits. Hafiz Ibn Hajr explained this and said the wording of another hadith mention, <em>“The woman would say,</em> <em>“I fear the Khabith (evil Shaytan jinn) will expose/uncover me (ie the uncover my clothes during the fits and expose my private parts.)”</em>  [Fath al-Bari [10:115] and the hadith is from Musnad al-Bazzar [no.5073]</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE HADITH OF ANAS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Anas RadiAllahu Anhu is also an evidence of jinn possession, he narrates the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <em>“For verily shaytan (evil jinn) runs through the veins (of humans) like blood does.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Muslim [no. 2174], Adab al-Mufrad [pp.471 no.1288], Sharh al-Sunnah [14:404-405] of Baghawi, Musnad Ahmad [3:162, 285], Tahawi [1:29], Shu’bal Iman [5:321] of Baihaqi, Musnad Abu Ya’la [no.3470]</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <em>“Verily shaytan (evil jinn) runs through humans just like blood flows&#8230;”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Bukhari [no.2035 2038, 2039, 3281], Fath al-Bari [13:159] Muslim [no.2175], Sharh Sahih Muslim [4:155], Sharh al-Sunnah [14:404-405], Abu Dawud [no.4994], Shaikh al-Albani graded the hadith in Sunan Abi Dawud as Sahih]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Some scholars have used this Hadith as evidence that Shaytan is an evil jinn can possess a human which is often the reason for mental illnesses and fits. According to Hafiz al-Haithami this Hadith clearly refutes the Mu&#8217;tazilah who deny and reject a jinn can posses a human. [Kitab al-Radud Ala Abatil [2:138]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The modern day jahmites and those who are bent in imitating the kuffar with their chains and dress code have relied on a statement of Qadi Ayad under the guise of the Maliki Madhab which is itself aberrant just because Qadi Ayad was learned of the Maliki Madhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Ayad said that the aforementioned hadith give an apparent meaning of vigilance in that shaytan is constantly and continuously engaged in attempting to beguile and misguide the human with his whisperings. Thus it seems as if shaytan is inseparable from man just as blood is constantly running through the body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However Qadi Ayad as part of the statement also said the apparent meaning of the hadith is that Allah ordained such power for shaytan for it to run through the human just as blood does. [Hashiyyah Sahih Muslim [4:193]   </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> There are numerous other ahadith which show the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam sought refuge in Allah from the evil Shaytan and it was not their whisperings only. He would recite supplications daily in his prayers which highlights how serious and concerned he was about the evil effects of evil Jinns. In fact he even fought with the jinns!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Narrated Abu Hurairah RadiAllahu Anhu, The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam once offered the prayer and said, <em>&#8220;Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, &#8216;My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.&#8217; Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated).&#8221; </em></span></p>

Glory be to Allah in the morning and after (saying it three times). I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed devil, from his puffing up (nafkh), his spitting (nafth) and his evil suggestion (hamz). He (Amr) said: His nafth it poetry, his nafkh is pride, and his hamz is madness.</em>”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah RadiAllahu Anhu said the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <em>“The yawning as from the devil. So when one of you yawns he should try to restrain it as far as it lies in his power.”</em> And the Hadith of Abu Sa’id al-Khudri RadiAllahu Anhu who said Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <em>“When one of you yawns, he should keep his mouth shut with the help of his hand, for it is the devil that enters therein.”</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers note the word used is يَدْخُلُ Yadkhulu ie enter&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr said it is possible the entering of shaytan in the mouth is haqiqi ie real and as shaytan roams or runs through the human body, he does not over power him as long as he continues to make zikr of Allah. So when a person yawns he is not making zikr and thus shaytan overpowers him and enters into him in reality ie haqiqi. [Fath al-Bari [10:216]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Minawi said shaytan entering into him when he yawns and opens his mouth shaytan enters his stomach. [Faidh al-Qadir [1:404] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Muhsin al-Abbad said it is known that shaytan runs through the body of bani Adam and thus also enters into him. [Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud [27:437]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Narrated Alaqah ibn Sahar at-Tamimi <em>“That he came to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and embraced Islam. He then came back from him and passed some people who had a lunatic fettered in chains. His people said: We are told that your companion has brought some good. Have you something with which you can cure him? I then recited Surat al-Fatihah and he was cured. They gave me one hundred sheep. I then came to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and informed him of it. He asked: Is it only this? The narrator, Musaddad, said in his other version: Did you say anything other than this? I said: No. He said: Take it, for by my life, some accept if for a worthless chain, but you have done so for a genuine one.”</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are numerous reports from the great Imams of this Ummah who would expel jinns from people. There are reports from Imam Ahmad [See Tabaqat Ashab Imam Ahmad of Qadhi Abu Ya’la and also Akam al-Marjan [pp.15] of al-Ashbili]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Hamid Fiqhi said, <em>&#8220;When we known Jinns have no form and invisible, then possessing a humans body is not something that is inconceivable by the way of intellectually and textually. This is because a minute or something small can enter into something bigger. Examples of this are air which penetrates our body, fire reaches in the inner core of something and electricity passes through a wire. The position of the people of truth is to accept these texts which transmit and thus allude to Jinns entering the human body. There are an overwhelming number of textual evidences which can not be ignored or abandoned just for the sake of the futility of those who deny and reject this (ie Jinn possession). There are so many incidences of Jinns entering the human body and eyewitness account that enumerating them would be extremely difficult. Thus, those who deny this reality and such accounts effectively refute and rebuke their own statements themselves.”</em> [Radud Ala Abatil [2:135]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Wahid Abdul Salam Bali said there are so many evidences on this issue and an overwhelming amount of statements from the people of knowledge that only an arrogant and argumentative person would deny them. [Waqayah Al-Insan Minal Jinn wal-Shaytan [pp.56-68]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Qayyim mentions that convoluting fits are of two types and that one of them is due to roaming evil Jinns [Tibb Nabawi [pp.51]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Qayyim goes on to describe the biological causes. He says, “<em>Regarding madness due to humors (akhlaa<u>t</u>), it is a sickness which partially prevents the limbs from feeling, moving and straightening out. It is caused by a viscous, sticky humor partly blocking pores inside the brain, resulting in a fractional inhibition of sensory influence and movement within it and within the limbs. Or it could be from other causes. For example, it could be from the trapping of a viscid odor in the outlets of the spirit, or from the rising of bad gases to the brain from some of the organs…causing the brain to contract in order to ward off the pain. This is followed by convulsions and twitching in all the limbs. The man is not able to remain upright but falls down, and froth usually appears in his mouth. This illness is considered among the periodical sicknesses relative to the [short] time frame of its painful occurrence. It is also considered among the chronic illnesses relative to the long period of its presence and the difficulty of curing those afflicted, especially beyond the age of twenty-five. It is an illness of brain matter, and such a form of epilepsy is persistent. As Hippocrates said, “Epilepsy remains in such persons until death.”</em> [al-Tibb al-Nabawi [pp.55]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Qayyim also said, <em>“There are two types of Jinn’s possession of human beings,</em> <em>Possession caused by earthly malicious spirits ie jinns</em> <em>and the other caused by filthy mixtures.</em> <em>As for the second type, it is the domain of physicians to find what causes it and how to treat it.</em> <em>Concerning the possession by spirits, the knowledgeable persons among them acknowledge its existence and do not deny it. They also admit that its treatment should be by confronting the celestial, benevolent and honorable spirits with that wicked and malicious ones to ward off the evil they cause and forestall their acts. This is even stated by Hippocrates in some of his books, as he mentioned some cures for possession. However, he said that his cure is only beneficial in case of possession caused by mixture of filthy blends, but not for that caused by evil spirits.</em> <em>Whereas, ignorant, worthless and disreputable physicians deny the possession by spirits and do not admit that they affect the body of the possessed person relying on no evidence to support their claims. They are only ignorant, as there is no medical proof to prove the impermissibility of this matter. The Jinn’s possession of human beings is an established fact and reality attests to it. However, the physicians’ denial of possession and ascribing this to the occurrence of some filthy blends is partially, not completely true.</em> <em>Ignorant and atheist doctors started to attribute the possession of human beings as caused only by filthy blends, but anyone with the least knowledge of such spirits and how they affect the body of the possessed will be astonished at the ignorance of such people and the weakness of their perception of such matters.”</em> [Zad al-Ma’ad Fi Hadi Khair al-Ibad [4:67-69]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah mentions some of the reasons why jinns possess humans, <em>“The occasional possession of man by the jinn may be due to sensual desires on the part of the jinn…or even love, just as it may be among humans.”</em> <em>He also said “Demonic possession sometimes also occurs as a result of horseplay, jest or plain evil on the part of the jinn, just as evil and mischief occurs among the humans for similar reasons.” He goes onto say, “However, possession is most often a result of the jinn being angry because some wrong has been done to them. Thus, the jinn punish those who wronged them. For example, when humans accidentally harm them or hurt them by urinating on them, by pouring hot water on them, or by killing some of them, the jinn think that they have been intentionally harmed. Although humans may not realize what they have done, the jinn are by nature very ignorant, harsh and volatile in their behaviour, so they may vengefully punish humans much more severely than they deserve.” </em>[See Majmu’a al-Fatawa [19:39]  Risalah al-Jinn [pp.31-32]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> Hafiz Ibn Hajr also mentions that convoluting fits are due to evil Jinns possessing the body and causing it harm. (Fath Al-Bari (10:114)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr also mentioned there are numerous evidences which allude to the harms and effects of jinn possession. [refer to Bazl al-Ta’un Fi Fazal al-Ta’un [pp.83].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said, <em>“The scholars of Ahlus Sunnah are unanimously agreed that a jinn can enter a human body.” </em>[Majmu’a al-Fatawa [24:276-277]. He uses as evidence Ayah of Surah al-Baqarah:275 and the Hadith of shaytan running through the body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah further said that Imam Abul Hasan al-Ashari said in his Maqalat Ahlus Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah that a jinn can enter and possess the a human being as Allah said <em>“</em><em>Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity.”</em> [Surah al-Baqarah:275]. [Majmu’a al-Fatawa [19:12]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah bin Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said, <em>“I said to my father, “People say a jinn cannot possess (ie enter) a human (body) and cause harm.” He replied, “Oh my son, these people lie and in reality it is shaytan himself who makes them say this (lie) (whilst possessing them).”</em> [Majmu’a al-Fatawa [24:227], Akam al-Marjan [pp.143-144]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are also reports from Imam Ahmad that he exorcised jinns [Refer to Laqt al-Marjan Fi Ahkam al-Jann  [pp.138]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Amr bin Ubaid said, <em>“Whoever denies and rejects jinns posses humans and enter their bodies he is an atheist.”</em> [Akam al-Marjan [pp.109]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah has devoted a great deal of research and writings on this subject and clarified in great detail of the reality and veracity of jinn possession and their affects. Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah has discussed this at length in his book <em>‘Aydah al-Dalalah Fi Umum al-Risalah’</em> which is incorporated in volume 19 of his Majmu’a al-Fatawa. It was published as a separate treatise titled ‘<em>Aydah al-Dalalah Fi Umum al-Risalah Wa’l Ta’rif Bi Ahwal al-Jinn</em>’ in Egypt with the verification of the late Egyptian scholar Shaikh Muhammad Shakir and this treatise is commonly known or often referred to <em>‘al-Risalah al-Jinn.’</em> Shaikh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah also discusses and touches on the subject in volume 35 of his Majmu’a al-Fatawa as well as his outstanding book, <em>‘al-Furqan Bayna Awliya al-Rahman Wa Awliya al-Shaytan.’ </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Hazm said, <em>“When Shaytan ie jinn enters a human he enters a state of insanity.”</em> [al-Fasal Fil Milal Wa’l Nihal [5:14]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Hanafi scholar, Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Ashbili al-Hanafi [799H] who we have cited above from his book authored a detailed book on this subject titled, <em>‘Akam al-Marjan Fi Ghara’ib al-Akhbar Wa Ahkam al-Jann.’</em> Just as Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned Imam Abul Hasan al-Ash’ari cited an ijma ie consensus of the Sunni scholars on jinn possession, al-Ashbili also cited the same consensus in his book. [Akam al-Marjan [pp.143]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Qastalani also believes in jinn possession and their evil effects. [al-Muwahid al-Ladunya Bi’l Manah al-Muhammadiyyah [3:448-449]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In current times before the recent immature outburst from those who have mocked the sacred sciences was Shaikh Ali Tantawi, he rejected and denied Jinn possession and no doubt this was probably due to the influence of Mu’tazilite theology which does not fall short of heresy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also again prior to another recent Nadwi outcry based on lack of knowledge of the sacred sciences and bold claims of knowledge and defence of the Hanafi madhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the Nadwis made this claim over 30 years ago and thus this erroneous notion and opposition to the Ijma, consensus of Sunni scholars spreading 1400 years is indeed a rejected and disparaged position which should be shunned and warned against as well as those who ignorantly promote this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are referring to the article of Dr. Muhammad Irfan which appeared in the Nadwa Journal dated 14:10:1407 where he alleged the word majnun ie madness has disappeared from the medical perspective, furthermore, that jinn possession and or the jinn entering a human and speaking through him is 100% wrong!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Aziz ibn Abdullah Baz refuted this notion and Shaikh Ali Tantawi’s position in his short epistle and treatise titled, <em>‘Aydah al-Haq Fi Dukhul al-Jinn Fi’l Insi Wa Radd A’la Man Ankara Zalik.’</em> The Shaikh Ibn Baz expounds the position and creed of Ahlus Sunnah in great detail with extensive evidences. The avid reader is advised to refer to it. [The epistle appeared in the al-Mujtama journal [Issue no.830], Dated: 12<sup>th</sup> Dhul Hijjah 1407H / 18<sup>th</sup> August 1987]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Aziz ibn Abdullah ibn Baz said, <em>“We have cited the evidences for jinn possession and the consensus of the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah  and the reader will clearly know the people who deny and reject jinn possession and that jinns can enter a humans body are upon clear error.”</em> [Majmu’a al-Fatawa [3:307].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad bin Saleh al-Uthaimin also mentioned the same as did Shaikh Saleh al-Fawzan [refer to Fatawa Islamiyyah and Muntaqa Fi’l Fatawa al-Fawzan]   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the reality based on textual evidences from the Quran, its Tafsir, the Hadith and from its explanation and from the statements of the scholars. There are an overwhelming number of evidences in this regard and due to time constraints we have kept this relatively brief and short.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The evidences outlined in this epistle show the true reality of the modern so called scholars and their actual knowledge of the Islamic sciences no matter how many books they have written or how many KGs they can lift. Lastly we advise to be careful who you take knowledge from and also who you promote as you will be responsible for any misguidance and deviation.     </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Difference Between The Salafi’s and The Ashari’s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated, Compiled and Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So know dear reader that when an Asharee who attempts to use his intellect over the authentic sunnah and attempts to say that an authentic hadeeth which confirms a particular Attribute, name or action of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala is not accepted because it is in contradiction with the Qur’an, then know that he is upon misguidance and away from all of the Muslims in his creed and the consensus of the blessed companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great imam al-A’ajuree d.360H spoke concerning those people who leave off the Sunnah from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam because they think that there is a contradiction with the Qur’an and instead they follow their own intellects, he has said that they are Mulhids (heretics), please refer to his book ash-Sharee’ah. (Ash shariyyah lil-Ajuree pg 350-351)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From amongst another deception of the Ashaairah is that they say <em>‘even if the hadeeth is authentic concerning the Attribute of Allah then many of them we cannot take as they are khabarul Ahad which are not like the Qur’an or have not come in mutawaatir form. In essence, this means that there is a doubt on the khabarul ahad hadeeth (which is a narration reported by less than the mutawaatir form and therefore for them that does not give the benefit of certain knowledge). The belief in the Attributes of Allah is based upon certain knowledge and not upon knowledge which has doubt within it’</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The asharis of past and present have used a particular narration which is very famous amongst them in order to substantiate this weak principle and that is a hadeeth which is mentioned in current modern times by the likes of Kawtharee and in earlier times by the likes of Imaam Baihaqee.  The hadeeth is from Abdullah bin Urwah Bin Zubair al-Awaam that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Verily Zubair bin al-Awaam </em><em>Radiallahu ‘anhu heard a man narrate a hadeeth from the Messenger of Allah </em><em>sallahu alaihi wasallam, so Zubair began to listen very attentively up until the man completed the narration. Thereupon, Zubair said to the man ‘did you hear this narration from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam?’. The man replied, ‘yes’. Zubair said, ‘We have heard similar to this from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam and because of this we refrain from mentioning hadeeth from the Messenger. By Allah I was present when the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam informed us about this narration and when he started to inform us of this narration he said in the beginning that he is narrating this to us from a man from the previous times who was from the ahlul kitaab (the people of the book) and on that day you came late and did not hear the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam mention that this narration was from the people of the book and therefore you took the words of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam as being an authentic narration from the Prophet  yet it was from the previous times of the people of the book and not from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam”. (</em>Kitabul asma wa sifaat of Baihaqee pg.258, Kawtharees footnotes to Baihaqee’s Asma was- Sifaat pg.358)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After mentioning this narration, Baihaqee said, <em>“And this narration is one of the reasons why our scholars of our madhab have said that to take the akhbaarul ahaad concerning the Attributes of Allah and to base belief upon this, is abandoned, due to this being a single narration and not like the Book of Allah or consensus. And due to this our scholars became engrossed in making figurative interpretation and ta’weel concerning the Attributes.”</em> (Baihaqee asma wa sifaat pg.450)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So it is clear from this that some of the ashaa’irah try to substantiate their aqeedah and at the most they try to take it back to the likes of Imaam Baihaqee by saying that, Baihaqee himself says that the scholars from the mutaqallimeen and the ashaa’irah at that time did not take the authentic narrations as khabrul ahad concerning the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala. However, this is incorrect for many reasons:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The narration which Bahaiqee himself relies upon from Zubair bin al-Awaam is unsubstantiated and rejected and there are 3 reasons for this.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">In the chain is a man known as Abu Ja’far A’raabee or al-Azaa’mee he is unknown as was mentioned by Shaykh Abdur Rahman bin Yahyaa al-Muallamee al-Yamaanee who said, <em>“I do not know of him.” (</em>al-Anwar ul Kaashifah pg.60)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Another narrator within the chain is Abul Abbas as-Sabaghee Muhammed bin Ishaaq bin Ayub. There is no tawtheeq for him. In fact his more established and trustworthy brother Imaam Abu Bakr Ahmad bin Ishaaq as-Sabaghee an-Nisapooree would make disparaging remarks about him for being a lewd man and a vagabond, he would stop people from narrating or listening to ahadeeth from him. (Haafiz Dhahabee’s Siyaar A&#8217;alaam An-Nubalaa vol.15 pg.489)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">This narration is not from Urwah bin Zubair but it is from his son Abdullah bin Urwah bin az-Zubair (Al-Anwar ul-Kashifah of Imaam Yamaani pg.60). This is important because Abdullah bin Urwah Rahimahullah was born in the year 45A.H. (Taqreeb at-Tahdhib no.3485) and the companion Zubair bin al-Awaam was martyred on his return from the battle of Jamal in the year 36A.H (Taqreeb at-Tahdhb of Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaani no.2003) .Therefore this narration is disconnected (Munqati’) and the disconnected (Munqati’) narration is known to be weak and unacceptable. In summary, Abdullah the son of Urwah was born after his grandfather’s {Zubair bin Awaam} death so he could not have narrated this from him.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, there are various other authentic narrations which are akhabarul ahad which have been accepted by consensus of the salaf which substantiate the Attributes of Allah. For example, the Attribute of a Foot for Allah is in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (Kitaab at-Tawheed hadeeth no.7384, Saheeh Muslim: the chapter of paradise and it’s attributes and blessings for those who are in it no. 2848, Sunan Tirmidhee no. 2558 who said this hadeeth was Hasan Saheeh, Saheeh Abee Awaanah no.344, al-Mukhtaar of Dhiyaa al-Maqdisee no.2486, Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan al-Ehsaan no. 268).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And just as a benefit to those readers who want even more confirmation concerning this Attribute, then know that Imaam Ishaaq bin Masoor al-Koosaj asked Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal about the narrations concerning the Foot of Allah and other Attributes, Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal replied, <em>“All of this is substantiated from authentic narrations”</em> and Imaam Ishaaq bin Rahawaihah said, <em>“This narration concerning the foot is authentic and those who have weak intellect and are from Ahlul Bid’ah are the ones who make distortions and negation concerning it.</em> (Ash-Shariyy’ah of al-Ajuree vol. 3 pg.1128 and he said the chain is saheeh)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Mandah said concerning the Foot of Allah, <em>“And this narration is accepted by consensus.” (</em>Radd Alal Jahmiyyah vol.1 pg.19)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore it is clear that from amongst the Khairul Quroon (that is approximately up to the year 300H) there is not a single scholar or companion or a mujtahid who rejected the authentic akhbaar ul ahaad concerning the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Instead, all the companions, the tabi’een, the taba tabi’een and the scholars of hadeeth accepted the Attributes as they came whether it was from an ahad narration, the Qur’an or mutawaatir form from various ahadeeth and this was part of their faith. It is therefore clear that the ashaa’irah of past and present have no basis for creating yet another obstacle for rejecting the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala in the way that they have come and to accept them literally, without taweel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we have seen that the ashaa’irah in the past and more so in the present have fallen into the grave sin of rejecting and making figurative interpretations of the Names and the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala, especially where they created their own principles in order to promote their madhab. At times the ashaairah let their intellects overcome the text of the hadeeth to be taken upon its literal meaning, at times they rejected the saheeh hadeeth because it went against their madhab and therefore they made interpretations of it, at times they rejected the Attributes of Allah because they said that the ahadeeth which have come are in contradiction with the Qur’an and other than that which we have mentioned above.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the result of this is that the ashaa’irah continue to propagate various narrations in order to support their false beliefs. Concerning this we are going to mention a few narrations here which are a result of the innovated principles of the ashaa’irah regarding the Attributes of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the narrations which the ashaa’irah maturidiyyah and other than them from the deviated sects have brought based upon their weak intellect, they said that Allah Subhanahu wata’ala said about Himself,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I was a hidden treasure, nobody knew me, then I wanted for the people to get to know me, so I created the people, the creation and gave it my ma’rifah (ability to understand) then after this they got to know me.” (</em>This hadeeth has been given a particular paramount importance by the modern day ashari deobandis. Haji Imdaadullah Muhaajar Makkee in his book Shamaaim Imdaadiyyah pg.39 wherein he attempts to explain the correct way of the ashaa’irah and the murji’ah mu’tazilah concerning the Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala based upon this fabricated narration!)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, we can see that this narration is nothing more than a fabricated narration which has been falsified by the deviant sects to prop up their own Madhab aswell as the Jahmiyyah.  We will not go into pages of evidence of who has called this fabricated, but it is sufficient to say that Hafiz Ibn Taymiyyah has said that this is fabricated (Tanziyah us-Sharriyyah of Kitaanee vol.1 pg.48).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Similarly Imaam Suyootee in his book (Dhail al-Lai’ee of Suyootee pg.203) has said that this verdict concerning the narration being fabricated is accurate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This narration has also been mentioned as a fabricated narration in (Mawdho’aatul Fitna pg. 11).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Sakhawee has also said that this narration is fabricated (al-Maqaasid al-Husna pg.153).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And furthermore the likes of Zarkhashee has also said that this narration has no basis and is fabricated (Tameez ut-Tayyib Minal Khabeeth pg.122).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Mulla Alee Qaaree has also said that this narration is fabricated (al-mawdhooaat lil fitna pg.54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So one can see the attempts by the ashaa’irah and the maturidiyyah who have tried to fabricate narrations in order to prove their creed by saying that how can we say Allah has a hand and Eyes and a Foot and Leg and various other Attributes if He Himself said about Himself that he was  unknown and then later on He became known to the people so the asl of Allah is that He is unknown and no one knows of Him except Allah Himself and through this the ashaa’irah and the muffawwidah who perform tawfeedh try to substantiate that Allah is unknown therefore His Attributes are meaningless and are not known. What a lie they made against Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and left the madhab of the salaf in order to substantiate that which was falsehood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith which the ashaa’irah, mu’tazilah, jahmiyyah bring in order to substantiate their false and rejected beliefs is,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The heart of a believer is the Throne of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“The heart of a believer is the house of Allah.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> So these narrations are brought so that they could say that the sifaat (Attributes) of Allah and Allah being above the throne have been explained by way of interpretation ta’weel by the Prophet himself!.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Read, This is fabricated. Sakhaawi said: <em>“It has no basis from the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam”</em> (al-Maqaasid al-Husna pg.144)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and likewise it is written in Tameez at-Tayyib minal Khabeeth (pg.114)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and likewise Ibn Taymiyyah said, “It is fabricated” (Tanzih ash-Shariyyah pg.148).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is similarly mentioned to be fabricated by Mulla Ali al-Qaari (al-Mawdhooaat pg.51). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Imaam Suyooti said that this is mawdoo (Dhail al-Lai’ee pg.203)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we can clearly see that the ashaa’irah and various other heretical sects including the jahmiyyah, maturidiyyah and others have traditionally in the past and continue in the present day to use various obstacles to go against the way of the salaf. But we say that salvation is only in the way of the salaf as-Saliheen and the correct aqeedah concerning the Attributes is as they have understood it and have mentioned in their books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah Subhanahu wata’ala forgive us for our sins and keep us upon the aqeedah and manhaj of the salaf us-Saliheen in making the aqeedah and manhaj clear from the doubts of the ahl ul ahwaa wal bidah. Ameen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The slaves of Allah,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">First compiled and Published 1998</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ‘Bukhaari of the West’, the Imaam, the Hafidh, ibn Abdul Barr (d.423H), the Imaam of the Sunnah of his time said in his work at-Tamheed under the commentary of the 8<sup>th</sup> hadeeth:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<em>From Abu Hurayra that the Prophet </em><em>ﷺ</em> <em>said, ‘Our Lord descends every night to the lowest heaven when the last third of the night remains and says:” who is there calling upon Me that I may answer? Who is there asking of Me that I may give him?’”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“This hadeeth is established from the point of view of transmission having an authentic chain, the Ahlul Hadeeth do not differ as to its authenticity…</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">…and in this is evidence that Allaah is over (fee) the heaven, over (alaa) Throne, above (Fawqa) the seven heavens, as is said by the Jama’ah, and this is their proof against the Mu’tazila and Jahmiyyah in their saying that Allaah is in every place, not over His Throne. And the evidence for what the people of truth say on that is His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘<strong>The Most Merciful rose above the Throne’ (20:5), `then He rose over the Throne…’(32:4), `then they would surely have sought out a way to (ilaa) the Lord of the Throne’ (17:42), `To Him ascends all goodly words…’(35:10), `Do you feel secure that He who is over (fee) the heavens will not cause the earth to sink on you?’ (67:16), `Glorify the name of your Lord Most High’ (87:1)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this is from Uluww and likewise His saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">`<strong>The Most High, The Most Great’</strong> (2:55), <strong>`The Most Great, The Most High’</strong> (13:9), <strong>`Owner of High ranks, owner of the Throne’</strong> (40:15), <strong>`They fear their Lord from above them’</strong> (16:50)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the jahmi says He is lower (then them), <strong>`He arranges every affair from the heaven and the earth, then it (affair) will go up to Him.’ (32:5),</strong> `O Jesus!  I will take you and raise you to Myself’ (3:55), <strong>`Rather Allaah raised him to Himself.’ (4:158), `From Allaah, the Lords of ways of ascent. The Angels and the Spirits ascend to Him.’(70:2-3)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for His saying, `do you feel secure that he who is “fee” the heaven’, then the meaning is `who is over (`alaa) the <strong>heaven</strong>’ .i.e. over the Throne. And the fee is being used with the meaning `alaa. Do you not see His saying, `<strong>so travel freely fee the land</strong>’ (9:2) meaning `upon (`alaa) the land’, and His saying, `<strong>and I will surely crucify you on (fee) the trucks of the palm trees</strong>’ (20:71) and all of this (i.e. interpretation of fee) is supported by His saying, `the Angels and spirits ascend to Him’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And what we have recited and the like of it from the verse to do with this topic are clear in their denial of the saying of the Mu’tazila (i.e. Allaah is everywhere). And as for their taking Istawaa metaphorically, and in it ta’wil to mean istawlaa (conquering) then this is not a meaning of it because it is not clear (ghayru dhaahir) in the language. And the meaning of istawlaa in the language is conquering/overcoming, and Allaah the Exalted does not (need to) overcome or overwhelm anyone. And He is the One, the External.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And from the right of the Words (of Allaah) is that they be taken upon their literal meanings (‘alaa haqeeqatihi), until the ummah is agreed that what is meant is the metaphorical meaning, when there is no way to follow what is revealed to us from our Lord except in that way. And the speech of Allaah is directed towards its most famous and obvious meaning if that (i.e. taking it upon its most famous meanings) is not stopped by something we have to submit to. And if all the claims of metaphors were allowed for every claimant then nothing would established from the actions of worship. And it befits Allaah that He speaks only with that which the Arab understands according to the constraints of the speech (i.e. everyday language) from what is the correctly understood by the listener. And istawaa is known in the language and understood to be: Highness (Uluww) and the rising above something and establishing (at-tamkinu) and settling in it (istiqraar feehee).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Ubaid said about His saying, `the Most Merciful Istawaa upon the Throne’ &#8211; `Above (‘alaa)…’ And others said, Istawaa meaning istaqarra (settling) and they seek support in His saying, <strong>`and when attained his full strength and was perfect (Istawaa)’</strong> (28:14) i.e. completed his youth and grew settled and there was not any increase in his youth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abdul Barr said, and istawaa is Istiqraar in highness (Uluww) [i.e. He has settled in being high], and this is what Allaah has informs us, <strong>`In order that you may mount firmly (tastu) on their backs, and then may remember the favour of your Lord when you mount (istawaytum) thereon…’</strong> (43:13), and Allaah said, `<strong>and it rested (wastawat) on mount Judi’</strong> (11:44) and He the Exalted said, <strong>`so when you embark (istawayta) and those with you on the ship’ </strong>(23:28). [i.e. all the examples show istiwaa to mean coming to rest in a elevated position]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">….and as for them using as a proof the narration of Ibn Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhu) about the saying of Allaah, <strong>`The Most Merciful istawaa upon the Throne’</strong> &#8211; `<strong>He conquered/overcame (istawlaa) all His opponents and His is everywhere</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then the answer is that this hadeeth is munkar to Ibn Abbaas (radhi Allaahu Anhu) and is transmitted by unknown and weak narrators….(takhreej omitted….and they (i.e. mu’tazila who narrated this hadeeth) do not accept the individually narrated traditions so how can they permit depending upon the likes of this hadeeth, if they had sense and were just? As for what they hear Allaah say, <strong>`And Pharaoh said, “O Haman! Build for me a tower that I may arrive at ways – the ways of heavens, and I may look upon the God of Moses but verily I think of him being a liar.”</strong>’(40:36-37) then this lends evidence to the fact that Moses (Alayhis Salam) used to say that verily my God is above the heavens and Pharaoh thought he was a liar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And also from the proofs that Allaah is over His throne, above the seven heavens is that the Believers in Tawheed (Muwahhideen), all of them Arabs and non-Arabs, when a matter concerns them, or a difficulty befalls them, they raise their faces to the heaven, and direct their raised hands to the heaven, seeking succour from Allaah, their Lord. And this is common amongst the general masses as well as the elite (khaasa)….And the Prophet (<em>ﷺ)</em> said to the slave girl whose master who wished to free her if she was a believer, so the Messenger (<em>ﷺ)</em> tested her asking her, `where is Allaah?’ So she pointed to the heaven. Then he asked, `who am I?’ So she said `you are the Messenger of Allaah’. So he said’ `set her free for she is a believer.’ So it sufficed the Messenger of Allaah (<em>ﷺ)</em> from her, her raising her face to the heaven and was content with that, not requiring anything else.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And as for their seeking support in the saying of Allaah, `there is no secret discourse of three except that he is the fourth’ then this is not the proof for them according to the literal sense of this verse. Because the scholars from the companions and taabi’een from whom the explanation of the Qur’aan is taken from, said in this explanation of this verse: He is over the Throne, and His knowledge is in every place, and no one amongst them, whose saying is depended on, differed on this. Ad-Dahhaak said about His saying, <strong>`there is no secret discourse of the three except that He is the fourth…’</strong> &#8211; <strong>`He is over His throne, and His knowledge is with them, where so ever they may be.’</strong> And it has reached me that Sufyaan ath-Thauri said something similar. Ibn Mas’ud (RadhiAllahu Anhu) said, `Allaah is over His Throne, and nothing is hidden from of your actions;” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Tamheed 7:103-105)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Difference Between The Salafi&#8217;s and The Ashari&#8217;s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Translated, Compiled and Annotated</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Who Are The Ahlus Sunnah?</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Sijzi (444AH) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Ahlus Sunnah are established upon the creed that they had established from the Salaf us-Saliheen who took it from the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam. They took from the companions because they were scholars and we must follow the narrations from the companions and we have been ordered to follow their way. Therefore it is necessary to hold onto the way of the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam and the companions and to have belief upon that and in this you can have no doubt.”</em> (Ar-Rad Ala Man Ankaral Khuruf Wa Sawt lee Sijzi (pg.9)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn ul-Jawzee defines Ahlus Sunnah by saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If someone asks that Sunnah is something which is praiseworthy and bid’ah (innovation) is something which is not, but what are Sunnah and bid’ah? We say, every innovator claims that he is from within Ahlus Sunnah, so we answer them by saying that in the arabic language Sunnah means ‘a way’ and in the Sharee’ah it will mean that those who are the Sunnis will be upon the way of the Messenger of Allah, the companions and those which have followed them. They are the Ahlus Sunnah and in that way there is no room for innovations for these came about after the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam and the companions </em>(Talbees Iblees of Ibn al-Jawzee vol.1 pgs.135-136)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Specifically, the term Ahlus Sunnah refers to the Ahlul-Hadeeth and this is because they are included within Ahlus sunnah for they have firm belief in the attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and they affirm them, they say that the Qur’an is the speech of Allah not created, they believe that on Yaum al-Qiyaamah the believers will see Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and they accept all the other established principles of creed other than this and these principles are known between the Ahlus Sunnah and Ahlul Hadeeth.” </em>(Minhaaj as-Sunnah of Ibn Taymiyyah vol.2 pg.221)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Further, the great Imaam Qawaam as-Sunnah Imaam Abul Qasim al-Asbahaanee (d.535H) Rahimahullah discussed in his very valuable book <em>al-Hujjah</em> the term Ahlus Sunnah, Ahlul Hadeeth and its various implications. Imam Asbahaanee said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“We saw the Ashaabul Hadeeth, and they travelled far and wide to collect the narrations, then they sifted out the weak ones from the authentic narrations, they compiled them and they memorised them. The Ashaabul hadeeth (Ahlul Hadeeth) then acted upon these narrations and they promoted and spread these narrations this being their dawah and they used the narrations of the Messenger of Allah </em><em>sallahu alaihi wasallam to refute the mukhaalifeen (the opposers). These Ashaabul Hadeeth had with them a vast amount of authentic narrations just like the cloth seller has clothes, the one who sells dates has dates, and the one who sells perfume has perfume! So the one who sold dates becomes known as the date seller and the one who sells clothes  becomes known as the clothes seller and the one who sells perfume becomes known as the perfume seller, then similarly the Ashaabul hadeeth and the scholars of hadeeth became known as the Ahlul Hadeeth. When these Ahlul Hadeeth saw people going away from the ma’roof (that which was known by way of necessitating and following the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam) and they could see people leaving the authentic narrations and they could see people from the various sects making tanqeed and making disparaging remarks against the narrations the scholars of hadeeth began to refute these people and began to warn against them in their gatherings. The ahulul hadeeth began to mention the real meanings of the words of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam as they ought to have been understood.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So it is fair to say from this evidence that the scholars of hadeeth who authored all of the works in promoting the ittiba (following) of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam in reality they are the <strong>Ahlus Sunnah </strong>and have more of a right to call themselves the <strong>Ahlus sunnah </strong>then any other person or group and this is because according to the scholars the real meaning of Sunnah is to follow the authentic chain of narration (hadeeth) from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam concerning the Ahkaam and to act upon that and to stay away from that which has come by way of a forbiddance in these narrations. Thus this is a clear evidence to say that the ahlul hadeeth, ashaabul hadeeth are actually none other than the Ahlus Sunnah themselves.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>If someone was to say that if this is the case then every other sect other than the Ahlul Hadeeth also mention various narrations as evidences for their beliefs and their actions then what do we say about them? Then our response is, that those which in opposition to an authentic narration bring a weak narration, in opposition to a complete narration, bring a mursal (an incomplete) narration, in opposition to a marfoo’ narration (a narration that reaches with complete chain the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam) bring a mawqoof narration (that which does not reach the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam but a companion) then they cannot be on the same level as the Ahlul Hadeeth whichever sect they may be from! The one who follows the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam based on the authentic narrations he is the one who is following a clear evidence and he is the one who is taking his understanding from the authentic narrations, not from the weak or the incomplete narrations which cannot be in comparison to those narrations which are authentic. Thus it is clear that the Ahlul Sunnah is the one who will follow the authentic narrations and go out of his way to follow the authentic narration over and above any other narration or saying, whereas those who are Ahlul Rai (people of opinion and conjecture) they only follow the narrations which fit well within their hearts and minds.” </em>(Al-Hujjah Fee Bayaanil Mahajjah vol. 3 pgs. 413-414)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The sects which have split from the Ahlul Hadeeth split due to a difference in the Usul and fundamentals by leaving authentic narrations as reported by the Salaf and choosing another path, such as  the Ashaa’irah and those like them who have deviated concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah and the true understanding concerning them, thus leaving the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah for verily they have taken their own distortions, their own minds and hearts, weak narrations, narrations which are unclear and understandings which are futile, over and above the absolutely clear cut authentic Ahadeeth which are proven from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So with which face can the Ashaa’irah of the past or today claim that they are from the Ahlul Sunnah when it comes to the Names and Attributes of Allah? It has expounded on this matter in some great detail and it is sufficient to say that the saying of imam Asbahaanee is a tremendous saying in showing:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A) The fadhal and greatness of the people of hadeeth and those who accept the authentic narrations whether it be in Aqeedah or other than it and the fallacy of those who oppose the authentic narrations who in essence have also opposed the Ahlul hadeeth. Further, no doubt this statement also shows that Aqeedah and creed is based upon authentic narrations and not narrations which are weak or dubious to say the least. So why is it then that the Ashaa’irah and those upon their way do not see that clinging to the way of Ahlul hadeeth is the way of salvation!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">B) It was the Ahlul Hadeeth who made it their routine to record, preserve, accurately narrate, spread and make actions upon the authentic Ahadeeth of our beloved master Muhammad and the best of the Ahlul Hadeeth were the companions in this regard may Allah be pleased with them all and the likes of the Ashaa’irah are far removed in their belief in opposition to the salaf and thus cannot be counted amongst the saved sect the Ahlul Hadeeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">C) It is obligatory to admonish and warn the people about keeping their Aqeedah free from the deviancy and innovated principles in Aqeedah from the likes of the Ashaa’irah and the Manhaj and methodology of doing so is to be taken from the Salaf, Aimmah of Ahlul Hadeeth and in it is a tremendous benefit if only the people knew!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">D) The Ahlul Hadeeth have always been known through the eras by their clinging and making dawah to the authentic Ahadeeth of our master may our parents be sacrificed for him Muhammad and the Athaar of the companions. So just like this the other sects who left the way of Ahlul Hadeeth like the Ashaa’irah have always been known for using spurious baseless arguments based upon there own weak intellects and analogies over above the clear texts established in the Ahadeeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">E) the litmus test of sifting out the deviant Aqeedah and corrupt principles of the likes of the Ashaa’irah is to test their sayings against the authentic narrations of the beloved Muhammad and none other will do this accept the Ahlul Hadeeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">F) Not everyone who narrates a Hadeeth will have the correct understanding of it, especially if he is a bigoted blind follower of a sect (such as the Ashaa’irah) for all that he will desire is to prop up his Madhab and way to the masses not knowing if what he is saying was actually the way of the best of generations after al-Aaqib Muhammad.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">G) There is great importance attached to the isnaad (chain of narration and seeing whom one takes knowledge from} in the religion of al Islaam. The sects that left Ahlus sunnah did so due to their inherent weakness of not paying attention to the difference between the weak and authentic narrations and many followed none other than their desires and opinions. Herein lays a fundamental difference between the Ahlul Hadeeth and the Ashaa’irah in that the Ahlul Hadeeth call to authentic narrations whereas the Ashaa’irah do not. Had it not been for the Ahlul Hadeeth then every sect would have said what it wanted about the Deen of Islaam and it would have been impossible to judge which sect was upon the way of the Salaf. So the Ashaa’irah and other than them are upon beliefs which do not have an authentic sanad (chain and connection) back to our master Muhammad and the Salaf.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">H) Before the innovations and distorted beliefs of the various sects like the Ashaai’rah and other than them the Ummah was united and one upon the way of the messenger and the companions. Thus the various sects split from the Jamaah and it is obligatory upon them to leave their falsehood and come back to the Quran, Sunnah upon the understanding of the companions and their successors, the Salafee, Atharee, Ahlul Hadeeth way and in it is salvation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great Imaam and scholar of Hadeeth Khateeb al-Baghdadi said in his tremendous book <em>Sharf Ashaabul hadeet</em>h concerning the Ahlus Sunnah and the Ahlul Hadeeth that they have a very special characteristic in that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Ahlul Hadeeth always search for the authentic narrations over and above anyone’s opinion and Qiyaas (analogy), the hadeeth is sufficient for them. This is because the Ahlul Hadeeth have the correct Aqeedah due to their reliance upon the authentic narrations for verily the Aqeedah will not only be found in the Qur’an but will be found extensively in the Sunnah also and this is why all basis and types of worship, for example, the principles of Tawheed, the punishments for those who disobey, the Sifaat (the Attributes of Allah </em><em>Subhanahu wata’ala), the kayfiya and description of the Paradise and Hellfire, and the Aqeedah concerning the Angels and the Books and the Prophets and other than this from the principles and fundamentals of Aqeedah are found in the authentic Ahadeeth. Those who take their analogy and their opinions and their understandings over and above the Hadeeth then they do not attain the benefit of this correct Aqeedah. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Every group which is outside of Ahlul Hadeeth leans more towards giving precedence and returning to opinion and analogy over and above the authentic narrations except for the Ahlul Hadeeth for the Hadeeth of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam is the paramount consideration for them in all that they do and all that they preach and they only accept the sayings of the scholars of past and present if that saying is in accordance with the Book of Allah and the authentically proven Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammed sallahu alaihi wasallam and this is why many of the sects of ahlul bid’ah have had no choice but to verbally agree with the creed of the Ahlul Hadeeth but inwardly they have always utilised their analogy and Qiyaas to follow their own Madhahibs and sect. Those in the past and the present up until the Day of Judgement who oppose the Ahlul Hadeeth creed and aqeedah which they are upon, then, Allah Subhanahu wata’ala will humiliate them, those who have enmity towards them then Allah Subhanahu wata’ala will humiliate and punish them further and those which separate from them will never be successful because the people are in need of the Ahlul hadeeth to give them the authentic narrations concerning their beliefs and other than that.” </em>(Sharf Ashabul Hadith pgs 36-37)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we can see further from this saying that the likes of the Ashaa’irah unfortunately have left the way of the Ahlul Hadeeth and instead when it comes to the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala they began to use their own analogy and their own opinions over and above the authentically proven narrations from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam and the companions. No doubt this was a grave reason for their leaving the ahlul sunnah wal jama’ah thus leading to their humiliation.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Difference Between The Salafi&#8217;s and The Ashari&#8217;s Regarding the Attributes of The Merciful </strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Between them is a Barrier Which they do not transgress (Surah ar-Rahman:55)</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated, Compiled and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise is for Allah the one with whose face the believers will be immensely rewarded in the hereafter as they will see his glorious face and between them and Allah there shall be no covering or barrier. We ask Allah with the waseelah of all of his tremendous names and attributes that he makes us from amongst those who will be honoured with such a blessing and not from those who deny and explain away that he does not have a face thus inviting the punishment of Allah upon themselves, misguiding themselves and misguiding others. May there be infinite blessings and salutations upon our master Muhammad and all those who follow him with righteousness until the last day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To proceed:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this short introduction to the book concerning the Ashaa’irah we will be discussing some of the fundamental points that the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah have alluded to when they have analysed the various sects that have reared their heads splitting away from the saved sect, the Ahlus Sunnah, The Ahlul Hadith, the Ahlul Athar, Salafiyeen. We will also be exploring the basic definition and implications of the term “Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah,” especially in relation to the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wa-Ta’ala and the stance of Ahlus Sunnah concerning those that have gone far away from the Ahlul Sunnah concerning their position on the Names and Attributes such as the Asha’irah and Mu’tazilah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will also attempt with the aid of Allah o delve into how some of the deviated sects such as the Asha’irah have tried to use the Qur’an and sometimes the Sunnah for their own benefit and have in fact even gone further in creating principles and rules when it comes to the Names and Attributes of Allah and the reader will come to know that these principles are based upon innovations which they have established  so that they can beguile other people whilst also fooling themselves!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The reader will come to realise that the Asharis and those splinter sects outside of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah have those from amongst them that even went to the extremities of lying upon the Messenger of Allah Salllahu alaihi wasallam and we shall discuss some examples where ahadeeth have been fabricated so that the Madhab and innovated principles of the Ashari’s can be pushed forward to the people concerning making Ta’weel (interpretations) in the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala which have not been accepted by the salaf being primarily the companions and the successors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Blessed are the Salaf and from amongst them the first and foremost the Messenger of Allah Sallalhu alaihi wasallam and the Companions May Allah be pleased with them all for they understood the Arabic language as it was meant to be taken and thus they accepted without any doubt whatsoever all the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wa ta’ala not having the need to make ta&#8217;wil, tamthil, ta&#8217;til or even ilhaid. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Blessed are the companions and their successors for none argued or disputed amongst themselves concerning the acceptance of the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and indeed they had a consensus concerning this issue and this is a consensus which was adhered to by the remaining Salaf of this ummah up until today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam said concerning the Khawarij and their father Dhul Khuwaisarah: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>They will read the Qur’an but it will not raise higher than beyond their throats and they will leave the religion the way an arrow leaves its prey.” </em>(Sahih Muslim hadith number 2316.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This hadith is evidently about the Khawaarij but in it is a deeper meaning and that meaning is that the sects of the past and present who have gone away from the Madhab and the way of the Sahabah and the Salaf have clearly misunderstood the meanings of the Quraan and Sunnah, that is the religion, for the hadeeth in Saheeh al-Bukhaari says that they will read the Qur’an meaning outwardly they would profess Islaam and outwardly they would read the Book of Allah and even they will read the narrations of the Prophet Muhammad sallalahu alaihi Wasallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However this reading of theirs will be distorted and will be of no consequence to them in relation to benefitting them in their Aqidah because they will not be reading it with the understanding and eyesight of the Companions and the Salaf. No doubt this was one of the fundamental reasons for the deviations of the various sects who left the way of Ahlul Hadeeth like the Khawaarij who ended up making mass takfir upon many of the Muslims on account of major sins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly we can see that the Asha’irah and the Mu’tazilah and the modern day Deobandis, Barailwis, Sufis, Qadiris, Chishtis, Naqshbandis, Shadhilis, Habashis, and all the others including the Shi’ahs. ([1] The reader can refer to the excellent books by Shaikh Taalib ur Rehman, this one such book, and the books of the Allaamah Ehsaan Elaahee Zaheer, al-Barailwiyyah, ash-Shia was-Sunnah and at-Tassawuf)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They read the Qur’an and they tell the people that they read the hadeeth and they try to provide evidences from the sources of the Qur’an and hadeeth but they have their own interpretations and this is what this hadeeth refers to, reading the Qur’an or reading the hadeeth is not sufficient if it does not penetrate the heart or does not even go beyond throats and the only way that the hadeeth and the ayah of the Qur’an will be of benefit and penetrate the hearts and be part of Iman based actions upon the limbs is if the understanding and the fahm is taking by the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam, the blessed companions and the Salaf of this ummah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How beneficial would it have been for the past and the current day sects especially the Asha’irah to reflect upon and understand the tremendous saying of the Imam, the Zahid Imam Zuhri (Rahimahullah) who said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Islaam means, for Allah (</em><em>Subhanahu wata’ala)</em><em>to make the bayaan by way of revelation, for the Messenger of Allah (</em><em>sallahu alaihi wasallam) </em><em>to make the balaagh by way of spreading, explaining and conveying that revelation, and for us is the taslim, that is to accept without any hesitations and conditions.”</em> (Zuhd of Ibn Abi Aasim (pg.78), Hilyatul Awliyah of Abu Nu’aym (3/369), Aqidatus Salaf Wa Ashabul Hadith of Abee Isma’il as-Sabuni and Ibn Hajr has also recorded this in his al-Fath with an authentic chain.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we have some of the old Ashaa’irah in the past, so it is important to distinguish between the previous scholars who were influenced by the Ashari creed yet they affirmed Allah being above the Throne and many of his Attributes as they have come to us by way of the Salaf, whilst erring in some methodologies concerning the same, such as, Qadi Abu Bakr al-Baqilani, Imam Abu Bakr al-Baihaqi, Abul Hasan Ibn Mahdi at-Tabari, Abul Hasan al-Ashari, Ibn Kullab and the modern day Ashari’s who are not actually Ashariyyah but more Jahmi, Sufi, Mu’tazili and Murji.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All rolled into one, such as the Jahmite Zahid al-Kawthari, Abu Guddah Abdul Fattah, the Ghumari clan and leaders of the modern day Deobandi’s and Barelvi’s who are outright Mufawwidah and Mu’attilah rejecting the sublime attributes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The modern day Asha’irah who make various claims and arguments about why they feel the need to make interpretations in the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and they attempt to attribute their innovation back to the Salaf who of course are absolutely free from such beliefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> One of the things which the Asha’irah of past and present have tried to hide behind is the term Ahlus Sunnah and they claim that <em>“to make Ta’wil (metaphorical and figurative interpretations) of Allahs attributes and to make Tafwidh (not giving the attributes a meaning that was understood by the Salaf as they have come)  is the way of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah”</em> and in this they try to beguile the common people by making them think that this way is the way of the Sahabah and the first three generations. So we ask who are the Ahlus Sunnah? How did the Salaf understand this term and in general, what does it entail?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Rajab defined ‘Sunnah’ by saying </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“it is a way which is established in the beliefs and actions and it is a way that the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam and the rightly guided Khulafah were upon, this is known as Sunnah tul-Kamilah (the complete Sunnah) and this is what the Salaf would call Sunnah and it would all be included within this definition.” </em>(Jam’e al-Ulum Wal Hikam of Ibn Rajab (pg.282)</span></p>
