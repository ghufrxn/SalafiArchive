<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was born into a religious family who were upon the correct Aqeedah from the very beginning and at the same time his surrounding was just a complete understanding of Quraan and Hadeeth.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then went to Shaikh Muhammad Ibraahim Meer Sialkotee and took a letter from him to attend madrassah Rehmania in Delhi but for some reason or another he never went. He read Wadheh al-Bayaan and Shahadatul-Quraan from Shaikh Ibrahim Meer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whatever subject the Shaikh studied he developed great expertise in it so much so that he even composed poetry. His father Shaikh Ehsaanullaah was strictly againt and hated Greek philosophy but the Shaikh convinced his father and also learnt it. The Shaikh aswell as learning the Islamic sciences also learnt secular sciences and so he completed his metric and thereafter he completed his F.A. and then B.A and went on further and completed an M.A. In Religious studies from Karachi or Sindh University aswell as further Arabic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh had great expertise and excelled in syntax and Arabic grammar and was an authority in tafseer and Hadeeth and this is the reason why many respected him.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was unique in his knowledge and actions and he had complete authority in Islamic sciences and principles such as tafseer, Hadeeth, fiqh, principles of fiqh, history and biographies, asma ur-rijaal, adab, philosophy and logic. He had a heartily affection with Hadeeth and his research and expertise in asma ur-rijaal was vast and he was an experienced in research and analysis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After receiving his education be began teaching in his village in Peer Jhandha and after a number of years he moved to another village Dargah Shareef which is situated about 2 to 3 kilometres from New Saeedabaad. He established a madrassah and began teaching. The Shaikh also has a very big library which has more than 10,000 books.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh spent a lot of his life teaching and lecturing in the village madrassah of Daar ur-Rashaad, any of the students who would come would leave with pearls of knowledge. The Shaikh has numerous students some of them are</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His younger brother and the great Al-Allaamah Imaam Badee ud deen Sindhee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ibraaheem A’waan</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Ghaanee bin Shaikh al-Allaamah Allaah Baksh Tanasyo</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hamdee Abdul Majeed as-Salafi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Yaqoob</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Professor Baksh Muhammadee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Yaqoob bin Moosaa Jantee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ayoob Mamduh bin Fathe al-Kuwaitee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Abdullaah </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And other that so many scholars benefitted from him.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Books</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">the Shaikh was constantly busy with teaching and delivering sermons and speeches throughout Pakistan and as he was also in charge of madrassah Daar ul-Rashaad where he would be continuously teaching and so had very little time. The Shaikh has written hundred of articles in the numerous magazines and journals in Pakistan and elsewhere, he would write in both Urdu and Sindhee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh has approximately 57 works spread over 3 languages ie Arabic, Urdu and Sindhee. This alone is a remarkable as most authors write in one language and rarely 2 but to write in 3 languages is indeed something. Writing alone is easy but writing on intricate and integral issues in different languages is a unique capability and we will see from the shaikhs works.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is further unique to Shaikh Muhibullaah is that a great majority of his books have an Arabic title irrespective of the language they have been written in as you will come to know.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh had travelled to Amritsar, Delhi, Agra, Saudia Arabia, Istanbul in Turkey and to some European countries with regards to knowledge. He spent 12 days just visiting the museums and bookshops in search of books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh would speak very little and when he did speak he was softly spoken, smiling and a pleasant natured scholar. His speech would always be weighed before he spoke and he would speak with his full knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh would prayer with great ease and simplicity and by this the followers would also tend to relax and pray with great ease. The Shaikh was indeed very simple and a very humble man so much so that if ever he needed a quote from a book he would get up and get the book himself instead of asking his students.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With regards to Tawheed and The Sunnah he was like an open razor sharp sword. Once a man came to the Shaikh and bowed down and gave Salaam, The Shaikh with great anger reprimanded the action and said any bowing is only for Allaah alone, when nowadays the people wait and anticipate that people bow and give them salaam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was strictly opposed and hated acts and statements of shirk. So an incident occurred in the year 1939 when the Shaikh along with his mother, nephew and some other people left for the annual pilgrimage of hajj via ship. The ship had not lifted the anchor when a man said “labbayk ya rasoolullaah” so the Shaikh said in a loud voice “is other than Allaah already being called upon what will happen to this ship” and as soon as the ship left the shores of Karachi it became engulfed in a storm and all you could hear were screams and the waves were rising and washing the ship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So now all of them were calling upon Allaah frantically and prostrating and reading the Quraan asking for leave of destruction. The captain said this ship has never had to face such a storm in over 40 years. The man who said labbayk ya rasoolullaah was on the ground prostrating and praying to Allaah. The captain had to turn the ship around away from Jeddah as he thought it was too dangerous and then the people became very sad at the thought of not being able to perform hajj. The ship remained in the storm for for 3 to days until things calmed and they finally made their way to Jeddah for hajj. This frightening ordeal lasted a total of 11 days and finally in the end they were able to fulfill their obligations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh really disliked pictures and any form of imagery so much so that all of the books in his library had all of the pictures defaced and every morning the photos in the newspaper would be defaced before they were give to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ehsaanullaah asked his brother for his daughters hand in marriage for Shaikh Muhibullah but his brother refused saying he (Shaikh Muhibullaah) does Raful Yadain ie raises his hands in the prayer so Shaikh Muhibullaah said I cannot abandon a Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu alayhee was-Sallam) just for the sake of a woman, let alone one woman i can sacrifice 1000 women over the Sunnah of my beloved Prophet (Sallalahu alayhee was-Sallam). Later on after Shaikh Ehsaanullahs demise his uncle agreed to his daughters marriage himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh would lead the Taraweeh prayer himself and recite one juzz every night in the month of Ramadhan. In any month he would on average recite 4 juzz per day and would finish reciting the whole Quraan in approximately one week, and he would start on the saturday and finish on the Friday, not only would he do this by memory but also by looking at the Quraan. Furthermore he would recite one juzz in the tahajjud prayer and would finish hence a whole Quraan via this way too.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would practise what had been narrated in the ahadeeth concerning the recitation of certain soorahs in the prayers for example what has been mentioned concerning reciting soorahs al-Baqarah, Ale Imraan and an-Nisaa the Shaikh would practise this as well as reciting 20 soorahs in 10 rakahs. This shows how the Shaikh was very observant of the Sunnah even when it came to actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh would have a lesson on tafseer ie explain the Quraan everyday after the fajr prayer and he would do so after researching the verses from at least 14 or 15 explanations of the Quraan and every ruling or issues related to the verse the Shaikh would mention and explain so much so that the explanation of a verse could continue for days. The Shaikh had great love for the Quraan and he would research and learn the meaning of the Quraan with great depth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh travelled extensively throughout Pakistan calling people to Islaam and delivering lectures at so many different places. He also travelled abroad and called non Muslims to Islaam. He travelled to England and visited cities such as London, Birmingham, Manchester and Oxford and told the people about the importance of sticking to the Quraan and Sunnah.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Shaikh On Asmaa ur-Rijaal</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair Alee Zaee said I did the checking of Imaam Baihaqis book “Ithbaat Adhaab al-Qabr” (Affirming the Punishment of The Grave) and this book was written in manuscript form by our Shaikh Imaam Bade ud deen so whilst doing the checking I was unable to find information concerning some narrators so I would refer to Shaikh Muhibullaah and he having unparallel memory would tell me the affair of some of these narrators from his memory from the books. Shaikh Muhibullaah also wrote the introduction to this book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hamdee Abdul Majeed as-Salafee one of the students of Imaam Badee ud deen is a checker and verifier of books and from one of the books he checked is Mu’ajam al-Kabeer of Imaam Tabarani and this is indeed a great service. He would often refer and benefit from Shaikh Muibullaah with regards to his checking in one place in the notes to a narrator he says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“For he is unknown according to the principles as my Shaikh Muhibullaah Shaah has said&#8221; (al-Muajam al-Kabeer 1/209)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hamdee would also send Shaikh Muhibullaah any new books printed in Iraaq.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Once in answer to an issue of science of hadeeth he authored a 74 page treatise titled, “Calming the heart of one troubled by the tadlees of Thawree and al-A’amash”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair Alee Zaee has for a number of years has been compiling a book on scholars of current times and other people as he also had a great interest in Asmaa ur-Rijaal. So he asked Shaikh Muhibullaah pertaining  to some great scholars of our times and he was indeed a great expert and fair in these affairs when he spoke so I asked him about</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ash-Shaikh Abdul Azeez bin Abdullah bin Baaz (Rahimahullah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said,<em> “Scholar, researcher of the truth, trustworthy and honest.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ash-Shaikh Muhammad Naasir ud deen al-Albaanee (Rahimahullah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said, <em>“Researcher of the truth undoubtedly, established and trustworthy”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ash-Shaikh Ataaullaah Haneef Bhojiyaanee (Rahimahullah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said, <em>“My teacher, the trustworthy from amongst my trustworthy teachers, and there are very few similar to him in this era.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ash-Shaikh Badee ud deen Sindhee (Rahimahullah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said, <em>“Trustworthy”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zaahid al-Kawtharee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">he said, <em>“staunch/bigoted from amongst the hanafis.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(taken from Shaikh Zubair book titled, Anwaar us-Sabeel Fee Meezaan al-Jarh Wat-Ta’deel (Manuscript)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Some of the Scholars who Praised him</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great Shaikh Imaam Abu Fadhal Faidh ur-Rahmaan ath-Thawree (d.1417H) a great researcher and a great scholar of hadeeth who wrote an answer and refutation to Ibn Turkamaanee Hanafis book al-Jawhar an-Naqee said about Shaikh Muhibullaah Shaah “The Great Scholar”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh al-Allaamah the Muhaddith Irshaad ul-Haqq al-Atharee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Shaikh Muhibullaah Shaah Raashidee is the person that if you do not mention him the history of Sindh is incomplete. His knowledge, his virtues, his fear of Allaah and actions were like mountains and his life was just like an example of a salaf. There was no one like him when it came to being upfront and honest and serving guests. His clear statements and his following the Sunnah was a clear sign of a clear way. His daily living was just books and he is really worthy of the following statement, ‘we will die in books and the pages will be our shroud’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zubair Alee Zaee said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“if I was made to stand between the station of Ibrahim and Rukn al-Yamaani ( ie facing kabah) and made to swear I would say I have not seen anyone more pious, worshipper or virtuous than Shaikh Muhibullaah Shaah”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh leaves behind 3 sons, Muhammad Yaseen, Muhammad Raashid and Muhammad Qaasim all of whom have received religious education and are now also teaching in the madrassah, the first two sons also help with cultivating the land that they own.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During various times various governments offered him positions within the governments but he kindly refused them and said the biggest service was to spread the Quraan and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The great Shaikh and Muhaddith passed away on the 9th of shabaan in 1415H corresponding to 21st January 1995ce in Hydrabaad, his younger brother and the great Muhaddith and Imaam of Ahlus Sunnah The Shaikh al-Arab wal-Ajam Abu Muhammad Badee ud deen led his funeral prayer and was buried in his family village</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated and Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question:</strong> Can you please explain the essence and existence of Allah intellectually?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer: </strong>There have always been a handful people in every era who have denied the existence of Allah. Most people in previous nations never rejected or denied the existence of Allah but yet continued to commit shirk with Allah. The Quran in Surah Yusuf states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And most of them believe not in Allah except while they associate others with Him”</strong> <strong>(Surah Yusuf : 106)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Denying the existence of Allah is from the epitome of ignorance, such people are from those who have bankrupt their intellects because anyone else can not deny the existence of Allah, the creator of the universe. This is why the misguided nations which Allah has mentioned in the Quran were all mushriks (polytheists) and none of them were atheists or denied the existence of Allah. All the Prophets who were sent to their respective nations propagated Tawhid and reprimanded Shirk. Surah Ibrahim mentions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>Their Messengers said, &#8220;Can there be doubt about Allah, Creator of the heavens and earth?”</strong> <strong>(Surah Ibrahim : 10)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messengers and Prophets said to their respective nations can anyone doubt that Allah is the creator and owner of the Heavens and Earths? This question is to the individual possessing sound intellect that when he sees the smallest of things he naturally assumes and concludes that an expert made it. This is because it is impossible for any sound intelligent person to believe that even the smallest of things came into existence without a creator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then how can such huge entity like this world come into existence just like that without a creator, the Heavens, the Earth, the Sky, the Sun, the Moon, the Star, the Mountains, the Sea, the Rivers, the Ocean, the Trees and gardens. Did everything come into existence without a creator? Did all of this just happen by itself. Only an insolent and an intellectually retarded individual can utter such foolish and futile statements because an intelligent person would not even think to say such a profanity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Books of history mention an incident that occurred during the Khilafah of the Abbasids. An atheist came to the to the Khaliphs palaces and said he did not believe in the existence of Allah and asked for intellectual evidences. The Kaliph summoned Imam Abu Hanifah who came extremely late. When the Imam was questioned why he came late. He replied, “When I reached the river shore I saw random planks of wood spread out. Then all of a sudden I saw the planks joining each other to form a boat, I then got onto the boat and eventually arrived and thus this is the reason for my late arrival. Upon hearing this the atheist said, “You called such a scholar to talk to me who is talking utter nonsense and saying something which lacks any intelligence.” Upon this the Imam said “Oh ignorant foolish one, you deny that a mere small boat can form just like that, yet you accept this vast Earth came into existence just like that without a creator!!! How do you have the audacity to have such a belief, it is except that you are ignorant.” Upon hearing the intellectual answer the atheist was silenced.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point was to educate the individual of the existence of Allah which everything in the world testifies to. No one other than the intellectually blind can deny the existence of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">32 of the worlds leading scientists or even more than this concluded that Allah exists based on their on scientific backgrounds and research. They presented evidences for this established belief and collated and compiled them into a book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This reality is so clear and manifest that almost all of the intelligent and intellectual people of this world agree that Allah exists but despite this the intellectually blind are communists, socialists and immoral atheists. These people are enemies onto themselves and their minds leading them to deny the existence of Allah. They openly misguide the people, taking them away from the straight path in a vulgar manner and foolishly claim Allah does not exist and constantly repeat, prove Allah exists.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says in the Quran</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And they rejected them, while their [inner] selves were convinced thereof, out of injustice and haughtiness.” (</strong><strong>Surah an-Naml : 14)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ie the people of Musa accepted the truthfulness of Musa (Alayhis Salam) but based on their oppression and arrogance they outwardly rejected his call. Likewise, these oppressive people onto themselves in reality believe in the existence of Allah and their conscious is always fighting them yet they reject this upon their tongues just for the sake of their whims and desires.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we intend to present three evidences for the people in search of the truth who lend an ear and use their intellectually sound minds. We pray that Allah guides these people to the truth. Amin</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will extract benefit from the following ayah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And We have sent down rain from the sky in a measured amount and settled it in the earth. And indeed, We are Able to take it away.”</strong> <strong>(Surah al-Mu’minun : 18)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ayah means Allah placed so much water on the Earth at one time making sufficient for the people until the day of judgement. Then the water separated into oceans and rivers forming sub-soil-water. It is the same water that changes states in the summer and winter. It condenses in the summer and spreads via rain, it spreads via fountains, wells and springs. It forms ice on top of the mountains in winter, which eventually melt and flow into the millions of rivers and streams. The water helps form numerous other entities for example vegetation via irrigation. So from the beginning of time not even one drop of water has decreased or increased in the water Allah gave us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Every person and students knows which we are taught in schools that water is formed by the merging of two gasses namely hydrogen and oxygen and this is an accepted fact by the scientists. We also know the vast oceans also came into existence in this way- by huge quantities of hydrogen and oxygen mixing and enormous quantities of water forming.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now the question is, if the atheists and communists claims there is no creator and Allah does not exist, then let them tell us based on the scientific research that is established with them, when there are still huge amounts of gases-oxygen and hydrogen why do they not mix like they did before and create enormous quantities of water which led to the creation of the seas, rivers and oceans. It is evident, if these gases did mix we would have constant water falling from the skies. We as intelligent individuals know the consequences and outcome, especially all life forms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We see that these huge quantities of gases exist but yet they do not mix as they mixed before to produce the enormous quantities of water. So we ask which entity is preventing the mixing of these gases? Which entity allowed the mixing of these gases previously and yet now they are not allowed to mix except with his permission?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Without a doubt these heretic atheists have no answer except elusive retorts. We also say prove the existence of these gases, they cannot be seen, touched or smelt, yet these atheists believe in its existence! How did they come to know that if they were to mix these gases in huge quantities, the resultant water would destroy the earth and all life form.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, we must accept there is a supreme entity who allowed the mixing of huge quantities of these gases to allow the colossal formation of water for us to be able to live on this Earth. Yet the same supreme entity is preventing the mixing of the very same gases now, this supreme being is Allah The Most High.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No one even tries to deny this except the stubborn heretics and enemies to their own intellects, the atheists. They do not have any responsible answer other than conjecture</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>And who is more unjust than one who invents about Allah a lie or denies His verses? Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.” (Surah al-An’am :  21)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Trans Note:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the Shaikh’s methodology in dealing with such issues, in relating it back to the Speech of the Allah first and foremost and then using science instead of using science on its own to prove the existence of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Taken from <em>Bazal al-Aqdi al-Was’a Fi Ajwibah as-Suwalat at-Tis’a</em> (pg.374)</span></p>
