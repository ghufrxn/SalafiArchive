				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>[This is an excerpt from the forthcoming Sharh of Bukhari by Shaikh Muhammad Ghondalwi (1405H), short passages are being presented for the avid reader]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some foolish people think the prophetic hadith was written in the third islamic century and that written hadith did not exist before the advent of Imam Bukhari, ie before he compiled his book. They say the people heard these narrations from different places; centuries later after the Messenger of Allah  ﷺ and therefore hadith has no legal authority in islamic law and neither is it to be relied upon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In reality these people are from the underlings of the rejectors of hadith who lack the mental capacity to comprehend the sciences of hadith and thats why they utter such ridiculous statements and views. The truth and fact of the matter is that numerous books were written and composed before the time of Imam Bukhari and his <em>Sahih</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For instance the teacher of Imam Bukhari, Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal had collated and compiled his large work on hadith famously known as the <em>Musnad</em>. Imam al-Shafi&#8217;i who was the teacher of Imam Ahmad, wrote a book before his time and was considered an early work, famously known as <em>Kitab al-Umm</em> which contained many hadith. Some of the scholars took all of the hadith from <em>Kitab al-Umm</em> and compiled a separate work and called it <em>Musnad al-Shafi&#8217;i</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise and similarly, Imam Malik was the teacher of Imam al-Shafi&#8217;i who also compiled a book on hadith at a very early stage such that it became so famous even until today, which people know as <em>Muwatta Imam Malik</em>. We also had books composed by authors of that era which include the likes of the <em>Musannaf</em> of Imam Abd al-Razzaq and before that the <em>Compendium</em> of Mu&#8217;ammar. We also had the Compendium known as the <em>Sahifah</em> of Hummam ibn Munabbeh, who was the student of Abu Hurairah RadiAllahu Anhu.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The transmission of all of these ahadith traces back to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Therefore, those who say the ahadith were compiled in the third century by here-say and that they had no origin prior to this, is a clear evidence of the ignorance of the rejectors of hadith who are oblivious to the science of hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would also write the ahadith. The companion Abdullah ibn Amr bin al-Aas RadiAllahu Anhu, wrote a compendium called <em>Sahifah Sadiqah</em> and he wrote this compendium by directly listening to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly the companion, Abdullah ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhuma would also write many hadith from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. So much so that when he died his son, Ali bin Abdullah had to organise camel loads of his books and compendiums to them, which shows he had many books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise and similarly there were many companions who would write the ayat and also write the hadith of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Writing in those days was not a common thing (TN &#8211; This was because their norm was to memorise with precision) neither was writing formulated as it is in our times. They also did not utilise I&#8217;rab (i.e. Taskhil) or dots (on letters to distinguish) like we do in our times. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Minhah al-bari sharh sahih al-bukhari 1:.56 (manuscript form), edited and compiled by Shaikh Muhammad Ramzan al-Salafi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Sharh is being Published by Maktabah Quddusia, Lahore, Pakistan)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Soofees and Bareilwees often scream and shout in order to establish the permissibility of the Milaad or the Mawlid of the Prophet (Sallaalahu Alayhee Wasallam)<span id="more-1311"></span>. So sometimes there is a lengthy lecture pertaining to the the categorisation of bidah, or the presentation of the old arguments relevant to bidah hassanah, all in order to some how prove the mawlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Often in such arguments you find weak and mostly non relevant texts or far fetched arguments and over the years the people of innovation have resorted to lists and books. So a common article in favour of the Mawlid would be oh such and such wrote a book and such a scholar wrote a book and so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In reality Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah are well versed with the evidences which constitutes obligation in the Sharee’ah of Islaam, ie the Quraan, the authentic Prophetic Ahadeeth and Ijmaa. Yet the people of innovation just to prove their point will resort to anything and this is one of the things they often produce in their articles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In his regard the people of innovation and misguidance often quote that Shaikh Suyootee authored a book on Mawlid titled, ‘<strong>Hassan al-Maqsid Fee Amal al-Mawlid’ </strong> and you will find such people constantly going on about it as if its a Milaad bible. The well known and famous Pakistani Hadeeth Master Muhaddith Muhammad Ghondalwee authored a succinct refutation of Shaikh Suyootees book titled, <strong><em>‘Radd Hassan al-Mawlid’</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At present this book is misplaced with one of the Shaikhs Student, Shaikh Abu Dharr Zakariyyah who was given the task to re-write the book in his neat handwriting for publishing. Coincidently Shaikh Abu Dharr was himself injured in this horrific innovation a few years back and as this evil innovation continues to get worse day by day the need for such book vehemently increases.</span></p>
