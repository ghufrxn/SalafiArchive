<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>by</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>ʿAudhu Billāhi min ash-Shayṭān al-Rajīm, Bismillāh al-Raḥmān al-Raḥīm. </em><em>Alḥamdullilāhi Rabbil ʿAlamīn, waṣalatu wassalām ʿala rasūlillahil karīm, wa ʿala alihī wa aṣḥābī wa man tabiʿahum bi-iḥsān ilāʾ yawm al-dīn</em>; wa baʿḍ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>-:The Allegation:-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our Shaykh Wasiullah Abbas has levied an incorrect allegation concerning me, I won&#8217;t go into the finer details right now due to legal reasons, and there are many to mention.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The allegation is that Shaykh Wasiullah allegedly caught me plagiarising, because I did not mention the name of one of researchers on JUST ONE of the books I consulted while translating, verifying and annotating an Urdu rendition of Usul al-Sunnah of Imam al-Humaydi. Shaykh Wasiullah informed me that I should give due credit and mention the person, whose work I consulted i.e. the name of the researcher and according to the Shaykhs information we did not do this and hence the criticism.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>-:Evidencing the Truth and Answering the False Allegation:-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The truth and actual fact is that we wrote exactly what the Shaykh told us, almost VERBATIM, WORD FOR WORD as per the Shaykhs instructions, yet I still get criticised! I can&#8217;t share the finer details right now, but when they are released, InshaAllah the readers will be absolutely shocked, in how people can be so oppressive against someone?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Please see the following scans and see the open and clear evidence before your eyes.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Front Cover of the Book, with the names of Shaykh Wasiullah Abbas and Shaykh Abdullah Nasir Rehmani and also of the TWO translators and researchers.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Book was Introduced by Shaykh Wasiullah Abbas himself and Shaykh Abdullah Nasir Rehmani.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Urdu readers can read the introduction of the two Mashaykh themselves.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It will be clear from the two introductions of both scholars that they have praised the effort and work, hoping that others benefit from it.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Read the editors introduction, clearly mentioning the name of the researcher of the book we used and referenced for the work.</span></li>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is from the introduction and what Shayh Wasiullah Abbas instructed us,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When no research is done but instead people are relied upon, who are seasoned fitna makers, they say I plagiarised, passing it off as my own work then the result is what Shaykh Wasiullah concluded. The proof shown is clear in showing that there was no plagiarism because the researchers name was clearly mentioned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykhs words have questioned and put into disrepute my integrity, even though I have spent over 20 years writing about the creed and manhaj of the Ahl al-Hadith whilst also being a thorn in the eyes of the innovators, and I thank Allah alone for this. It is because of my entire reputation being attacked that I have used my right to seek judgement from the courts, because this in my view is false information and outright slander. As Muslims we all have rights and I have asked for mine and I am vigorously pursuing that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What the readers were not informed of, is that I sent a subsequent message to the Shaykh to converse and resolve the matter, without the need for court action, but I have not received any response to this, but rather this refutation was released against me. Where is the justice?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Not only this, I called the Shaykh directly a year later in 2018 after I heard some rumours about me. The intention of calling the Shaykh was for him to mention his advice and some of the concerns he had raised. We just talked about health issues and I mentioned some natural remedies for his health. The Shaykh did not even indicate a single word of his concerns, even when I kept on asking. (This is all evidenced) and I then conveyed this to other brothers that the Shaykh did not say anything about our work and therefore, there must be some misunderstanding, as I had spoken to the Shaykh before.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>-:General Background of the Situation of Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon:-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, by this time starting from 2015 until my last conversation with him in 2018, I had at least 3-4 conversations with the Shaykh, with one very lengthy conversation (beginning of 2017) about the serious and grave accusations against Zulfiker and I informed the Shaykh that Zulfiker, who I tried to help, clearly admitted to all of these grave and serious accusations. I asked the Shaykh to sit with him and to advise him with a detailed self rectification programme and I left it that. Then from early 2017 until August 2017, is when Shaykh Wasiullahs critical statement about me was released.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>-:Zulfiker&#8217;s Attacks Everyone:-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zulfiker continued his secret attacks on everyone who disagreed with him and even criticised brothers families publically. The statement of Shaykh Wasiullah Abbas was only released to a group of people in September 2019, perhaps even before that, I am not sure about this. These people were informed that this is an amanah with them and the purpose was to inform the people about my reality. However, during all this time, not the Shaykh or anyone else had the Islamic decency or manners which they talk about, to even inform me ONCE, until an upright person informed us. Now I ask any decent person reading this, what level of honesty, decency and islamic rectification is this? that they have been slandering and oppressing me for over 2 years and before this, Zulfiker has been doing this for many years prior to 2014.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>-:Outright Oppression:-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They further wanted this to continue secretly and for the recording and other information not to reach me. It is under these underhanded and indecent tactics that I sent the Shaykh a message, saying to him that Shaykh you did not even inform me once of your concerns even if you believed them to be true, knowing that I had spoken to him several times during this period. If the Shaykh had done so, it would not have got to this stage, as all I would have said to him, we did write the name of the researcher in the book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>-:Attempts to Advise Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon:-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I also informed the Shaykh (in early 2017) that at least six different brothers have had over 5 hours of sittings with him, which were all documented. We also consulted numerous scholars about the issue of Zulfiker and they all said he needs to stop. I also said to Zulfiker If he had informed Shaykh Wasiullah about these issues and he said no. I said how could you not have done this, it&#8217;s imperative and he needs to know to give you advice. He said he would speak to him and other Mashaykh. I learnt later that he never mentioned a single word to him or other scholars, but rather he and those around him slandered me with outrageous lies to the Shaykh so that they could cover up the realities of Zulfiker Memon from the Shaykh. I also said to the Shaykh, that he was a big scholar of Hadith and rijal and thus an expert in this field and he should look at the evidence himself independently, which I believe to this day the Shaykh has not done so and this is my excuse for the Noble Shaykh, Hafizahullah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>-:The Web of Lies Spun by Zulfiker and his Associates:-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zulfiker and his associates lied to the Shaykh and did not inform him of the reality of Zulfiker&#8217;s explicit conversations and manipulation of over at least half a dozen women over a lengthy period. They covered this up and made out to the Shaykh that everything against Zulfiker was just &#8220;hacked information&#8221; from Zulfiker&#8217;s email. They covered up the truth and have even stopped people from knowing this man&#8217;s reality by saying they should not read the 225 page document about Zulfikers filthy womanising and INVITATION TO ZINA AND OPEN SIN, because it was all based on &#8220;hacked information and Shaykh Wasiullah said don&#8217;t rely on this information.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>-:The Despicable Behaviour of Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon: Desecrating the Commands of the Shari&#8217;ah:-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example, one of the mostevil manipulations and deceptions I have ever seen in my life, is what Zulfiker did with our Muslim sister, our heart bleeds for the pain of a father and his daughter. If Allah wills, I will explain this is detail. However, for now, that sister was so disturbed at the sheer deception, manipulation and distortions of Zulfiker that she told him she would inform his organisation, Markaz as-Sunnah Leicester of his highly inappropriate and illicit behaviour, and so she emailed the entire conversation to the website admin, which was managed by one of his students at the time. There were lies after lies, deception after deception, as if everyone else was not Salafi and they all had a planned agenda against him. Zulfiker continued to spin a web of lies, even to me, who was trying to help him at the time to realise the errors of his ways. Zulfiker himself acknowledged how we tried to help him, we also have evidence of this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He stooped to such levels that I don&#8217;t even know if Ahl al-Bid&#8217;ah would ever stoop so low, except in the case of the Mawlid Imam from Bradford. When the web admin, his student at the time advised him. Zulfiker was the Wali of the website admins wife. So, in order to manipulate and oppress the brother, Zulfiker manipulated and groomed his wife to secretly record her husband (the website admin) and Zulfiker since then has been blackmailing him! Zulfiker also later attacked him and struck his face drawing blood, when they both had a meeting. His students, upon the instructions of Zulfiker sent me this recording, when I spent almost a year investigating all the claims and then the subsequent meetings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>-:Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon&#8217;s Grooming Tactics:-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zulfiker had been and still does, use his position of being the student of Shaykh Wasiullah and other Mashaykh, his connections with them, his gatherings and conversations with them, his years of study in Madinah University, his qualifications &#8211; for example, saying there is no student in the west with his level of qualifications, saying he is the guard of the Prophets Grave, his ijazat, his meetings with Ulama and so on and so forth, to manipulate men and badly exploit sisters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was all of these realities and truths that led me to send the message to our Shaykh. We respect the Shaykh and my message was personal to him, I did not send that message to a single person except the Shaykh, it was the Shaykh himself who spread it to people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>-:Revisiting the Plagiarism Allegation:-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is how they presented the issue to the Shaykh and to the people and they hid behind the Shaykh. These liars are once again hiding behind the Shaykh and trying to refute me. Let me today announce, I have a lot of evidence of him admitting he was involved in all this evil yet he shamelessly continues with his evil. Let him deny his recordings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people who are around Shaykh Wasiullah, like Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon and others, are to blame, who either lied or deliberately misinformed the Shaykh and the Shaykh should hold them responsible for this catastrophic slander on me and ultimately sloppy research and investigation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the same Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon, who used to be an ardent Deobandi, who me and my brother, Abu Hibban gave Da&#8217;wah to. The same Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon who asked me to check and read his Master&#8217;s Thesis?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>-:There Were Two People who Worked on the Book, Why only Target me? Was it only due to my Warning of Zulfiker:-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Me and another well known researcher and Shaykh of Pakistan, Shaykh Muhammad Ibrahim b. Bashir al-Hussainwy, both equally worked on the said book. So why was I just singled out and targeted? (See the scan of the book cover and inside pages)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>-: Why Write the Introduction if I Plagiarised? :-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the Shaykh, Hafizahullah, believed everything he said about me in his statement and he held this to be the truth, then when I asked him to write the introduction to my book, I have the complete right to ask this, why did the Shaykh write the introduction to the book? His comments were to only change the urdu sentence structure. Furthermore, not a single mistake was mentioned of Aqidah, Manhaj, plagiarism or that im not qualified to translate, research and annotate such books! Rather, he praised my efforts. I have the hand written introduction by the Shaykh, which can be seen below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Note:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Wasiullah&#8217;s critical statement is based 2014, when we last met in the Summer of 2014. Whereas his introduction to my book was written around September 2015 and the book was published in January 2016. The book has been published for almost 3 and ½ years, and yet they were still not able to verify the facts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdullah Nasir Rehmani Hafizahullah, also looked over the book and he did not point out a single mistake.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many of the Mashaykh have trusted me with their books in different capacities, translations, annotations and publishing. Some of them have also introduced my books while others have asked me to research for them. Some Mashaykh have trusted and expressed their agreement of my notes on their translations etc. There are too many to mention but for example:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fazal Elahi Zahir</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Luqman al-Salafi</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Muhammad Ziya ur Rehman (Abdullah) A&#8217;zami</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Salah ud Din Yusuf</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The books of Shaykh Ehsan Ilahi Zahir in English (by his sons)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdullah Nasir Rehmani.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The books of Shaykh Badi ud Din Shah al-Rashidi Sindhi (by his family)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The books of Shaykh Muhibullah Shah Rashidi al-Sindhi (by his family)</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The families of the latter two Mashaykh trusted me enough to give me most of their manuscripts.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="9">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Sultan Mahmud Jalalpuri (by his son Shaykh Yahya Jalalpuri)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Ghaffar Hasan Rehmani (by his family in Pakistan)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Faysal al-Jasim</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are many others but I suffice with this. May Allah forgive me for my many shortcomings and mistakes, Amin. There is so much more to say. I have everything evidenced by way of text messages, WhatsApp conversations, audio recordings and witnesses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now, I forgive all those who have slandered me and failed to look at the evidence, I will continue my Da&#8217;wah, whether people like it or not. Zulfiker has manipulated these young inexperienced brothers like Wali al-Din Durrani, Uzayr Nazir, Abu Talhah Zahack, who are all ignorant and blind, more about these individuals later, inshaAllah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, Zulfiker always threatens people who do not agree with him, he forces them to take his views, he bullies them and threatens them that he will get them refuted by Shaykh Wasiullah, this is well known about him. We do not make taqlid of anyone except that we follow the Quran and Sunnah, no matter who the Shaykh is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the other allegations of plagiarism and ludicrous accusations etc, I&#8217;ll address them in due course, InshaAllah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I had stopped so many brothers and people from talking about these issues and to focus on beneficial knowledge but now, since you opened the door, I can&#8217;t control them anymore.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah sees and hears all things and indeed, He is The Most Just and Fair.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">BarakAllāhu Fikum</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">**************************************************</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>-:The True Reality of Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon and his attack on Shaykh Wasiullah&#8217;s Wife:-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zulfiker is shameless, brothers accused me of all sorts regarding Shaykh Wasiullah and I was only asking for my legitimate right with the best manners. Zulfiker is a selfish individual and he does not care about anyone, he won&#8217;t stop anywhere and he has no levels or bounds, this is why you&#8217;ll see his close friends not defending him, rather he hides behind Shaykh Wasiullah and his expendable young so called students. They will one day realise soon inshaAllah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon Belittles Shaykh Waseeullah&#8217;s wife</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Where is the honour of Sheikh Waseeullah?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Questioner: Have you spoken ill about Sheikh Waseeullah’s wife?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon: No, not ill of Sheikh Waseeullah’s wife.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Questioner: I’m talking about what you told me and brother A (about Sheikh Waseeullah&#8217;s wife)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon: About the shoes and that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Questioner: Yes, about the shoes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon: That wasn&#8217;t about Sheikh Waseeullah&#8217;s wife!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Questioner: Yes, of course it was. You were saying about his wife that she (Sheikh Waseeullah’s wife) took money off of your mum.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon: She didn&#8217;t take money off my mum!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Questioner: Your mum gave her money, yeah and (according to you, she) never paid it back.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon: remains silent for a while, knowing he has been caught lying).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Questioner: Are you aware this behaviour is not befitting and is wrong?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon: YES!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Questioner: You know it&#8217;s wrong to speak ill about somebody?!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon: Remains silent in agreement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Questioner: Khalas, now it&#8217;s the personal things we are going discuss.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon confirms that he did say this about Sheikh Waseeullah&#8217;s wife).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Additional Note:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Background</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sheikh Waseeullah&#8217;s wife took money from Zulfikers mum to buy shoes and she said she would pay her back, but she didn&#8217;t, Zulfiker attacks her honour because of this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon attempted to lie but he got caught.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Two weeks prior to this meeting, in a separate sitting with five witnesses he admitted to saying something extremely derogatory and disrespectful about Sheikh Waseeullah&#8217;s wife and ultimately about the honour of Sheikh Waseeullah himself.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Marriage is just one of the infinite blessings Allah has bestowed upon the Muslims. Its has numerous rewards and effects on the Individual, his family and society in general. In this regard the noble and virtuous brother Badī uz-Zaman al-Madanī delivered a comprehensive and precise lecture on the aforementioned subject and offered great insight and practical advice to society in general in how to approach marriage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The brother, May Allāh reward him abundantly and make his scales heavy on Yaum al-Qiyāmah (Amīn), Arshan ʿUmer Anṣārī, painstakingly transcribed the whole lecture to benefit the Muslims. May Allāh Accept this from him and reward him with good and Success. Amīn.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Birmingham, England.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>S</strong><strong>alafi</strong> <strong>R</strong><strong>esearch</strong> <strong>I</strong><strong>nstitute</strong> <strong>2016</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise to Allah, we seek his aid and his assistance, and ask his forgiveness and we seek refuge in Allah from the evil of our souls and from the evil of our actions. Whomever Allah guides, no one will be able to able to mislead him. Whomever he leads astray, none can guide him.  I bear witness that there is no one worthy of worship but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. As to what proceeds: Indeed the best speech is the speech of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (ﷺ). And the worst of matters are those innovated by the people, and every innovated matter is a bid’ah and every bid’ah is astray, and every going astray is in the fire.            </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Noble brother Badi-uz Zaman Madani</strong> is a student from Madina University. He graduated from college of tafseer, and has memorized several narrations of tafseer. One of his prominent teachers was Sheikh Hikmat bin Basheer Al Iraqi, the author of the one of the recent most tafseer named: “At Tafseer As-Saheeh” (published in four volumes).  Sheikh Hikmat lead the tafseer department in Madina University for some time, and his other books are as well focused on subjects related to tafseer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sheikh Badi-uz Zaman currently resides in Saudi Arabia, and is a member of Islamic center in the capital city, Riyadh. He gave a lecture several years back in India on the topic: Nikah: Asaan ya Mushkil? (Marriage: Easy or Difficult?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is Allah, the Most Noble and the Most Wise who:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Prohibited adultery, and sanctioned punishments for it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And it is he who:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Encouraged marriage, and in some cases obligated it, and rewards us for it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What’s the difference between the two? Is there any reason behind it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not have any doubt that much of the Muslim youth today are into matters related to this subject which lay outside the boundaries set by Allah. I, as a nineteen year old university student found it effective and beneficial. If it can benefit me, then without a doubt it can benefit others as well, with the help of Allah. And therefore, transcribed this lecture for the benefit of others. I acknowledge that this is very brief, but I hope that Allah accepts it from me, forgives me due to this, and guides other through this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Arshan Umer Ansari</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[25<sup>th</sup> September 2015]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Marriage and its Necessity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought. (30:21)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> The maqsad (aim) of nikaah is peace and tranquility, and eradication of all evils. The tranquility we achieve by marrying in the Islamic manner cannot be achieved by any other way. Through this Allah put mawaddah (affection) and rahmah (mercy).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Love in Islam is after marriage. But those submerged into materialism like the Europeans think that love should be before marriage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah (subhanahu wata ala) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>هن لباس لكم</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;They are clothing for you and you are clothing for them.&#8221; (2:187)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah compared this relationship to clothes. Clothes are a shelter for humans, and clothes hide the private parts. Clothes are also for beautification of the body. They also hide the bad things of the body. So, from this we learn that when a husband and wife get close to each other, their actual life begins. The way in which clothes hide our bad and frame our body, the husband-wife relationship is also established so that they conceal each other&#8217;s bad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah said, <strong>&#8220;O children of Adam, We have bestowed upon you clothing to conceal your private parts and as adornment.&#8221; (7:26)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The way our clothes hides our secrets, the husband-wife relationship as well hides each other’s secrets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What is the importance of marriage?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah spoke several times on this matter in the Qur&#8217;an and specifically in Suratun Nisa (chapter 4). Allah brought this bond into existence even before bringing human life into existence on this earth.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;It is He who created you from one soul and created from it its mate that he might dwell in security with her..&#8221; (7:189)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah brought human beings into existence through Adam (alayhissalam). Then Allah created their pairs ie., he created his wife from Adam (alayhissalam)&#8217;s ribs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The most wicked among the people in the eye of Allah on the Day of judgment is the men who goes to his wife and she comes to him, and then he divulges her secret.&#8221; (Muslim)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Because he did not ‘behave’ like a clothe! And he (ﷺ) said,</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>إِنَّمَا النِّسَاءُ شَقَائِقُ الرِّجَالِ&#8221;‏</strong><strong>&#8220;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Women are counterpart of men.&#8221;</em> (Abu Dawood)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For this reason marriage is an obligation upon everyone. Because peace, tranquility cannot be established except with marriage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And he (ﷺ) said, <em>&#8220;O young men, those among you who can support a wife should marry, for it restrains eyes (from casting evil glances) and preserves one from immorality; but he who cannot afford It should observe fast for it is a means of controlling the sexual desire.&#8221; (Agreed upon)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Those youth who can support a wife ie., he desires marriage, and can afford a wife, her clothing and a room and is prepared internally for marriage, must get married. It is obligatory for such youth to get married, belating is not permissible. Zuhr Salah cannot be performed at the time of Asr, and Asr cannot be performed with Maghrib. The Lord who established Salah on fixed times also obligated marriage on those with capability.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If one doesn&#8217;t marries at the right time, then this is zulm on the shariah. One must marry, because youth is an age and time when it is difficult to control oneself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The biggest trial for youth is women. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, <em>&#8220;I am not leaving behind me a more harmful trial for men than women.&#8221; (Bukhari)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> The Prophet (ﷺ) said, <em>&#8220;The life of the world is sweet and green. Allah makes you generations succeeding one another so that He may try you in respect of your actions. So beware of the beguilements of the world and those of women. The first trial of Banu Israel was through women&#8221;. (Muslim)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bani Israel, the followers of Musa alayhissalam, those who sacrificed their wealth and lives for the sake of Allah, but when the fitnah of women was presented to them, they failed the test. And Allamah ibn Qayyim mentioned in &#8220;Turk al  Hukmiyyah&#8221; that when they got into fahisha, more than seventy thousand of them died in a day due to diseases.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah does not forgives societies which indulge into fahisha, zina, and mixed gatherings. Look at the history of Iran, Egypt and Rome, their society, culture and everything got destroyed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He (ﷺ) said, <em>&#8220;Immorality never appears among a people to such an extent that they commit it openly, but plagues and diseases that were never known among the predecessors will spread among them.&#8221;</em> <em>(Ibn Majah)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> The benefit of marriage that Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) said is that it restrains ones eyes. <strong>Because evil and zina begins from our gaze.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) said that gaze is one of the poisonous arrows from among the arrows of Iblees.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>النظرة سهم مسموم من سهام إبليس</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If an arrow hits our body, it will have a massive effect on the whole body. And if poison is added to it, the whole body will be poisoned. Controlling gaze is so important, that one will loose his deen and eman, if one doesn&#8217;t controls it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">But the benefit of marriage is that it restrains the gaze.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;And it prevents one from immorality.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>وَأَحْصَنُ لِلْفَرْجِ</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hisn means a fort. A person remains safe in a fort, and the enemy cannot attack him. Similarly, a person becomes safe from the attacks of Shaitaan if a person gets married.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And marriage is the sunnah of all the ambiyaa (prophets). Allah says</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;And We have already sent messengers before you and assigned to them wives and descendants.&#8221; (13:38)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is the sunnah of our role models, and therefore we must get married. For this reason, scholars are united that marriage is better than just performing voluntary prayers at night, and fasting in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: &#8220;In this world, women and perfume have been made dear to me, and my comfort has been provided in prayer.&#8221; <em>(Nas&#8217;ai)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And he (ﷺ) said: <em>“Marriage is part of my sunnah, and whoever does not follow my sunnah has nothing to do with me.&#8221;</em> <em>(Ibn Majah)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning that whoever considers this sunnah to be wrong is not of this ummah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> And the one gives life to this sunnah, his deen and Iman will be protected. Allah will protect the one who gets married.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are three who are promised the help of Allah and one of them is the one who gets married seeking to keep himself chaste.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The one who is under Allah&#8217;s protection cannot ever be harmed anyone!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> And for this reason, marrying is completing half the deen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our beloved messenger (ﷺ) said, <em>&#8220;When a slave (of Allâh) marries, he perfects half of his religion. So let him fear Allâh in the remaining half.&#8221; (Mustadrak Al Hakim and the wording is of Baihaqi) And in another narration, he said, &#8220;it is half of Iman (faith).&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Subhanallah, such a virtuous deed marriage is, fulfil your need and desire as well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Just like he (ﷺ) said, <em>&#8220;Cleanliness is half of faith.&#8221;</em> The one who doesn&#8217;t gets married cannot remain clean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Virtues of a righteous spouse</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And he (ﷺ) mentioned the virtue of marriage saying,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>&#8220;Four things are part of happiness: a righteous wife, spacious abode, a good neighbour and a comfortable mount.&#8221; (Ibn Hibban and Musnad Ahmad)<br />
</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> The first from among the four is a righteous wife. The one who Allah bestows a righteous wife, is as if he has received all the good of this world, and that he received Allah&#8217;s forgiveness in dunya!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A righteous wife is the most precious asset after gaining taqwa of Allah. And he said<em>, “A believer has not benefited after fear of Allah more than a pious wife..&#8221; (Ibn Majah)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ali ibn Abi Talib radiyallahu anhu used to tell others that if any seeks as righteous wife, then make this dua, &#8220;Rabbana aatina fid dunya hasanah wa fil aakhirati hasanah waqina azzaban naar.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ali (radiyallahu anh) made tafseer of <em>&#8220;good of this world&#8221;</em> to be a righteous wife. Because a righteous wife can bring revolution to one&#8217;s life, one&#8217;s home, and the whole society!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For this reason, Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) used to emphasize on the importance of a righteous wife. Collect all gold, silver, dollar and machinery, but the most precious thing in this dunya is a righteous wife.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in Sunan Ibn Majah, Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) said, <em>&#8220;Indeed, this world is no more than temporary joys, and there is no temporary joy of this world that is better than a righteous wife.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Allahuakbar! This is the status Allah has given to women! Is there any society or culture or tradition from the past or present that has given a status to women as high as what Islam has given?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> So marry, for Allah will not only fulfill your dreams and desires through marriage, but he will reward you for marrying as well!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) said, <em>“Truly every tasbeehah [saying: &#8216;subhan-Allah&#8217;] is a charity, and every takbeerah [saying: &#8216;Allahu akbar&#8217;] is a charity, and every tahmeedah [saying: &#8216;al-hamdu lillah&#8217;] is a charity, and every tahleelah [saying: &#8216;laa ilaha illAllah&#8217;] is a charity. And commanding the good is a charity, and forbidding an evil is a charity, and in the bud`i [sexual act] of each one of you there is a charity.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is a charity ie., we will be rewarded just like we are rewarded for giving in charity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They (companions) said, <em>&#8220;O Messenger of Allah, when one of us fulfils his carnal desire will he have some reward for that?&#8221; He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, &#8220;Do you not see that if he were to act upon it [his desire] in an unlawful manner then he would be deserving of punishment? Likewise, if he were to act upon it in a lawful manner then he will be deserving of a reward.&#8221; (Muslim)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Allah&#8217;s messenger (</strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>) said that the one who saves oneself from haram is the best worshipper of Allah among the people.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Save yourself from zina and get married, you&#8217;ll become the best of people.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> This shows the importance of marriage, without which one&#8217;s Iman cannot be complete; without which fahisha and zina cannot be eradicated; and Allah&#8217;s pleasure and happiness cannot be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> This marriage will become a reason for the messenger to be proud of us. If we marry in accordance to Islam, our kids will become a reason of pride for the messenger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) said, <em>“Marry the one who is loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers.” (Abu Dawood)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> Hence, whereas marriage is the reason for multiplication of mankind, and peace and tranquility, it is also a reason for happiness of our messenger; and also a perfect way to end fornication and adultery!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> He (ﷺ) said, &#8220;The most blessed marriage is that which is affordable (with less expenses).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The best marriage, the most blessed one, the one that will establish peace and tranquility, the one that creates love, that will eradicate evil is the easily affordable one.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">But establishing a relationship through marriage has become difficult, and zina has become easy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;And whatever strikes you of disaster &#8211; it is for what your hands have earned.&#8221; (42:30)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We don&#8217;t remember Allah when we see evil. But we only remember him when the evil affects us with all the problems!  Rectify yourself, rectify your family, before that a day comes when Allah rejects it all our duas.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> Fahisha has become so common that this evil is being called &#8220;fashion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> A boy who doesn&#8217;t has girlfriends and girls who don&#8217;t have boyfriends are seen as too traditional and sort of crazy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: <em>“Among my ummah there will certainly be people who permit zinaa, silk, alcohol and musical instruments…”</em> <em>(Bukhari)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> They have given it new names, but zina will remain evil. They have become used to it, so they don&#8217;t see this evil as evil anymore. The hearts have died.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For this reason, marriage has been prescribed early. If youth (both men and women) get married at the right time, all the doors to faahisha will be closed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ), <em>&#8220;If anyone cares for three daughters, disciplines them, marries them, and does good to them, he will go to Paradise</em>.&#8221; <em>(Abu Dawood)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> And he (ﷺ) said, <em>&#8220;Marriage is the best thing for lovers.&#8221; (Ibn Majah)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>An Addition:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbas (radiyallahu anhuma) related that a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, <em>&#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I am a guardian of an orphan girl. Two men betrothed that girl: one of them is wealthy and the other is poor. We like to give her to the wealthy but she  wants the poor! The Prophet </em>ﷺ <em>said, Marriage is the best thing for lovers.</em> <em>(Ibn Majah)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Love does not mean the lustful desire. This is a false love. No sooner does a man desire a woman than he hates her after satisfying himself. Love, which is mainly portrayed in romantic stories, is just a kind of fiction and dreams. Love only grows between spouses. As years pass, company and kind treatment enhance such love.  Real love gradually replaces the illusive love.&#8221; <em>(The Bride’s Boon &#8211; Tuhfat Al-‘Arous  by Mahmoud M Al-Istambulli)</em><em><br />
</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Marriage also kills all hatred between two families. Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) married Juwairiyyah (radiyallahu anha) and some others for primarily this reason.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Tatars, destroyed Muslims lands and killed approx 50 hundred thousand Muslims, and the later on married some of the Muslim women, this lead to a turning point in history. They accepted Islam and then dedicated their lives for serving Islam.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> Make the marriage easy, and for this, the groom and his family must stop the practice of asking the bride for dowry. Stop behaving like beggars! Remember that Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) swore by Allah and said, <em>&#8220;He who opens a gate of begging, Allah opens a gate of poverty<strong>.&#8221; </strong>(Tirmidhi)<br />
</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Will you ask for that haram dowry? Allah&#8217;s messenger (<strong>ﷺ</strong>) has sworn that Allah will make a beggar dependant on others for every little thing!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an, <strong>&#8220;And marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves. If they should be poor, Allah will enrich them from His bounty, and Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.&#8221; (24:32)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you don&#8217;t have much money, then Allah will enrich. Don&#8217;t worry about that. But you want to get rich before the marriage itself, you want to buy the girl in the price of an animal! So, why would Allah then help?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> First, get married. And then, Allah&#8217;s help will arrive. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Who is a ‘gani’ (rich person)? The one who has alot of money? No. Gani is the one is self &#8211; sufficient. And Allah is Al Gani, The Self Sufficient, not dependant on anyone. Allah will make you as well Gani, you will not be dependent on people, but on Allah alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Look in the case of Abdurrahman ibn Awf (radiyallahu anh), who got married just after sometime of migration when he had nothing much in terms of wealth. The messenger, the most important person of the city was also not invited for the marriage. Look into this companion&#8217;s simple marriage. But we distribute invitation cards in the whole country! And even to those in foreign countries. Why not follow the sunnah? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> Later on, he increased so much in wealth that he even married four wives. Allah has permitted marrying two, three, and four wives. Because Allah knows that man has desires, and it is not necessary that his desires will be fulfilled by marrying one. He died leaving behind thousands of dinars for each wife. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is why Abdullah ibn Abbas (radiyallahu anh) used to tell others to search for richness by marrying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>التمسوا الغنى في النكاح</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Abu Bakr (radiyallahu anh) would say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;من اراد الغنى فاليتزوج&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Whoever wants to get rich should get married!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the same is learnt from Zubair ibn al Awwam (radiyallahu anh)&#8217;s marriage who got married while yet very poor, but died leaving lands and buildings in Madina, Basra, Egypt etc. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He (ﷺ) said, <em>“A woman may be married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her religious commitment. Seek the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” (Muslim)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We saw earlier how righteous wives changed the history of Tatars, and now look at how Umm Sulaim (radiyallahu anha) who told to the non Muslim man who proposed her, &#8220;If you accept Islam, then that is your mahr (dowry).&#8221; She made her dowry as Islam, and what a revolution came that he accepted Islam, other women got inspired and her ten children became scholars of the Deen, and one of the those sons was Anas ibn Malik (radiyallahu anh) for who the messenger (ﷺ) made dua saying, &#8220;O Allah increase in his wealth and family and let him enter Jannah.&#8221; And then he had a hundred children!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl, who the messenger decided at the conquest of Makkah that he would not be forgiven at any cost. But his wife, Umm Hakeem, a pious woman, interceded on his behalf. Ikrimah wanted to get close her but she refused and told him to accept Islam or else their marriage bond would break. It was due to her wisdom and tableegh that such a big oppressor accepted Islam. And the same Ikrimah at the time Abu Bakr and Umar (radiyallahu anhum), fought very hard against Musailimah Al Kazzab, who claimed prophet-hood. Allah made him serve the deen, but this was due the efforts of his wife.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No doubt that a righteous wife has great importance. And thus, the famous Arabic proverb,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>وراء كل رجل عظيم امرأة</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Behind every successful man is a woman.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That was some of the basics in introduction to marriage. Now let&#8217;s analyze whether marriage is simple or difficult.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Conditions Of Marriage</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Marriage will remain in existence until mankind remains. For this reason, Allah has made marriage simple and easy. There are conditions of marriage, and until we don&#8217;t apply these rules and conditions, the difficulty will continue to increase. If we really want to see a change, then let us establish this sunnah in our lives, let us marry in an affordable and simple manner.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With regards to this, the conditions of marriage are:-</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Wali (guardian) of the girl:</strong> A girl cannot marry without a guardian. Wali is a condition. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Two witnesses:</strong> Marriage cannot be complete without minimum two witnesses. Marriage without two witnesses cannot establish this bond and relationship, rather it would be destruction. Allah has put the same condition for even other business transactions like loan, and for divorce as well. Two just witnesses are a condition. And the hadith of the messenger (ﷺ) proves this, <em>“There is no marriage except with a wali and two just witnesses.&#8221; (Abu Dawood)</em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Mahr </strong>: Islam puts the financial responsibility on the men before the marriage itself. Other responsibilities like house and clothing come later on. Marriage will not be valid until Mahr is decided, or that it is given it to her. Marriage without deciding the amount of Mahr will not be marriage, but Zina. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Waleema (wedding feast):</strong> After the marriage, an important thing is waleema. People spend in hundreds of thousands for waleema, just to show off.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Why is a Wali required ?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah said in the Qur&#8217;an to the wives of messenger. <em>&#8220;And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as [was] the display of the former times of ignorance.&#8221; (33:33)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A woman is the Queen of her home. A woman should generally stay in her home, for she cannot handle everything all together. Allah has put such a responsibility and capability in woman that she can bring a revolution in the home, city or the whole culture! But Allah has not permitted her to roam publicly all alone, or become the ruler. Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) has cursed saying, <em>&#8220;A people who make a woman their ruler will never be successful.&#8221; (Bukhari)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When women began working in clubs, parks, restaurants and theatres; mankind became its own enemy, and peace disappeared from the land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we see that Allah has preferred women over men in certain cases and men over women in other cases. He has given different abilities to men and women.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable. But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority].&#8221; (2:228)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The financial responsibilities are on the men. Some of the responsibilities are on the men, and not women. And other capabilities Allah gave to women, and not men.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For this reason, Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) said, <em>“No woman can give a woman in marriage and no woman can give herself in marriage.&#8221;</em> <em>(Ibn Majah)<br />
</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> And he (ﷺ) said, <em>&#8220;The adulteresses are the ones who marry themselves without Bayyinah (proof).&#8221; (Tirmidh) </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And usually, the court marriages and many so called “love marriages” come under this ruling. Very often such women who marry without any wali or witnesses are dumped by their &#8220;lovers.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If someone wants to have blessing in their lives, then a wali and two witnesses are necessary. The messenger (ﷺ) said, <em>&#8220;The marriage is invalid without the wali, mahr, and   two just witnesses.&#8221; </em>(Sunan Al Kubra)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>Who is a wali?</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The father. And the one who doesn&#8217;t has a father will have her brother or son as a wali. The one who has none, will have the ruler or the scholars as her wali. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A marriage in which one that is forced to marry by the wali is also an invalid marriage according to the messenger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Reflect at the justice of Islam. On one side, the wali has been made a condition. On the other hand, the choice and will of the girl is also a condition!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Khansaa&#8217; bint Khizam Al Ansariyyah was forcefully married by her father. She went and complained to the messenger (ﷺ) and he invalidated that marriage. <em>(Fath Al Bari, sharh al Bukhari)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And there are other narrations proving that agreement of the girl is necessary. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And it is upon the wali to accept a proposal of a righteous, well mannered, man of Taqwa. If you reject such proposals, then you cannot prevent the virus of fitnah from affecting you. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) repeated and emphasised this message thrice saying, : <em>&#8220;When someone whose religion and character you are pleased with proposes to (someone under the care) of one of you, then marry to him. If you do not do so, then there will be turmoil (Fitnah) in the land and abounding discord (Fasad).&#8221; (Tirmidhi)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning that if he is righteous and well mannered, then don&#8217;t look at how much he earns, nor at his position and status in society.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>Mahr:</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> Mahr is the right of the woman, and it must be given to her, and she will be the sole-owner of it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah said, <strong>&#8220;And give the women [upon mahrriage] their [bridal] gifts graciously.&#8221; (4:4)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">But many of us do not even give the mahr. They specify the amount in written form just for the sake of formalities, but don&#8217;t actually give it. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) said, <em>&#8220;If a man married a woman with less or more mahr and his intention of not giving the mahr, and he dies without giving the mahr, will meet Allah on the day of judgement as Zaani (adultrer).&#8221; (Tabarani)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> Such a man will be put in the rows with adulterers. And do you know the punishment for a this act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;And do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty. Multiplied for him is the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein humiliated.&#8221; (25:68-69)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the light of these ayat, such a person deserves to stay in Jahannam forever and ever. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (ﷺ) said, <em>&#8220;The one who commits an illegal sexual intercourse is not a believer at the time of committing illegal sexual intercourse..&#8221; (Bukhari)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zina is from among the major sins! Imam Ad Dhahabi mentioned this in his Kitab Al Kabair (major sins). So, how about the one who commits zina all his life? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Give the mahr to them happily and graciously. Allah says in Surah Nisa, <strong>&#8220;So for whatever you enjoy [of marriage] from them, give them their due compensation as an obligation.&#8221; (4:24)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mahr is an obligation just like the obligation of Salah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) said, <em>“The conditions that are most deserving to be fulfilled are those by means of which intimacy becomes permissible for you.” (Bukhari)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nowadays, they take heavy dowry as gold and money from the girl, but don&#8217;t give the mahr! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says, &#8220;But if they (the girl and her family) give up willingly to you anything of it </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(mahr), then take it in satisfaction and ease.&#8221; (4:4)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Enjoy the mahr if she gives. But don&#8217;t ask her for dowry, even if you&#8217;re in need of money. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;But let them who find not [the means for] marriage abstain [from sexual relations] until Allah enriches them from His bounty.&#8221; (24:33)<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Postpone the marriage if you don&#8217;t have the money. But don&#8217;t ask for dowry from the women. This is absolutely haram (impermissible). Abstain from consuming haram! Ka&#8217;ab (radiyallahu anh) narrated that the messenger (ﷺ) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> &#8220;There is no flesh raised that sprouts from the unlawful except that the Fire is more appropriate for it.&#8221;</em><em> (Tirmidhi)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And my dear brothers, the reason for this mahr is not to make the situation difficult for men, or else the messenger would have not permitted the sahaba to give few coins as or excessively less money and clothe as mahr. Nor would he have permitted memorization of the Qur&#8217;an as mahr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d As-Sa&#8217;idi narrated that: <em>A woman came to the Messenger of Allah(</em>ﷺ <em> </em><em>) and said: &#8220;I present myself to you (for marriage).&#8221; So she stood for a long time. Then a man said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Marry her to me if you have no need of her.&#8221; So he said: &#8220;Do you have anything to give her as a dowry?&#8221; He said: &#8220;I have nothing except this Izar.&#8221; So the Messenger of Allah said: &#8220;If you give her your Izar then you will have no Izar, so search for something.&#8221; He said: &#8220;I did not find anything.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Search for something, even if it just an iron ring.&#8221; He said: So he searched but he did not find anything. The Messenger of Allah said: &#8220;Do you have any Qur&#8217;an (memorized)?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes. This Surat and that Surat.&#8221; And he named the Surat. So the Messenger of Allah said: &#8220;I marry her to you for what you have (memorized) of the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221; (Tirmidhi)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Umar ibn al-Khattaab said: <em>“Do not go to extremes with regard to the dowries of women, </em>for if that were a sign of honour and dignity in this world or a sign of piety before Allaah, then Muhammad (ﷺ) would have done that before you. But he did not give any of his wives, and<em> none of his daughters were given, more than twelve uqiyah. A man may increase the dowry until he feels resentment against her and says, ‘You cost me everything I own, and caused me a great deal of hardship’.” (Ibn Majah)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Pay the mahr in accordance to your affordability. But it should be in agreement with the bride as well. The messenger (ﷺ) always gave the mahr before marriage, except in the case of Aisha (radiyallahu anha) who he gave after the marriage. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So give the mahr in front of the public, so that others learn a lesson from you and get inspired from you to follow this. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Waleemah (wedding feast): </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If someone wants to get married, then he should be capable to afford a waleemah (wedding feast). If you can&#8217;t afford, then you may even ask others to donate something for you. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) married Safiyyah (radiyallahu aha), and the wedding feast had no bread or meat, but just some dates, dried curd (cheese) and ghee. (Bukhari)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fatimah (radiyallahu anha) married Ali (radiyallahu anh) when he didn&#8217;t even own a house. And we think of bank balance, land and property before getting married. And Ali did not have anything to even give in for wedding feast. So, the sahaba contributed for it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, among the things we need to take care while hosting a waleemah is to invite the local poor people, and the scholars, students of knowledge, Imams and Muadhins. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The messenger (ﷺ) said, <em>&#8220;The worst kind of food is that at a wedding feast from which those who come (ie the poor) are turned away and to which those who refuse to come (ie the rich) are invited..&#8221; (Muslim)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Steps to make marriage easy and successful</strong></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Lessen the burden on the bride’s family:</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Waleemah (wedding feast) should be hosted by the groom, and there is no proof whatsoever to ask the bride&#8217;s family to host the waleemah. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> You will not a find single saheeh or even a daeef hadith proving the opposite. The messenger (ﷺ) is our role model. You pray like the messenger and perform abulution like the messenger (ﷺ) . He married Aisha, but did Abu Bakr (radiyallahu anh) call for any feast ? He (ﷺ) married Hafsah, but did Umar (radiyallahu anh) invited for any feast ? Fatimah (radiyallahu anha) married Ali, but did the messenger (ﷺ) invite Ali (radiyallahu anh) for any feast ? Abu Bakr radiyallahu anh gave his daughter in marriage to Zubair ibn al Awwam (radiyallahu anh). Abu Bakr was rich enough, and he gifted them a slave as well, but did he invite for any feast ? This is nothing but blind following the culture of non Muslims like Jews, Christians and Hindus.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no proof for feasts to be hosted by the bride or her family. Rather, this is a clear innovation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Today, many Muslim girls are committing adultery in clubs, universities etc. When a survey was made so as to why they do this, tears flowed from their eyes and their response was that their parents were not able to afford the high dowry and the expenses of waleemah asked by the future in-laws. We come across lots of such cases. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They will not be able to get married until the youth wakeup, and decide to make their marriages simple and affordable. It is not possible until they give women their rights, their mahr, and they spend and take upon themselves the responsibility of hosting the wedding feast. Remember that this disease of faahisha cannot be killed until the youth take their responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> You put all the blame for the spread of fahisha on Television, series, movies and Internet. But who is the root cause for this? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an, <strong>&#8220;O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves. Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided. To Allah is you return all together; then He will inform you of what you used to do.&#8221; (5:105)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Educate your children about Qur&#8217;an and Hadith. You see girls becoming lecturers and teachers in English schools, but then running away from homes with some strangers to fulfill their desires! Who is responsible for this? At times, they find it difficult to recall the shahadah! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you give proper tarbiyah to your children, then even if they go to countries abroad for studies, they&#8217;ll be teaching and inspiring others instead of following their footsteps. Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ), <em>&#8220;He who raises two daughters until their puberty will be with me in Paradise like this&#8221;, and he symbolized the proximity by showing two of his fingers with a slight gap between them.&#8221; (Muslim)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allahuakbar, Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) will be as close to us as are our two fingers! So, make the marriage affordable. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Learn the obligations and encouraged acts concerning marriage:<br />
</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> And from the Sunnah is to perform two rak&#8217;ahs Salah upon the first meeting to have sexual intercourse. The husband will be the Imam, and the wife will be following behind him. After the Salah, hold your wife&#8217;s head/hair and make dua to Allah saying,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> &#8220;O Allah, I ask You for the goodness within her and the goodness that you have made her inclined towards, and I take refuge with You from the evil within her and the evil that you have made her inclined towards.&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <strong><br />
</strong><strong>اللّهُـمَّ إِنَّـي أَسْـأَلُـكَ خَيْـرَها، وَخَيْـرَ ما جَبَلْـتَهـا عَلَـيْه، وَأَعـوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَـرِّها، وَشَـرِّ ما جَبَلْـتَهـا عَلَـيْه</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> If you begin your married life following the sunnah, then your future will become blessed!</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Avoid and abandon Jahez (dowry):</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the word &#8220;Jahez&#8221; (Urdu word for the dowry given by the bride&#8217;s family) has been taken from the Arabic language. But this word in Arabic is not used for those alive, rather for the dead ones! The burial and funeral procession is called &#8220;Tajheez&#8221; in Arabic. The word &#8220;Jahez&#8221; is connected to the word &#8220;Tajheez&#8221;. But this tajheez is us for the dead. And the reality is that those whose hearts have become dead only ask for dowry from the bride or her family. But those whose hearts are alive do not ask for Jahez (dowry)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this Jahez is zulm (oppression) as well. This is because Allah&#8217;s messenger (ﷺ) said,  <em>“The property of a Muslim is not permissible unless he gives his consent.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Don&#8217;t target your Muslim brother&#8217;s money. Do you think that these parents of the girls give the dowry happily?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There may be someone with a dead heart giving Jahez with pleasure, but usually parents of the girl give Jahez only out of force of the culture and pressure of the in-laws. For this reason, this money is haram. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an, <strong>&#8220;And do not consume one another&#8217;s wealth unjustly..&#8221; (2:188)</strong> This is zulm (oppression), and it is haram as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> And the boy and his family feels proud asking for Jahez. Remember that the one who has pride even as little as grain will not enter Jannah. Allah says, <strong>&#8220;Indeed, Allah does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful.&#8221; (31:18)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> And one of the things for which Allah punishes anyone in this dunya and in the akhirah as well is Zulm (oppression). This dowry is haram, and is zulm, and is used to boast. And he said in khutbah of Hajjatul Wida that just like the land of Makkah is sacred and fighting therein is haram, our blood, our property and our honour are sacred also sacred.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> And very often this dowry is used as a bribe for marriage, they look for who agree for dowry. So know that messenger (ﷺ) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Allah has cursed the one who gives bribe and the one who takes it.&#8221; (Abu Dawood)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the one who Allah curses will never be successful.  This dowry is also brought among Muslims following the footsteps of non Muslims. Allah forbid this behavior, and heavily warned us saying, <strong>&#8220;And incline not to those who do wrong, or the Fire will seize you; and ye have no protectors other than Allah, nor shall ye be helped.&#8221; (11:113)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Don&#8217;t even incline towards them. No such culture of demanding jahez is found except in the Indian subcontinent. So those who want end this must themselves take the first step. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Avoid extravagance:</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">O brothers and sisters, realize that other reasons making marriages difficult for our youth is the extravagance. Extravagance in decoration of function halls, music, photo shooting, video &#8211; recording, and even much wastage of food. Allah has made music and dance haram, and remember that Allah doesn&#8217;t prohibits anything except that he hates it, and is harmful for us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> &#8220;Waleema&#8221; is the Arabic word for the wedding feast and &#8220;Aleema&#8221; refers to &#8216;azaab (punishment). Don&#8217;t convert your Waleema to Aleema!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> O my dear Muslims, remember that Allah will ask you about all this. He says in the Qur&#8217;an: And he says, <strong>&#8220;Indeed, the wasteful are brothers of the devils, and the Shaitan (Devil &#8211; Satan) is ever ungrateful to his Lord.&#8221; (17:27)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> It is due to wastage that Muslims lost their power and rule. Caliph Ma&#8217;moon married one of the most beautiful lady (Bouran) of that time; and same with Caliph Mu&#8217;tasim, others who wasted much wealth in marriage, and emptied the nation&#8217;s wealth and the treasury of the Muslims just like some of the current ones, and the nation reached height of poverty and misery. And it was at this time that the Tatars (Turks) decided to attack. Muslim rule became utterly destroyed. The situation went so worse that they couldn&#8217;t save themselves, nor could they save their honor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear brothers, this land (the subcontinent) is also beloved to us, we have strived and struggled much for the freedom of this land, and we have speared much blood and tears here, and put our lives to danger (to free ourselves from colonization). It is in this land that we raised the banner of &#8220;Qaala &#8211; Allah wa qaala &#8211; Rasool&#8221;, and we Muslims ruled this land for a 1000 years! We are the ones who spread the message of love and peace in this land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">O Muslims! Put an end to this extravagance; the more the expenditure, the more number of girls won&#8217;t be able to marry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">But if you don&#8217;t stop all this, then Allah will not forgive you, he&#8217;ll make your wives disobedient, and your own children will become stubborn and unmanageable; and you will die out of disgrace and embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> Do away with all these rituals of Mehendi and haldi. Take the responsibility of Walima on yourself, don&#8217;t even expect the bride&#8217;s family to do any of that. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Marry on any day or month of the year:</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Few people consider Muharram a cursed month, subhanallah. This is the month when Khaibar was conquered and the battle of Qadissiyyah was won; the messenger (ﷺ) made hijrah in this month; so what&#8217;s wrong that you try to avoid this month? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The idolaters of Makkah used to consider the month of Shawwal a accursed month, and inappropriate for marriage. So, the messenger (ﷺ) married Aisha in Shawwal opposing their beliefs and rituals. And as it has been narrated in Saheeh Bukhari, Aisha (radiyallahu anha) used to prefer for others as well to get married in this month. Implement the teachings of Allah, this is the right way to eradicate wrong beliefs and rituals. So, marry in the month of of Muharram and Shawwal. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> And avoid mixed gatherings:</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At least, don&#8217;t let men and women mix in your weddings. Make proper segregation arrangements. Don&#8217;t let men and male waiters enter your women&#8217;s section. Where is gheerah (honorable protectiveness)? The messenger (ﷺ) said that there is no good in the one who does not feels geerah. I request my mothers and sisters to avoid such gatherings and function halls.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Dear reader, may Allah ease your life and ease your hereafter, don&#8217;t close this document without having any effect on yourself. Promise yourself that you will implement what you learnt. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: <em>&#8220;Indeed the religion began as something strange and it will return to being strange. So glad &#8211; tidings is for the strangers who correct what the people have corrupted from my Sunnah after me.&#8221; (Tirmidhi)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Islam began as something strange among kuffar, but a time would come that this very deen would become strange among Muslims. So glad tidings for the strangers! Do you want the glad tidings of Jannah? Then promise yourself that you will not ask others for dowry. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We ask Allah that may he bless you with such wealth that he blessed Zubair ibn Al Awwam with. May those parents who marry their children Islamically also be blessed with happiness in this life and hereafter. Some of us have parents who also make much trouble for their children from marrying in the Islamic manner. We ask Allah by his noble names and attributes to bring us back to Islam, and to protect our sisters and daughters, and all those who wish to implement Islam in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> And may Allah&#8217;s peace, mercy and blessings be upon Muhammad.</span></p>
