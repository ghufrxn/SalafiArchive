				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>by </strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Shamil in an article attempted to prove Shaykh Irshad al-Haq distorted the words of as-Samarqandi in his article <strong><em>Did as-Samarqandi say rafay yadain nullifies salah? (Irshad ul Haq Athari’s tahreef)</em></strong> on Hanafiyya wordpress and Darul Tahqiq copying them, published it on their site. I did not expect this level of presentation for this unwarranted allegation of tahrif, and even they know it’s not tahrif.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Shamil’s scathing allegation is that Shaykh Irshad distorted as-Samarqandi’s words and put words into his mouth while he in turn was quoting Imam Abu Hanifah! So, merely on account of this, Ahmad Shamil echoes this charge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9828 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-cov.jpeg?resize=386%2C636" alt="Nawazil cov" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-cov.jpeg?resize=182%2C300 182w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-cov.jpeg?w=698 698w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9830 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?resize=398%2C600" alt="Nawazil 49" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?resize=199%2C300 199w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?resize=768%2C1158 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?resize=679%2C1024 679w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-49.jpeg?w=832 832w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You can clearly read Shaykh Irshad saying, “<em>Faqih Abu Layth as-Samarqandi has clearly written…” </em> because as-Samarqandi did write this in his book. Shaykh Irshad chose the words <em>“has clearly written”</em> opposed to <em>“he clearly said”.</em> So, Shaykh Irshad was very precise in what he was implying. However, the brother missed this point because he was too busy juggling the word <em>“Tahreef”</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9823 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/irshadul-haq-athari-1.jpg?resize=484%2C313" alt="irshadul-haq-athari 1" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/irshadul-haq-athari-1.jpg?resize=300%2C194 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/irshadul-haq-athari-1.jpg?resize=768%2C497 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/irshadul-haq-athari-1.jpg?w=900 900w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secondly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says, <em>“Also one must note that as-Samarqani quoted it saying </em>روى عن <em>which is </em><em>“</em><em>sighah al-tamreedh</em><em>”</em><em> and a way to point towards weakness of the narration.”</em> So, if as-Samarqandi alluded to its weakness it means he was in doubt of its attribution to Imam Abu Hanifah. However as-Samarqandi is the one who transmitted it to the world and the readers. So, If Shaykh Irshad al-Haq was also aware of this sighah, it would be natural for him to say “<em>Faqih Abu Layth as-Samarqandi has clearly written.” </em>So, is this your appreciation of Shaykh Irshad al-Haq for not attributing this statement to Imam Abu Hanifah and giving him the benefit of doubt?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9824 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fatawa-al-nawazil-asal.jpg?resize=536%2C220" alt="fatawa-al-nawazil asal" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fatawa-al-nawazil-asal.jpg?resize=300%2C123 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fatawa-al-nawazil-asal.jpg?resize=768%2C314 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fatawa-al-nawazil-asal.jpg?w=799 799w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says, <em>“In his work Irshad al Haqq Athari in asserting that scholars of the four established schools of Islamic fiqh have gone to extremes in issues of furoo’..” </em>Shaykh Irshad summarised as-Samarqandi’s speech and you clearly see this from the Urdu summary of the Arabic. Ahmad Shamil clearly knew this, this is clear like the day, yet he wanted to pass this off as a tahrif of the Shaykh. This is common when quoting lengthy passages as the point is to usually convey the intended meaning or comprehension. Surely as Muslims we should know better.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fourthly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is clearly a view which as-Samarqandi believed in. He first says, “Qalu” as in they say, meaning the elders and authorities of the Hanafi madhhab and that this is their view and by default also his. He mentions these scenarios and reasons in which the Hanafis can pray behind the Shafi’s. He then proceeds to mention raising the hands also nullifies the prayer, the only difference this time is that he mentions it through Makhul from Imam Abu Hanifah. So the question is, did as-Samarqandi hold this view? Yes, of course he did. What is the problem then when Shaykh Irshad said, “<em>Faqih Abu Layth as-Samarqandi has clearly written.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fifthly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says, <em>“What he has done here is to put into the mouth of a seasoned Hanafi jurist what he merely stated as a report from Imam Abu Hanifa through Makhul an-Nasafi.” </em>This is a very poor line or argument to begin with. It would make more sense to have said this was Imam Abu Hanifah’s view because he is “the most seasoned Hanafi jurist” and it would further support and strengthen Shaykhs Irshad’s view and the point he was trying to make. Why would he settle for a lesser point. Obviously this does not make sense.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sixthly</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are not concerned with what other Hanafi scholars have had to say about his issue, as this is an internal matter for the Ahnaf to deal with. He said, <em>“Shaykh al-Lucknawi has mentioned the names of multiple renowned jurists who have not accepted that word.” </em>This is besides the point and what al-Lucknowi or others said. This is a matter for your house to resolve. In fact, al-Lucknowi offered a detailed discussion in <em>as-Si’ayah fi Kashf ma-fi Sharh al-Wiqayah</em> (2/150-151), (Deoband: Maktabah Shaykh ul-Hindh, Faisal Publications, 1427H).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He does refute this incident in his <em>al-Fawa’id al-Bahiyyah fee Tarajim al-Hanafiyyah</em> (1/401 under no. 244) (Riyadh/ Cairo: Dar Ibn al-Qayyim/Dar Ibn Affan, 1441/2020) and alludes to it elsewhere under Makhul’s entry in detail. (<em>al-Fawa’id al-Bahiyyah </em>(2/197 no.479).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And did the brother not read in <em>al-Fawa’id al-Bahiyyah fee Tarajim al-Hanafiyyah</em> how Amir Katib al-Itqani attributed this view to Imam Abu Hanifah from Makhul (1/194 no.90). So, it was your own scholars who continued to use this report for centuries even until Amir Katib’s time. So, a sharp exit through al-Lucknowi is not as honourable as you might want to think.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The contention was a Hanafi jurist and mufti held this view, the view of raising hands nullifies the salah and thus the salah of the Hanafi behind the Shafi&#8217; is null and void, this was the point. It would be pointless to even share books which Hanafi scholars wrote advocating raising hands in prayer. This is not the discussion brother.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To then conclude, Shaykh Athari summarised as-Samarqandi’s words and mentioned the issue of the prayer being invalid if the hands were raised. As-Samarqandi held this view himself as he mentions it with the discussion when a Hanafi can pray behind a Shafi&#8217; and that before him al-Makhul attributed this view to Imam Abu Hanifah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us take a moment here and ask, was it not as-Samarqandi’s work which mentioned the following while transmitting from Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There will light be after the Prophet and his kunyah will be Abu Hanifah and he will revive the religion of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam<em>.</em> Anas RadhiAllahu Anhu said Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, there will be a man at the end of times with the kunyah Abu Hanifah who will revive the religion of Allah and my sunnah… (<em>an-Nawazil </em>(p.378) (Hyderabad: Matba’a Shams al-Islamiyyah, 1355H/1936).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9831 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-p378.jpeg?resize=407%2C626" alt="Nawazil p378" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-p378.jpeg?resize=195%2C300 195w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-p378.jpeg?resize=665%2C1024 665w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nawazil-p378.jpeg?w=762 762w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whether this addition is not from the author or if someone else added it, it has remained in his book, read and seen since its publication, and this edition was published around 1936, i.e for almost 90 years. Is this not a distortion of the religion?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Honest and sincere advice would be to rectify your own house before accusing others of distortion!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="center"><strong>Compiled &amp; Translated </strong></h5>
<h5 align="center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A confused anonymous twitter user Dr.AbuLaylah (@DrAbuLaylah) attempted to mock the “Ahlul Hadith”, in speech marks as he expresses himself and says, <strong>“The “Ahlul Hadith” kid after discovering that Imam Malik didn’t view Raf al Yadayn as Sunnah: (then adds GIF showing a young adult weeping and crying)”</strong> an attempt to show it dawns on the Ahlul Hadith that Imam Malik did not deem Raf ul-Yadain as the Sunnah and they start crying!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-9626 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/twitter-pro.jpeg?resize=338%2C469" alt="twitter pro" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/twitter-pro.jpeg?resize=216%2C300 216w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/twitter-pro.jpeg?resize=768%2C1067 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/twitter-pro.jpeg?resize=737%2C1024 737w, https://i0.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/twitter-pro.jpeg?w=1080 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When a brother comments with an image from Ibn Rushd’s <em>Bidayatul Mujtahid</em> that it was actually a Sunnah according to Imam Malik, he back tracks and then jumps on the last bastion of defence and says it’s the Mu’tamad of the Madhhab. So, we see in the beginning from attempting to mock the Ahlul Hadith he finishes with the clause out of “Mu’tamad”. The astonishing irony is that he likes the tweet comment from <em>Bidayatul Mujtahid</em> and fails to delete his, which as this point is a lie. When another brother presents a statement from Imam ash-Shaf’i he accuses the brother of attacking Imam Malik and yet mind bogglingly forgets his attack on all of the Ahlul Hadith with his lamentable comment, the irony!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A precursory view of the tweets of <strong>Dr.AbuLaylah</strong> yield some purulent vilification of the Salafi Ahlul Hadith. He thinks by using playground terms like <strong>“…Pseudo-salafi ghayr muqallids…” </strong>and then goes on to supplicate to Allah <strong>“May Allah get rid of them” </strong>not before rushing his fingers saying, <strong>“pseudo-salafi ghayr muqallids closeted modernist are most dangerous sect now and they are the cause of the deviance among the ummah”.</strong> Unfortunately this is the true reality of Muslims on the social media, we pray in earnest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are not concerned with the pitiable remarks since they are not new for the Salafis and Ahlul Hadith and such statements have been emanating from the <strong>Ghayr-Muttab’is</strong> for centuries. The most ironic thing this false allegation was actually answered around 25 years ago by a young Salafi Ahlul Hadith teenager, <em>Abu Asaakir al-Araaqee</em> in <strong>Kitaab Raf al-Yadain – Dharb ul-Yadain ala Munkari Raf ul-Yadain. </strong>Perhaps Dr.AbuLaylah was literally a young kid or even a toddler at the time. My dear friend it is easy to mock and perhaps this is what you learn from your neo-Madhhabist approach.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Raf ul-Yadain – raising the hands for the opening takbir, going into and rising from ruku and when standing for the third rak’ah was the Sunnah with Imam Malik. Furthermore, Imam Malik transmitted and practised this Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here are scans from the book and I hope the honest reader can see the evil lie this individual hurled at Imam Malik and the Ahlul Hadith</span></p>
