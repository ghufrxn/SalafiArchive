<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[1] </strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1250H-1326H </strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(1834c-1908c)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the early 2000’s we compiled short biographies of some of the scholars of the sub continent, we also mentioned they were summaries of detailed biographies which were delayed in being published for some reason or another. In additional to the fact that in recent years, unfortunately some imprudent ignorant people from Birmingham began to say our dawah was to the scholars of ‘India and Pakistan,’ despite the sheer ignorance of such people and being totally clueless and oblivious of the dawah of the scholars before, we thought it was time and most pertinent to share some of the biographies of these great luminaries of the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafi’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was the summarized biography which has been since amended and updated by this biography.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[Biography] – Allamah Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani [1326H]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">http://www.salafiri.com/biography-allamah-muhammad-bashir-Sahaswani-1326h/</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is Allamah Kabir Muhammad Bashir bin Hakim Muhammad Badr al-Din bin Sadr al-Din al-Faruqi al-Sahaswani. He is not in need of any introduction, he is the renowned Scholar, the <em>Muhaddith</em>, the jurist, the debater, the teacher, the <em>mufti</em>, the admonisher and speaker. <em>(Forty Scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65 and Hayat nazir p.173 both of Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whenever Sahaswan is mentioned Shaikh Muhammad Bashir is the first one who comes to mind. <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab bayna mu’idihah wa mu’aridahah fi shabbah al-qarihah al-hindiyyah p.63 of Shaikh Abul Mukarram bin Abdul al-Jalil)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Family Roots and Background</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His lineage traces back to Umar ibn al-Khattab (RadhiAllahu Anhu). His grandfather was a resident of Thanesar which is in western Punjab, which he left and settled in Sahaswan. He had studied with various scholars and was known to be upright and righteous. <em>(Dabistan hadith p.216 of Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father, Hakim Muhammad Badr al-Din Faruqi was a Doctor and resided in Lucknow due to his work in the early years of the Shaikh’s life and this is where he received his early education, under the guidance of his father. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250 of Shaikh Imam Khan Nawshahri, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.379-380 of Muhammad Qadi Aslam Sayf Fairuzpuri)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father was a renowned physician who had learnt and studied Medicine at the hands of the experts of the Day which included the likes of Shaikh Shah Rafi al-Din Muhaddith Dehlawi. He also studied Ibn Sina’s classical Medical magnum opus <em>‘al-Qanun.’ </em>The Shaikhs father would treat everyone ranging from poor to the elite and even received honorary titles from the ruler of Oudh. He also had knowledge and had studied the Islamic sciences. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dabistan hadith p.216, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237 oh Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi, Forty Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith p.65)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs father died in approximately 1260H/1844c and at the time Shaikh Muhammad Bashir was approximately 10 years old. Thereafter he returned to his native area of Sahsawan with his mother.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Birth of the Allamah Kabir</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani was born in approximately 1250H/1834c in Sahsawan which is in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Sahaswan is an old city with rich history. Sahsawan had always been a city of learning and Islamic sciences and a great number of scholars hailed from there. Likewise, and similarly a large number of Ahl al-Hadith scholars used to live in Sahaswan <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.379-380, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237, Forty Scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The historians and biographers have differed with regards to his exact date of birth. Shaikh Idris Nigrami mentions his birth to have been in 1240H in <em>‘Tazkirrah Ulama Hal’</em> where as Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hassani mentions 1254H in his <em>‘Nuzhat al-Khawatir.’</em> Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions that he was born approximately in the middle of the century and he was no more 8-9 years old when his father died. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:437)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abul Muakkaram mentions his birth day to be 1245H <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous Ahl al-Hadith historian, Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti mentions his date of birth as 1252H (1836-1837c) <em>(Dabistan hadith p.217)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The biographers have generally accepted his birth to have been around the years 1250H-1251H based on the statement of the Shaikhs student.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some Ahl al-Hadith historians and researchers have mentioned another Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani who died in 1321H who authored <em>‘Tabsirah al-naqid,’ </em>we were unable to find anything on this Shaikh and perhaps it is a mistake in the citation of the name and also the potential difficulty in reading the hand writing and script from books of that era. <em>(Was Islam Spread in the Subcontinent due to the efforts of the Sufiyyah, p.154 of Shaikh Ghazi Uzair)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani, who spend a lot of time under the tutelage of Shaikh Sahaswani authored a book on the biographies of the scholars of Sahaswan titled, <em>‘al-Yaqut al-marjan fi zikr ulama Sahaswan.’</em> Which is often referred to as ‘<em>Hayat al-ulama’ </em>and we will also refer to it with the same name here on in.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Pursuit of Knowledge</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Early Days in Sahaswan and Lucknow</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh began his studies with his father who had himself studied in Delhi and thus spent time with notable luminaries of the era. After returning to Sahaswan he began to study under Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan for approximately 10 years or so. Then in 1273H/1856c, just after the period of mutiny was subsiding he travelled to Lucknow and studied with the Scholars of Farangi Mahal from the likes of Shaikh Hidayahtullah Khan Rampuri, Shaikh Wajid Ali Banarasi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also studied with his paternal cousin, Shaikh Nur al-Hasan Sahaswani whilst in Matharah. He studied the Islamic sciences of tafsir, hadith, fiqh and usul <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.217, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.65, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Studies with Shaikh Muhaddith Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After Lucknow the Shaikh travelled to Delhi to study with Allamah Imam Sayyid Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, he studied Hadith, Fiqh and Tafsir with him and also obtained chains for ahadith from him Ie ijazat. He studied the two Sahihs and the four sunans. He also obtained (isnad) chains of hadith from Allamah Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin Ansari al-Yamani who was the Qadi of Bhopal. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Dabistan hadith p.217, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.237-238, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Teachers from the Najd</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Shaikh travelled to the Hijaz and Najd to perform Hajj he studied with the likes of Shaikh Ahmad bin Ibrahim bin Isa al-Sharqi al-Najdi (d.1329H) and Shaikh Muhammad bin Abd al-Rahman Saharanpuri who migrated to Makkah and respectively attained ijazahs in hadith. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Transformation</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was upon the way of taqlid in his early years until his studies and the constant diligent nurturing of his first teacher, Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan Sahaswani who instilled the love and admiration of the Quran and Sunnah. Thereafter the Shaikh abandoned taqlid and held firmly onto the Kitab and Sunnah and the manhaj of the Salaf. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90-91, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikhs student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani said when Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani studied the books of Ulum Aqliyyah, Mantiq, philosophy, Fiqh and Usul he leaned towards taqlid and the hanafi madhab and would issue legal edicts based on it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, when he sat in the lessons of Shaikh Sayyid Amir Hasan and benefitted from his manhaj, Shaikh Sahaswani’s inclination for research grew stronger, leading him to follow the Quran and Sunnah, he would refer to it in every issue. He adopted the manhaj of Amal bil-Hadith and believed it was obligatory to abandon the taqlid of specific people and opinions. <em>(Hayah al-ulama p.91, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Spreading the Quran and Sunnah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani was essentially a teacher and spent all of his life learning and teaching.  Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il al-Salafi also comes to this conclusion in his introduction to Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi’s <em>‘Ma’yar ul-haq,’he </em> categorises the Shaikhs students into, writers, debaters, teachers and so on where he says Shaikh Sahaswani was more of a teacher and educationalist. <em>(Introduction to Ma’yar ul-haq</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the beginning he spent a year teaching in Bangladesh and then another year in Bihar. This was followed by 15 years of teaching as a professor in Akbarabad, Agra in a college. This is what he would do in the day and then in the evening he would teach Quran and Hadith and conduct lessons at his house. There would be a constant flow of students to his gatherings of learnings during the day and the evening, the students would benefit greatly from his knowledge. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Time in Bhopal </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During this era Shaikh Allamah Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan was active in Bhopal due to his family. At the request of Allamah Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan in 1295H/1878ce Shaikh Sahaswani was appointed as a teacher in Madrassah Shah Jahaniyyah in Bhopal after leaving Agra and he remained there for sometime. Shaikh Sahaswani was given great respect and a high position in the teaching circles and was essentially made the head of all the learning faculties. <em>(Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst in Bhopal the Shaikh would deliver lectures and sermons and the Shaikh was such a prolific speaker and orator, most of the gathering would cry due to the fear of Allah due to the Shaikh reminding them of the affairs of the Din and Dunya. He would also deliver lectures in the residence of the leaders, who would also cry to the power of his admonitions. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:251, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani had been in Bhopal for approximately 12 years. In these 12 years both scholars worked together. Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan would write books and Shaikh Sahaswani would answer all the question that were presented and in this was why Shaikh Sahaswani was known as the Mufti. At the same time Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin Ansari al-Yamani was also in Bhopal and he was the Qadi. Bhopal flourished with Ilm and became a powerful learning centre for the Salafi’s and Ahl al-Hadith. <em>(Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.376-380, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Later around 1307H/1890c after the death of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan, the atmosphere of Bhopal was changing and Shaikh Sahaswani thought it was time to move on to Delhi. The family of Shaikh Siddiq Hasan Khan were unhappy with his decision due to the great benefit and knowledge he would propagate to the people and therefore he remained in Bhopal for longer. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The historians and biographers differ how long Shaikh Sahaswani’s stayed in Bhopal with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hassani saying 30 years and Shaikh Imam Khan Nawshahri saying 24 years. It seems more appropriate that he stayed in Bhopal for approximately 24 years because this is in line with other information. Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti mentions 25 years.  After Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan’s death Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani remained in Bhopal after another 12 years making his total time in Bhopal as 24 years. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252-253, Dabistan hadith p.220, Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During this period Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan and Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi had an exchange of a book debate, where they both wrote books against one another. Shaikh Lucknowi alleged that Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani was the actual one writing the books under Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan’s name. Shaikh Sahaswani crushed this false allegation and clarified he was not the one writing the books. Shaikh Lucknowi later accepted this. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.93, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:251, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.380, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the wife of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan died in 1319H/1901c, the situation of Bhopal had changed with the new authority having a different approach to the Islamic sciences. It was at this time Shaikh Sahaswani thought it was time to move on. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.94, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252, Dabistan hadith p.218)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Time in Delhi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh left Bhopal in approximately 1319H and spent approximately 6-7 years in Delhi where he taught Tafsir and Hadith, he also published some books and engaged in answering the general questions of the people ie Ifta. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.381)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh continued to teach in the place of his teacher, Shaikh Muhaddith Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi after his death in Delhi and he remained in this position until he died. Allamah Sahaswani was an exceptional orator, he gave circles in explanation of the Quran for years in Delhi and many scholars of that time would sit in his lessons.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>An Example of His Exemplary Character and Being Firm Upon Islam</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh only had a one son who was born in 1288H whose name was Nazir Hussain upon the name of his teacher Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi.  The Shaikh concentrated on the well being and nurtured his son upon the Quran and Sunnah and was fervently diligent in educating and teaching him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Eventually the Shaikh married his son off at the tender age of 17. However, after just 6 months the Shaikhs son died in 1305H. This was a very difficult and testing time for the Shaikh, losing an only son at such a young age and even that after 6 months of marriage. The Shaikh remained patience and continued his teaching and worship of Allah. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255-256)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh also set a precedent in his era which was unheard of and in fact was frowned upon due to the Hindu culture and practices that were prevalent in society at the time which did not bother the Shaikh nor did he care. The Shaikh arranged another marriage for his daughter in law with his own expense. Even during this era, the Muslims were affected by the hindu culture and they would think it was a bad and disliked practice for the woman to get married again. In this way the Shaikh put into practice what he had learnt and studied with his teachers.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What the Scholars Said About Him</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Muhammad Bashir was well known for his knowledge and deep insight into the affairs of the Quran and Sunnah and numerous scholars testified to this including his teachers, from there were the likes of,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi praised Shaikh Sahaswani for his knowledge of the Quran and asks the family of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan to instruct Shaikh Sahaswani to start writing a tafsir of the Quran as others will not be as capable as him. <em>(Makatib naziriyyah p.159)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Hussian bin Muhsin Yamani wrote in a letter to Shaikh Shams al-Haq A’zimabadi,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“May Allah have mercy on our brother al-Allamah Muhammad Bashir who is an Alim and Muhaqqiq who holds onto the Quran and Sunnah.”</em> <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams al-Haq A’zimabadi considered Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani from amongst the foremost students of Shaikh Sayyid Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi. <em>(Ghayah al-maqsud fi hal sunan abi dawud 1:59)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allamah, the Shaikh was the epitome of knowledge and the pride of the Khalaf to the Salaf in his virtue and good qualities. He was a mujaddid of the Din in the late era, the Imam of the time and a mujtahid mutlaq.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.90)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Sahaswan in an area which has produced scholars for years and if a scholar did emerge from there, it would not be unusual or something unheard of. However, a scholar of his caliber being born in the 13/14<sup>th</sup> century gave his era radiance and his area of Sahaswan such recognition that it will be forever remembered.” (Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:250)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Rashid Rida said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was the Shaikh, Muhammad Bashir al-Sahaswani, May Allah have mercy on him, he was from the powerful Scholars of India and from the major scholars of hadith, he encompassed the various science of the Shari’ah and other than it, coupled with actions based upon knowledge, taqwa and righteousness.”</em> <em>(Muqaddimah siyanah al-insan p.14)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hassani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“al-Shaikh al-Fazil al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Muhammad Bashir al-Umari al-Sahaswani, a famous and well know scholar of India. … he was from the major scholars. He had piety and taqwa, he was righteous and upright. He was a genius with lofty manners and he had complete mastery over Usul al-Fiqh.”</em> <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:437-438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions great praise for him, his excellent and loft qualities he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I benefitted from the Shaikh with regards to knowledge of the texts and interpretation whilst he was in Agra and Bhopal. A whole group of students in fact the whole city of Dehli would benefit from his knowledge as we would deliver lessons and lectures on various sciences and disciplines. He would deliver a lesson every day for two hours after Fajr on the explanation of the Quran and Haidth and the people would travel far and wide to come to listen to him.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi goes onto say he would would teach the students the Quran and Hadith directly and he would answer questions on various in great depth and research like a mujtahid. He would also deliver lessons after jumu’ah on the Quran and Hadith in Masjid Qadi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was only interested and fervently followed the Quran and Sunnah and he was only interested in the victory of the truth. He set the precedence of knowledge in Bhopal and in fact in the whole of India and thereby established his rank and status in terms of his knowledge and powerful deductions of ijtihad. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Badi al-Din Shah al-Rashidi al-Sindi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Shaikh of the Mashaykh. The one and only, The Muhaddith of his time, the embodiment of taqwa, the revered scholar, the one who acted upon Islam completely, Shaikh, the well known Muhammad Bashir bin Badr al-Din Sahaswani he died in 1306H (this is a typo in the book it should be 1326H) , he authored ‘Siyanah al-Insan an waswasah al-shaikh dahlan’ which caused devastation in the circles of Ahl al-Bid’ah, he also wrote 3 treatises on the visitation of the Prophets (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) grave, ‘al-Qawl al-muhkam, al-Qawl al-mansur and al-Sa’i al-mashkur (Itmam al-hujjah)’(Muqaddimah hidayah al-mustafid p.96-97) </em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Shaikhs as a Debator</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Book Debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Shaikh Sahaswani went to the Hijaz to perform Hajj he saw some of the practices of the people in their veneration of the Prophets grave and saying the visiting of the grave was pillar of Hajj. Upon his return to India he authored a book on the subject titled, <em>‘al-Qawl al-muhaqqiq al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em> Some authors have cited the book as, ‘<em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani cites the book as <em>‘al-Qawl al-muhaqqiq al-Muhkam Fi Ziyarah Qabr al-Habib al-Akram.’</em> This is essentially a primary source as it comes directly from the Shaikhs students. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.91</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri cites the name as <em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhaqqiq al-Muhkam…</em>’ <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Indian Shaikh and researcher Shaikh Uzair Shams perhaps also relied on the latter two Mashaikh and thus also mentions the name of the book as <em>‘al-Qawl al-Muhaqqiq al-Muhkam…</em>’ Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti also mentions the book with the same name. <em>(Dabistan hadith p.219)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This led to a book debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Hanafi Lucknowi of Farangi Mahalli who was of the fervent opinion of the obligation and necessity to visit the Prophets grave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi wrote a reply titled <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mubram Fi Radd al-Qawl al-Muhkam’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani wrote a counter replied titled, <em>‘al-Qawl al-Mansur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi wrote his reply to the counter reply titled, <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur Fi Radd al-Qawl al-Mansur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Lucknowi in <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur’ </em>failed to answer the the main pivotal points and in return relied heavily on Subki’s arguments and <em>‘Shifa al-Siqam.’</em> Shaikh Sahaswani knew of Hafiz Ibn Abdul Hadi’s answer to al-Subki, ie <em>‘al-Sarim al-Munki’ </em>however Shaikh Sahaswani did not have the book. After a lengthy and exhausting search the Shaikh found the book wrote a follow up titled, <em>‘Itmam al-Hujjah Ala Man Awjab al-Ziyarah Mithal al-Hujjah al-Ma’ruf al-Madhab al-Ma’thur Fi Ziyarah Sayyid al-Qabur’ </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi replied with <em>‘al-Sai’i al-Mashkur Fi Radd al-Madhab al-Ma’thur’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The latters reply was all regurgitation and repetition of the same arguments. Shaikh Lucknowi relied heavily on Subki’s <em>‘Shifa al-Siqam’</em> as mentioned and on the writings of Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Haithami. Shaikh Lucknowi overlooked the counter replies and arguments and thus in this regard the book <em>‘Itmam al-Hujjah’</em> remains by far the most comprehensive reply to all of the Sufi arguments even today. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani showed the contradictions, inconsistencies and irregularities from the own words of Shaikh Lucknowi from his books and then showed Shaikh Lucknowi’s contradictions from his other books. The discussions ranged from Usul al-Hadith, Usul al-Fiqh and rijal. Shaikh Sahaswani would first quote Shaikh Lucknowi from his book <em>‘al-Kalam al-Mabrur’</em> and then answer all of his arguments in a writing style showing a written debate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani also wrote the reply to Shaikh Lucknowi’s <em>‘Madhab al-Ma’thur’</em> but it was never published and also due to the fact that Shaikh Sahaswani felt the arguments were just irrelevant repetitions and that he had already answered the claims anyway and also penned answers in his other book <em>‘Siyanah al-Insan’</em> as his student Shaikh Abdul Baqi mentions <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92, </em><em>Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:254)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both Scholars had mutual respect for each other and did not leave the realms of the Quran and Sunnah whilst addressing each other and the detailed issues.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Debate with the Mulhid Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani was an excellent debater and was very sharp Alhamdulillah. When the disbeliever Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani Hanafi challenged Allamah Sayyid Nazir Hussain Dehlawi for a debate, however as Allamah Nazir Hussain was very busy and also frail due to age. All of his students gathered to debate and he chose and Allamah Sahaswani to have a written debate with Mirza Qadiyani Hanafi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani came to Delhi around 1312-1313H and had issued a poster challenging for a debate as Shaikh al-Allamah Muhaddith Nazir Hussain Dehlawi was one of the first scholars in the whole world to declare him to be a disbeliever. In those days sometimes they would have a written debate someone would be challenged and then they would respond to each other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The responses would usually be sent to each other via messengers depending on the place of residence. What was interesting is that Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani in order to show his bold nature in an attempt to fool the people of India thought he would come to Delhi as in go to the lions den in popular proverbs.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani came from Bhopal for the debate and began the written debate with Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani. One of the treacherous tricks of Mirza Qadiyani was when the other party would accept his challenge for a debate, he would digress and diverge into the conditions of the debate so that he would have an option to runaway from the debate. The Sufis and Barelwis of today also do the same, big mouths with little actions. Anyhow, Shaikh Sahaswani was an erudite Scholar and knew of such tricks so he said at the very beginning I agree with all of your conditions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence the debate took place which was concerning the living of the Messiah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mirza Qayani presented the ayah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>when Allah said, &#8220;O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve (Surah Ale Imran:56)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahaswani recited</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>And there is none from the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe (in Jesus) before his death. (Surah al-Nisa:159)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This obliterated Mirza Ghulam Qadiyanis points which left him to resort to red herrings and illogical and stupid distortions and manipulation. It is said Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani tried to make different excuses to leave he was unable to answer and counteract the evidence of Allamah Sahaswan, he said he had to go to the train station to pick up his father in law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate continued for a period of 6 days and after the disgraceful fleeing of Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani, Shaikh Sahaswani remained in Delhi for another 2 days and then returned to Bhopal and Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani Hanafi never set foot in Delhi again. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.94-95, Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.382, Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.238)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate took place approximately around in either 1309H or 1312-1313H, showing he was from amongst the first people to refute and rebut the fallacious claims of the Mulhid Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani. This was the position of the Ahl al-Hadith at the very onset and then years later the Hanafi quarters followed, perhaps because he was one of their own. The book was published around 1313H titled <em>‘</em><em>al-Haq as-sarih fi hayat al-masih.’</em> <em>Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:253, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.63-64)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Ahl al-Hadith historians and biographers have differed as to when the debate took place, some have said it took place in 1309H whilst others seem to think it was later in 1312H-1313H <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi, the famous Ahl al-Hadith historian and biographer said he read the book in Shaikh Abdul Majid Seharwardi’s library and that it was printed by Matba’a Ansari in Delhi in 1309H and it was 136 pages. <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.66-67)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is possible and plausible, the actual written debate took place in 1309H and the book was later published in 1312-1313H.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Well Known Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh had a huge number of students due to his constant teaching in the various places he taught and travelled to and numerating all of them would be impossible however, some of them were major scholars of Hadith in their own right who themselves produced many other scholars. Some of the students include,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ahmadullah Muhaddith Partabghadhi and Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Sa’id Sharf al-Din Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Isma’il Ansari Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Iqtidar Ahmad Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Amir Ahmad Sehswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mazhar Ali Sahaswani (the Shaikhs younger brother)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Wahhab Nabina Dehlawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid E’jaz Mu’jiz Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Sattar Umrpuri (The father of Shaikh Abdul Ghaffar Hasan Rehmani)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdur Rahman Bastawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Uthman Aligharhi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Taqi Sahaswani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdus Samad Bastawi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Mubarak Ali Akbarabadi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ma’sum Ali Akbarabadi</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And manu more</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Sahaswani an an Author</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was a prolific writer as we have already mentioned in his book debate with Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi. The Shaikh was essentially a teacher however he did write some books and what outstanding and monumental books they were. From them we have the revolutionary book which caused havoc amongst the Sufi’s, making them feel things besides their usual wajd (Sufi dances) and esoteric trances!!! </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Siyanah al-insan an waswasah al-shaikh </strong><strong>dahlan &#8211; </strong><strong><em>Protecting The Human From The Satanic Whisperings of Shaikh Dahlan.</em></strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Shaikh Sahaswani went to Hijaz to perform Hajj he had a debate on Tawhid with the Ash’arite and Shafi Mufti Shaikh Ahmad bin Zaini Dahlan. The later also authored <em>‘</em><em>Durar al-saniyyah fi radd ala al-wahhabiyyah.’ </em>Shaikh Sahaswani upon his return to India authored his book answering all of the allegations and distortions of Dahlan as well as his slanderous aspersions against Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. The book is in debate format and contains some very detailed discussions. It was first printed in 1324H/1906c has been printed many times. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.92-93, Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.64, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.68)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is very important to understand is that after the debate with Shaikh Dahlan, Shaikh Sahaswani returned to India and Shaikh Dahlan also authored his <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah.’</em> Some people may argue Shaikh Sahaswani’s book was only a summary of the verbal debate they had in Makkh and that <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> is not an answer to <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah.’</em> It is very evident that Shaikh Sahaswani’s book more than likely was authored after he looked a <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah’</em> because he answers it in <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> and also the fact that it was published just two years before his death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another clear evidence which supports the aforementioned point is that Shaikh Ahmad Zaini Dahlan died in 1304H, way before Shaikh Sahaswani died and therefore it naturally leads to the conclusion that Shaikh Dahlans book <em>‘Durar al-saniyyah’ </em>was authored at least before 1304H </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Rashid Rida in his introduction to the book said,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In summary it can be said about this book, not only is it a refutation of Shaikh Dahlan or the jurists who have been cited for example Shaikh Taqi al-Din al-Subki and Shaikh Ahmad bin Hajr al-Haithami al-Makki but rather it is also a refutation of all of the grave worshippers and innovators of our time and those to come.”</em> <em>(Muqaddimah siyanah al-insan p.17, cf. </em><em>Dawah al-imam muhammad bin abdul wahhab p.65-66)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em> is still used and it is of great benefit due to its depth and precision in answering the claims and distortions of the innovator grave worshippers. To add the book to date has not been answered!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad bin Zaini Dahlan had other issues, one was his position on the british colonialists, his edict can be read here</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>The Wahabis – Zainee Dahlans Real Opinion &amp; The British</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">also this is a refutation of Subki and Dahlan from the <em>‘Siyanah al-insan’</em></span></p>

</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is on the obligation of reciting fatihah behind the Imam and again it is a very detailed book answering the points of those who say otherwise. The Shaikh would deliver a lesson everyday after Fajr on this issue for approximately 3 months. The well known hanafi scholars of Delhi would be in attendance and would note every word. The Shaikhs student Shaikh Ahmadullah Dehlawi also noted every word and later published it as a book with this title. This book was published 1327H/1909c <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:252-253, Tehrik ahl al-hadith p.381, Forty scholars of ahl al-hadith p.68)</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book is on the issue of the permissibility of sacrificing on Eid al-Adha until the end of the month, this was an odd opinion of the Shaikh in which he opposed the people of knowledge. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The contentions that is well known amongst Ahl al-Sunnah is whether it can be done for 4 days.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh initially published a general poster in Bhopal on this issue after the death of Shaikh Nawab siddiq Hasan Khan. This was one such view which Shaikh Sahaswani erred on and his teacher Shaikh Hussain bin Muhsin al-Yamani wrote a treatise answering Shaikh Sahaswani’s points as did another prominent student of Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, none other that the Imam of Hadith and Rijal in his own right, Shaikh al-Allamah Abul Mukarim Muhammad Ali Mu’i titled <em>‘Umdah al-tahqiq fi ithbat al-dhihayah ila akhir ayam al-tashriq’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani mentions Shaikh Sahaswani wrote a book collecting the evidences as well as his research into a book, however it was never published in reply to some of the points raised by the aforementioned scholars. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.95) </em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The debate which Shaikh Sahaswani had with Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani on the issue whether the messiah was alive, this was authored in book form with some additional points and printed with this title around 1313H.</span></p>

</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Rashid Iraqi mentions this as one of the works of Shaikh Sahaswani, other biographers have not mentioned this. <em>(Tazkirrah al-nabula fi tarajim al-ulama p.239)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said Shaikh Sahaswani wrote many books, some which were lost and other unprinted. <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sahsawani’s student, Shaikh Abdul Baqi Sahaswani, who was also his student during his time in Bhopal and Delhi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He wrote many other treatises on the affairs of the Din which were attributed to some of his students.”</em> <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96)</em></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Death</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh felt ill whilst in Delhi and passed away on the 29<sup>th</sup> of Jumada al-Ula/ Thani 1326H / 29<sup>th</sup> June 1908c at the age of 74. He was buried next to his teacher Shaikh Allamah Sayyid Nazir Hussain, in the Shaidipura graveyard. <em>(Hayat al-ulama p.96).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hassani has yet made another mistake in his biographical entry for Shaikh Sahaswani where he says that he died in 1323H. <em>(Nuzhah al-khawatir 8:438)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Salafis and Ahl al-Hadith lost a great scholar who truly answered the grave worshipping innovators. It is therefore without a doubt that Shaikh Sahaswani is considered and will be known as one of the scholars who subdued and kept them at bay.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Yahya Imam Khan Nawshahri said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was from the scholars of the Ahl al-Hadith who they all respected. It is a shame just as the learning places and institutions were deprived of someone to replace the scholars, it was the same case with Shaikh Muhammad Bashir Sahaswani, that there has been no one like him from Sahaswan or from the general Ahl al-Hadith”</em> <em>(Tarajim ulama hadith hindh 1:255)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah forgive him and shower him with her mercy, Amin</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alhamdullilahi Rabbil A’lamīn, Wasalatu Wasalam Ala Rasūlillahil Karīm,  Wa Ba’d</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The subject of Jinn possession has been historically documented in the Sirah of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam which is full of wisdoms for this ummah to benefit from. However, in recent times there has been a spout of detractors, a rejuvenated modernistic cult who have incoherently uttered vague and inconclusive weak transmissions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a very sad occasion because these detractors have claimed that there is no such teaching as jinn possession in the clear Quran and Sunnah. It is shocking to the say the least that these individuals have demonstrated a primitive mindset with flagrant loose remarks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Needless to say, the Qur’an is clear and shall always be, the clarity is in this glorious book and the Sunnah of the prophet Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam however it is with great regret that these shameless individuals who proclaim the nobility of the Qur’an have constricted themselves to a madhahib.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people are in clear contradiction who rigidly follow their respective madhab blindly and thereby side stepping the manhaj of the Prophet Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some Mu’tazilites and Jahmites essentially denied the existence of jinns altogether whereas some Mu’tazilites like al-Jabba’i and al-Razi denied jinn possession. [Aydah al-Dalalah Fi Umum al-Risalah from Majmu’a al-Fatawa [19:9-65].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fakhr al-Razi explicitly denies jinn possession and also quotes Jabbai and then offers his explanation [Tafsir al-Kabir [7:88-90]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As does Zamakshari in his al-Kishaf [1:399]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is important to note here is that Imam Abul Hasan al-Ash’ari, those who the modern day Ash’arites and flagrant Kullabites attach themselves to cited an Ijma ie consensus of the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah believing in jinn possession!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These modern, well we do not even know what they are upon and believe because we have just cited the position of Imam Abul Hasan al-Ash’ari on jinn possession. This is also followed up by the position of an 11<sup>th</sup> century Ash’ari Shafite theologian, Muhammad bin Ei’lan al-Siddiqi [1057H].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another Hanafi scholar of the 8<sup>th</sup> century also cites the consensus mentioned by Imam Abul Hasan al-Ash’ari and authored a specific book on the Jinn, he is Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Ashbili al-Hanafi [799H].  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Without further digression, lets discuss the issue in detail and address this in light of the Qur’an and Sunnah, by the will of Allah Almighty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>EVIDENCE FOR JINN POSSESSION FROM THE QURAN</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“</strong><strong>Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by shaytan into insanity.” [</strong><strong>Surah Al-Baqarah:275]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Qurtubi said in explanation of this ayah, <em>&#8220;This ayah is an evidence against the people who reject and deny jinn possession and its evil affects, or those who believe a jinn cannot enter a human and roam through his body and rather they say he just has a medical illness.”</em> [al-Jam’e Li Ahkam al-Quran [3:255 no.12] also Mukhtasar Tafsir Qurtubi [1:210] of Basam Ni’mah]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Tabari said in explanation of this ayah, <em>&#8220;The people who consume interest will rise in their graves in the hereafter like the person who has been beaten by satan into insanity ie shaytan chases after him and destroys his mind.&#8221;</em> (Jam’e al-Bayan an-Ta’wil al-Quran (3:101)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Kathir said, <em>“It Means the one who consumes interest will rise up from their graves on the Day of Judgement just like the person who has been possessed by a shaytan, who renders him insane meaning that he stands in a strange and peculiar way in a fit of madness. Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Ibn Abbas said, “One who devours interest will be resurrected on the Day of Judgement insane in a suffocating form of madness.” Ibn Abi Hatim also said that similar commentaries were narrated from Awf ibn Malik, Sa’id ibn Jubair, al-Suddi, al-Rabi Ibn Anas, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan.”</em> (Tafsir Ibn Kathir [1:326] refer also to Tafsir Ibn Abi Hatim [2:544]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Qutaibah said ie the person is insane as in the man is possessed (by shaytan ie jinn) [Tafsir Gharib al-Quran [pp.98]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Baghawi also mentioned the same explanation ie as if the person was possessed by a jinn. [Mu’allim al-Tanzil [1:340]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ulusi has also mentioned the same in his Ruh al-Bayan [3:49]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti also mentions the same in al-Darr al-Manthur Fi Tafsir Bi’l Maithur [2:102]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Rashid Rida also cited the same, he cites the statements of Ibn Atiyyah and Baidhawi with Abu Sa’ud agreeing with him. He also mentions that the mu’tazilah deny jinn possession and some Ahlus Sunnah. [Tafsir al-Manar [3:94-96]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan also mentioned the same is insanity due to jinn possession. [Fath Fi Maqasid al-Quran [2:138]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Shawkani also mentions the same in his Fath al-Qadir [1:338-339]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ali Sabuni the Ash’ari also cited the same [Safah al-Tafasir [1:174]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ali al-Sayas also mentions the same and says this is the position of Ahl al-Sunnah and answers those who disagree [Tafsir Ayat al-Ahkam [1:172]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr has alluded in his Fath al-Bari that disbelieving jinns are Shaytan’s meaning that when the word shaytan is used it means an evil disbelieving jinn. [Fath al-Bari [6:344] and [8:675]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>EVIDENCE FOR JINN POSSESSION FROM THE SUNNAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE NARRATION OF UMM ABAN</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Matar bin Abdur Rahman A&#8217;naq narrates that Umm Aban bint Warz&#8217;a bin Zar&#8217;a bin Amir Abdi, she mentioned to him whilst narrating from her father that her grandfather, Zar&#8217;a , <em>“She said my grandfather Zar’a went to the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and his son or nephew was with him and he was insane. He informed the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam his son or nephew was unwell and thus make du’a for him. At the time the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was with a delegation. The messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam brought himself close to the boy and asked him to turn around. He then proceeded to strike his back and he lifted his arms until the whiteness of his arm pits were visible. He Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam would say “Get out enemy of Allah, Get out enemy of Allah.” I later saw the child in a better state with his eyes in a normal state. I sat the child in front of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who called for some water for hium and wiped his facem then he prayed for him. After the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallm’s prayer there was none in the delegation better than him.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Transmitted by Tabarani, Haithami said, Tabarani transmitted this Hadith however no one else other than Matar narrates from Umm Aban. He also said Ahmad also narrated this hadith in his Musnad in summarized form, which Tabarani cited who said Hind bint al-Wazr’a is in the chain and no one other than matr narrates from her and the rest of the narrators are trustworthy. [Majma’a al-Zawa’id [9:2-3] also cited by Ibn Taymiyyah in Majmu’a al-Fatawa [19:57]. Also cited by Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi. Hafiz Ibn Hajr graded Umm Aban as acceptable ie (Maqbulah) See also Wahid Abdus Salam Bali’s, Waqayah al-Insan Minal Jinn Wa’l Shaytan [pp.57]. Hafiz Ibn Hajr has said no female narrator has been ever disparaged. [Refer to the generals books of Mastalah]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>THE NARRATION OF YA’LA BIN MARRAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah bin Numair narrates from Ya’la bin Marrah who said, “<em>I observed 3 incidences of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam that no individual has witnessed and neither will there be the possibility of any person witnessing such events. I travelled with the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and during the journey we saw a woman sitting beside a child. This woman approached the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and said that this child has been possessed for 7 years and as a result of this we are depressed. She also said that the child would experience 2 fits on a daily due to the possession. Upon hearing this, the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam requested to have the child brought close to him, he proceeded to open the mouth of the child and blew into it 3 times and then said “I am the worshipper of Allah, go away enemy of Allah.” He then returned the child to the lady and requested to meet them again upon our return from the journey in the same location. Upon our return the lady was sat waiting with 3 sheep, the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam asked “Where is the child?” the lady replied “I swear by him who sent you with the truth, we did not see his state change and then she presented the sheep to him. The messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said to me to take one and leave the others with the lady.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Transmitted by Musnad Ahmad [4:173], Darimi [1:15 no.18], Ibn Sunni [pp.299] Dalail al-Nabuwwah [no.294] of Abu Nu&#8217;aym, Dalail al-Nabuwwah [6:18-19] of Baihaqi, Mu’ajam al-Kabir of Tabarani [no.8347], Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah [11:488-496] with some very slight variation. However it should be noted that Yahya ibn Sa’id al-Attar is in the chain and he is weak and the narrator al-Masudi became confused before his death. Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned this in Majmu’a al-Fatawa [19:57-58]. Haithami said <em>“Ahmad transmitted it via 2 chains as did Tabarani. One being through Imam Ahmads chain whose narrators are Sahih”</em> [Majma’a al-Zawa’id [9:5-6]. Shaikh al-Albani cited a variation of it in his Silsilah al-Sahihah [no.485]. Imam Hakim also transmitted it in al-Mustadrak [2:617] via al-A’mash and graded the chain to be Sahih and Imam Dhahabi agreed. We have mentioned elsewhere Imam Hakims authentication and Imam Dhahabi agreeing with him alone is not sufficient unless supported by other scholars. This said, it is not an absolute principle and in every instance the chain shall be scrutinised. This authentication of the later two authorities is further supported by Hafiz al-Munziri who said its chain is good. [al-Targhib Wal-Tarhib [3:158]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The narration of Ya’la ibn Murrah in Imam Ahmads Musnad via Waki is with the following wording <em>“Once a woman bought her child to the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who was insane so he said “Get out enemy of Allah, I am the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam” and thus he was relieved of the Jinn. He further said the woman had 2 male sheep, dried curd (cheese) and fat, which she presented to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who said “Take the dried curd (cheese) and fat and 1 animal and return the other”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Ahmad 4:170-172], Haithami said its narrators are the narrators of the Sahih. [Majma’a al-Zawa’id [9:6]. al-Arna’ut graded this narration to be Sahih ie authentic in his verification of Zad al-Ma’ad [4:68]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ahmad has transmitted this report with a slightly different wording from Abdur Razzaq via Ya’la ibn Marrah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Asakir has transmitted a report from Usamah ibn Zaid RadiAllahu Anhu very similar to the wording of Ya’la ibn Marrah. [Akam al-Marjan Fi Ahkam al-Jan [pp.14]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>THE NARRATION OF JABIR BIN ABDULLAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Jabir bin Abdullah RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates <em>“We were travelling with the messenger of Allah on the expedition to Zat Al Raqa’a until we reached a placed called Harrah when a Bedouin woman came to them with her child and said to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. This is my son who is possessed by a Jinn. He replied bring him closer to me and open his mouth, she opened his mouth and the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam  put some saliva in his mouth and said “Go away oh enemy of Allah I am the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam he said this three times and then he said look after this child and nothing will possess him and nothing will return to him that will harm him.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Darimi [1:10], Haithami said, <em>“Tabarani cited in Al-Awsth and al Bazzar in summarized form and the chain contains Abdul Hakim bin Sufyan, Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned him without disparaging or criticising him and the rest of the narrators are trustworthy.</em>” [Majma&#8217;a al-Zawa’id [9:9] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE NARRATION OF UTHMAN IBN ABI AAS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was narrated that ‘Uthman bin Abul-‘As said, <em>“When the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam appointed me as governor of Ta’if, I began to get confused during my prayer, until I no longer knew what I was doing. When I noticed that, I travelled to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, and he said: ‘The son of Abul-‘As?’ I said: ‘Yes, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘What brings you here?’ He said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I get confused during my prayer, until I do not know what I am doing.’ He said: ‘That is Satan. Come here.’ So I came close to him, and sat upon the front part of my feet then he struck my chest with his hand and put some spittle in my mouth and said: ‘Get out, O enemy of Allah!’ He did that three times, then he said: ‘Get on with your work.’” ‘Uthman said: “Indeed, I never felt confused (during my prayer) after that.” </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Ibn Majah [no.3548]. Haithami said in Majma’a al-Zawa’id, <em>“The chain is Sahih and its narrators are trustworthy</em>.” Shaikh al-Albani authenticated in Sahih Sunan ibn Majah [3:185 no.2874]. Imam Bausairi said, <em>&#8220;This chain is authentic and its narrators are trustworthy.&#8221;</em> Also refer to Jam’e al-Usul [6:264]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Uthman ibn Abi Aas narrates, <em>“I went to the messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam “my memory used to be very good and then something possessed me and I am forgetting things”. So he Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam placed his hand on my chest and said “Oh Allah expel this shaytan from him” Thereafter I had no complaint of memory loss.</em>”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Muslim [no’s. 3, 22], Ahmad Musnad [4:218], Ibn Sunni [pp. 272], there is also a narration from Ubaid bin Rafa’h in the Musnad of Ahmad, Musannaf of Abdur Razzaq and in Ibn Abi Shaybah]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is also another variation of this narration, where Uthman bin Abi al-Aas said to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, <em>“Oh Messenger of Allah, the shaytan came between me and my recitation in the prayer.” The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, “This is a shaytan called Khinzab.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE NARRATION OF ABDUR RAHMAN IBN ABI LAYLA</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was narrated from ‘Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Laila that his father Abu Laila said, <em>“I was sitting with the Prophet </em><em>Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</em><em> when a Bedouin came to him and said: ‘I have a brother who is sick.’ He said: ‘What is the matter with your brother?’ He said: ‘He suffers from a slight mental derangement.’ He said: ‘Go and bring him.’” He said: “(So he went) and he brought him. He made him sit down in front of him and I heard him seeking refuge for him with Fatihatil-Kitab; four Verses from the beginning of Al-Baqarah, two Verses from its middle: ‘And your Ilah (Allah) is One Ilah (Allah),’ [2:163] and Ayat Al-Kursi; and three Verses from its end; a Verse from Al ‘Imran, I think it was: ‘Allah bears witness that La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He),’ [3:18] a Verse from Al-A’raf: ‘Indeed, your Lord is Allah,’ [7:54] a Verse from Al-Mu’minun: ‘And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allah, any other ilah (god), of whom he has no proof,’[23:117] a Verse from Al-Jinn: ‘And He, exalted is the Majesty of our Lord,’ [72:3] ten Verses from the beginning of As-Saffat; three Verses from the end of Al-Hashr; (then) ‘Say: He is Allah, (the) One,’ [112:1] and Al-Mu’awwidhatain. Then the Bedouin stood up, healed, and there was nothing wrong with him.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Ibn Majah [no.3549], Ibn Sunni [pp.298-299], Hakim said the hadith is Sahih and preserved, however Haithami said, <em>“Abdullah ibn Ahmad narrated it from and the chain contains Abu Janab who is weak, he would do a lot of tadlis. Ibn Hibban authenticated him and the rest of the narrators are the narrators of the Sahih’s”</em> [Majma’a al-Zawaʿid [5:115], Hafiz Ibn Hajr said, <em>“Abu Janab is Yahya bin Abi Hayyah who is weak and also a mudallis, a good narrator and there is speech concerning him and he also opposed his teachers in the chain. It is apparent there is a companion in the hadith and he did not mention his name or kunyah which is contradictory and indicative from the chain.”</em> [Fatuhat al-Rabaniyyah [4:42], Shaikh al-Albani graded it weak in his checking of the Sunan of Ibn Majah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE NARRATION OF ABDULLAH IBN MAS’UD</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is narrated that once Abdullah ibn Masʿud RadiAllahu Anhu recited some ayahs in the ear of someone inflicted or suffering and he regained consciousness. The Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam asked him, <em>“What did you recite in his ear?” He replied and said, “</em><em>Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?&#8221;. </em><em>So exalted is Allah , the Sovereign, the Truth; there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Noble Throne. </em><em>And whoever invokes besides Allah another deity for which he has no proof &#8211; then his account is only with his Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed. </em><em>And, [O Muhammad], say, &#8220;My Lord, forgive and have mercy, and You are the best of the merciful.&#8221; [Surah al-Mu’minun:115-118]. The Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, “If a person was certain (about Allah) recited it on a mountain it would perish.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Abu Nu’aym in Hilyah ul-Awliya [1:8], Ibn Sunni [pp.298], As does Hakim, Tirmidhi, Abu Ya’la, Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Mardawiyyah and Nawawi in al-Azkar [pp.120-121] all via Abdullah bin Lahiyyah who is weak. Haithami said, <em>“Transmitted by Abu Ya’la and Ibn Lahiyyah is in the chain who is weak, his hadith are hasan and the remaining narrators are the narrators of the Sahihs.”</em> [Majma’a al-Zawa’id [5:115], Hafiz Ibn Hajr said, <em>“This Hadith is Gharib, Tabarani transmitted it in his book al-Du’a, Ibn Abi Hatim in his Tafisr, however Uqaili said Abdullah ibn Ahmad bin Hanbal said his father (ie Imam Ahmad) said, “It is fabricated, it is a report of the liar.”</em> [Dhuʿfa al-Kabir [2:113], also cited by Dhahabi in al-Mizan [2:185]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Qayyim mentions his teacher and the Shaikh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah <em>“He would recite this ayah in the ear of the insane people. On one occasion he recited it and the possessing jinn said ‘Yes’ in a drawn out voice. So he took and stick and beat him on his veins on the side of his neck until his arm became fatigued the people thought the man was dead from the beating. During the beating the jiin cried out and said, “I love him.” Imam Ibn Taymiyyah said, “He does not love you.” It said, “I want to make Hajj with him,” He replied, “He does not want to make Hajj with you.” It said, “I will leave him in your honour.” He replied, “no, do so in obedience to Allah and his Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.” It said, “Then I will leave him,” The man person sat up and looked left and right and said, “Why did I come to the honourable Shaikh?” The people present said, “What about all the beating your received,” He asked, “For what would the Shaikh Beat me when I have not committed a sin?” He was not aware that he had been beaten. The Shaikh also used to treat people with Ayatul Kurdi and he used to order the possessed as well as the exorcist to read it often, alone with the Muwwadhatain.”</em> [Zad al-Ma’ad [4:67-68]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE NARRATION OF ABDULLAH IBN ABBAS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhu narrates from the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam that he supplicated for a child (inflicted with possession) and stroke his chest with his hand. [Majma&#8217;a [9:2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhuma also narrates a woman bought her child to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and informed him of him being inflicted with mental illness (Jinn possession) and is seized with fits every morning and evening and ruins our lives. The Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam put his hand on the child&#8217;s chest and supplicated for him. He immediately vomited and they found remnants of a black puppy which ran away. The child became well and then left.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Sunan Darimi [no.20] and Musnad Ahmad. Haithami mentioned that one narrator in the chain Farqad is weak however Ibn Ma&#8217;in and al-Ejli said he was trustworthy. Majma&#8217;a [9:2]. [Tabarani, Baihaqi and Abu Nu’aym have also transmitted it, refer also to [Khasais al-Kubra [2:290]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This narration that mentions the child vomited and there were remnants of a black puppy, this addition is not established with an authentic chain. However this narration being weak is not problematic as the issues seems exactly the same and thus reaches the level of Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>THE NARRATION OF IBN ABBAS FROM ATA BIN ABI RABAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Narrated &#8216;Ata bin Abi Rabah, Ibn `Abbas said to me, <em>&#8220;Shall I show you a woman of the people of Paradise?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This black lady came to the Prophet </em><em>Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</em><em> and said, &#8216;I get attacks of epilepsy and my body becomes uncovered; please invoke Allah for me.&#8217; The Prophet </em><em>Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</em><em> said (to her), &#8216;If you wish, be patient and you will have (enter) Paradise; and if you wish, I will invoke Allah to cure you.&#8217; She said, &#8216;I will remain patient,&#8217; and added, &#8216;but I become uncovered, so please invoke Allah for me that I may not become uncovered.&#8217; So he invoked Allah for her.&#8221; </em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The 11<sup>th</sup> century Ash’ari theologian, Muhammad bin Ei’lan al-Siddiqi [1057H] in his explanation of this narration clearly mentions there are two types of epileptic fits (1) due to an illness and (2) due to jinn possession. The later is established from the Quran itself based on the ayah, <strong>“</strong><strong>Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by shaytan into insanity.” [</strong><strong>Surah al-Baqarah:275] </strong>and the hadith in Musnad Ahmad of the mother who bought her possessed child to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam whilst he was travelling and he exorcised the jinn by asking it to leave. The mother offered some gifts in return. This type of possession should be cured through ruqyah by reciting ayah al-Kursi and the Muwadhatain. [Dalil al-Falihin Sharh Riyadh al-Salihin [1:125] <strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The word used in the hadith is epilepsy or convulsing fits. Hafiz Ibn Hajr explained this and said the wording of another hadith mention, <em>“The woman would say,</em> <em>“I fear the Khabith (evil Shaytan jinn) will expose/uncover me (ie the uncover my clothes during the fits and expose my private parts.)”</em>  [Fath al-Bari [10:115] and the hadith is from Musnad al-Bazzar [no.5073]</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE HADITH OF ANAS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Anas RadiAllahu Anhu is also an evidence of jinn possession, he narrates the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <em>“For verily shaytan (evil jinn) runs through the veins (of humans) like blood does.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Muslim [no. 2174], Adab al-Mufrad [pp.471 no.1288], Sharh al-Sunnah [14:404-405] of Baghawi, Musnad Ahmad [3:162, 285], Tahawi [1:29], Shu’bal Iman [5:321] of Baihaqi, Musnad Abu Ya’la [no.3470]</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, <em>“Verily shaytan (evil jinn) runs through humans just like blood flows&#8230;”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Bukhari [no.2035 2038, 2039, 3281], Fath al-Bari [13:159] Muslim [no.2175], Sharh Sahih Muslim [4:155], Sharh al-Sunnah [14:404-405], Abu Dawud [no.4994], Shaikh al-Albani graded the hadith in Sunan Abi Dawud as Sahih]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Some scholars have used this Hadith as evidence that Shaytan is an evil jinn can possess a human which is often the reason for mental illnesses and fits. According to Hafiz al-Haithami this Hadith clearly refutes the Mu&#8217;tazilah who deny and reject a jinn can posses a human. [Kitab al-Radud Ala Abatil [2:138]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The modern day jahmites and those who are bent in imitating the kuffar with their chains and dress code have relied on a statement of Qadi Ayad under the guise of the Maliki Madhab which is itself aberrant just because Qadi Ayad was learned of the Maliki Madhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Ayad said that the aforementioned hadith give an apparent meaning of vigilance in that shaytan is constantly and continuously engaged in attempting to beguile and misguide the human with his whisperings. Thus it seems as if shaytan is inseparable from man just as blood is constantly running through the body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However Qadi Ayad as part of the statement also said the apparent meaning of the hadith is that Allah ordained such power for shaytan for it to run through the human just as blood does. [Hashiyyah Sahih Muslim [4:193]   </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> There are numerous other ahadith which show the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam sought refuge in Allah from the evil Shaytan and it was not their whisperings only. He would recite supplications daily in his prayers which highlights how serious and concerned he was about the evil effects of evil Jinns. In fact he even fought with the jinns!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Narrated Abu Hurairah RadiAllahu Anhu, The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam once offered the prayer and said, <em>&#8220;Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, &#8216;My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.&#8217; Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated).&#8221; </em></span></p>

I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed devil, from his puffing up (nafkh), his spitting (nafth) and his evil suggestion (hamz). He (Amr) said: His nafth it poetry, his nafkh is pride, and his hamz is madness.</em>”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr said it is possible the entering of shaytan in the mouth is haqiqi ie real and as shaytan roams or runs through the human body, he does not over power him as long as he continues to make zikr of Allah. So when a person yawns he is not making zikr and thus shaytan overpowers him and enters into him in reality ie haqiqi. [Fath al-Bari [10:216]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Minawi said shaytan entering into him when he yawns and opens his mouth shaytan enters his stomach. [Faidh al-Qadir [1:404] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Muhsin al-Abbad said it is known that shaytan runs through the body of bani Adam and thus also enters into him. [Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud [27:437]</span></p>

I then came to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and informed him of it. He asked: Is it only this?

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are numerous reports from the great Imams of this Ummah who would expel jinns from people. There are reports from Imam Ahmad [See Tabaqat Ashab Imam Ahmad of Qadhi Abu Ya’la and also Akam al-Marjan [pp.15] of al-Ashbili]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Hamid Fiqhi said, <em>&#8220;When we known Jinns have no form and invisible, then possessing a humans body is not something that is inconceivable by the way of intellectually and textually. This is because a minute or something small can enter into something bigger. Examples of this are air which penetrates our body, fire reaches in the inner core of something and electricity passes through a wire. The position of the people of truth is to accept these texts which transmit and thus allude to Jinns entering the human body. There are an overwhelming number of textual evidences which can not be ignored or abandoned just for the sake of the futility of those who deny and reject this (ie Jinn possession). There are so many incidences of Jinns entering the human body and eyewitness account that enumerating them would be extremely difficult. Thus, those who deny this reality and such accounts effectively refute and rebuke their own statements themselves.”</em> [Radud Ala Abatil [2:135]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Wahid Abdul Salam Bali said there are so many evidences on this issue and an overwhelming amount of statements from the people of knowledge that only an arrogant and argumentative person would deny them. [Waqayah Al-Insan Minal Jinn wal-Shaytan [pp.56-68]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Qayyim mentions that convoluting fits are of two types and that one of them is due to roaming evil Jinns [Tibb Nabawi [pp.51]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Qayyim goes on to describe the biological causes. He says, “<em>Regarding madness due to humors (akhlaa<u>t</u>), it is a sickness which partially prevents the limbs from feeling, moving and straightening out. It is caused by a viscous, sticky humor partly blocking pores inside the brain, resulting in a fractional inhibition of sensory influence and movement within it and within the limbs. Or it could be from other causes. For example, it could be from the trapping of a viscid odor in the outlets of the spirit, or from the rising of bad gases to the brain from some of the organs…causing the brain to contract in order to ward off the pain. This is followed by convulsions and twitching in all the limbs. The man is not able to remain upright but falls down, and froth usually appears in his mouth. This illness is considered among the periodical sicknesses relative to the [short] time frame of its painful occurrence. It is also considered among the chronic illnesses relative to the long period of its presence and the difficulty of curing those afflicted, especially beyond the age of twenty-five. It is an illness of brain matter, and such a form of epilepsy is persistent. As Hippocrates said, “Epilepsy remains in such persons until death.”</em> [al-Tibb al-Nabawi [pp.55]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Qayyim also said, <em>“There are two types of Jinn’s possession of human beings,</em> <em>Possession caused by earthly malicious spirits ie jinns</em> <em>and the other caused by filthy mixtures.</em> <em>As for the second type, it is the domain of physicians to find what causes it and how to treat it.</em> <em>Concerning the possession by spirits, the knowledgeable persons among them acknowledge its existence and do not deny it. They also admit that its treatment should be by confronting the celestial, benevolent and honorable spirits with that wicked and malicious ones to ward off the evil they cause and forestall their acts. This is even stated by Hippocrates in some of his books, as he mentioned some cures for possession. However, he said that his cure is only beneficial in case of possession caused by mixture of filthy blends, but not for that caused by evil spirits.</em> <em>Whereas, ignorant, worthless and disreputable physicians deny the possession by spirits and do not admit that they affect the body of the possessed person relying on no evidence to support their claims. They are only ignorant, as there is no medical proof to prove the impermissibility of this matter. The Jinn’s possession of human beings is an established fact and reality attests to it. However, the physicians’ denial of possession and ascribing this to the occurrence of some filthy blends is partially, not completely true.</em> <em>Ignorant and atheist doctors started to attribute the possession of human beings as caused only by filthy blends, but anyone with the least knowledge of such spirits and how they affect the body of the possessed will be astonished at the ignorance of such people and the weakness of their perception of such matters.”</em> [Zad al-Ma’ad Fi Hadi Khair al-Ibad [4:67-69]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah mentions some of the reasons why jinns possess humans, <em>“The occasional possession of man by the jinn may be due to sensual desires on the part of the jinn…or even love, just as it may be among humans.”</em> <em>He also said “Demonic possession sometimes also occurs as a result of horseplay, jest or plain evil on the part of the jinn, just as evil and mischief occurs among the humans for similar reasons.” He goes onto say, “However, possession is most often a result of the jinn being angry because some wrong has been done to them. Thus, the jinn punish those who wronged them. For example, when humans accidentally harm them or hurt them by urinating on them, by pouring hot water on them, or by killing some of them, the jinn think that they have been intentionally harmed. Although humans may not realize what they have done, the jinn are by nature very ignorant, harsh and volatile in their behaviour, so they may vengefully punish humans much more severely than they deserve.” </em>[See Majmu’a al-Fatawa [19:39]  Risalah al-Jinn [pp.31-32]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> Hafiz Ibn Hajr also mentions that convoluting fits are due to evil Jinns possessing the body and causing it harm. (Fath Al-Bari (10:114)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr also mentioned there are numerous evidences which allude to the harms and effects of jinn possession. [refer to Bazl al-Ta’un Fi Fazal al-Ta’un [pp.83].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said, <em>“The scholars of Ahlus Sunnah are unanimously agreed that a jinn can enter a human body.” </em>[Majmu’a al-Fatawa [24:276-277]. He uses as evidence Ayah of Surah al-Baqarah:275 and the Hadith of shaytan running through the body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah further said that Imam Abul Hasan al-Ashari said in his Maqalat Ahlus Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah that a jinn can enter and possess the a human being as Allah said <em>“</em><em>Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity.”</em> [Surah al-Baqarah:275]. [Majmu’a al-Fatawa [19:12]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdullah bin Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said, <em>“I said to my father, “People say a jinn cannot possess (ie enter) a human (body) and cause harm.” He replied, “Oh my son, these people lie and in reality it is shaytan himself who makes them say this (lie) (whilst possessing them).”</em> [Majmu’a al-Fatawa [24:227], Akam al-Marjan [pp.143-144]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are also reports from Imam Ahmad that he exorcised jinns [Refer to Laqt al-Marjan Fi Ahkam al-Jann  [pp.138]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Amr bin Ubaid said, <em>“Whoever denies and rejects jinns posses humans and enter their bodies he is an atheist.”</em> [Akam al-Marjan [pp.109]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah has devoted a great deal of research and writings on this subject and clarified in great detail of the reality and veracity of jinn possession and their affects. Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah has discussed this at length in his book <em>‘Aydah al-Dalalah Fi Umum al-Risalah’</em> which is incorporated in volume 19 of his Majmu’a al-Fatawa. It was published as a separate treatise titled ‘<em>Aydah al-Dalalah Fi Umum al-Risalah Wa’l Ta’rif Bi Ahwal al-Jinn</em>’ in Egypt with the verification of the late Egyptian scholar Shaikh Muhammad Shakir and this treatise is commonly known or often referred to <em>‘al-Risalah al-Jinn.’</em> Shaikh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah also discusses and touches on the subject in volume 35 of his Majmu’a al-Fatawa as well as his outstanding book, <em>‘al-Furqan Bayna Awliya al-Rahman Wa Awliya al-Shaytan.’ </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Hazm said, <em>“When Shaytan ie jinn enters a human he enters a state of insanity.”</em> [al-Fasal Fil Milal Wa’l Nihal [5:14]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Hanafi scholar, Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Ashbili al-Hanafi [799H] who we have cited above from his book authored a detailed book on this subject titled, <em>‘Akam al-Marjan Fi Ghara’ib al-Akhbar Wa Ahkam al-Jann.’</em> Just as Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned Imam Abul Hasan al-Ash’ari cited an ijma ie consensus of the Sunni scholars on jinn possession, al-Ashbili also cited the same consensus in his book. [Akam al-Marjan [pp.143]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Qastalani also believes in jinn possession and their evil effects. [al-Muwahid al-Ladunya Bi’l Manah al-Muhammadiyyah [3:448-449]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In current times before the recent immature outburst from those who have mocked the sacred sciences was Shaikh Ali Tantawi, he rejected and denied Jinn possession and no doubt this was probably due to the influence of Mu’tazilite theology which does not fall short of heresy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also again prior to another recent Nadwi outcry based on lack of knowledge of the sacred sciences and bold claims of knowledge and defence of the Hanafi madhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the Nadwis made this claim over 30 years ago and thus this erroneous notion and opposition to the Ijma, consensus of Sunni scholars spreading 1400 years is indeed a rejected and disparaged position which should be shunned and warned against as well as those who ignorantly promote this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are referring to the article of Dr. Muhammad Irfan which appeared in the Nadwa Journal dated 14:10:1407 where he alleged the word majnun ie madness has disappeared from the medical perspective, furthermore, that jinn possession and or the jinn entering a human and speaking through him is 100% wrong!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Aziz ibn Abdullah Baz refuted this notion and Shaikh Ali Tantawi’s position in his short epistle and treatise titled, <em>‘Aydah al-Haq Fi Dukhul al-Jinn Fi’l Insi Wa Radd A’la Man Ankara Zalik.’</em> The Shaikh Ibn Baz expounds the position and creed of Ahlus Sunnah in great detail with extensive evidences. The avid reader is advised to refer to it. [The epistle appeared in the al-Mujtama journal [Issue no.830], Dated: 12<sup>th</sup> Dhul Hijjah 1407H / 18<sup>th</sup> August 1987]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Aziz ibn Abdullah ibn Baz said, <em>“We have cited the evidences for jinn possession and the consensus of the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah  and the reader will clearly know the people who deny and reject jinn possession and that jinns can enter a humans body are upon clear error.”</em> [Majmu’a al-Fatawa [3:307].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad bin Saleh al-Uthaimin also mentioned the same as did Shaikh Saleh al-Fawzan [refer to Fatawa Islamiyyah and Muntaqa Fi’l Fatawa al-Fawzan]   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the reality based on textual evidences from the Quran, its Tafsir, the Hadith and from its explanation and from the statements of the scholars. There are an overwhelming number of evidences in this regard and due to time constraints we have kept this relatively brief and short.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The evidences outlined in this epistle show the true reality of the modern so called scholars and their actual knowledge of the Islamic sciences no matter how many books they have written or how many KGs they can lift. Lastly we advise to be careful who you take knowledge from and also who you promote as you will be responsible for any misguidance and deviation.     </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Alhamdullilahi Rabbil A’lamin, Wasalatu Wasalam Ala Rasoolillahil Karim,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Wa, Ba’d</strong></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>2) Ok the scholars state that the laypeople can take a ruling without un</strong></span><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>derstanding the reasoning behind it from a reputable scholar, isnt that similar to what the madhabs have done, ie the pious predecessors with their methodologies have derived rulings for all thinkable and unthinkable topic areas?</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> PART 4</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I think there seems to be an incorrect understanding with regards to this discussion. We say a normal lay or average person can ask Ahlul ilm or a scholar pertaining to any issue which the lay person then goes and acts upon.  With regards to this the scholars have differed whether this is taqlid or not.  Some have classed this as ittiba and they use the ayah which states ask the people of knowledge if you do not know.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is more accurate as this what the earlier Muslims did and no one use the word Taqlid and hence this is the reason you will not find the usage of this word in the first three generation. That a single one said to another go and do taqlid of so and so in all of their affairs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It could be argued the normal lay person does not need to know the reasoning behind the legal edict but this does not in anyway or form suggest the scholar does not provide evidence. It would be sufficient alone if he said Allaah says or The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said…</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This no longer remains taqlid, in this situation it is not necessary the for lay person to understand the intricacies of the evidence ie the Asbab an-Nuzool, Qate ud-Dalalah Aam, Khaas Raje Wal-Marjoo etc but what suffices and what is is important is that he knows and comprehends there is evidence from Allaahs book or the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The madhabs evolved in different ways, each very different from the next. What is also important to note these madhabs were not formulated during the eras of the Imams but years later, in fact 3 to 4 centuries later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Imams themselves would derive rulings from the Book and the Sunnah and this is an undeniable fact. However in the same instance these Imams applied their own individual ijtihad. In doing so they also applied and formulated some of their own principles and rule, each differing from the next.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore they based their rulings on some of these principles and rules. So now with all of these different rules and principles they differed with each other and so it is very possible they also made mistakes. So due to these principles and rules their understanding and attempting to reconcile the ahadeeth may have led them to err and make mistakes in their rulings. Numerous examples can be highlighted here and this would lengthen the discussion. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The main point is that the Imams as great and revered they were in terms of their knowledge and comprehension, were at the end of the day humans and made errors. We have not been obligated to follow their mistakes or errors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the principles they differed over include did the statement of a companion constitute evidence (Refer to al-Ahkam 4/210 of al-Amadi, Kashf ul-Asrar 2/100-10 of Nasafi, Minhaj al-Wasool (3/143 of Baidhawi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An example of this is the difference in how long a woman can remain pregnant for (ie the child remains in the mothers womb). For example Imam Abu Hanifah said a woman can remain pregnant only for 2 years and they use the narration of Aishah (RadhiAllahu Anha) in which she said the child only remains in the womb for 2 years (refer to Hidayah 2/32)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Imams, Malik, Shafi and Ahmad ibn Hanbal said this can last till 4 years. Walid ibn Muslim mentions that he narrated to Malik that Jamilah bint Sa’ad narrates from A’ishah (Radhi Allahu Anha), “A woman does not exceed 2 years of pregnancy.” Imam Malik said Subhanallah, who says this? The wife of Muhammad bin Ejlan remained in her mothers womb for 4 years. Shafi said Muhammad bin Ejlan remained 4 years in his mothers womb. Ahmad said the women of Banu Ejlan would remain pregnant for 4 years.” (al-Mughni 8/84-85 of Ibn Qudamah). And there are numerous examples.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The most comprehensive point in rebutting and expanding on this point is that if all the madhabs took from the Quran and Sunnah, why are there so many differences amongst them in these issues and we know this is a clear reality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will not go into the different usools the madhabs formulated for themselves and then differed with each other base don their understanding of the texts. The main problem here is that we accept the Imams took from the Book and the Sunnah, but what is obligated upon us ie the normal lay Muslims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then in later years their respective students modified the rulings of their respective teachers, and then they presented their own fiqh with the modifications. Then their students did the same and this continued over the years. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the scholars preserved the rulings of the imams so for example in the Hanafi madhab you might have three opinions ie one of Imam Abu Hanifah, one of Shaikh Muhammad Shaybani and another of Qadhi Abu Yusuf but the questions is what is the actual ruling and whose ruling was it and what evidence did they use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore it is possible the madhabs in their own way derived the necessary rulings for a whole host of issues based on their formulated principles. So firstly they differed with each other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Secondly who exactly made these principles and rules.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thirdly when we say the madhabs did this ie formulated or derived the rulings, yet again what is exactly meant by this?  Is this not following a way other than the Book and Sunnah even though they may have used the same sources for their extraction and interpretation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fourthly what does an individual do when he knows their madhab is going against the authentic hadeeth. This indeed is a burning question!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With regards to the rulings from the judge or Qadhis perspective the judgements of Qadhi Abu Yusuf are given more precedence over the verdicts of Imam Abu Haneefah because Qadhi Abu Yusuf studied with him as well as others before him. (Refer to Rasm al-Mufti pg.35 and Radd al-Mukhtar 1/71)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Kawthari the defender of the Hanafi madhab in his brief summary in answer to a point raised by Imam Juwainee essentially argued that the 4 Imams were not infallible or entirely certain with regards to the rulings. He said Imam Abu Haneefah remained silent and did not pass judgement on many issues. Imam Malik said regarding many issues that he did not know.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Shafi has 2 conflicting statements regarding one issue and he often also said the authentic Hadeeth was his position. None of these realities take away the status or rank of these Imams and this is because none of the Imams had all of the knowledge pertaining to the deen. (Summarised from Kawthari Hanafis Ahqaq al-Haq pg.22)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and famous about Imam Malik that whenever he did not know the ruling on an issue or topic ie he was unable to derive a ruling he would say I don’t know, la adri. The two well known scholars of the west, Imam Ibn Abdul Barr and Allamah Shatibi opined that if all of these instances were collated and compiled it would amount to a short treatise.(al-Muwafiqat 4/288).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So when we know and accept and even the staunchest of the muqallideen or muqallids and there is no one more deserving of this title than Kawthari Hanafi, that even he admits and accepts that the Imams did not have all the knowledge and they would clearly say I don’t know and then centuries later we are hell bent in trying to prove and establish the 4 Imams had enough knowledge to derive all the rulings even today. This is is especially so when the modern world has thrown us more challenges.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another important angle or aspect to consider and this is again another pivotal point, how many books did each of the 4 respected Imams leave. What books did Imam Abu Haneefah leave on Fiqh? Is Fiqh ul-Akbar or Fiqh ul-Absat really his books and if so were they on aqidah or Fiqh. Imam Malik left his Muwatta but is this a book of Hadeeth or is this a book of Fiqh? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">How many did Imam Shafi and Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal leave, can it be argued his book al-Musnad is a book of Fiqh or Hadeeth. How accurate and correct would it be to include the issues ie the ‘al-Masails’ his sons and students compiled by asking him questions as part of the Hanbali madhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already mentioned for example Imam Abu Haneefahs students who differed with him extensively but can we classify and add the books of his students within the rulings of Imam Abu Haneefah or the Hanafi madhab. For example Imam Shaybani’s al-Jami as-Saghir, al-Kabir, Kitab al-Asal and many more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Qadhi Abu Yusufs ‘al-Amwal’ and what do we say about his book ‘Ikhtilaf Abi Haneefah Wa Ibn Abi Layla’ can such a book highlighting Ibn Abi Layla’s differences with Imam Abu Haneefah be classed and included in the books of the Hanafi madhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, these Imams were indeed illustrious and pivotal in the derivation of issues of Fiqh but this alone was not sufficient as other sciences were not completed or were still on the early stages of formulation or progressive for example the sciences of Hadeeth, the biographical notes and science of praise and criticism. So therefore it is possible not all rulings were entirely accurate at the time they were made or they were made on weak narrations etc. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to this not all knowledge is just contained in Fiqh but rather also in other sciences and the Scholars and their students were possibly not proficient in all the sciences. This is what the late Deobandi Hanafi scholar Anwar Shah Kashmiri said, “Whoever thinks all the knowledge is contained within Fiqh and there is nothing outside of it, then he is far away from the truth.” (Faidh al-Bari 2/10).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So in light of this when we know there were many differences between the scholars and the scholars themselves admit to not knowing all the answers to some of the issues and when we know that not all the knowledge was contained just in Fiqh. How is it possible or feasible to hold on to a particular madhab or to say all the rulings contained within a madhab are correct and worthy to be followed. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another interesting point here and it is to be noted very well, that when the madhab of Imam Abu Haneefah was formulated, which was the first madhab and this students who differed with him in numerous issues contributed to the madhab, then if this was the case why was there a need for other madhabs to be established. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to the four main madhabs we also had the madhab of Imam Laith Ibn Sad, Imam Awzai, Imam Sufyan at-Thawri and Imam Sufyan, why were all of these madhabs formulated if they are also doing the same thing is deriving and establishing rulings from the book and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have also previously mentioned what does a madhab actually entail, whose madhab is a madhab? Let’s take the Hanafi madhab for example. The rulings that we have in the Hanafi madhab whose rulings are they exactly?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The people claim they are following the Hanafi madhab however the rulings and their derivation was not carried out by a single person say for instance only Imam Abu Haneefah but Imam Shaybani, Qadhi Abu Yusuf and Shaikh Zafar also contributed, in fact the common understanding is that a committee of 40 scholars was set up and they all collectively contributed towards the formulation and derivation of the legal rulings and edicts.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alhamdullilahi Rabbil A’lamin, Wasalatu Wasalam Ala Rasoolillahil Karim,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wa, Ba’d</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1.  Im interested in the statement that madhabs were enforced due to partisanship and not due to scholarly foresight or decision, can i gain further information to read up??</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Part 3</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example the author of Khulasatul Kaidani mentions, if someone does Raf ul-Yadain, says Bismillah loudly in the prayer, says Amin loudly in the prayer and points his finger in the tashahud, then all of these affairs are from those which are haram ie unlawful (ie invalidate the prayer.). (Khulasatul Kaidani pg.15-16).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It must also be noted on the title page of Khulasatul Kaidani it says, “How do you know how to pray if you do not know Khulasatul Kaidani.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly others have said raising the hands ie Raf ul-Yadain is makruh in the prayer ie is it prohibitively disliked (refer to Radd ul-Mukhtar 1/654 and at-Tatarkhaniyyah 1/562).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Other said it is makruh tahrimi and according to the Hanafi principles this means it is haram, ie it is haram to do raise your hands in the prayer ie Raf ul-Yadain whilst going and rising from ruku. (Refer to Badai as-Sanai 1/548 and Sharh al-Muniyyah pg.347 and Faidh al-Bari 2/257</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During the time of Shaikh Abu Hafs Kabeer the well known Hanafi scholar, a Hanafi man prayed behind someone and recited the Fatihah (in opposition to the hanafi madhab) behind the imam and he also raised his hands ie Raf ul-Yadain. When Shaikh Abu Hafs found out he went and complained to the ruler of the time, who in turn ruled for the Hanafi man to be publicly lashed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people feeling sympathy for the Hanafi man approached Shaikh Abu Hafs and intervened and plead on his behalf. The Hanafi man eventually repented and hence was spared the publish lashing. (at-Tatarkhaniyyah 5/145)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Raising the hands was also the reason why the hanafis had animosity and hatred for Imam Bukhari. Imam Dhahabi mentions when Imam Bukhari began teaching the people, they would come to him and say the takbir for the iqamah once and also raise their hands ie Raf ul-Yadain according to the way of Ahlul Hadeeth. One of the Hanafi jurists Hareeth bin Abee al-Warqa thought this was causing discord and dissension in the community and hence began to oppose Imam Bukhari. (For more details refer to Siyar A’lam an-Nabula 12/465)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then we have Isa bin Abu Bakr bin Ayub who died in the year 624H, he was considered to be a scholar and prolific orator, he was also the ruler of Damascus for 8 years. Shaikh Mulla Ali Qari Hanafi said about him that he was of virtuous faith and a blessing upon the deen. Isa bin Abu Bakr was also responsible for writing a refutation of Imam Khatib al-Baghdadi and he falsely attempted to prove that Imam Ibn al-Jawzi was a Hanafi. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is said about him that he was so staunch and bigoted that his father said to him one day, “How have you adopted and accepted the madhab of Abu Haneefah when all of your family are Shafis. He replied, “Do you not wish that at least one member of your family becomes a Muslim!!!!” (al-Fawaid al-Bahiyyah pg.152) of Shaikh Abdul Hayy Lucknowi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And how about the scholar of the sub continent, Muhiy ud deen Muhammad bin Muhammad who died in the year 789H who was a staunch and bigoted Hanafi. It has been said about him that when he went on Hajj, he would do an umrah daily and finish the recitation of the whole Quran on a daily basis. However he would shun, criticise and abuse Imam Shafi and he would consider this to be a form of worship. (Shudhrat udh-Dhahab 6/310)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of these disgareements, quarrelling, argumentation, bigotry, staunchness, animosity and enmity all in the name of madhabs and blindly following them. It is these traits that led to the 4 separate musallahs in the first house of Allaah ie Ka’aba. Dear Muslims how is it conceivable that based on our pristine and beautiful religion about which the people of the book would envy us led to such sects and factions in the first house of Allaah whilst making the most important aspect of worship ie the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are also other differences in which they have shown extreme bigotry and scare monging tactics and thereby strongly refuting and rebuking the opinions of the other madhabs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For instance the one Hanafi elder and scholar, ie Shaikh Abdullah Balkhi said, “Whoever recites Fatihah behind the Imam, force soil into his mouth, and if not then break his teeth.” He also issued an edict that the one who recites fatihah behind the Imam then his is a fasiq and someone who does something haram. (Refer to Darr al-Mukhtar 1/544 and Fath ul-Qadeer 1/240) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What impression and understanding does this give to the hanafi muqallid with regards to the other madhabs and people who believe one must recite fatihah behind the Imam, how comfortable would they feel if they prayed in their masjid!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also what do we do about the positions of the other Imams and madhabs like for example Imams Shafi, Ibn Mubarak, Ishaq ibn Rahawaihah, Awzai, Abu Thawr, Bukhari and many others who heled the opinion that Fatihah should be recited behind the Imam. Are they worthy of soil being put in their mouths, their teeth being broken and fire put into their mouths??? Subhanallah, The Imams Bukhari and Baihaqi even wrote books on this topic obligating the reciting Fatihah behind the Imam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Unfortunately this is the result of blind bigoted partisanship and such opinions lead to this level of sectarianism which ultimately lead to discord, chaos and dissention in the Ummah and the end goal of all of this is that a Muslim is prohibited and restricted from following and obeying the Book and the Sunnah. May Allaah keep us upon the Quran and Hadeeth. Ameen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The well known historian and traveller of Spain ie Andalus Ibn Jubair who died in the year 614H. In the year 579H he travelled to Makkah and said, “From the Imams of Ahlus Sunnah (meaning some people were not from Ahlus Sunnah) the Shafis would pray first and they were the followers of the Abasid Imams and their place was at Muqam Karim, thereafter the Malikis would pray. However at the time of Maghrib due to the constraints of time all of them would pray with their own perspective Imams all at the same time (ie 4 imams all leading the Maghrib prayer.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This was very difficult as each individual would be very attentive to the sound and voice of their own mu’adhain and Imam. This is because they would hear 4 takbirs from the 4 Imams and the worshippers would get very confused and lost. Sometimes they would do ruku and sujud according to the takbirs of the hanafis, malikis, shafis and hanbalis and sometimes their own imam and sometimes they would say the Salam at the end according to another imams salutation etc.” (End of Ibn Jubairs words) (Rihlah Ibn Jubair 78)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers can you imagine what confusion and disorientation there would have been whilst trying to pray in such an atmosphere. In our daily lives it becomes difficult enough based on the background noise can you imagine what the atmosphere would have been like. What can be more of an example of partisanship and bigotry than this in the house of Allaah, this is what sectarianism and madhabism always eventually leads to and this is also the situation in our times. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is even more disturbing and worrying can you imagine what level of Khushu, Khudhu and concentration some of these worshippers must have had when they were praying in such an atmosphere, knowing very well the prayer would be the first thing to be judged on the day of judgement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In part of this series in relation to question no.4 where the questioner asks about hundreds and thousands of scholars refining and correcting a madhab from within. Indeed then this is nothing but a fallacy as most often the scholars continued to defend their madhab irrespective of the positions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example the issue of 4 imams leading prayers in a single masjid, an emiment Hanafi scholar Shaikh Mulla Ali Qari said in defence of this, “If there is an Imam for every madhab like there is in our time, then it is better to pray behind the Imam of your Madhab (only) whther he prays earlier or later. This is because the general Muslims and the majority of the believers from the Harmain, Quds, Misr and Sham have adopted and preferred this way and no attention is paid to those who oppose this.” (Radd al-Mukhtar 1/564) and Allamah Shami even goes onto give evidence for the permissibility of numerous jamahs in the Haram. (Radd al-Mukhtar 1/553)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And we have not even began to talk about the current day issues of bigotry and staunchness and if this was the case we would run into volumes. There have been cases of severe physical abuse upon people who changed from hanafis to Ahlul Hadeeth, masjids being destroyed and burnt, scholars being shot and injured, houses being burnt and destroyed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Masjids banning the Ahlul Hadeeth, washing the places where an Ahlul Hadeeth prayed Salah, breaking the Ahlul Hadeeths fingers whilst they supplicated with them in the tashahud etc. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Egypt an Imam did not recite the Bismillah loudly so someone during the prayer said your prayer is Baatil, so repeat your prayer. So the prayer was started again. Similarly the Shafis once prayed the fajr prayer behind the Hanafis and Malikis on jumuah and then they repeated the prayer only because the Hanafi imam did not recite Soorah Sajdah in the prayer. (Refer to the monthly journal al-Furqan April issue no.44 pg.55, 1994)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise Allamah Rashid Ridha mentions that, “A Hanafi from Afghanistan heard that a man whilst praying recited the Fatihah behind the Imam, so a person punched him so hard in this chest or stomach that he fell down in sheer agony, pain and nearly died from it. I have also been informed that someone broke a persons finger just because he was moving it during tashahud.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the last century the people of Tarbulus were engrossed in so much partisanship and sectarianism to such an extreme level that some of the Shafis went to the main mufti and asked him to divide the masjid into 2 halves one for us and one for the Hanafis because their jurists (ie the Hanafi faqihs) consider us to be Ahludh-Dhimmah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The issue of a Hanafi man marrying a Shafi woman also arose. Some argued that he cannot marry her because the Shafi woman says I am believer inshallah therefore she doubts her imam and others said he can marry her by reasoning and say she can be understood to be from the people of Dhimmah.” (End of his words) (Refer to Muqaddimah al-Mughni 1/18)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The late indian Hanafi scholar, Sayyid Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi has also cited the breaking of the finger whilst moving it during Tashahud by some the afghani tribes and he concludes the people only did this because this what they were taught ie that Khulasatul Kaidani teaches that is haram to move the finger in tashahud. (When The Waves of Iman Came pg.213-214 in the footnotes.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sha’arani said, “Most of the Muqallideen have very evil thoughts about the other Imams. It has been relayed to us that the Hanafis and Shafis of Wara Nahr abandon fasting in the month of Ramadhan so that they maintain their energy whilst refuting each others evidences and proofs.” (Meezan al-Kubra 1/43)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Taj ud din Subki (771H) said, “It is unacceptable to Allaah, the forcing of people to accept one madhab and the associated partisanship (tahazzub) in the subsidiary issues of the deen and nothing pushes this fervour and zealously except partisanship and jealousy. If Abu Haneefah, Shafi, Malik and Ahmad were alive they would severely censure these people and they would dissassociate themselves from them.” (Mu’eed an-Na’am Wa Mubeed an-Naqam pg.76)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This way of bigoted staunchness was not the way of the salaf, they still had mutual respect for each other and differing opinions. There are numerous examples from during the times of the companions who despite differences would still respect, listen and pray behind each other. Likewise and similarly if they saw or found someone from amongst their companions they would advise them by giving them evidences from the Quran and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To mention a few examples are for example Abu Talha (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) did not believe that eating ice broke the fast(refer to Musnad Ahmad 3/279 and al-Ahkam 6/83 of Imam Ibn Hazm)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and Abdullah Ibn Masood (RadhiAllahu Anhu) would place his hands between his knees during the ruku (Sahih Muslim 1/202).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) believed that the eyes should be open during the Ghusl of Janabah (refer to Zarkanis explanation of the Muwatta 1/92) and many many more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However they still had that respect and prayed behind each other. Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah mentions despite the differences between the companions and the successors they would still pray behind each other. (Refer to al-Fatawa al-Kubra 2/380).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same applied to the scholars and Imams of this Ummah. For example Imam Ahmad’s opinion regarding normal bleeding was that it invalidate a persons wudhu and so he was asked if an Imam, the one leading the prayer started to bleed and he did not repeat his wudhu, would you pray behind him? Imam Ahmad replied, “How can I not pray behind Imam Malik and Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyab (who believed normal bleeding did not invalidate the wudhu.” (al-Fatawa al-Kubra 2/381 of Ibn Taymiyyah and Hujjatullah al-Balighah 1/159 of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And also For example Qadhi Abu Yusuf once bathed in such a bath area and led the prayer in the Friday prayer, later he found out the the well the water was supplied from a well that had a dead mouse in it, upon this he said, “So we take the statement of our brothers from the people of Madinah that when the water is equal to 2 qullas it is not impure.” (Fatawa al-Bazaziyyah cited from Hujjatullah al-Balighah 1/159)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Liewise Qadhi Abu Yusuf once prayed behind the Khaliph Harun Rashid who had hijama cups attached to him and he lead the prayer and he did not repeat his wudhu according to the opinion of Imam Malik. Qadhi Abu Yusuf did not repeat the prayer. (al-Fatawa al-Kubra 2/380)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This has also led to various scholars of the differend madhabs belittling and hurling abuse to the Scholars who they thought belonged to other madhabs. Citing examples would lengthen this discourse which beyong the scope of it, One such example is when Shaikh Anwar Shah Kashmiri Hanafi Deobandi refers to Imam Baihaqi as a mutassub ie  abigoted individual. (Refer to his Faidh al-Bari 1/58, 301)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These are some of the consequences and means by which certain madhabs were forced amongst the communites. We pray that Allaah saves us from such staunch blind bigotedness. Ameen</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By the two who are in need of the Mercy of his Lord, may Allah forgive us</span></p>
