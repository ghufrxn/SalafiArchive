<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-8636-1" width="618" height="348" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="http://www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/abdhaqq1.mp4?_=1" /><a href="http://www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/abdhaqq1.mp4">http://www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/abdhaqq1.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This is the audio of the conversation between Abu Khuzaimah Ansari and Abd al-Haqq b. Shaykh Muhammad Ra&#8217;is Nadwi.</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Read <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/answering-the-lies-of-zulfiker-ibrahim-memon-the-deceiving-kazzab-and-the-clear-deception-of-abd-al-haqq-b-shaykh-muhammad-rais-nadwi/">THIS</a></span> document as it is associated with the discussion at hand</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>First Point</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon and his blind following team, like <strong><em>Wali ud Din Durrani</em></strong> from Australia, <em><strong>Abu Habibullah Somali</strong></em> from London, <em><strong>Uzayr Nazir</strong></em> from Nottingham (currently studying with Ikhwanis in Jordan), <em><strong>Umar Farouq Abul Baihaqi</strong></em>, and the rest of the motley crew, after three (3) unsuccessful attempts in complaining to YouTube to remove this audio conversation, were at last successful on the fourth (4th) attempt. These are men of this Ummah who call themselves Salafis. They spread videos and audios about Abu Khuzaimah and when SRI responded, they were unable to handle the truth and the true reality of their Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon and had to complain to YouTube like crying little babies, as if they had lost their dummies. If you can&#8217;t handle the truth, stop lying.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Second Point</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They said the conversation with Abd al-Haqq was recorded without his permission. We say, so what! It is permissible when you know someone lies and in order to clarify the truth to expose the ardent liars. Let us ask you, and we challenge you on this, when the questioner asked Shaikh Wasiullah Abbas Hafidhahullah Ta&#8217;la the questions about Abu Khuzaimah, did he seek permission or did he secretly record the Shaikh. Please answer this? Yet you still uploaded that audio conversation on social media. This is another contradictory lie of these openly deceptive liars, following in the footsteps of their spiritual pir, the one who was unable to shake off the disease of the Deobandiyyah, Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Third Point</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was these deceptive liars, Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon and his merry men, who spread and initiated these points on social media and they were the ones who dishonoured our  Shaikh Wasiullah Abbas. Yet again, they had no concern for Salafiyyah but rather aided Ahl a-Bid&#8217;ah, why? Because none of them know the principles and qawaid of Da&#8217;wah Salafiyyah and the people of Hadith</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fourth Point</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon released another audio of Shuayb Junagarhi, as if it was some sort of defence of Zulfiker&#8217;s despicable, evil and vile behaviour of coercion, intimidation, bribery, pressure and forcing a bayan. Listen carefully and read carefully, no one said Shuayb Junagarhi said, rather it was said that it was found out via his route that he called Abd al-Haqq. As for his response, then direct it to Abd al-Haqq who said that SHUAYB JUNAGARHI SAID TO HIM ZULFIKER IBRAHIM MEMON WAS AN AGGRESSIVELY EMOTIONAL PERSON. These people are so ignorant and blinded from the truth, they clearly heard Abd al-Haqq say this himself, yet they shift the blame to others. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Abd al-Haqq was already aware that Zulfiker was spreading this about him as he was shown the evidence way before. It was Zulfiker himself who was spreading this about Abd al-Haqq that he hits his mother, he is not reliable with money, he has mental issues, he was dropped as a child. etc. MANY brothers in the UK can confirm this and it is well known that Zulfiker told numerous people and now that both parties have been caught lying through their teeth, red handed with clear unequivocal audio proof, they have started the deniability and blame someone else game. In fact some brothers, knew that Abd al-Haqq was a liar and did not want to even converse with him. He is no doubt the unfortunate victim in all of this due to the deception and cunning behaviour of Zulfiker, he seriously exploited Abd al-Haqq&#8217;s financial situation. Zulfiker will not spare anyones honour, he will degrade and attack you and your families honour, sooner or later. Stay away from this evil disgusting dajjalic devil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fifth Point</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These immature and ignorant individuals, full of bravery and the courageous men that they are resorted to (a) posting on Facebook under their wives names (b) made fake profiles like &#8220;Pedro Synco&#8221; in order to make a mockery and fool of themselves, and where are you now O Pedro! (c) made profiles with generic names like Ahl al-Hadith and attempted to answer the points.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sixth Point</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people, have tried to take advantage of the open refutation and exposition of this disgusting dajjalic devil, Zulfiker Memon and have made websites trying to refute Zulfiker. The truth is that many people hate and despise Zulfiker and so many people will do whatever it takes to expose this evil individual because he has attacked their honour and their families. He coerced and manipulated money out of people, stole books and manuscripts. Zulfiker Memon, the pir, the one who has not fully left his Deobandism. Salafi Research Institute and its members refute Zulfiker openly and behind close doors with their real names and identities, they have done this publicly, on social media, in written form and audio form, they are not scared neither do they shy away from the filth of this evil individual. The same people who accuse Salafi Research Institute and Abu Khuzaimah of being behind these websites are desperate to pin anything on him, when they themselves are Pedro Syncho and Pellawon on social media going on ruthless like rabid puppies. Where is Zulfiker in all of this, well not a single squeak from the grand pir and &#8220;sheikh&#8221;. Also, when we make a website on Zulfiker, we will let you know, trust me.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>[3]</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Imam Muhammad Fakhir Za’ir Ilabadi</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>1120H-1164H</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(1708c-1751c)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari </strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His full name is Muhammad Fakhir and known as Za’ir, the son of Shaikh Muhammad Yahya. His title is as ash-Shaikh al-Alim al-Kabir al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir bin Muhammad Yahya bin Muhammad Amin al-Abbasi Ilabadi. (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence is Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir bin Shaikh Muhammad Yahya Ilabadi. (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.334)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had two brothers, one was Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Ilabadi who was a reputable scholar of the Din. His maternal grandfather was Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi, whose lineage could be traced back to Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhu).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find that Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was from a family of learning who valued and gave Islamic education great importance. The family were known amongst the people for their knowledge and attachment to the sacred Islamic sciences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From an early age Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir started learning from his father, grandfather and older brother and benefited greatly from them. It led him to acquire knowledge quickly and thereby becoming highly proficient and competent in the sacred Islamic sciences. (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>A Brief Overview of his Family</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(1) His father; Shaikh Muhammad Yahya Ilabadi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a major scholar of his day and the author of <em>Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram</em> praised him by saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was an ocean of knowledge in the sciences, once that sent waves of this knowledge resounding with the people and he authored a number of books and treatises.” (</em>Ma&#8217;athir Al-Kiram (2:218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had three sons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(i) Shaikh Muhammad Tahir</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(ii) Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(iii) Shaikh Shah Muhammad Hasir Afsali</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All three sons and father were keen poets and enjoyed poetry.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(2) His grandfather; Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No detailed information could be obtained regarding his biography.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(3) His brother; Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Ilabadi (b.1110H &#8211; d.1143H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the older brother of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir, he was a person of knowledge and virtue, Shaikh Muhammad Ra&#8217;is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was upon the Salafi Madhab and an Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith just like his brother as we find from his writings.&#8221;</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.193)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hasani said he was well aware and acquainted with the Madhabs of the Salaf and Khalaf and that his brothers sought knowledge from him. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:332-333 no.615)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Seeking the Knowledge of Hadith from Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi [1163H]</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir studied with Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi in the year 1149H when he travelled to the 2 sanctuaries and visited Madinah. At the time Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami was also studying with Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi and hence both were of similar stature in terms of their sittings. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339-340), Taqsar Junud al-Ahrar Min Tazkar Junud al-Abrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Fakhir studied and read <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em> on Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi to the extent that he gained great credibility and heights which conjured up immense love for Hadith in his heart, such was the case that he became rigid and firm on the Quran and Hadith his whole life. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.141)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi also gave him Ijazah for the two Sahihs as well as other books. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349), Sarwar Azad (p.213), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.141)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Under the Tutelage of Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir studied with Shaikh Azad Bilgirami, as another beneficial point it is sufficient to note that Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlavi also studied under Shaikh Azad Bilgirami, meaning that Shaikh Azad Bilgirami was a teacher of both of them however their period of study was different. (Sarwar Azad (p.213+), Itihaf an-Nabula (p.406-407), Ma&#8217;arif (22:339)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Stay in The Two Blessed Sanctuaries</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir had special love for the 2 blessed lands and hence for the purpose and intent of seeking and consolidating his knowledge he remained there for a few years. During this period, he performed 2 Hajjs. After returning to India, he intended to perform his third Hajj in the year 1154H and whilst he set out, some goons captured him near Surat and stole all of his belongings except his books and eventually gave him a ride to the city of Surat. (Sarwar Azad (p.214), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He attempted to perform Hajj again in the year 1156H and whilst travelling by ship, the journey was short lived due to ship wreck. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir ended up residing in Bandar Faha for a few days and then eventually reached his destination of Hijaz safely in the same year and then finally returned back to India in 1159H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In one of his journeys to Hajj he returned with an edition of <em>Sahih Muslim</em>, which was copied by Mawlana Ruh al-Amin Khan, which is preserved in Habin Ganj library. (Ma&#8217;arif (23:91-92), Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349), Sarwar Azad (p.214), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335, 340).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After seeking the traditional knowledge and sciences he began to teach his students with great vigour and fervour. He was known to have reached the status of being a Muhaddith at a very young age and thus a large number of people benefited from his knowledge and understanding.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This can easily be deduced and understood from the fact that when Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan sent Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati to study with Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlavi, he later sent him to Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir to seek knowledge of Hadith and its sciences. This clearly shows Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was a great scholar of Hadith of his era and was highly proficient as a Hadith master.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From his students were his two sons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Shaikh Qutb ud-Din (1187H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(2) Shaikh Muhammad Ajmal (1236H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and also</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Shaikh Qadhi Thanullah Pani Pati (1225H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Shaikh Murtaza Bilgirami (al-Zabidi) (1205H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Shaikh Ghulam Haidar Khan Kakawri (1252H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(6) Shaikh Ghulam Safdar Khan (1283H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(7) Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi (1234H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(8) Shaikh Muhammad Nasih</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(see Mashahir Kakawri (p.300), Tazkirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140), Siratul Bukhari (p.37-38).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Shaikh Qutb Al-Din bin Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir (b.1138H &#8211; 1187H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the Shaikhs eldest son, and was often responsible for teaching the people as well delivering regular lessons, he essentially took over his father’s role in teaching, more so when his father would travel to perform Hajj. He has been mentioned with great virtue with regards to his command of the various sciences and disciplines, especially the knowledge of <em>Fiqh</em> and its principles ie <em>Fiqh</em> and <em>Usul al-Fiqh</em> and other areas of learning. He died while he travelled to Makkah to perform Hajj and was thus buried there. He also authored some books. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:235-236 no.437).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra&#8217;is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was upon the way of his father and uncle, on the Madhab of Ahl al-Hadith.&#8221;</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.192)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The affect of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir on his students was so profound that it was manifest in their writings. This was more so in adhering and abiding by the ahadith and rejecting any form of blameworthy and rigid staunch Taqlid which is prevalent with the muqallidin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An example of this is what Shaikh Qadhi Thanullah Pani Pati said in his will, in that Surah Fatihah is to be recited after the first takbir and opening supplication even though he is famously attributed to the hanafi madhab. (<em>Wasiyat Nama</em> printed with <em>Majmu&#8217;a Wasaya</em> Number 4 (p.146).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi (1234H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi authored a book on raising the hands in the prayer titled, <em>&#8216;Nur Al-Aynayn Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain.&#8217;</em> This maybe an addendum to his Shaikh work or his own personal work and Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is said about him that he was exemplary and unmatched in speaking the truth and being vocal in this and he spent a large part of his life strictly following the Quran and Hadith and adhering to the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says in one place in his book, <em>&#8216;Nur Al-Aynayn Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain&#8217;,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When I have obeyed and followed the Messenger of Allah </em><em>ﷺ</em> <em>I am totally unconcerned with the statements of Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Sufyan ath-Thawri and Imam at-Zuhri.&#8221;</em> (Tarajim Ulama Hadith (p.383), Tazkirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (pg.142), Siratul Bukhari (p.37-38)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Will</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was firm and strong in adhering to the Quran and Sunnah and thus vehemently abhorred grave worship and so he willed that he was to be buried next to Shaikh Abdul Latif in Burhanpur. This was due to the fact it was only his grave that was not venerated and worshipped. Hence, according to his wish he was buried next to Shaikh Abdul Latif.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Status and Position</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was a mujtahid, a Salafi and not a muqallid. We find by looking at his books that he was undoubtedly an Ahl al-Hadith and refrained from doing Taqlid of anyone. He was a mujtahid in his own right and this supported by the statement of Shaikh Abdul Hay al-Hasani which is to proceed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah blessed Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir with a great station and status.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He studied with numerous teachers and began teaching at the tender age of 20. He achieved the title of Shaikh. He then went to Haramayn Sharifayn in 1149H to perform Hajj and Umrah. He visited The Prophets Masjid and eventually sought knowledge of hadith and other disciplines from the Shaikh of the Shaikhs, Muhammad Hayat Sindhi and eventually returned back to his native land. He would visit Haramayn Sharifayn numerous times.”</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh (p.195)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Author of Risalah Najatiyyah of Shaikh al-Fazil Al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir with the title of Za&#8217;ir Ilabadi.&#8221;</em> (Ittihaf an-Nabula (p.84) Also refer to Intiqad at-Rajih (p.84), Taqsar Junud al-Ahrar Min Tazkar Junud al-Abrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At another instance Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He detested venerating the holy men ie the pirs and he would write in refutation of them. He would encourage adhering to the Quran and Sunnah. It is sufficient testimony for Shaikh Muhammad Fakhirs trustworthiness and uprightness that Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan and Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami bore witness to his great virtue, immense noble character and extensive knowledge.&#8221;</em> (Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said at another place,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was the Imam of the Imams of the followers of the Sunnah in India and he was from amongst the Shaikh of the Shuyukhs from the major and well known scholars.&#8221;</em> (Taqsar al-Junud al-Ahrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ismail Salafi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is apparent from the authors poems that he was a fearless caller to Tawhid and the Sunnah, and at the same instance he would rebuke the customary staunch bigoted Taqlid. This would inevitably lead to some harshness but nonetheless he was very intelligent and the scholars would respect him highly.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Azad Bilgrami said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan said, &#8220;I have seen many notable people but after 11 hundred years I saw the likes of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir and I found him to conform and agree with the Quran and Sunnah.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram Fi Tazkirrah Ulama Bilgiram (2:218), (Sarwar Azad (p.218), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.337)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He (ie Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan) would would visit me with respect but with Shaikh Fakhir he was even more respectful and humble.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan would go to visit Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir Ilabadi himself which was not the norm for him.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati praised Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir with the following words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ash-Shaikh al-Ustadh Muhammad Fakhir al-Muhaddith Rahimahullah said that it was unlawful to make a masjid next to a grave whilst deducing from the Hadith of Abi Lahaij in Sahih Muslim.&#8221;</em> (Tafsir Mazhari (6:23)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati undoubtedly, was a non staunch open minded Hanafi Scholar searching for the truth such that the current day Hanafis would not bat an eyelid except to shun and ostracise him and label him as a pseudo Hanafi as the word pseudo is often used and accustomed on the tongues of the bewildered retractors. So despite this Shaikh Thanullah Pani Pati would would still have great respect for him despite him being an Ahl al-Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whereas in our times it is the total opposite and the present day Hanafis have left the teachings and mindset of their forefathers and abuse the Ahl al-Hadith. (Refer to Nur us-Sunnah (p.5-6)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Abdul Hayy al-Hasani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ash-Shaikh Al-Alim Al-Kabir Al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir bin Muhammad Yahya bin Muhammad Amin Al-Abbasi al-Salafi Ilabadi, one the well known and famous scholars.&#8221;</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349 no.641)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;All the people were agreed in praise of him and his noble characteristics, he was someone who was referred to in such affairs. He did not restrict himself to only one specific madhab nor did he do taqlid of anyone in the affairs of the Din rather he followed the texts of the Quran and Sunnah and did Ijtihad which he was well qualified and capable to do.&#8221;</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:350)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Atthar Mubarakpuri said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was a major Muhaddith of his era.”</em> (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is Nadwi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“…We can see just from the titles of his books that it is apparent he was Ahl al-Hadith and upon the Salafi Madhab, he would openly say he was an Ahl al-Hadith and would spread the Manhaj of Ahl al-Hadith…..In summary, this Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith of the twelfth century, who was accepted and praised by whose who were not from the Ahl al-Hadith. The Imam was an outspoken, formidable and fervent propagator of the Madhab of Ahl al-Hadith, coupled with the fact that he was accepted by both the Ahl al-Hadith non Ahl al-Hadith, thus it is not impossible a large group of the muqallidin did not adopt and change to the Madhab of the Ahl al-Hadith due to the arduous efforts of this Imam of Ahl al-Hadith.”</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.196)     </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Allamah Azad Bilgrami&#8217;s (1294H) Praise for Imam Muhammad Fakhir.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Azad Bilgrami wrote a poem in Farsi on the death of Imam Muhammad Fakhir&#8217;s in respect of him and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was known as Za&#8217;ir (in the poets circles) and his name was Muhammad Fakhir, the son of Shaikh Muhammad and the grandson of Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi, and we empowered the three, he assumed the role of the Musnad of his elders. In doing so he was very noble, virtuous and reached a high rank as well as having lofty characteristics.&#8221;</em> (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>An Expert Master in the Sciences</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was an excelled master in the Islamic principles and far ahead in the sciences of texts and their comprehension from his counterparts, this was also applicable to some of the scholars prior to his era.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir excelled and was a specialist in Hadith and its various sciences as well has having the rank of a mujtahid in issues of <em>fiqh</em> ie jurisprudence.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Writings and Works</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir authored a number of treatises. The Hanafite biographer, Shaikh Abdul Hayy said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He authored a number of books in spreading the Sunnah.”</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:350)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">some of them are</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(1) Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqa&#8217;id Al-Hadithiyyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the scholars referred to this book as <em>Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqa&#8217;id Al-Athariyyah</em>. There is probable cause for this as Imam Muhammad Fakhir authored this book on the methodology Ahl al-Hadith and hence the Athari creed. It has only been printed twice and Walillahil Hamd we have published it for a third time.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Risalah Najatiyyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we have already mentioned some scholars referred to this book with two equally interchangeable names. This classical 12th century text on Salafi creed was authored by Imam Muhammad Fakhir when he had to reside in Chittagong in Bangladesh for between 3-4 months in the year 1161H ie 3 years before his death. The original book is preserved in Mawlana Abdul Ghani al-Baqi’s library in Dinajpur in Bengal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treatise as also mentioned before is based purely on the Salafi Creed and Manhaj and hence the Quran and Sunnah and it is from Imam Muhammad Fakhir last works. One can gauge the importance and significance of this book from the fact that Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan translated the book from Farsi into Urdu as Farsi was the original language it was written in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-8048 alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=306%2C343" alt="najatiyyah old" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=268%2C300 268w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=768%2C861 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=913%2C1024 913w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?w=1040 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan produced a summarised transation and included it in his book <em>&#8216;Al-Mu&#8217;taqad Al-Muntaqad&#8217;</em> which was printed in the year 1305H from Matba&#8217;a Al-Ansari in Delhi. Furthermore, he included the whole book in Farsi in the beginning of another book, <em>&#8216;an-Nahj Al-Qubul Min Shara&#8217;i ar-Rusul.’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the importance of the status of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir, if a great scholar of the likes of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan summarized his book and reproduced them in his books of Aqidah, it for sure shows his status and calibre.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was an accomplished poet in Arabic and Farisi. Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan summarised Shaikh Muhammad Fakhirs poems in his two books, <em>&#8216;Nafah at-Tayyib&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;ar-Rawdh al-Khasib&#8217;</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir was calling to the the Quran and Sunnah without Taqlid and adhering to the Salafi Manhaj at a time when the people and the scholars of the era were engrossed in Taqlid or the madhahibs. It also shows the status of Imam Muhammad Fakhir as well as his call based on the notable and praiseworthy scholars that were around during his era, it includes the likes of</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>When Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir Met Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is also a well known incident when Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir met Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi. The incident mentions that once when Imam Muhammad Fakhir visited Delhi, while praying he said Amin loudly in the prayer in the Jamia Masjid. This was a disturbing event in Delhi. The general people because angry and began to oppress Imam Muhammad Fakhir to the extent they were on the verge of beating him. Imam Fakhir explained to them that this was established from the Sunnah and if you were to go to any of your major scholars of Hadith they will affirm this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the end they took Imam Muhammad Fakhir to the gathering of Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi and mentioned the incident to him.  So Shaikh Shah Waliullah told the people that this was also established from the Sunnah and the people were silenced. Thereafter Imam Muhamamd Fakhir said to Shaikh Shah Waliullah what don&#8217;t you tell these people openly what the Sunnah is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To which Shaikh Shah Waliullah replied that if I was to tell these people openly about such issues how would I have saved you today. Meaning that the people were so engrossed and staunch in the Hanafi madhab and fixed in their ways that they failed to accept anything else. (Taqsar al-Junud al-Ahrar (p.115), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339), Mawj Kawthar (p.63) of Shaikh Muhammad Akram)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Death</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1164H Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir prepared for Hajj again but became very ill, he had just reached the town or Burhanpur when he breathed his last and returned to our creator on the 11th Dhul Hijjah 1164H. Shaikh Azad Bilgirami expressed his sorrow and sadness at the demise of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir. (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218), Sarwar Azad (p.218), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.336)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This formidable Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith, spent his very short life in spreading Tawhid and the Sunnah, reprimanding grave veneration, grave worship and blind taqlid. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir spent almost quarter of a decade in calling to adhering to the Quran and Sunnah in an era which was filled with ardent bigoted hanafi muqallids, who were ferociously vicious and violent. The legacy of this Imam of Ahl al-Hadith who was upon the Madhab of the Salaf still remains as radiant and bright as ever around the globe even after 250 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The existence of this impressive Scholar of Ahl al-Hadith, his efforts and struggles are a testimony and a tremendous rebuttal of the modern madhabists who claim the Ahl al-Hadith are a new sect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah have mercy upon Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir and forgive his sins, Amin   </span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Series compilers, Translated and Annotated </strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) was originally from the land of Yemen and was from the great tribe of Daus, the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Eemaan is in Yemen, Fiqh is in Yemen and wisdom is in Yemen.” (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Saheeh Muslim and Ahmad)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">So this hadeeth shows the virtue of Eemaan, jurisprudence and wisdom of the people of Yemen. Hence no one with correct intellect and sound disposition can deny the companion, Abu Hurairah from Yemen had the abilities of jurisprudence or wisdom and his virtue and respect in this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">One ahadeeth states, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Abu Hurairah had knowledge.” (Mustadrak (3/509), in another hadeeth the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) said, “Abu Hurairah is the one with Wisdom in this Ummah” (Kunz al-A’maal (5/217), al-Esteeya’aab (1/8). </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">The Qur’aan says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">“He grants Hikmah to whom He pleases, and he, to whom Hikmah is granted, is indeed granted abundant good. But none remember (will receive admonition) except men of understanding.”</span></strong><span style="font-style: inherit;"> (Soorah al-Baqarah:269)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah according to the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) had juristic abilities and wisdom from Allaah and the people of knowledge have also mentioned the meaning of Hikmah to mean juristic abilities and knowing the Prophetic Sunnah. (See al-Jaam’e al-Ahkaam al-Qur’aan (20/230)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) was from the Arab tribe of Daus and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “I can only accept the gift of the people from the tribes of Qurashee, Ansaari and Dausee.” (Abu Dawood, Nasaa’ee Tirmidhee with Tuhfatul-Ahwadhee (4/379-380, also see Musnad Ahmad with the Footnotes of Allaamah Ahmad Shaakir (13/97), Jaam’e Ibn Wahb (pg.57), Musnad Humaidee (2/454) and the chain is authentic)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">This hadeeth also shows the virtue of Abu Hurairah, however due to bigotry and narrow mindedness an individual is deprived of insight and sight which causes him to be deprived of knowing and understanding the truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">It is narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Muslim and Musnad Humaidee (2/453) that Tufail bin Umar Dausee (Radhiallahu Anhu) said to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) curse the Daus tribe so the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Oh Allaah guide the Daus.” (Asaabah Fee Ma’ariftus Sahaabah of Haafidh Ibn Hajr in the mentioning of Tufail (2/225)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Imaam Sama’anee mentions that Jaabir (Radhiallaahu Anhu) narrated the companion Tufail bin Umar ad-Dausee came to Makkah in the beginning period of Islaam and said to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Oh Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) my tribe in Yemen is like a castle so make Hijrah and come there with me.” Insaab of Sama’aanee (2/401-402), Saheeh Muslim, Mustadrak (4/76), Musnad Abee Awaanah (1/47).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">These narrations also establish the virtue of the tribe of Abu Hurairah. The tribe of Daus is a branch of the tribe of Azd. (Tabaqaat Khaleefah bin Khayaat (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.814</span>) and the tribe of Azd also has much virtue. (Tuhfatul-Ahwadhee With Tirmidhee, Chapter al-Manaaqib)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">The uncle Abu Hurairah, Sa’ad bin Abee Dhabaab was the king of the Daus tribe when he became muslim the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) made him the Ameer of the tribe and after the demise of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) he maintained this position during the period of the leader of the believers, Abu Bakr and Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma). (Ktaab al-Amwaal (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.496</span>) of Abee Ubayd, Musannaf Ibn Abee Shaybah (3/143), Musnad Ahmad (4/79), Taareekh al-Kabeer of Bukhaari (2/46 Q2).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Many families of the Daus tribe accepted Islaam and offered to help the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam). (ad-Difa’ah An Abee Hurairah (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.18-21</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">The mother of Abu Hurairah Ameenah bint Safeeh bin Haarith was also a woman of the Daus tribe. (al-Ma’arif of Ibn al-Qutaibah (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.277</span>) she was also a female companion of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam). Abu Hurairah’s father, Sakhar according to the narration of ibn al-Kalbee was a companion (Fath ul-Baaree (9/164), however ibn al-Kalbee is weak. However Abu Hurairah’s maternal uncle Sa’ad bin Safeeh (Radhiallaahu Anhu) was from the bravest men of the Daus tribe and he was also a companion. (Tabaqaat Ibn Sa’ad (4/325) and Asaabah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah mentioned himself his name in the days of ignorance used to be Abdush-Shams (cited by Ibn Khuzaimah with an authentic Chain) and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) changed it and named it Abdur-Rahmaan or Abdullaah. (Tahdheeb ut-Tahdheeb and al-Esteeya’aab in the biography of Abu Hurairah). The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) also chose this kunyah (ie Abu Hurairah) for him. (al-Mustadrak (3/506) with an authentic chain). The reason for this Kunyah was that he used to like small cats and a cat in arabic is known as hirrah and its plural is Hurairah (see Jaami at-Tirmidhee). Abu Hurairah was also the Khaleef of Abu Bakr. (see Kitaab al-Kunaa of Daulaabee (1/61).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Abu Hurairah became Muslim in the beginning of Islaam but he migrated in 7H with about 70 families and at that time Abu Hurairah was about 30 years old.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Abu Hurairah Accepting Islaam<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">   </span></span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Hajr has mentioned in Asaabah that the well known chief of the tribe of Daus Tufail binUmayr (Radhiallaahu Anhu) came to Makkah in the beginning of Islaam and met the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) after which he accepted Islaam. (Assabah, Tabaqaat Ibn Sa’ad (1/353), Mustadrak (3/259). After having accepted Islaam he returned to his land of Yemen and started spreading the message of Islaam and invited his tribe to Islaam. So Abu Hurairah was the only person who accepted Islaam and thereafter the other people started to accept Islaam. (Asaabah (2/225-226), Tabaqaat Ibn Sa’ad)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">We find from this narration Abu Hurairah became Muslim in the beginning of Islaam however he saw the Messenger of Allaah in 7H when he the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) was in the battle of Khaybar. For detals see Anwaar al-Kaashifah of Allaamah Mu’allimee al-Yamaanee (p.144 and p.204) and the notes to Insaab by Mu’allimee also.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">So the conclusion is Abu Hurairah had accepted Islaam in the beginning. Imaam al-Maghaazee Imaam Muhammad bin Ishaaq narrates, Abu Hurairah was from the most respected and virtuous member of the Daus tribe.” (Footnote to Insaab and Mustadrak (3/506)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">The Love of The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) For Abu Hurairah (Radhiallaahu Anhu)</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) loved Abu Hurairah a great deal. Once the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) said to Abu Hurairah, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Ask me for something from the wealth.” Abu Hurairah replied, “Of Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) I only ask you to teach me some of the knowledge Allaah granted to you. So the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) spread the shawl of Abu Hurairah on the ground and began to recite something over it. When he had finished he said, “Take your shawl and keep it with you.” Abu Hurairah said, “From that day I did not even forget one letter of the hadeeth.” (Tadhkirratul-Huffaadh, the meaning of this is also narrated in Bukhaari, Muslim, Nasaa’ee and others and Hilyatul-Awliyaa (1/381).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">It is reported authentically that Abu Hurairah said to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam), </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Supplicate for me that Allaah makes me and my mother beloved to his beloved believer. So the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) supplicated for him. Abu Hurairah said, “Whoever sees or hears about me, he begins to love due to the blessing of the supplication of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam). (Saheeh Muslim, Tabaqaat Ibn Sa’ad (3/54-55 Q2), Hilyatul-Awliaa)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">So loving Abu Hurairah is a sigh of Eemaan therefore do the hanafee’s love Abu Hurairah more or the people of Rayy (opinion) especially Imaam Abu Haneefah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Once Abu Hurairah was ill and was sitting in a corner of the Prophets Masjid, the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) searched for him and when he found him he put his hand on his chest and supplicated for him and Abu Hurairah recovered. (Sunan Abee Dawood (1/502) with an authentic chain). This shows the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) loved Abu Hurairah greatly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Similarly Abu Hurairah also greatly loved the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam), he said to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam), </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Oh Messenger of Allaah when I see you I feel very happy and joyous and my eyes water.” (Musnad Ahmad (3/323), Mustadrak (4/160), Majma’a az-Zawaa’id (9/363) with an authentic chain). </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">After the death of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) when Abu Hurairah would narrate ahadeeth he would faint due to the great love he had for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam). (Jaam’i Tirmidhee with a Hasan chain), Mustadrak (1/418), Kitaab az-Zubd (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.159</span>) of Ibn al-Mubaarak) Abu Hurairah would also refer to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) as his best friend. (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Musannaf Ibn Abee Shaybah (2/408). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">A jurist of the hanafee madhab (ie an individual of the people of Rayy (opinion) was once degrading Abu Hurairah (Radhiallaahu Anhu) and was saying he was not a jurist and his narrations are not to be accepted, when suddenly a serpent (snake) started to chase him and only stopped chasing him once he repented. (See Siyar A’laam an-Nabulaa (2/444) of Dhahabee, Taareekh al-Islaam (2/337) also of Imaam Dhahabee, Tuhfatul-Ahwadhee Sharh Tirmidhee, Baab Maa Jaa Fee Fadhal at-Tahoor (1/11) from Aa’ardhatul-Ahwadhee, Hayaatul-Haywaan of Damairee and Difa’ah Ann Abee Hurairah (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.480</span>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “Oh Abu Hurairah you are from the biggest scholars amongst the companions.” (Jaam’i Tirmidhee, Asaabah and Esteeya’aab)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">However the hanafee jurists of Ahlur-Rayy after all this claim, one of the companions who spent the most time with the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) was a non-Faqeeh and the hadeeth narrated by him, which oppose the hanafee principles will not be accepted and according to Kawthari his hadeeth (ie Abu Hurairah’s) and of other such companions will not be accepted in contradiction to the Qiyaas (analogical reasoning) of Abu Haneefah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">To be continued…Inshallaah</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Abu Hurairah Was The Teacher of Ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">The scholars of Rijaal (narrators) have clearly mentioned Ibn Abbaas to be the student of Abu Hurairah and a manifest evidence for this is that once the issue of divorce was presented before the companions and Ibn Abbaas said to Abu Hurairah, “This is a serious issue please answer it.” So Abu Hurairah answered it immediately and Ibn Abbaas and the other companions acted upon it. (Sunan Abee Dawood Ma’a Au’n al-Ma’bood Kitaab at-Talaaq (2/227-228), Muwatta Imaam Maalik and others)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: inherit;">Similarly Ibn Abbaas asked Abu Hurairah concerning an issue of the prayer and he acted upon what Abu Hurairah told him. (Musannaf Ibn Abee Shaybah (2/236).</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: inherit;">From this we find Ibn Abbaas would refer to his teacher, Abu Hurairah in difficult issues.</span></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="font-style: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit;">The Rightly Guided Khaleeph’s Were From His Students</span></span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Al-Asaabah Fee Ma’arifatus-Sahaabah (4/209), Tabqaat Ibn Sa’ad and others clearly mention in the biography of Abu Hurairah that the Rightly guided Khaleeph’s from them Umar, Uthmaan and Alee, Talhah and Zubair from the 10 promised paradise would refer to Abu Hurairah for the Prophets hadeeth. Once Marwaan bin Hakam raised objections at Abu Hurairah for narrating too many ahadeeth but when he found the major companions like Umar would refer to him for Hadeeth he stopped his objections. (Bidaayah Wan-Nihaayah Tarjamah Abu Hurairah)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="font-style: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit;">Abu Hurairah As a Governor During the Times of Abu Bakr Siddeeq and Umar bin al-Khattaab</span></span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; color: #000000;">Sa’eed bin Mansoor mentions from Imam Ibn Seereen Abu Hurairah was given the position of calling the A’dhaan in Bahrain and he had a condition with Imaam al-E’laa bin al-Hadhramee that he would not say Ameen before him. (Fath ul-Baaree (2/217), Dalaa’il an-Nubuwwah (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.501</span>), Musannaf Ibn Abee Shaybah (2/427), Anwaar al-Kaashifah (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.224</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: inherit;">Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq also had Abu Hurairah take up a governmental post in Bahrain. (Tabaqaat Ibn Sa’ad (4/77 Q2),Anwaar al-Kaashifah (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.224</span>)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: inherit;">Even during the time of Umar bin Khattaab he was responsible for the same post. (Tabaqaat Ibn Sa’ad, Anwaar al-Kaashifah (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.229</span>), Fatooh al-Baldaan (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.93</span>), Kitaab al-Kharaj Lee Abee Yoosuf (<span style="font-style: inherit;">pg.114</span>)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: inherit;">So it is not hidden from any person of intellect that the companion posted on a government post upon the request of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) (as cited by Haafidh Ibn Hajr see Tabaqaat Ibn Sa’ad 4/76), Abu Bakr and Umar, must have been a jurist (ie Faqeeh) and with this he would have given rulings based upon ahadeeth and narrations.……..</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: inherit;">To follow a short and detailed biography of Abu Hurairah (Radhiallaahu Anhu)</span></span></p>
