<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Point by Point on Debunking Yasir Qadhi (ism) In light of his DISPATCH: Yasir Qadhi on Salafis and Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab, Science and Miracles, Yajuj and Majuj.</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Part 4</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Timestamp 1:00</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Host Mahin Says: I have heard, there is a guy in our WhatsApp group that calls him Sheikh ul-Islam of America, Ali al-Boriqi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Host SIM: oh Ali is very learned as well Mashallah that’s a huge compliment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Comment</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says in the glorious Qur’an:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">[And they should consider that] when those who have been followed disassociate themselves from those who followed [them], and they [all] see the punishment, and cut off from them are the ties [of relationship], Those who followed will say, &#8220;If only we had another turn [at worldly life] so we could disassociate ourselves from them as they have disassociated themselves from us.&#8221; Thus will Allah show them their deeds as regrets upon them. And they are never to emerge from the Fire. (Surah al-Baqarah:166-167)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a prime illustration of how individuals like this Ali al-Boriqi, who are fanatical followers, fall into extremism, the very thing they irresponsibly accuse others of! This level of praise is if at all only for the major scholars of this Ummah. In fact, we don’t even find the students of the major scholars of our times referring to them with such loaded titles of eminence. How is then the case for someone who is only 45 and and has perhaps only studied Islamic sciences for around a decade, with most parts being centered on a corrupt methodological approach anyway.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We then see Yasir Qadhi at this moment of sheer humility letting off a smug smirk lasting for a good few seconds. There is obviously no uproar, nor a dare I say quote unquote remark, actually there isn’t even a weak sigh or gasp of dismay at the utterance of such a chilling testimony. This is Yasir Qadhi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Compare Yasir Qadhi to the humility of Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan. Yasir Qadhi during the course of the podcast stated that he started to deliver sermons when he was 16 and that he has been lecturing preaching and teaching for almost three decades and during this moment of enlightened self-amazement, he says “wow, Subhanallah” (Time stamp 11:15).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us now compare him to who the real scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah are, why? Because he has repeatedly asserted that the west should refer to the Scholars of the WEST. Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan was born in 1933 and in 1950 he was appointed as a teacher in a school in Buraydah. Therefore, Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan has been teaching the Islamic sciences, issues legal edicts ranging from creed to governance and so on for the best part of 69 years, yes dear readers 69 years. I am quite certain the intelligent person will see the enormous disparity between precision, depth and accuracy in the knowledge of Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan and the other scholars of our times and between the insignificant role Yasir Qadhi actually has in the West. Moving on, a scholar who has taught Islam, the true “strand” of Ahl al-Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah, Salafism or as Yasir likes to define as the Najdi Da’wah said the following when:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Questioner praises Shaykh Fawzan for his defence of the Islamic Aqidah and Shari’ah. He says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“May Allah show goodness to you, this questioner calls Allah to witness, as well as those present here, that he loves you for the sake of Allah, he asks Allah, The Exalted, The Most High that He forgives you, gives you Tawfiq and rewards you on Behalf of Islam and the Muslims, due to what you do in defending the Aqidah and the Shari’ah.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan replies:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Firstly we ask Allah that He loves you, just as you love us for His sake, as for your statement that I defend Islam, then in reality I am not of this rank. I am less than this, I am deficient and I Seek the forgiveness of Allah, however we hope in Allah, that he gives victory to Islam, a victory from Himself and He forsakes the enemies of Islam by his Honour and His Ability, may He Be Glorified, the Most High.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Example &#8211;  Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The questioner says: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah grant you good. How does one reach the level of knowledge possessed by Shaykh Ibn Baz and You?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan replies:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I don’t have knowledge! As for Shaykh Ibn Baz, yes he had knowledge, may Allah forgive him and have mercy on him. As for us, we are poor (in terms of knowledge) like you. However, it is obligatory upon us to learn.</span></p>
</blockquote>

Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwJXSFuYsEc)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwJXSFuYsEc)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allahu Akbar, May Allah have mercy on the noble Scholars Ahl al-Sunnah, just look at their humility and simplicity, a true sign of knowledge which leads to Taqwa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Third Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A host introduces Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan during a lecture and he continues to praise him for almost one and a half minutes. When Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan finally speaks he says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim, Alhamdulillah Wassalatu Wassalam Ala Rasullillah Wa Ala Alihi Wa Sahbi wa Man Wala, to proceed: Indeed, you have EMBARASSED me, where you have lifted me to a place I have not reached, I’m to say the least just a seeker of knowledge just like one of you. Rather, perhaps amongst you there are those who greater and more noble.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fourth Example – Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yasir Qadhi goes onto mention his Islamic achievements that he wrote books and delivered lectures on this i.e in defence and propagation of the Najdi Da’wah, like Kitab al-Tawhid, Kashf al-Shubuhat and Qawa’id al-Arba’a and propagation of the Najdi Da’wah. He goes onto say I quote unquote:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Quote <span style="color: #ff0000;">“Dare I say to this day NOTHING (emphasis his) has been written in the English language that is more of an advanced defence of the Najdi da’wah then my critical analysis of shirk which is still available in the English language.”</span> Unquote (Timestamp, 12:50)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Saleh al-Fawzan was asked:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Allah has blessed you to author many books; are there any books you deem better?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: which books?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Questioner Your Books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: (with some concern) You want me to praise my own book? (The Shaykh chuckles)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan: I deem all of my books to be weak.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fifth Example –Shaykh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A host introduces Shaykh al-Albani for approximately two and a half minutes. Shaykh al-Albani while following the Sunnah of Allahs’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam begins by reciting the Khutbatul Hajah. He then thanks the host for his words and praise and then says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I have no answer to it except to follow the example of the First Khalifah, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq RadhiAllah Anhu, who was the first and true Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. When he heard someone praising him, and it is my belief that no matter how much the one who is exaggerating in his praise (it was the truth) since he was the Khalifah of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam yet. (THE SHAYKHS STARTS CRYING from timestamp 4:29 until 5:00 and in between says Allahul Musta’an and then continues) Yet he used to say “Oh Allah don’t hold me responsible for that which say, make me better then that which they think of me and forgive me for that which they don’t know” (The Shaykh is still shaken and upset) This is what the great Siddiq said. What is there for us to say after him? So I say Following his example (while the Shaykh is still upset) Oh Allah don’t hold me responsible for that which say, make me better then that which they think of me and forgive me for that which they don’t know” The truth is and I say the truth, I am not the person that was described by our noble brother but I am merely a student of knowledge, nothing else.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(YouTube: The Humility of Sheikh Al Albani. Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFzTPHR3Ukk)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFzTPHR3Ukk)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Sixth Example –Shaykh Muhammad b. Saleh al-Uthaymin</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yasir Qadhi proudly claims he was the student of Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin, is this the case? I will scrutinise this claim later. Let us look at the humility of Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin. A host asks Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin if it was permissible for a person to recite a poem, so Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin grants them permission. He starts reciting:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“My Ummah after this night comes</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Dawn that its light spread across the world</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Good is awaited and the opening is soon</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the truth will be victorious despite of the efforts of evil</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By a revival that Allah has blessed</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">That is pure and free of any defects</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as Ibn Saleh (i.e. Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin) is amongst us</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as Ibn Saleh is amongst us</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaykh of our revival</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With his likes we wish for support and victory</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin interjects and says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I do not agree with this line, no I do not agree because I don’t want the truth to be attributed to individuals. Everyone makes mistakes and if we attribute the truth to individuals and then that person dies, the people will fall into desperation. If you wish (i.e) change that line to “As long as we have the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of his Messenger” It would be better.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reciter then continues his recitation:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As long as we have the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of his Messenger</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Uthaymin…</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin then interjects again: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“No Oh Shaykh (like I just told you) Don’t say this, no no, stop, stop.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reciter continues and it seems like he does not understand what the Shaykh is trying to point out:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Jurist..</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin stops them and they say let us continue by the will of Allah. Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin says:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“No, by Allah I don’t want, no I am not joking, you only have this? Then ask your question. The poem was absolutely uncalled for. I advise you from now and after, not to tie the truth to men. Firstly, men can deviate even Ibn Mas’ud RadhiAllahu Anhu said: “Whoever is to follow someone then follow those who have passed away because those who are alive are not safe from trials.” If you attribute the truth to men a person could be deceived by himself, we seek refuge of Allah from that and adopt wrong ways. Therefore, I advise you not to attribute the truth to men. Firstly, a man is not safe, I ask Allah to make us firm, a man is not safe from mistakes and trial. Secondly, he will die, no one remains alive, “We granted not to any human being immortality before you then if you die, would they live forever (Surah al-Anbiya, 21:34). Thirdly the sons of Adam, humans may be deceived if he sees people honouring and flocking to him. He might be deceived, he might think he is infallible or claim that he is and believe everything that he does is the truth and that every path he takes is permissible. This could lead him to destruction, a man praised another man a the presence of the Messenger of Allah Salallahu alayhi Wsallam, The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam told him: Woe to you, you have cut the neck of your friend (his back). I thank the brother in advance though I have not heard what he says about me to what he expresses of his feelings towards me I ask Allah to make me as he best sees me no more but I don’t like being praised, I will reward you inshallah and so I ask Allah to reward you and to recompense you”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(YouTube: Don’t Tie the Truth to Men – The Humility of Ibn Uthaymin. Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfKeWwSILvE)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfKeWwSILvE)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After these illustrative examples showing how our scholars displayed humility and how Yasir Qadhi displays the direct opposite. It would be most pertinent to remind the readers secondarily and Yasir himself primarily concerning the issue of Riya- the hidden shirk or polytheism. Yasir Qadhi is usually very quick in listing the names of his books relevant to the Sunni Salafi Aqidah but rarely if at all ever mentions his book on Riya – showing of. On page 43 of the book he mentions how the dangers of riya are the destruction of the Ummah and then on page 45 the love of praise and the most important on page 32, it increases misguidance. It seems likes Yasir Qadhi has not only left Salafism and the Najdi Da’wah but also the basic concepts of self rectification and personal purification of the soul and it is a must that he reads his book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly in this part I would like to leave the readers with words of Shaykh Abd al-Razzaq al-Badr where in he states and the aim to highlight the idea of being humble</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Mutarif ibn Abdillah ibn ash-Shik-kheer who was a scholar from Tabi’in, he saw a man wearing a cloak and walking or strutting boastfully. So, he said to the man: “Oh slave of Allah, this is the type of boastful walking or strutting of those whom Allah hates.” The man replied, “Don’t you know who I am? This man was wearing this beautiful cloak and his appearance was attractive and he was strutting, and someone has the nerve to speak to him in this manner?! Thus he replied, Don’t you know who I am?! Meaning if you knew who I was you would not speak to me like this. Mutarrif said: “On the contrary, of course I know who you are!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You started as a sprinkled drop of sperm</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You will end up as a soiled corpse</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And in the meantime you are carrying faeces around (in your intestines)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So I know who you are</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the man went about his way and he no longer strutted and these words of Mutarrif taught this man some manners.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(YouTube: How to humble an arrogant person – By Shaykh Abdur Razzaq Al-Badr. Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee. Retrieved from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv62pV2BOXw)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv62pV2BOXw)</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The purpose of knowledge is that is saves a person from disobeying Allah and his Messenger. Allah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error. (Surah al-Ahzab:36)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hasan al-Basri said: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">there are two types of knowledge, one that which is in the heart which is beneficial knowledge. The second type of knowledge is that which is on the tongue which is Allah’s evidence against mankind. (Sunan al-Darimi, 1:350 no.374, Dar al-Tasil)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With this being said, it is first and foremost for us to be humble and know our status in terms of ilm. Secondly for my fellow Muslims, brothers and sisters to to sit back a little and realise that true scholarship, academia and knowledge is with the Rabbani scholars of this Ummah, their virtue and status is well universal and agreed upon. Thirdly, do not be naïve and let people play with your emotions and Islam, for indeed you alone are responsible for your actions when you have to stand before Allah without any leader, scholar or interpreter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the subsequent parts I will highlight many inconsistencies, contradictions and the true reality of Yasir Qadhi, InshaAllah.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Making Intention for Fasting the Night Before.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Fawzan said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whether it is fasting or any other act of worship, having an intention is a prerequisite and a condition. The Hadith mentions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;Every action is based on intention and everyone is due what they made an intention for.&#8221;</i> (Bukhari 1, Muslim 1907)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alayhi wasallam said specifically concerning the fast,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>&#8220;There is no fast for the one who does not bind an intention in the night.&#8221;</i> (Nasai 2334, graded Sahih by Shaykh al-Albani)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is concerning the obligatory fast &#8211; that it is mandatory to form an intention before sunrise. It is also mandatory to form a new intention every day for every fast because every day ie the fast is a specific act of worship and thus requires an intention. The Hadith of every action is based on intentions is general and if a person wakes up and makes Suhur this is forming the intention. If he wakes up after sunrise and he had made the intention during the night before he went to sleep, then he must not eat when he wakes up and his fast is valid because he had formed his intention during the night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Muntaqa p.424)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(TN:-BENEFIT &#8211; the wording of the second Hadith is La Siyam&#8230; Meaning there is no fast for the one who does not have intention, likewise and similarly this is also applied to the Hadith of reciting Fatihah behind the Imam as it also mentions La Salah&#8230;, the la of negation)</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Risaalah “Laa tafarraqu” (Do not Differ)</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And hold firmly to the rope of Allāh all together and do not become divided.” {Āli’Imrān (3): 103}</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We were sent an email by a very noble brother who highlighted some very important issues and concerns relating to the dawah Salafiyyah in Birmingham. Thereafter, on numerous occasions many brothers have been discussing the email and about how the dawah is to be progressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We thought it prudent to write a very short treatise on some of the important matters that have been discussed generally amongst the salafee brothers relating to dawah and specifically have highlighted some areas that are potential pitfalls, that we as Salafees must endeavour to navigate away from, thus preserving the dawah and ourselves before our Lord, the Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We have called this treatise “Do not Differ” as we have advocated in the past and shall continue to do so with the aid of Allah that the salafees ought to be united and must learn to differ, as and when subsidiary issues arise. However, this does not by any means translate into abandoning or watering down any of the blessed dawah’s principles or its identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, in current times it is ever more crucial and mandatory to preserve that which we have been blessed with of As Salafiyyah so that we are not held otherwise to account before Allah for distorting his deen.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have summarised some points and principles in this treatise so that the reader can benefit as much as possible and shall in due course be publishing the works of the respected scholars, past and present concerning dawah salafiyyah and its principles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah allow us all to accept the advice of our brother and may Allah accept this work from us</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(1) The Issue Concerning Watering Down the Dawah and an Important Distinction. That is, The Tremendous Principle of the Difference Between ‘Mudarah’ (being amicable) and ‘Mudahanah’ (to compromise).</strong></span></h4>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">’Ā’ishah (radi Allāhu ’anha) reported </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“that a man sought permission to enter upon the Prophet (sallallāhu alayhi wassallam) and when he saw the man the Prophet (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam) said: “Let him in, what a bad brother of his tribe he is and what a bad son of his tribe he is.” (Bukharee &#8211; Kitaab ul Fitan)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Nawawee (rahimahullāh) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“This Hadīth shows the permissibility of mudārah”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Hajr (rahimahullāh) said about this Hadīth: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Ibn Battāl said: Mudārah is from the good character of the believers, to be responsive to people, even with a word, without being coarse with them in speech, this is one of the strongest causes of harmony. Some people think that mudārah is mudahānah and this is an error, as mudārah is regrettable and mudāhanah is prohibited. The difference is: mudāhanah is taken from the word ad-Dahhān (the painter) who glosses over something and covers what is actually there. the scholars have explained it as lying with a sinner and openly displaying happiness with what he is doing without forbidding him at all. Mudārah is being kind with the ignorant in order to teach him, being kind with the sinner in order to forbid him from what he is doing, without being harsh with him so that he does not expose what he does, and forbidding him with gentle speech and action, especially if his comradeship is needed and the likes of that.” (Fath ul-Bārī [Dār ur-Rayyān], vol.10, pg.545)</span></em></p>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 6">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Imām al-Qurtubī (rahimahullāh) stated: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“the difference between mudārah and mudāhanah is that mudārah is to surrender the dunya for the benefit of the religion and it is permissible and even recommended. Mudāhanah is leaving the religion for the dunya.” (ibid, vol.10, p.469)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (rahimahullāh): </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Thus mudārah is praiseworthy and mudāhanah is censured, so there is a differenece between the two. The one who is mudāree uses kindness with a person in order for the truth to manifest from the person or make him retract from falsehood. The mudāhin (compromiser) uses kindness in order for the person to remain established upon falsehood and leaves him upon his desires. Mudārah is for the people of Imān while mudāhanah is for the hypocrites.” (Ar-Rūh pg. 231)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is important to refer to the magnificent books by the great late, Allamah Bakr Abu Zayd (rahimahullāh) ‘Hukm ul Intimaa’ and ‘Hajr ul Mubtadi’ for a discussion on this topic further and I pray Allah will allow us to translate and publish the book soon, Inshaallaah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So you will come to realise that it is not necessary to be harsh and rough all the time when giving dawah or responding to the one calling you, although this has its time and place. At the same token we should not ‘gloss over’ the current problems in the dawah and pretend that they are not there, such pertinent example are from the likes of al-Maghrib, al-Kauthar, these academies, institutes and cooperating with their speakers and promoter’s thus creating a confusion and void in the minds of the Salafee youth, not knowing whether to turn to the right or left.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 7">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ultimately, the caller and the called become confused together and the sinner is left unspoken and not warned about, and this is displaying a support and aid for the sinner. It should not be difficult for the Salafee, as a minimum, to free himself from the one who places the Soofee, Mutazilee, Jahmee, Qadaree, Murjee and so on under the banner of Ahlus Sunnah, and by doing so he preserves the trust that Allah has placed with him through this blessed dawah. A lot, can be said but this will be detailed in a later book Inshaallaah. Allah’s aid is sought.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(2) The Basis of the Salafee Call and Its Restriction</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam adh-Dhahabee (rahimahullāh) said in the introduction to his book al-’Uluww li’l-’Aliyy al-Ghaffār’: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“O ’Abdullāh, If you love justice then stop at the texts of the Qur’ān and Sunan and then look at what the Companions and the Tābi’ūn stated along with the commentaries of the Imāms of tafsīr with regards to the verses and with whatever has been related from the madhab of the Salaf. So either you speak with knowledge or you remain silent with gentleness.” (Refer to Wasitiyyyah Ahlus Sunnah Baynal Firaq pgs. 102-103.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Pay attention, it is obligatory, no doubt, that the caller call to and stop at the Quran, Sunnah and salaf. Look carefully and you will see in the words of Dhahabee the restriction and not going beyond this and it is therefore necessary that we explain this dawah to the masses in the kindest way. Contra, It is a major sin if we attempt to water down, hide or appease this dawah with that which is falsehood.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Look carefully again at the words of Dhahabee and you will see that a condition he placed is that the caller must have knowledge of that which he calls to and by this it is as clear as the sun that he is placing the importance upon the obligation of consulting, taking advise of and referring to the scholars.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 8">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A dawah which does not refer to scholars for its knowledge is like the one who expects a response from a donkey when it asks it how its affairs are! Impossible! That is, it is a dawah that cannot possibly succeed and instead the dawah becomes open to the interpretations of the juhaal (ignorant) and ruwaybidah (those unfit to give knowledge). So what will be the effect? See below,</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(3) False Interpretations</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn ul-Qayyim (rahimahullāh) states: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“To sum up: The splitting of the People of the Book and of this Ummah into 73 sects is only understood via their interpretations.” (Ilaamul Muwaqi’een 4/317)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abi’l-’Izz al-Hanafī (rahimahullāh) states: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Did the Khawārij revolt, or the Mu’tazilah depart or the Rawāfid reject and the Ummah split into 73 sects due to anything except corrupt and false interpretations? (Sharh Aqeedah Tahawiyyah pg. 89)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once the dawah has been clouded and clarity diminishes then the floodgates open for all the watering down, false interpretations, accommodations of all the opinions ever held by the people. It is at this time that the dawah becomes something which is strange only adhered to by those who seen as strangers! So one of the most important ways to remove such blemishes and confusions concerning the dawah is to be clear upon the prophetic Aqeedah, Manhaj and stopping where the salaf stopped. This one is the true salafee and sunni.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 9">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Pay heed, as salafees we must not allow any false interpretations of anyone, no matter how many degrees they may have, how brilliant their courses are, how filled their seminar rooms become and so on to alter the dawah ‘through the back door’, the saying of the arabs is to be noted “the shade of the stick will never straighten up until the stick itself is crooked”.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(4)Why We Must Never Taint Dawah Salafiyyah</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ubayy ibn Ka’b (radi Allāhu ’anhu) stated: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“You must follow the path of Allāh and the Sunnah. There is no slave who is on the path of Allāh and the Sunnah, remembering Allāh, his eyes overflowing out of fear of his Lord, but that Allāh will never punish him. A minimal course in the path of Allāh and the Sunnah is better than striving hard in a path contrary to the path of Allāh and the Sunnah and consenting to innovation.” (Usool ul Eemaan Fee Dau Kitaab was Sunnah pg. 296)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Praise be to Allah, we call to a middle path, not being too harsh and nor being overly lenient and apologetic.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Consider the words of the illustrious companion Ubayy, the first part is emphatic in stating that the Sunni, Salafee who is merely an aami {layperson} but he is established firmly upon the book and Sunnah, that is as Salafiyyah, then “Allah will never punish him”. Praise be to Allah, let us call the general masses to this Salafiyyah and let us not be shy. We may well be held accountable for not allowing the general masses to be introduced to the clear and untainted salafiyyah. This is the job of the caller.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 10">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The second part of his saying clarifies further that as callers if we cannot give the people true and pure Dawah Salafiyyah then we should NEVER allow an untainted, twisted and confused version promoted by those who bring the grave worshipper and other than that under Ahlus Sunnah to emanate from our platforms or masaajid! It is better for us that we sit at home and better ourselves and our families then to preach or stay silent, thus accepting, the mistakes of others in the deen. Allahs aid is sought.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(5) Do not pretend to be on Dawah Salafiyyah but besincere in being a Salafee.</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullāh) stated in Majmū’ al-Fataāwā, vol.3, pg.156: </span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 10">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;As for pretending to be upon the Madhhab of the Salaf then this is bātil, as this is not possible except that ignorance will increase and knowledge will decrease.”</em></span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We don’t wish to overly comment upon the Imaams above quote but suffice it to say that it seems the watering down and wolves clothed in Salafiyyah garments is not a modern problem but one which has been dealt with by our salaf. Instead, we record below the words of a current day scholar.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdus Salām bin Sālim Rajā’ as-Suhaymī (Associate Professor in the Department of Fiqh, College of Sharī’ah, Islamic University of Madeenah) Commented on the above quote with,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“I say: “During our time there have been those who have claimed to be upon the madhab of the Salaf when the reality is that they are not. Indeed, there are those who are part of modern partisan groups, some who have the ideology of the Khawārij in the name of Salafiyyah and the likes. All of this is the result of the increase of ignorance and the decrease of knowledge just as Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah stated, or there has been a watering down of the Salafee Manhaj in order to include deviated groups in the guise of Ahlus-Sunnah wa’l-Jamā’ah”. (Please refer to the tremendous book of the sheikh ‘Kun Salafiyyan ’alā’l-Jādah’ pg.72)</span></em></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">A} The saying of Allāh:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And do not insult those they invoke other than Allāh, lest they insult Allāh in enmity without knowledge.” (Soorah al-Anām 6: 108)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allāh has prohibited insulting the gods of the Mushrikīn due to insults being levelled at Allāh and on the pretext that humiliating their deities leads to insulting Allāh. So the benefit of averting the insulting of Allāh is better than the benefit of us insulting their deities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">B} It is mentioned in the Hadīth of Ā’ishah (radi Allāhu ’anhā) that the Prophet (sallallāhu alayhi wassallam) said: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Yā Ā’ishah! If yourpeople had not been recent converts to Islām, I would have spent the treasure of the Ka’bah in the way of Allāh and would have constructed its door just on the level of the ground and would have encompassed in it the space of Hijr.” (Agreed Upon)</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 12">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the hadīth is a clear evidence for this principle as the Prophet (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam) left of the benefit of the Ancient House on the premise that Ibrāhīm (‘alayhis-salām) in order to avert the evils and fearing falling into them destroyed it and built on it and out of the people apostating due to this action. So the Prophet (sallallāhu alayhi wassallam) gave precedence to preventing this evil than achieving the benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">C} The Prophet (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam) sufficed from fighting the hypocrites due to the benefit in that for safeguarding the people from their harm, such as it being said that Muhammad (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam) kills his companions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">D} The Prophet (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam) forbade killing the leaders (of the Muslims) and revolting against their Imāms (i.e. leaders) even if they oppress, as long as they establish the prayer, in order to prevent the means to fitna and the wisdom in this was to prevent further corruption and harm; this is because what results in killing and revolting against leaders is double the evil than what the leader was doing in the first instance, and the Ummah is still reaping the effects of this to this day. The Prophet (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam) said: “If two Caliphs are pledged allegiance to then kill the last of them (who called for allegiance to be pledged to him)”, in order to prevent the means to fitna (tribulation).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullāh), after mentioning the different branches under the principle of preventing harm takes precedence over achieving benefits, mentioned that if the benefits and harms conflict then the most correct one in the situation will take precedence, he said (rahimahullāh):</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“From the Usool of Ahlus Sunnah is to stick to the Jamā’ah, leave off fighting against the leader, meaning: the oppressive leader, and abandoning fighting during times of fitna and all of these are included with the general principle that if the benefits and harms, and the evil and good conflict, then the most correct option has to be selected. This is because enjoining and forbidding though they entail the attainment of some benefit, and the prevention of some harm, its opposite must also be considered. If, in carrying out this enjoining or forbidding, there is benefit lost greater than the benefit gained, or harm is brought about greater than the harm which was avoided, then this is not part of that which Allah has ordered us to do, rather it is harām, because of the fact that its net harm is greater than its net benefit. the only criterion for measuring the above- mentioned harm and benefit is with the scales of the Sharī’ah. Whenever one is capable of following a text directly, it is not permitted for him to turn elsewhere. If he cannot find a text for the exact problem confronting him, he can exert his reason to understand the ruling by way of analogy. the legal texts are seldom without someone capable of knowing their implications, and how they point the way to the rulings of the Sharī’ah” (Majmu al-Fataawa vol. 28 page 128.)</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 13">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So we have heard amongst brothers saying that, ‘if we make the dawah clear then the people will leave’, ‘our numbers will decrease’, ‘the masjid will become empty’, ‘donations will fall’ and so on. These are excuses and not the legislated principles which allow one to leave of enjoining the good. Further, these points are mere conjectures and just darkness upon darkness.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(7) The Openness of Dawah Salafiyyah</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">’Umar bin ’Abdul ’Azīz (rahimahullāh) stated:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “If you see a people having secret meetings about their religion without involving the general people then know that they are based on misguidance.” (See Kun Salafiyyan pg.85 of Shaikh Suhaimee.)</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 14">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Note, the dawah is not about shutting out individuals from a close network just as those such as the al-maysooniyyah (The Free Masons) do with their closed meetings and agendas. The dawah is open for all and the doors are open for any individual to participate with sincerity and good actions before Allah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Further, the involvement of general people is also important in its right place. The salafee ought to be the most humble one distancing himself from arrogance and checking himself at all stages, Allah’s aid is sought.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(8) Preserve Your Salafiyyah At All Costs Oh Salafee!</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">’Abdullāh ibn Imām Ahmad (rahimahullāh) reported from Abī Qilābah (rahimahullāh) that he said:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “Neither sit with them nor mix with them! It is not safe as they will plunge you into their misguidance and confuse you with many things.” (Masaa’il Imam Ahmad pg. 86)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">How many a people have we seen that began to sit and have relations with one distant from the sunnah only for him to become like that person. In Birmingham, we have seen people say that the Deobandee caller to his baatil beliefs and manhaj, such as Zaheer Mahmood, was a shaikh and nothing was wrong with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">See all the points above and then you will come to the conclusion on how this one fell into the trap of sitting with an open innovator, the callers cannot free themselves of having a portion of the blame in this poor ones demise and distance from salafiyyah.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 15">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So what is the starting point for the salafee when it comes to innovators? Read on.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(9) The Balance of the Salafees in Dealing With Innovators</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullāh) said: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“So for example, the Imāms of innovation from the people who have statements which oppose the Book and the Sunnah or actions of worship which oppose the Book and the Sunnah, then their condition has to be clarified and it is obligatory to warn the Ummah against them by agreement of the Muslims. to the extent that it was said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: “If a man fasts, prays and secludes himself in the worship of Allāh, is this more beloved to you or talking about the people of innovation?” Imām Ahmad replied: “When a person prays, fasts and secludes himself in worship then this is only for himself, yet if he speaks about the people of innovation this is for the Muslims and thus is more virtuous.” He made clear that the benefit for this is for the general Muslims in their religion and is a type of jihād in the path of Allāh wherein the path of Allāh is purified along with His religion, His Methods and His Divine Legislation (from the heresies of the innovators) and it prevents their transgression and enmity. For this reason, it is obligatory according to the consensus of the Muslims and if this was not established for Allāh to prevent the harms of those innovators then the religion would become corrupted and this harm would be much worse than the enemy during warfare gaining power. this is because when these enemies take control they do not corrupt the hearts or the religion that is within the hearts. But as for those (innovators) then they corrupt the hearts from the outset.” (Majmu al-Fataawa vol. 28 page 231-232.)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He also said (rahimahullāh) in another instance:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If an innovator is calling to his corrupted beliefs which oppose the Book and the Sunnah, and it is feared that he will misguide the people then his situation has to be explained to the people so that they are conscious of his misguidance and know about him. All of this is obligatory as a form of advice and seeking the Countenance of Allāh and not for personal desire with the people.” (Majmu al-Fataawa vol 28 page 221)</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 16">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Consider!, the IJMAA (consensus) of the salafee, past and present, in warning against the innovator and his innovation. So what about the salafee who sees no harm in the innovator and instead looks for ways of cooperating with the innovator rather than creating the distance of the east and west between him and the innovator. We do not need to go into specific occurrences concerning the dawah in the UK to exemplify this point and those who have some understanding will see what is being said here!</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(10)A Note of Clarity Concerning al-Maghrib, al-Kauthar, Current Day Institutes, Academies, Zaheer Mahmood: as-Suffa and others Who Are Unclear, Who Say “but they have some good points aswell.”</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Al-’Allāmah Shaykh Sālih al-Fawzān (hafidhahullāh) was asked, after being asked about groups {that oppose the salaf}:”O Shaykh! Shall we warn against them without mentioning their good points for example? or do we mention both their good and bad points?”</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 17">
<div class="layoutArea" style="text-align: justify;">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Answer:</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column" style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If you mention their good points it is as if you are calling to them, so no! Do not mention their good points just mention their mistakes because you have not been entrusted to study their circumstances and support their personalities. You have been entrusted to clarify their errors in order for them to repent and in order to warn against them. As for mentioning their good points then the people will then say “this is what we want to take.” (Extracted from Muqaddimah an-Nasr il-’Azeez, pg.8 transmitted from the cassette of the third lesson of Kitāb ut-Tawhīd which was given by the noble Shaykh in Summer 1413 AH/1992 CE in Tā’if.)</span></em></p>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 17">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The above saying needs no commentary from us and is as clear as the sun for the one who wishes to see.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>(11) A Great Reminder by Allaamah Bakr Abu Zayd(rahimahullāh)</strong></span></h4>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He said in his book ‘Hajr ul-Mubtadi’ (pg.48:) </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“&#8230;just as the one who speaks with falsehood is a Shaytān speaking, the one who is quiet about the truth is likewise a silent Shaytān, as Abū ’Ali ad-Diqāq (d.406 AH, rahimahullāh) stated! From the verified Sunnah is the statement of the Prophet (sallallāhu ’alayhi wassallam): “A person is with who he loves” and Anas (radi Allāhu ’anhu) stated: “The Muslims were not pleased with anything after Islām except this Hadīth.” The Imāms were stern on whoever contradicted the basis of belief and abandoned the innovators. Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah refuted the Ittihādiyyah saying: “All who is attached to them must be punished along with those who praise them and their books and along with those who help and assist them, or those who hate speaking about them, or those who make excuses for them by saying “This speech is unknown” and “it is not known who made these disparaging statements” and the likes of such excuses which are not uttered except by a jāhil or hypocrite! So rather, all who know their condition (of the innovators of the Ittihādiyyah) and do not help to oppose them have to be punished. This is because opposing them is from the greatest obligations because they (the Ittihādiyyah) corrupt the minds and religion of many scholars, kings, rulers and they thus strive throughout the earth causing corruption and they block people from the path to Allāh”.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" style="text-align: justify;" title="Page 18">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Bakr Abu Zaid (rahimahullāh) then said:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “May Allāh have mercy on Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah and bless him to drink from the Salsabīl of Paradise, Āmīn. These words are of the utmost precision and importance&#8230; so all who manifestly praise an innovator, or praise his books and distributes them among the Muslims and spread their innovation and misguidance and does not expose the deviations in belief that they have – then whoever does this is negligent and has to be abandoned so that he does not affect the Muslims. We have been tested in this era with people who praise the innovators and distribute their statements and writings and neither warn against them nor from their misguidance&#8230;.we seek refuge in Allāh from misery and its people.”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So Oh Salafee, do not be silent at all times on the innovation, confusion, corruption and evil being uttered by those around you and certainly do not open the door and let in yourself the one who will harm your dawah and its people. Have trust in Allah and be not worried on your numbers dwindling!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Remember the prophet said about people like you and us (inshallaah) that the victorious group will be “Dhaahriyeen alal haqq”, that is OPEN AND APPPARENT upon the truth (Nasa’ee no.2229), so do not be shy, afraid or even embarrassed of saying that you are Salafee and that you oppose al that which opposes salafiyyah!.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah Guide Us All. Ameen</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>Question:</b></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Oh noble Shaykh, may Allah grant you success. There are those who say the era of Salafiyah is an era that has come and ended and we are not able to apply…</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><b>Shaykh Fawzan interrupts:</b></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has ended for him; because he does not love the Salaf and he does not want to follow their methodology; but as it relates to Ahlus Sunnah wa Jamah the era of Salafiyah will remain until the hour is established, it will remain until the hour is established. It will not end; and to Allah belongs all the praises.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Question:</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Why are all of those who call towards Tawhîd called as “Wahhâbiyyah” ever since Shaykh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhâb (rahimahullâh)? This word scares off many people from those who call towards Tawhîd.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>:</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No, it doesn’t scare off at all. We are proud of the fact that the one who calls towards Tawhîd is called as “Wahhâbî” and all praise is due to Allâh. What is the one who calls towards Shirk (idolatry, polytheism) called then? What is he called? Jâhilî!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are proud of it. Let them then say “Wahhâbî”. They are thusly themselves witnessing that the call of Wahhâbiyyah is a call towards Tawhîd. The author of “al-Lanjah” (rahimahullâh) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If the one who follows Ahmad is a Wahhâbî, then let the humans and Jinns witness that I am a Wahhâbî.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad here is the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam);</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If the one who follows Ahmad is a Wahhâbî, then let the humans and Jinns witness that I am a Wahhâbî.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaykh Saalih bin Fawzaan al-Fawzaan</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>Question:</em></strong> </span>Is Salafiyyah a hizb (party) amongst the parties? And is ascribing to them (the Salafis) a blameworthy thing?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan:</em></strong></span> As-Salafiyyah is the Saved Sect and they are Ahl us-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah. It is not a hizb (party) from amongst the various parties, those which are called parties today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather they are the Jamaa’ah, the Jamaa’ah upon the Sunnah and upon the Deen (Religion). They are Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – said, “There will not cease to be a group from my Ummah (nation) manifest and upon the truth, not being harmed by those who forsake them neither by those who oppose them.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">And he – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – also said, “And this Ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Hell-Fire except one.” They said, “Which one is this O Messenger of Allaah?” He replied, “They are those who are upon what I and my companions are upon today.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence, Salafiyyah is a group of people (the Salafis) upon the madhab of the Salaf, upon what the Messenger – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – and his companions were upon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">And it is not a hizb from amongst the contemporary groups present today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather it is the very old Jamaa’ah, from the time of the Messenger – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – which inherits (this way) and continues, and which never ceases to be upon the manifest truth until the establishment of the Hour, as he (Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam) has informed us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaykh Saleh bin Fowzan</strong></span> stated:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">Not everyone who claims to be Salafi is truly Salafi. Some individuals have made this claim but they are ignorant and they don’t know the Salafi Minhaj. Some individuals have made this claim but they have actually adopted the methodology of the Khawarij, and this is displayed in their spilling of blood and causing mischief throughout the earth. Others have made this claim but they are self-taught and they have not taken knowledge from the scholars, but rather, they have taken it from books and that which they have read. They depend on their memorization of texts without (true) understanding. </span></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now that we know the Message of the Prophets was Tawheed and how important it is, it naturally follows to know the types of Tawheed and their correct understanding.<span id="more-864"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Most of the Muslims are unaware of the reality of Tawheed and what it actually entails hence they are ignorant of the categories of tawheed and therefore indulge in acts of shirk and fall short in their belief in Allah. Tawheed linguistically means to single out/separate and in the context of Sharee’ah it means to single out Allah and worship him alone and not to associate any partners with him. Believing in Allah is to have the Aqeedah that Allah alone is the lord and creator of everything, he is the owner and master of everything, so he is the one who is entitled to be worshipped and nothing be associated with him. The prayers, fasting, supplications, seeking help, fear home, humility, awe are all of the rights of Allah alone. So prayer or fasting, seeking help or supplicating or having inner fear of anything else or hoping from anyone else is impermissible and believing in this is shirk. Furthermore, he is attributed with all the good and lofty attributes and he is free of any defect or deficiencies. By believing in all of this it separates tawheed into 3 categories: Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah, Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah wal-Ebaadah and Tawheed Al-Asmaa was-sifaat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is to affirm and believe in Allah in terms of his actions to be alone. For example He Alone is; the creator, the giver of life, the one who takes life away, the owner and master. So it is to believe in all of this that he alone is the creator and no one can change this, and he is the one who can help and he is the one we supplicate to and he is the creator of all of the universe and it is his command alone that keeps existence existing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Most High says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Indeed your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He Istawa (rose over) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty). He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His Command. Surely, His is the Creation and Commandment. Blessed be Allah, the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists)!” (Soorah Al-A’raaf 7:54) </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Most High says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators [of themselves]?” (Soorah Toor 52:35)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The mushrikeen pagans/polytheists believed in this but this did not make them enter Islaam. A question of great importance here is why were they not Muslims or enter Islaam because they believed in Allah being the creator.  Allah says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And if you asked them who created them, they would surely say, “Allah.” So how are they deluded?” (Soorah az-Zukhruf 43:87)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And they would believe in all of the points of Ruboobiyyah. Allah the most high says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Say, “Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges [every] matter?” They will say, “Allah,” so say, “Then will you not fear Him?”” (Soorah Yunus 10:31)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah is the foundation of the other aspects of Tawheed so when this established Allah is the master and creator then by default it follows he alone is worthy to be worshipped. It was this problem which did not allow the mushriks (polytheists) to enter Islaam and it is this problem the common muslims are failing in today.  Allah the Most High says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And most of them believe not in Allah except while they associate others with Him” (Soorah Yusuf 12:106)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning they believe in Allah as the creator, the provider the one who gives life and death but they worshipped other deities so they believed in Allah but they were still polytheists.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah wal-Ebaadah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is to single out Allah alone in worship. It has been mentioned before the polytheists believed in Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah but they never worshipped Allah alone. So all of our worship should be directed to Allah alone. So our prayers, fasts, sacrifice, and seeking help should all be singled out for Allah alone. No one other than Allah should be called upon, not his prophets, his angels or the righteous or holy people. So if you are directing any form of worship  to anyone other than Allah then you are committing shirk hence a mushrik and you will be expelling yourself outside the fold of Islaam. Allah said, Say, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah , Lord of the worlds.” (Soorah al-A’naam 6:162)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and his saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>“And whoever invokes besides Allah another deity for which he has no proof – then his account is only  with his Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed.” (Soorah al-Mu’minoon 23:117)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And it was Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah concerning which the prophets and Messengers argued and fought with the polytheists as they would say we believe in the one all master and creator but they would associate false deities in the worship of Allah and they would say, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Unquestionably, for Allah is the pure religion. And those who take protectors besides Him [say], “We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allah in position.” Indeed, Allah will judge between them concerning that over which they differ. Indeed, Allah does not guide he who is a liar and [confirmed] disbeliever.” (Soorah az-Zumar 39:3)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence the Prophet and messengers were sent to call to the pure tawheed. Allah the most high said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And We sent not before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that, “There is no deity except Me, so worship Me.” (Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:25)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And the polytheists of olden times were a lot better than the mushrik (poytheists) of the current time as in the past even at times of calamities they would call on Allah. Allah says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And when they board a ship, they supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, at once they associate others with Him” (Soorah al-Ankaboot 29:65)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whereas the mushriks of today even if they are on their death beds they call upon other than Allah thus proving to be worse than the mushrikeen of the past. The current day Muslims oppress Allah’s worship so much so that they go to the graves of people asking them for help, sacrificing in their name, organizing gatherings of songs and dances on the anniversaries of holy saints hoping to receive reward and their intercession They spend days at holy tombs like the shirk infested sites of Dhata Darbar, the grave of Ali Hujwairee, kissing the graves and sacrificing food for them and they try to eat the soil and sand around the graves of these holy people believing it to be blessed. They bow and prostrate to these graves and holy shrines and even offer prayers towards them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sometimes they circumbulate these graves just as we do tawaaf of the house of Allah and they ask the inhabitants of the graves for help by pleading to them  for their aid and assistance and all of this is shirk and the worst crime. These people are so misguided and ignorant that they are in the grave depths darkness in  committing the biggest crime and sin a man could ever commit. May Allaah save us. Ameen</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And who is more astray than he who invokes besides Allah those who will not respond to him until the Day of Resurrection, and they, of their invocation, are unaware. And when the people are gathered [that Day], they [who were invoked] will be enemies to them, and they will be deniers of their worship.” (Soorah Ahqaf 46:5-6)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah says these people are not capable of helping themselves let alone helping you. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And if Allah touches you with harm, none can remove it but He, and if He touches you with good, then He is Able to do all things.” (Soorah al-Anaam 6:17)</strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Tawheed Asmaa was-Sifaat</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To believe in the names and attributes of Allah as has been mentioned in the Qu’ran and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah. So we take these attributes as they are without Tahreef (distortion) and we also accept the attributes by knowing their meaning. Nor should we do Ta’weel (figuratively explain them), nor should we give them Tashbeeh (resemblance) to the creation nor mention examples as Allah said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.” (Soorah ash-Shuraa 42:11)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So it is obligatory on a Muslim to mention the attributes just as Allah and His Messenger mentioned them without any addition or omission as Allah said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do.” (Soorah al-A’raaf 7:180)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And those who disbelieve in Allah’s names and attributes they are disbelievers as Allah said, “Thus have We sent you to a community before which [other] communities have passed on so you might recite to them that which We revealed to you, while they disbelieve in the Most Merciful. Say, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“He is my Lord; there is no deity except Him. Upon Him I rely, and to Him is my return.” (Soorah ar-Ra’d 13:30)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah has established these attributes for himself so Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jam’ah establish them for him and deny attributes of defectfor him and in establishing and denying these attributes it is based on the Qu’ran and Sunnah. Allah said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“The Most Beneficent (Allah) Istawa (rose over) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty).” (Soorah TaHa 20:5)</strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Methodology of Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah the Names and Attributes of Allah </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> The methodology of Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah from the Salaf us-Saaleh and those who follow them, is to affirm the Names and Attributes of Allah as they have been reported in the Book and the Sunnah. Their methodology is built upon the following principles:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1.  They affirm the Names and Attributes of Allah as reported in the Book and the Sunnah with the apparent meaning indicated by the words. They do not interpret them with other than apparent meanings nor do they deny the meanings of the words and what they indicate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> 2.   They negate any likeness of the Attributes of Allah to the attributes of the creation, as He, the Most High, says:<strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.” (ash-shuraa (42): 11)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> 3.  They do not go beyond that which has been reported in the Book and the Sunnah regarding the affirmation of the Names and Attributes of Allaah. They affirm that which Allaah and His Messenger have affirmed and they negate that which Allaah and His Messenger have negated. They remain silent about that which Allaah and His Messenger have not spoken about.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> 4.   They believe that the texts regarding the Names and Attributes are from the muhkam (clear, decisive verses), whose meaning and explanation is understood and that they are not from the mutashaabihaat (unclear). So they do not withhold from mentioning the meaning of the Attributes, as they have been accused by those who lie against them and those who are ignorant of their manhaj from amongst the current day writers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> 5.  They withhold from mentioning how the Attributes of Allaah, and they do not go into these matters.</span></p>
