<p style="text-align: justify;"><iframe width="800" height="800" src="https://www.salafiri.com/wp-content/plugins/pdf-viewer-for-wordpress/web/viewer-shortcode.php?file=http://www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-Points-in-Response-to-The-Piteous-Video-of-The-Hanafi-Fiqh-Channel-on-Shaikh-al-Albani-Weakening-Hadith-in-Sahih-al-Bukhari.pdf&download=true&print=true&fullscreen=true&share=true&zoom=true&open=true&logo=true&pagenav=true&find=true#locale=en-US&page=&zoom=auto"></iframe>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In response to the first video uploaded by the Hanafi fiqh channel <em><strong>(HFC) </strong></em>they presented that Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani declared a hadith weak in Sahih al-Bukhari.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is the video in question, they have titled it as &#8216;</span><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>Albani Weakens Hadith of Sahih Al-Bukhari- Part 1&#8242;</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT22e4LRevg&amp;t=87s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT22e4LRevg&amp;t=87s</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The youtube video spans approximately 5 and a half minutes without the name of the presenter. The attack on Shaikh al-Albani is that he weakens a hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari. The hadith they are referring to is,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">حَدَّثَنِي بِشْرُ بْنُ مَرْحُومٍ، حَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى بْنُ سُلَيْمٍ، عَنْ إِسْمَاعِيلَ بْنِ أُمَيَّةَ، عَنْ سَعِيدِ بْنِ أَبِي سَعِيدٍ، عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏ &#8220;‏ قَالَ اللَّهُ ثَلاَثَةٌ أَنَا خَصْمُهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، رَجُلٌ أَعْطَى بِي ثُمَّ غَدَرَ، وَرَجُلٌ بَاعَ حُرًّا فَأَكَلَ ثَمَنَهُ، وَرَجُلٌ اسْتَأْجَرَ أَجِيرًا فَاسْتَوْفَى مِنْهُ، وَلَمْ يُعْطِ أَجْرَهُ ‏&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari said, narrated to me Bishr bin Marhum, who narrated from Yahya bin Sulaim on the authority of Isma’il bin Umayyah on the authority of Sa’id bin Abi Sa’id on the authority Abu Hurairah on the authority of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who said, &#8220;Allah says, &#8216;I will be against three people on the Day of Resurrection: 1. One who makes a covenant in My Name, but he proves treacherous. 2. One who sells a free person (as a slave) and eats the price. 3. And one who employs a laborer and gets the full work done by him but does not pay him his wages.” (Bukhari, Kitab al-Buyu’a, Bab Ithmi Man Ba’a Hurran, hadith no.2227)</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They say Shaikh al-Albani weakens this Hadith in <em>Da’if al-Jami (al-Saghir)</em> of Hafiz Suyuti and they present a small scan of the grading on the top right of the video.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scan they scantly showed was of this page, where Shaikh al-Albani, according to them weakened this hadith of<em> Sahih al-Bukhari</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Da&#8217;if Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir Wa Ziyadatuhu (p.590 no.4050)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let us now move on to their presentation</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE FIRST POINT &#8211; Ignorant Hanafi Muqallids!</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The presenters of these points are hanafi muqallids, the calamity is that not only are they not scholars, but they are in actual fact &#8211; ignorant blind followers of the hanafi madhab and they have no credentials whatsoever to present these points as they are not scholars. Rather, they adamantly believe they are hanafi muqallids and the job of the muqallid is only but to make taqlid. So we ask them, which hanafi scholar has preceded the hanafi fiqh channel in presenting this point.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If they acknowledge they are ignorant muqallids, why are they exceeding their remit as muqallids of the hanafi madhhab. If they claim the hanafi madhhab allows its followers to do research and present intricate detailed points related to <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>, as well as the array of sciences associated with Bukhari combined with the details of the science of hadith, then show us which hanafi scholars has  preceded you in allowing you to do this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, as it relates to this point, the hanafi muqallid who presented this point under the Hanafi fiqh channel, contradictory to his madhhab, reads a hadith from <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> with a screen image of bookcase with dated books. Seriously brothers, how does a hanafi muqallid go from reading a hadith from Bukhari with all those books behind him while he still remains an ignorant hanafi muqallid? Is it not the case that the aim is to feign Islamic knowledge while projecting an academic scholastic approach? I leave you to decide for yourselves. Seriously, what are some hanafi fanatical muqallids doing in bradford trying to talk about <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and the hadith gradings of Shaikh Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani?</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE SECOND POINT &#8211; Why Single out Bukhari?</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani does not and has not categorically graded the hadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> weak in the <em>Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir</em>. Hafiz Suyuti references the hadith to the <em>Musnad</em> of <em>Ahmad</em> (حم) as well as Bukhari (خ) and not just <em>Bukhari</em>, this is the first point to be noted. The video of HFC, surprise surprise, employ their usual &#8216;unique&#8217; tactics and gloss over the fact that the hadith is also in the <em>Musnad</em> of <em>Ahmad</em>. Thus HFC present to the audience the hadith is only in <em>Bukhari</em>, the very same hadith Shaikh al-Albani grades weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In perspective, Hafiz Suyuti includes this hadith in his <em>Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir</em> and references it to <em>Musnad Ahmad</em> and <em>Bukhari</em>. Shaikh al-Albani grades it weak and then HFC come along and say Shaikh al-Albani grades the hadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> weak. This is an exerted effort to direct false impressions against Shaikh al-Albani.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE THIRD POINT &#8211; The Methodology of Shaikh al-Albani</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani applied the methodology of the scholars of hadith to the verification and authentication of hadith. It was not based on wishful thinking or bigoted partisanship, rather it was honest and upright application of the science of hadith. In Part 3 we added the statement of Shaikh al-Albani himself explaining his reasons.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani was known and is still known as a scholar of the Sunnah, who defended and clarified the Sahih hadith from the weak. The HFC video is presented in a repugnant manner attempting to highlight and portray Shaikh al-Albani undermined and discredited <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>. This was also a miserable attempt to malign the Shaikh and equate him with those who rejected and refuted the hadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em> i.e. the Sahihayn. Shaikh al-Albani applied the framework and the established blueprint for researching hadith, their verification and gradings. Therefore, this was a brazen endeavour to discredit Shaikh al-Albani and the Salafi&#8217;s by saying the Sheikh graded hadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As Muslims, we should always research issues with an open, fair and just mind. There should be a clear distinction between the approach of Shaykh al-Albani and the modern day rationalists to the hadith of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>, where the latter only desire to reject and cause doubts pertaining to the Prophetic hadith and the former applies the sciences of hadith based on reading and research.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani said in clarification of position.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I am compelled by academic honesty to express what I believe is correct and to fulfil my duty, as the researcher who has deep knowledge, I hold an academic reality which was mentioned by Imam al-Shafi&#8217;i who said, &#8216;Allah has decreed that no book should be perfect except His Book,&#8217; therefore some of the scholars objected to some words that were erroneously inserted by some of the narrators in some Sahih ahadith.&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (Riyadh: Maktabah al-Ma&#8217;arif, 1422H/2002c) 2:5-6)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE FOURTH POINT- Shaykh al-Albani&#8217;s View on the Status of the Sahihayn</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, this point is further emphasised why the overwhelming number of statements of Shaykh al-Albani in defence, veneration and propagation of the lofty status and calibre of the two Sahihyan i.e. <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em>. Shaikh al-Albani himself said</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;How can the Sahihayn have the same status (as the Sunans), they (the Sahihahyn) are the most authentic books after the book of Allah with the agreement of the Muslim Scholars from the Muhaddithin and others. They have superiority over the books of Sunan as they collated the most authentic ahadith as the Sahihs. They separated and left the weak ahadith and those with objectionable texts, which they based on strong principles and intricate conditions. They had unprecedented success, such that was not given to those after them who collected Sahih ahadith from the likes of Ibn Khuzaimah, Ibn Hibban, al-Hakim and others.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">It has become a well known and common understanding that a hadith transmitted by the al-Shaykhayn or one of them has passed the test of authenticity and thus is sound and authentic without any deficincy, and this is the principle we also hold. </span>However, this does not mean that every letter, word or phrase in the Sahihayn has a similar status to that which is in the Quran, and that it is not possible for the narrators to have made a mistake and error. Neither do we believe any book is free from error except the book of Allah&#8230;.&#8221;</em> (Muqaddimah Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah p.22-23, see scan below)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Muqaddimah Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah (p.22-23)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani highlights his respect for Imam Bukhari and his Sahih by titling his summary of it as <em>&#8216;Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari&#8217;</em> which shows his respect and love for Imam Bukhari by calling him al-Imam, compare this to the presentation of HFC. Imam al-Albani also said <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> has the status of being unanimously accepted with consensus throughout the ages (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (1:8)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Sahih al-Bukhari with his majestic nature has been universally accepted by the Scholars throughout the ages as I have mentioned in the introduction.&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (2:4)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear Readers, you have read the status and position of Bukhari and the Sahihayn according to Shaikh al-Albani from his Muqaddimah of <em>Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah</em> and his <em>Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari</em>. The former, was printed by a Hanafi Deobandi publishing house in Karachi Pakistan. We also find from this excerpt the view of Shaikh al-Albani, his reverence for the Sahihayn is not what the HFC falsely presents when they distort this presentation and say Shaikh al-Albani </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;attacked&#8221;</span> <span style="color: #000000;">this hadith (video timestamp 2:44). Do you see the deception, gross distortion and deliberate misrepresentation?</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE FIFTH POINT &#8211; Shaikh al-Albani did not Grade this Hadith in Bukhari Weak!</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have already mentioned the reference in question relates to <em>Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir</em> which also shows the reference to <em>Musnad Ahmad</em>, so the Shaikh did not categorically grade the hadith in Bukhari to be weak. Shaikh al-Albani in his notes to his <em>Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari</em> discusses the chain and the narrator in question i.e. Yahya bin Sulaim and mentions the views of the Scholars concerning him. Shaikh al-Albani says,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I say, this hadith is a lone report of Yahya bin Sulaim..&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (2:73 no.1050)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani also discusses some of the contentious narrations and additional wordings to ahadith in the introduction of <em>Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari</em> and he mentions this hadith as one of the ones there is a issue with. However, nowhere at all does he grade them weak and categorically says they are Da&#8217;if. This is further supported by two later works of Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s where he further discusses this hadith, which is to proceed, In Sha&#8217; Allah.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE SIXTH POINT &#8211; The Actual View of Shaikh al-Albani Regarding This Hadith</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s discusses this hadith in two separate works which are later than the <em>Da&#8217;if al-Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir</em> and hence serve as his last view and hence regarding of this hadith. It must be noted, and this will only be understood and appreciated by the students of hadith, not by the hanafi muqallids, that there is is a difference in saying the hadith is weak and the isnad is weak. This is not unknown to even the beginner student of hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The View of Shaikh al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani references the hadith in <em>Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir</em> to his <em>Irwa al-Ghalil Fi Takhrij Ahadith Manar al-Sabil</em> (no.1489). In the Irwa dear readers, low and behold Shaikh al-Albani grades this Hadith <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hasan</strong></span> to close to it. (see scan below)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Irwa al-Ghalil (5:308 no.1489)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find Shaikh al-Albani grading this hadith to be Hasan or very close to it, when he said <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>&#8220;Hasan or Qaribu minhu&#8221;</em></span> An interesting point to note here is that sheikh al-Albani himself references the hadith to <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> in the referencing. So, dear readers, we see that Shaikh al-Albani graded the very same Hadith Hasan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I ask where are the HFC boys now? The grading of Hasan or very close to it is an indication that there is a concern with the chain.  The hanafi scholars themselves have said similar things like this, that not every hadith in the Sahihayn is 100% Sahih and some of them are not of the highest degree of Sahih. The revered hanafi Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah has said this, which has been reiterated by the likes of G.F.Haddad and others. In Sha&#8217; Allah we shall reproduce this later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s goes onto discuss and scrutinise the hadith whilst presenting his research (Irwa al-Ghalil (5:308-311 no.1489). He concludes by saying, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the ISNAD i.e. CHAIN is weak</span> but <span style="color: #ff0000;">the hadith is Hasan</span> and as for it being Sahih then this has phases. (Irwa (5:310). Shaikh al-Albani looks at the view of Hafiz Ibn Hajr and his reasoning and presents his answers. (Irwa al-Ghalil (5:311)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The View of Shaikh al-Albani in Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the footnotes to the Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari Shaikh al-Albani said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;<em>I say, this hadith is a lone report of Yahya bin Sulaim and he is al-Taifi. The Scholars differed with regards to his veracity and they had three views. Some of them said he was trustworthy like Ibn Ma&#8217;in, some said he was just weak like Ahmad and others, he said (i.e. Ahmad), &#8220;I wrote hadith from him for one year and he would mix the hadith so I abandoned him, and he has an issue with him.&#8221; Some said he is weak when transmitting only from Ubadiullah bin Umar al-Umari like al-Nasa&#8217;i, who said, &#8220;There is no harm with him and he is rejected in hadith from Ubaidullah bin Umar.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>It seems like this is what al-Hafiz (Ibn Hajr) relied on when he said in Fath al-Bari, &#8220;The final conclusion is that the criticism levied against him is specific to when he narrates from Ubaidullah bin Umar and this hadith is narrated from other than him.&#8221; However this is contrary to what he said with firm conviction in al-Taqrib that he (Yahya bin Sulaim) is, &#8220;Truthful but he has a week memory.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>This is what I (i.e. al-Albani) relied upon because those who outrightly criticised him had more knowledge compared to those who weakened him specifically in the narrations from Ubaidullah bin Umar.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And there is a fourth madhab (or view) which is based on a statement of the author (i.e. al-Bukhari) who said, as mentioned in the biographical note of Abdur Rahman ibn Naf&#8217;e as it is in al-Tahdhib, when he said. &#8220;Whatever al-Humaydi transmits from Yahya bin Sulaim is authentic i.e. Sahih.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">We understand from this that, any transmission from other than al-Humaidi are not authentic and the author (i.e. al-Bukhari) has transmitted this hadith from a route other than al-Humaidi, hence</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">I do not know how to reconcile between this statement and the fact that this hadith is transmitted in the Sahih.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> (For further reading) refer to al-Irwa al-Ghalil (no,1489)&#8221;</span></em> (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (2:73-74 no.1050, see scan below)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (2:73-74)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear Readers, this scrutiny of the hadith, its chain based on the sciences of hadith is very clear and the presentation of Shaikh al-Albani is riddled with justice, fairness and the application of the sciences. In fact, it is so precise and meticulous that Shaikh al-Albani refers to the words of Imam Bukhari himself while scrutinising the hadith. Dear readers, is the statement that <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;The hadith is Hasan or near it&#8221;</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;<em>I do not know how to reconcile between this statement and the fact that this hadith is transmitted in the Sahih,&#8221;</em></span> not fair and just which show the knowledge and stature of Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When we return to the <em>al-Irwa al-Ghalil,</em> Shaikh al-Albani said after citing the views of the Scholars of hadith and their grading of Yahya bin Sulaim,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I say: The summary of these statements is that the narrator is in essence trustworthy however he is weak in terms of his memory, especially in his narrations from Ubaidullah bin Umar and excluded from this is whatever al-Humaidi narrates from him, which is Sahih i.e. authentic. This hadith is not narrated via al-Humaidi from him (i.e. Yahya) and neither is it the one Bukhari transmits and nor has anyone else transmitted it in this manner. I do not know from which angle al-Bukhari transmitted it from him as the understanding of Bukhari&#8217;s earlier statement that anything transmitted from other than al-Humaidi  from him is not authentic.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Hafiz Ibn al-Hajr&#8217;s answer to this statement is unsatisfactory which is mentioned under the explanation of this hadith where he says, &#8220;Yahya bin Sulaim who is al-Taifi, resident of Makkah and the scholars have differed with regards to his authenticity and al-Bukhari does not have any other mawsul hadith except this one from him. The conclusion is that this statement (i.e. of Bukhari) is concerning and specific to his narrations from Ubaidullah him Umar and as such this hadith is not via his route.&#8221; (Irwa al-Ghalil (5:309)</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani then goes onto answer this view of Hafiz Ibn Hajr, in summary he says the scholars said Yahya has a bad memory and those who restrict his hadith from Ubaidullah bin Umar being weak are incorrect because the statements of the scholars are detailed and hence cannot be restricted. Also that a group of scholars including the likes al-Daraqutni have weakened Yahya due to his poor memory is understood as detailed criticism. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani goes onto say that al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr himself has summarised the statements of the scholars when he in <em>al-Taqrib</em> that Yahya bin Sulaim is truthful but had poor memory. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani then alludes to two mistakes of Hafiz ibn Hajr when he first said the hadith was in <em>Sahih Muslim</em> in his <em>Bulugh al-Maram</em> and the second that after Hafiz Ibn Hajr mentions in <em>Muqaddimah Fath al-Bari</em> (p.172 &#8211; Muniriyyah print) in the biographical note of Yahya there is no other hadith from him in <em>al-Bukhari</em> other than this one, he says, <em>&#8220;He has a basis (for this hadith) other than this transmission.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However there is no other basis for this hadith with Bukhari which Ibn Hajr alludes too nor with anyone else. and Allah knows best. (Irwa al-Ghalil (5:309-311), see the scan from Irwa</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr also alludes to the issues pertaining to this hadith as well as the narrator, Yahya bin Sulaim in several places, he says in <em>Fath al-Bari</em>,</span></p>
<blockquote>

The conclusion is that this statement (i.e. of Bukhari) is concerning and specific to his narrations from Ubaidullah him Umar and as such this hadith is not via his route.&#8221; (Fath al-Bari (5:705 no.2227)</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Fath al-Bari (5:705 no.2227)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Hafiz Ibn al-Hajr in his entry in the <em>Tahdhib al-Tahdhib</em> mentions statement of praise and criticism from the scholars of hadith and rijal. At the end of the biographical note he summarised his view by saying, <em>&#8220;I say..&#8221;</em> and then he goes onto mention his conclusion without any specific words but cites the statements from the Imams and Scholars of hadith and rijal who say Yahya was Hasan, truthful, Saleh, his hadith are written, trustworthy, there is no harm in him, and also that he is not strong, he would confuse hadith, weak,  made mistakes in hadith, he did not preserve hadith and had weak memory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr then concludes his entry by saying,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;al-Bukhari said in his Tarikh in the entry of Abdur Rahman bin Naf&#8217;e that whatever al-Humaydi narrates from Yahya bin Sulaim is authentic i.e. Sahih.&#8221;</em> (Tahdhib al-Tahdhib (Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 1415H/1994c) 11:196-197 no.7882)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr then summarises this in his <em>Tarqib</em> and said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Truthful but he has a week memory.&#8221; (Taqrib ul-Tahdhib (Riyadh: Dar ul-A&#8217;simah, 1416H), no.7613 p.1057)</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani was not the first scholar of hadith to critically discuss Yahya bin Sulaim as many great scholars, Imams and critical analysts of Hadith had preceded him. We know this because al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr establishes a whole chapter in his <em>Hadi al-Sari</em> where he mentions the names of narrators who were criticised and were narrators of Sahih al-Bukhari and then proceeds to answer them alphabetically and systematically. (Hadi al-Sari Muqaddimah Fath al-Bari (Riyadh: Dar Tayybah, 1432H/2011c) 2:1002)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Under Yahya bin Sulaim he says,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Yahya bin Sulaim al-Taifi, Resident of Makkah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Ahmad said I heard one hadith from him, Ibn Ma&#8217;in, al-E&#8217;jli, Ibn Sa&#8217;d said he was Thiqah, Abu Hatim said he was was truthful but not a hafiz, Nasa&#8217;i said there is no harm in him and he is munkar al-hadith when narrating from Ubaidullah bin Umar. al-Saji said he made mistakes in the hadith he narrated from Ubaidullah bin Umar. Ya&#8217;qub bin Sufyan said he was a righteous man, there is no harm in his book, if he transmits from his book his hadith are Hasan and if he transmits from memory then know they are denied/rejected.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>I say: The Shaykhan ie Bukhari and Muslim have not transmitted anything from him when he narrated from Ubaidullah bin Umar, and he has no hadith in Bukhari except this one from Ismail bin Umayyah from Sa&#8217;id al-Muqbari from Abu Hurairah from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ &#8220;Allah says, &#8216;I will be against three people.. al-hadith. He has a basis (for this hadith) other than this transmission and hence used the rest for evidence.&#8221; (Hadi al-Sari Muqaddimah Fath al-Bari (Riyadh: Dar Tayybah, 1432H/2011c) 2:1214)</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Hadi al-Sari Muqaddimah Fath al-Bari (2:1214)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We find that even al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr knew that some of the earlier critical analysts scrutinised this narrator and Shaikh al-Albani was not the first. We also learn of Hafiz&#8217;s own grading of Yahya and his reservations about the chain as well as Imam Bukhari&#8217;s statement concerning the transmission of al-Humaydi via Yahya bin Sulaim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We know the issue relates to the memory of Yahya bin Sulaim and perhaps the central issue rests and revolves around Yahya narrating from his book or from memory because he is truthful. al-Hafiz ibn Hajr himself draws conclusion when he cites what Imam Yaqub bin Sufyan said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was a righteous man, there is no harm in his book, if he transmits from his book his hadith are Hasan and if he transmits from memory then know they are denied/rejected.&#8221; (al-Ma&#8217;arifah wa&#8217;l Tarikh (3:51), Hadi al-Sari (2:1214), Tahdhib al-Tahdhib (11:197)</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE EIGHTH POINT &#8211; Imam Bukhari&#8217;s View on Yahya bin Sulaim</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani drew understanding and conclusion from the words of Imam Bukhari himself when he said <em>&#8220;Whatever al-Humaydi transmits from Yahya bin Sulaim is authentic i.e. Sahih.&#8221; </em>Meaning that any other route was understood and considered to be weak. The reader should bare in mind that Shaikh al-Albani based his research on the words of Imam Bukhari himself and yet the HFC attack Shaikh al-Albani! If only the ḥanafi Deobandi muqallids were able to look beyond their hatred and animosity for the Salaf, the Salafi&#8217;s and their scholars, may Allah open their hearts and the hearts of their followers to the truth, Amin</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, this point, that Imam al-Bukhari preferred this transmission i.e. from al-Humaydi from Yahya bin Sulaim and held it to be authentic is further evidenced in his <em>Tarikh al-Kabir</em> where he cites a chain from al-Humaydi from Yahya bin Sulaim from Ibn Khuthaim from Abdur Rahman bin Naf&#8217;e from Abu Hurairah. (Kitab Tarikh al-Kabir (Hyderabad: Da&#8217;irah al-Ma&#8217;arif al-Uthmaniyyah, 1957c) 5:356-358 no.1135)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani has reiterated this elucidation of Imam al-Bukhari when he mentioned this very hadith in the introduction of his <em>Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari</em> when he said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Its chain includes a narrator who was differed over (by the scholars with regards to his authenticity). What is accepted is that he had a poor memory. Al-Bukhari himself indicates that the narration of the one who he narrates this hadith from is not valid. You can refer to his statement there, so that you may be prudent with regard to matters of your religion and the hadiths of your Prophet.&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (2:8)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE NINTH POINT &#8211; Many Scholars of Hadith have Weakened, Criticised and Disagreed with Ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari, Why Only Attack Shaikh al-Albani?</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many Imams, Scholars of Hadith and critical analysts have criticised numerous ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari as well as the narrators. From the likes of Imam Muslim, Imam Abu Zur&#8217;ah, Imam Abu Hatim, Imam Abdur Rahman ibn Hatim, Imam Dhuhali, Imam al-Daraqutni, Imam Abu Dawud, Imam al-Tirmidhi, Imam al-Nasa&#8217;i, Imam al-Bayhaqi, Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Hafiz al-Dhahabi, al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr and many more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In fact Imam al-Daraqutni authored a whole book scrutinising the hadith of Sahih al-Bukhari called <em>&#8216;al-Tattabu&#8217;a&#8217;</em>, he had contention with approximately 78 ahadith. al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr responded to every claim of Imam al-Daraqutni and devoted a large part of his <em>Hadi al-Sari</em> clarifying the issues and concerns over <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>, the ahadith, the text and narrators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Abu Mas&#8217;ud al-Dimashqi (d.401H) wrote &#8216;<em>Atraf al-Sahihayn&#8217;</em>, in which he contested some of the hadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari,</em> al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr answered his claims in <em>Hadi al-Sari</em> (1:568+). Interestingly Hafiz Abu Mas&#8217;ud al-Dimashqi also answered some of the contentions of Imam al-Daraqutni.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Abu Ali al-Ghassani (d.498H) authored &#8216;<em>al-Tanbiyyah Alal Awham al-Waqi&#8217;ah Fil Sahihayn Min Qibal al-Ruwah&#8217;</em>, where he also scrutinised the chains and narrators in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>, al-Hafiz Ibn Hajr also answered his points in <em>Hadi al-Sari</em> (1:568+). Some researchers have attributed another book to Hafiz Abu Ali al-Ghassani in his critical analysis of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> which titled, <em>&#8216;al-Taqayyid al-Mahmal.&#8217;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Imam and erudite scholar, Hafiz Ibn Abdul Hadi said the wording of one hadith in Bukhari was wrong. (Tanqih al-Tahqiq (2:104). Hafiz Ibn al-Jawzi went to the extent of declaring some hadith of the Sahihayn to be fabricated!! and there are many other examples we can cite.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The hanafi scholars themselves have weakened so many ahadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari </em>that it is horrendously hypocritical to focus on Shaykh al-Albani and turn a blind eye to your own <em>&#8216;Buzurgs.&#8217; </em>Well this is not something HFC should be worried about because we will do this for you In Sha&#8217;Allah, since you decided to be hero&#8217;s. Some hanafi scholars of the past and present have weakened some of the narrators in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> while others have weakened some of the ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is strange how the HFC have singled out Shaykh al-Albani for their attack while turning a bigoted blind eye towards their own scholars. More information regarding this is to follow. In Sha&#8217; Allah and then we will see how HFC responds when he uncover and reveal centuries of criticism levied against Sahih al-Bukhari by the hanafi and deobandi scholars past and present. Yes and I will be mentioning <em>&#8216;Sahih al-Bihari&#8217;</em>!!!!</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE TENTH POINT &#8211; Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s Research and Analysis on the Hadith of Sahih al-Bukhari Around Was on 10 or so Ahadith</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point here is that Shaikh al-Albani applied the hadith sciences, his research and the understanding of the earlier scholars and critical analysts to<em> Sahih al-Bukhari</em>, and he already mentioned that he did not specifically devote time to check <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> due to its station. However, when he did, he found roughly between 10-12 ahadith he had concerns with and they varied in their nature as I have mentioned in a previous part.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholars I mentioned the previous point,  In each case we find their criticism and scrutiny was limited to a very small number of hadiths, and it was always based on academic, fair-minded, methodological research. So then why is there this big fuss about Shaikh al-Albani attacking <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em>, the books which has such acceptance they said and also make youtube videos titled, <em><strong>&#8216;Al-Albani weakens hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari.&#8217;</strong></em></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE ELEVENTH POINT &#8211; The Hanafi&#8217;s like Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah and His View of Sahih al-Bukhari </strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is known Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah &#8211; the little Kawthari, had a lot of love for the deobandi elders and this is a stark reality which is acknowledged by everyone. Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah venerated and lauded the Deobandi scholars, he praised them and mentioned their virtues and service to Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s grading of this hadith under discussion was Hasan or close to it. So was Shaikh al-Albani the only one who declared Hadith in Bukhari as Hasan? The answer is no, as others before as well as the likes of Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah said the same</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">G F. Haddad said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The fact is that they are all sahih but not all of them reach the same high degree of sahih. This is in essence what al-Dhahabi concluded concerning the few narrators of the Sahihayn whose grading was questioned: “The narration of one such as those, does not go below the rank of hasan which we might call the lowest rank of the sahih.” Shaykh Abu Ghudda comments in the margin:</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">“This is an explicit confirmation that al-Bukhari and Muslim did not confine themselves, in the narrations of their respective books, only to narrate hadiths that have the highest degree of sihha.”<span style="color: #000000;">(Emphasis mine) </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;">(Living Islam website)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These points have been raised before by the likes of Hasan Saqqaf and co which were reproduced in the shambled book al-Albani Unveiled authored by Sayf ad-Din Ahmed ibn Muhammad Amirul Islam, which was throughly refuted.

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Al-Albani Unveiled (p.7)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Everyone knows who Hasan Saqqaf is, he is an Asharite Shafi who was staunch and bigoted. He spent day and night attacking Shaikh al-Albani and the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah. Since then he has manifested himself as a Khariji open clear cut Rafidhi Shi&#8217;i. When the likes of the author of Al-Albani Unveiled praised him and lauded him titles like Shaykh and Scholar of Hadith. These people do not mention his names nowadays, I wonder why? When you attack the Sunnah and its people, this is what happens. These are the elders of the likes of HFC. The likes of Hasan  Saqqaf who attacked and reviled the illustrious companions, yet you talk about Shaikh al-Albani attacking the Sahabah Kiram!!!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Look at the incredible immaturity of the compiler of al-Albani Unveiled, he says, <em>&#8220;Little does he know that this hadith has been narrated by Ahmad and Bukhari from Abu Hurayra.&#8221;</em> Now who will enlighten this genius that the <em>Jam&#8217;e al-Saghir</em> itself has references (i.e. Ramuz) to Ahmad and Bukhari in key form as i have mentioned previously.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani said about the likes of Hasan Saqqaf and his ilk,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;At the other end of the spectrum, s</em><em>ome writers have no respect at all for as-Sahihayn, and they reject its ahadith, any that are not in accordance with their rational thinking and their whims and desires, such as al-Saqqaaf, Hisan and (Muhammad) Ghazzali. I have responded to both groups in more than one place.&#8221;</em> (Silsilah Ahadith al-Sahihah (Riyadh: Maktabah al-Ma&#8217;arif, 1415H/1995c) 6:93, no.2540, see scan below)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Silsilah Ahadith al-Sahihah (6:93, no.2540)</strong></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE THIRTEENTH POINT &#8211; The Hanafi Scholars and Sahih al-Bukhari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since the HFC have opened this bab, everything is going to pass through. We will show in the forthcoming parts the dealings of the hanafi scholars of the past and present, in how they criticised, scrutinised and weakened hadith in Sahih a-Bukhari as well heavily criticised the narrators of Bukhari. How they used various garbs and disguises to attack the Muhadithin and Sahih al-Bukhari themselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The HFC only attempt to discredit <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> themselves by causing false aspersions and distorted presentations. Dear readers, the biggest attack on <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> is rejecting its hadith knowing very well they are clear and authentic whilst hiding behind madhhabs or the statements of Imams. Dear readers, the HFC was active in making two videos against Shaikh al-Albani because he allegedly weakened hadith in Bukhari, but is it unfair to say the biggest attack and rejection of <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> is dismissing and not acting on its hadith, and there are so many examples which are well known the deobandi hanafis outrightly reject and dismiss</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rest assured, we will be looking at all of your scholars, past and present with regards to their shenanigans and playful tactics with the Sahihayn.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE FOURTEENTH POINT &#8211; Only the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is Infallible</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This point relates to the fact that Shaikh al-Albani is fallible, despite being a great Imam, a Hafiz, a Muhaddith and a formidable Scholar of Hadith and its sciences in this century. If Shaikh al-Albani made a mistake, he made a mistake, we do not blindly defend him or distort reality, as this is what Shaikh al-Albani taught us, that we do not have partisanship and blind imitation of anyone other than the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So even if Shaikh al-Albani scrutinised a hadith in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and indicated weakness in it, then he has a right to do based on academic research due to his ijtihad and knowledge. So he is either wrong or right i.e. he gets one reward or two rewards. This is what the scholars do, however on the other hand the despondent detractors on one hand claim they are hanafi deobandi muqallids yet on the other hand have titles like Mufti, Muhaddith and Shaykh ul-Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The issue is, when a group of muqallids attempt to publicly malign, vilify and attack Shaikh al-Albani with the sole aim of propagating hate and animosity, it is only fair we look at the allegations with a fair, just and open mind. We present the facts while separating the truth from the lies, bias and distorted youtube videos.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE FIFTEENTH POINT &#8211; Conclusion:- Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s View Framework, Outlook and Reprimand of the Despondent Antagonists &amp; His View of the Sahihahyn</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since the aim of the Hanafi fiqh channel was to discredit Shaikh al-Albani and the Salafi&#8217;s, It is pertinent to cite more statements of Shaikh al-Albani from his various works to show the readers, the methodology of this great Shaykh. Shaykh al-Albani was asked,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Question: Are there weak hadith in Bukhari and Muslim?</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Answer: This affair is as Imam al-Shafi&#8217;i said Allah has decreed that no book should be perfect except His Book. Bukhari and Muslim took great care and diligence in the Din of Allah and thus they collated what they considered to be authentic from the ahadith of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>To the extent that it is authentically reported about al-Imam al-Bukhari that he had memorised 600,000 ahadith of which 200,000 were authentic and from them he selected 8,000 to be placed in his Sahih.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>This is why you will not find even in this time a book which is so pristine as to the likes of these two books, however we know only the Prophets are infallible but this does not mean you will not find one letter, a phrase or even a short hadith to be incorrect in Sahih al-Bukhari. However, neither does this mean the ahadith in Bukhari and Muslims cannot be used as evidence.&#8221;</em> (al-Masa&#8217;il al-Ilmiyyah al-Fatawa al-Shari&#8217;ah &#8211; Fatawa al-Shaikh al-Allamah Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani Fil Madinah Wal Imarat (Tanta: Dar al-Dhiya, 1427/2006) p.212, Fatawa al-Imarat no.113, see scan below)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Imam al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim did their duty of selecting these ahadith that they included in al-Sahihayn from among hundreds of thousands of hadiths, which was an immense effort. Therefore it does no service to knowledge and it is not wise at all for me to focus my efforts on examining as-Sahihayn and ignore the ahadith to be found in the four Sunans and elsewhere, which are not known whether they are Sahih or Da‘if. But during my academic research, I came across some ahadith in a-Sahihayn, or in one of the two, and realised that there are some ahadith that are Da‘if! But whoever has doubts about my ruling concerning some ahadith, let him refer to Fath al-Bari, where he will find very many things that al-Hafiz Ahmad ibn Hajr al-Asqalani critiqued. </em>(Fatawa al-Shaykh al-Albani (Cairo: Maktabah Turath al-Islami, 1414/1994) p. 565)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We also also know Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s view of the Sahihhayn, its ranks and status as well as the hadith contained therein, he was consistent throughout his life and hence we can go as far back as 1969, almost 30 years before he passed away. in 1389/1969 Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s checking of the <em>Mukhtar Sahih Muslim</em> by Imam al-Mundhiri was published, in the introduction he said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This is with the exception of the Sahihayn which have been universally accepted by the Scholars and being safe and free from weak and objectionable ahadith, which are numerous in the books of the Sunnah like the four Sunans and others.&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar Sahih Muslim (Beirut, Maktab al-Islami, 1407/1987), ed. 6th, p.6, see scan below)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Mukhtasar Sahih Muslim (p.6)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, what has preceded is the reality regarding Shaikh al-Albani and his alleged attack on the Sahih of Imam al-Bukhari and his grading the hadith weak in it. The other examples posed by the HFC will similarly lack any form of lateral thinking due to their muqallid hanafi mindsets coupled with tahazzub, ta&#8217;assub and blind ardent fanaticism for their madhab. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This fanatical extremism is not shy of hatred and animosity for Ahl al-Sunnah, the Ahl al-Hadith and the Salafi&#8217;s. These self styled young brothers, who admittedly are lay muqallids, making youtube videos, with &#8216;books&#8217; behind them as their screen are most certainly pushing way beyond their pay grades. Some friendly advice to them is to humble themselves and realise and know their worth, maqam and manzilah with regards to these sacred sciences and the great scholars of this Ummah, like Allamah Rabbani Shaikh al-Muhaddith Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani, Rahimahullah.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Shaikh al-Albani on the Bigoted Hanafi Asharite Fanatics &#8211; Between al-Kawthari, Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah, The Ghumari&#8217;s, Mahmud Sa&#8217;id Mamduh, Muhammad Ghazzali and Modern Mutazilites Hadith Rejectors and Madhabists</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I leave you with these succinct and pertinent words of Allamah al-Albani</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I have mentioned these examples so that readers may be prudent with regard to matters of their religion and will have a clear understanding of the hadiths of their Prophet and be certain of the soundness of the report mentioned above: “Allah has decreed that no book should be perfect except His Book.” Thus they will also not be deceived by what has been written by some of those who want to stir up trouble against us, such as the ignorant muqallids and madhhabists who talk nonsense about what they do not know, say what they do not know and ignore what they already know. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Examples of such people are the likes of The extreme one from Halab Abu Guddah &#8211; the little Kawthari, similar to his likes the Egyptian despondent Mahmud Sa&#8217;id and whoever is upon their way. One may read my refutations upon the two in some of my introductions to various books, for example my introduction to Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah, my introduction to Adab al-Zufaf Fi Sunnah al-Mutahharah, and my new introduction to Mukhtasar Sahih Muslim of Hafiz al-Mundhiri with my checking which is under print and is due to be released soon In Sha Allah with my new notes and checking.   </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And on the other hand there are some people who have made some contributions in some fields of knowledge or in the field of da‘wah (calling people to Islam) – even if it is on the basis of their own understanding – who show audacity in refuting that which they do not like of sahih ahadith, which they regard as da‘if despite the consensus of the ummah in accepting that hadith. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>They do not reject it on the basis of sound principles of this noble branch of knowledge and the rules of knowledge according to the muhaddithin, or because of some doubts that they developed about one of the narrators of that hadith, for they have no knowledge of that and they have total disregard for the knowledge of people who specialise in that field. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Rather they base their argument on their own whims and desires or on their education that was far removed from correct Iman which is based on the Qur’an and authentic Sunnah, in taqlid of the Orientalists and the enemies of the Din, and those who imitate them of westernised people such as Abu Rayyah al-Misri, Izz al-Din Baliq al-Lubnani, Shaikh Muhammad al-Ghazzali and others who have afflicted this ummah in recent times, who reject authentic ahadith on the basis of whims and desires, and cause confusion to some Muslims because of the fallacious arguments they present. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Similar to this are those people who are occupied with this knowledge but are overpowered with bigoted partisanship (Ta&#8217;assub) for their madhabs, following their desires such that they have weakened so many authentic ahadith, For examples the likes of al-Kawthari, Abdullah al-Ghumari, his brother Shaikh Ahmad, Shaikh Isma&#8217;il al-Ansari, so whoever wants to know anything about this then let him refer to my introduction to Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah and the introduction of my books Adab al-Zufaf Fi Sunnah Mutahharah and others where you will find the most surprisingly astonishing things. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Allah, may He be exalted, is the One Whose help we seek and ask Him to protect the Sunnah from the hands of the ignorant, those who would tamper with it and the ignorant who follow whims and desires; we ask Him to make us recognise the efforts of the early imams in service of the Sunnah, who laid out for us principles and rules for knowing what is sound and what is not. Whoever adheres to those principles and rules will be following a clear way, and whoever deviates from that will go far astray. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>And May allah have mercy on al-Imam al-Bukhari who gained unprecedented precedence in this field and thus compiled this al-Sahih, and selected hadith from thousands of hadith of the Prophet ﷺ, May Allah reward with an immensely good reward on behalf of Islam and the Muslims.&#8221;</em> (Mukhtasar Sahih al-Imam al-Bukhari (p.8-10)</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>READ <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/clearing-the-allegations-and-attack-on-allamah-rabbani-shaikh-muhammad-nasir-al-din-al-albani-1420h-part-1-the-hanafi-fiqh-channel/">Part 1</a>, <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/clearing-the-allegations-and-attack-on-allamah-rabbani-shaikh-muhammad-nasir-al-din-al-albani-1420h-part-2-the-hanafi-fiqh-channel-hanafi-asharis-on-the-hadith-in-sahih-mus/">Part 2</a></span></strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Hanafi Fiqh Channel have produced two videos showing that Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani weakened ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari. As I mentioned in the previous part, we will address the issues a little later In Shāʿ Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Following on from the previous part where I showed the position and outlook of Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah and his understanding of Sahih Muslim-the authenticity of the hadith contained therein, it showed his blind fanaticism for the hanafi madhab and his true position of the hadith in Sahih Muslim. This was an answer to the second video produced by the Hanafi Fiqh channel wherein the speaker talks about Sahih Muslim. (please refer to part 2)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both speakers in their respective parts digress to mention some comical points throughout their videos. They contained cheap shots and immature presentation of points. For example, they said we know the Salafi group attacks the four Imams, we did not know they would attack Sahih al-Bukhari and other such illiterate type of points. We assure you, do not worry, since you have opened this closet your hanafi skeletons will most certainly come to haunt you. More on this In Shāʿ Allāh in the forthcoming parts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will however overlook these points and not stoop to their level, whereas our intent is to bring clarity to these matters and the mindset, these young brothers wish to portray of Shaikh Allamah Rabbani Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here is another example how juvenile and childish these people are. When they mention Shaikh al-Albani’s name they say Nasir ud Din, when we all know the Shaikhs full name is Muhammad Nasir ud Din. This is the level of these people, such is their hatred and animosity that they can not even bring themselves to say the name Muhammad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Anyway, Shaikh al-Albani talks about the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and he looked at how some of the hadith which did not fulfill the criteria. He talks about Imams before him, like Imam Daraqutni, Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Hafiz Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, Hafiz Ibn Hajr and Hafiz al-Mundhiri, who also spoke about some of the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and their wording.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani gives three examples to highlight what he refers to when he did a generic gloss of the Sahihayn, and it is not as the detractors make out, that he scrutinized and analysed the whole of Sahih al-Bukhari. Shaikh al-Albani clearly says his contention is with just about 10 ahadith and that Imam Daraqutni questions 12 or so hadith from the Sahih of Imam Bukhari.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani clearly said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“Therefore, it is not wisdom or knowledge for me to focus on critiquing the Sahihayn and abandon the hadith in the 4 sunans.” (watch video)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“If a person questions my judgements of some of the hadiths, then they can look at Fath al-Bari and they will find many many things that are criticized by Hafiz Ahmad bin Hajr al-Asqalani.” (watch video)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“This Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani clarified in his Sharh (Fath al-Bar) many mistakes in the ahadith of Bukhari…” (watch video)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the three examples Shaikh al-Albani talks about is the hadith of Ibn Abbas radiAllahu Anhuma concerning the marriage of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to Maymunah radhiallahu anha while he was in ihram, he said the hadith is authentic in terms of its chains but the interpretation is of Ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhuma. Other ahadith that are critiqued are based on the narrators in the chain, this is the second type. With the third type being additional words added to the hadith to indicate a meaning that were not actually transmitted, like the hadith of the limbs radiating light due to being frequently washed in Wudu.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These are just some of the points that relate to this intricate science, and it is most certainly not for every individual to delve into it. This is more applicable and pertinent to those who proudly claim and openly attest they are hanafi muqallids ie in other words, they are strikingly ignorant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This being said, other modern day writers in academia have also alluded to Shaikh al-Albani weakening hadith in Bukhari, at least three different writers. Yet the same writers have strangely overlooked and ignored the criticism and views of Hafiz Ibn Hajr in his al-Fath and Imam Daraqutni’s queries. One of the aforementioned writers, in all fairness did look at Daraqutni’s queries and presented his arguments. Interestingly a fourth writer asserts Sahih al-Bukhari is the backbone of Salafi Islam, as the writer suggests. This is not far from the truth as Shaikh al-Albani was one of the most famous proponents of Salafiyyah, since when have the modern day Hanafi Ash’arites shown any care or love for Sahih al-Bukhari, except they worked on it to defend their Madhhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such writers and others like Hamza Malyabari and of his ilk suggest Shaikh al-Albani’s critical analysis of hadith was not in line with the methods of the earlier scholars. This is another farcical allegation which has been rebutted by many writers. The following book, being just one example dismantles and dismisses this embarrassing claim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-8087 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=386%2C685" alt="DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=169%2C300 169w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=768%2C1365 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?resize=576%2C1024 576w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DSLAOYKXkAIFxVp.jpg-large.jpg?w=1152 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Zakariyyah bin Ghulam Qadir Pakistani</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">(pp.280, Riyadh: Maktabah al-Ma&#8217;arif Lil-Nashr wal-Tawzi&#8217;a, 1431H/2010ce) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being, such matter are based of Ijtihad in relation to understanding the intricacies of this magnificent science, and only those who are free from the shackles of extreme blind partisanship and destructive fanaticism can look at such matters objectively. This excludes the extreme muqallids who vehemently acknowledge they are ignorant and are obligated to perform taqlid, yet they are the ones making youtube videos, reading the ahadith from Bukhari to show the inconsistencies and approach of the Salafi’s but they themselves reject the hadith in Bukhari when it is time to accept and act on them. This is most reprehensible!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Low and behold, here is the clarification from Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani when he was asked if he graded hadith in Bukhari weak and if the Scholars before him preceded him in it. Please watch it and be sincere without bigotry or sectarian partisanship.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>READ PREVIOUS PART  &#8211;</strong> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-36-fact-not-fiction-the-mawlid-was-not-celebrated-by-the-salaf-us-saleh-a-reply-to-the-barelwi-asrar-rashid/">The Mawlid Papers – Part 36 – Fact not Fiction: The Mawlid Was Not Celebrated by the Salaf us-Saleh; A Reply to the Barelwi Asrar Rashid</a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bukhīt al-Mutī‘ī Al-Hanafī the Qadī of Alexandria (Egypt) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When Umar bin Al-Hasan famously known as Abū Khattāb bin Dahiyyah whilst on his travels to Khurasān in 604H visited Irbil he saw the the kind Malik Mu&#8217;azam Muzaffar Al-Dīn bin Zain Al-Dīn was liked the Mawlid Al-Nabi. So with the intention of pleasing the king he authored a book called &#8216;al-Tanwīr Fī Mawlid Al-Sirāj Al-Munīr&#8217; which he read to the King himself. When he authored the book, Malik Mu&#8217;azam gave him 1000 Dinars.&#8221;</em> [Ahsan Al-Kalām Fimā Yata‘laq Bil-Sunnah Wa&#8217;l Bid‘ah Minal Ahkām [pp.70]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Sufi authored a book whilst hiding the truth and cloaking it with futile interpretations in establishing and the virtue of the Mawlid. He called it <em>&#8220;Al-Tanwīr Fi Mawlid Al-Bashir an-Nazir&#8221;</em> and eventually received 1000 dinars. Refer to Al-Bidāyah wan Nihāyah (13:124), Al-Hawī lil-Fatâwa (1:189), Wafyat al-A&#8217;yān (4:119). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The sufi&#8217;s full name was Umar bin Al-Hasan Abu Khatāb Dahiyyah Andalusī. As for his affair Imām Dhahabī said about him, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He is accused of lying even in the things he copies.&#8221; </em>(Mīzān (3:186)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Dhiya al-Maqdisi said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I did not like his affair in that he would tarnish the Imāms and then Ibrahim Sanhawari  informed that the scholars of Maghrib wrote concerning him in that they criticised and weakened him.&#8221;</em> [Mizān [3:186] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Najjār said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I saw that the people were united and agreed on him being a liar and weak, likewise and similarly his claim t<span style="color: #000000;">he people he heard from when he never heard from them and those who he claimed to have met when he never met them.&#8221;</span></em> [Liīsān Al-Mizān [4:295]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was of the Zahiri madhab who would tarnish and degrade the honour of Imāms and Scholars of the Salaf, he had a vile tongue, he was a fool with utmost arrogance and very little insight in the affairs of the Dīn and very lazy.&#8221;</em> [Līsān Al-Mizān [4:296]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some researchers have speculated his attribution to the Zahiri Madhab was due to his Andalusian roots, where the Zahiri Madhab featured prominently. They also said the Maliki&#8217;s at the time conformed to their roots and adhered to the thoughts of the school in Fiqh and otherwise. Likewise the concept of any offshoot from the norm in those days would be attributed to the Zahiri Madhab due to its approach of independent reasoning. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This does not however mean he was a propagator of the madhab. This is often the case, you will find ardent Sufi&#8217;s claiming to be Zahiri&#8217;s or an an attribution to the Zahiri Madhab because of their need to be free and independent of the legislated rulings, however this is a direct contradiction of the Zahiri Madhab, which is strict adherence and rigorously conform to the Divine Texts. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Suyūti said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Besides his knowledge and memory he was ver</span>y immature in citing texts. He would make bold audacious claims and would say &#8216;he narrated to us&#8217; in his ijazahs.&#8221;</em> [Tabaqāt al-Huffāz [pp.498]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Taqī al-Dīn Ahmad bin Alī al-Maqrizī [845H] said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Fatimid Khaliphs would celebrate a number of Eīds and other special days in a year. They would celebrate at the end of the year, at the beginning of the year, the day of Ashurah, the Milād (birthday) of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, the Milād of Alī bin Abī Tālib, the Mawlid of Hasan, the Mawlid of Hussain, the Mawlid of Fatimah and the Mawlid of the current ruler, the first night of Rajab, the night of the Middle of Rajab, the first night of Sha&#8217;bān, the night of the Middle of Sha&#8217;bān&#8230;&#8221;</em> [al-Muwā&#8217;iz wa&#8217;l Ei‘tibār Bi Zikr al-Khitat wa&#8217;l Athār [2:436]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Processions and other acts during the six Milād son different days. They were the Milād of the Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, Amīr al-Mu&#8217;minīn Alī bin Abi Tālib, the Mawlid of Fatimah Alayhis Salām, the Mawlid of Al-Hasan, the Mawlid of Al-Hussain Alayhuma Asalām  and the Mawlid of the current Khaliph.&#8221;</em> [al-Muwā&#8217;iz wa&#8217;l Ei‘tibār Bi Zikr al-Khitat wa&#8217;l Athār [2:333]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When the 12th of Rabī Al-Awwal would come they would prepare sweet dishes from 20 plates of sugar which would then be put on 300 silver plates and this would be the day of the Mawlid.&#8221;</em> [al-Muwā&#8217;iz wa&#8217;l Ei‘tibār Bi Zikr al-Khitat wa&#8217;l Athār [2:334]</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><br />
Question:</strong> The questioner says, O our virtuous Shaykh, what is your statement, may Allaah reward you with good: You repudiate A-Turaabee, At-Tilmisaanee,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Al-Ghazaalee, and Al-Qardaawee; you declare them to be innovators, and you refute them, and backbite them whilst leaving off mentioning their good qualities; while there are Imaams who fell into innovation, such as Ibn Hajr and An-Nawawee; but you mention the earlier ones with good while speaking about (i.e., refuting) the latter ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong> I say, firstly: This comparison from this person displays his ignorance. How can one compare Ibn Hajr and An-Nawawee to the likes of At-Turaabee, Al-Ghazaalee, and Al-Qardawee? What is dirt in comparison to the stars? What is dung in comparison to the camel? These (Imaams) are lovers of the Sunnah; explainers of it, and clarifiers of it. That which they misinterpreted and fell into was miniscule in light of that which they clarified from the affairs of Al-Islaam. So the people of knowledge continue to benefit from their speech. Rather, they understand the texts of the Book and the Sunnah based upon that which they clarified, because they were people of knowledge, in truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for these latter day people, from the likes of At-Turaabee, Al-Ghazaalee, Al-Qardaawee, At-Tilmisaanee, and their likes; these are heads in calling the people to not clinging to the Sunnah, and to its rejection. Hence, the condition is different. (You have) he who errs and avoids that which is correct in an issue or a branch from the subsidiary branches or an issue or two of creed (and on the other hand) he who opposes (the Sunnah) at its basis. These (latter people) do not give Tawheed any status and they have no concern for it. Rather, the people of Tawheed have encountered from them the greatest harms, as is attested to. At-Turaabee is such that his condition is known. He deems that there is a need for <em>“updating”</em> the foundations of Al-Islaam, and <em>“updating” </em>the principles of Fiqh; and that the principles of Fiqh is terminology of the scholars, in spite of the fact that the texts are understood based upon these principles; and this (according to At-Turaabee) does not mean that we are bound by them. So he says that we must institute new principles for Fiqh by way of which we can understand the Book and the Sunnah with that which is appropriate for this era.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Ghazaalee rejects the Sunnah if it opposes his intellect and if it opposes his understanding. Al-Qardaawee traverses upon the same program, although he does not openly display that like Al-Ghazaalee. At-Tilmisaanee does not acknowledge Tawheed Al-‘Ibaadah nor the Sunnah. He mixes up the affairs greatly. There is no wonder (that this is the case); for these four, and those of their ilk, graduated from the same (ideological) school; it is the school of the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimeen. This school is known, in its foundations and its methodology; so it is no wonder that the likes of these would come out in the future; and it is no wonder that the likes of these are present in the likes of this time, as long as they are nurtured upon the principles of that school. So repudiation of them and that which they are upon (is a must). For they lead the youth astray in the name of the Da’wah. The youth venerate them thinking that they are callers to Al-Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr and An-Nawawee, not one day have we heard that anyone defended an issue from the issues of creed in which they erred using as a proof that Ibn Hajr said it or An-Nawawee said it. Their mistakes passed away in their time, and it remains that the people benefit from their abundant knowledge and their enlightened understanding. As for these (latter guys), they cannot compare, and it is not permissible that they be placed alongside these (Imaams); and the dirt cannot compare to the stars.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of Abu Hurairah RadiAllahu Anhu the Messenger of Allah Sallalalhu alayhi Wasallam said, <em>&#8220;Whenever one of you performs wudu for Salah, he should not do tashbik with his fingers (after he has completed the wudu)</em> (al-Sahihah no.1294, transmitted Tabarani in al-Awsth (1:4-5).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tashbik is interlocking the fingers of both hands, ie putting the fingers on one hand into the fingers of the other hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith as narrated by Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri RadiAllahu Anhu said, <em>&#8220;When one of you is in the masjid, do not do tashbik for verily tashbik is from the Shaytan.&#8221;</em> (Musnad Ahmad (3:43).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Isma’ll b. Umayyah said, <em>“I asked about a man who intertwines his fingers while he is engaged in prayer. He said that Ibn ‘Umar had said: This is the prayer of those who earn the anger of Allah.”</em> (Abu Dawud no.993) Shaikh al-Albani graded its chain to be authentic (Irwa 2:103)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Thumamah al-Hannat said that Ka&#8217;b ibn Ujrah met him while he was going to the mosque; one of the two (companions) met his companion (on his way to the mosque) And he met crossing the fingers of my both hands. He prohibited me to do so, and said: The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) has said: If any of you performs ablution, and performs his ablution perfectly, and then goes out intending for the mosque, he should not cross the fingers of his hand because he is already in prayer. (Abu Dawud (no.562), Sahih Abi Dawud (1:168 no.562), Ibn Majah (no.967)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari established the following chapter heading in his Sahih, <strong>“Chapter on interlocking the fingers in the Masjid and elsewhere” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He then brings a hadith from either Abdullah ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) or Abdullah ibn Amr bin Aas (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) interlocked his fingers. (Bukhari no’s 478-479)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the following hadith the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said to Abdullah Ibn Amr al-Aas (RadhiAllahu Anhu), <em>&#8220;O Abdullah bin Amr! What will be your condition when you will be left with the of (worst) people?&#8221; (and he indicated by interlocking the fingers of his two hands). </em>(Bukhari no.480)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the authority of Abu Musa al-Ash’ari (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who narrates the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “<em>A faithful believer to a faithful believer is like the bricks of a wall, enforcing each other.&#8221; While (saying that) the Prophet (</em><em>ﷺ</em><em>) clasped his hands, by interlocking his fingers.” </em>(Bukhari no.481)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another hadith in this regard is the long hadith of Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu about the story of Dhul Yadayn, it mentions the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, <em>“went and stood by a piece of wood that was set up in the masjid, and leaned against it as if he was angry, and he placed his right hand on his left and interlocked his fingers…”</em> (Bukhari no.482, Muslim no.573)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Bukhari brings this ahadith to show the permissibility of clasping the hands and interlocking the the fingers. The prohibition is because this is ie interlocking of the fingers a futile and useless act. However, there is no harm if there is a specific reason for a person to do this as in the hadith above the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) used the interlocking of his fingers to illustrate or explain a particular point.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr has explained despite one of the narration being in note form, Ibrahim Harbi has cited a continuous chain for it in his Gharib al-Hadith. Imam Bukhari’s intent in establishing this chapter heading is to elucidate and show the permissibility of clasping the hands and interlocking the fingers. As for the ahadith which mention prohibition of interlocking the fingers they are specific and in relation to the prayer or whilst preparing for the prayer and or most of them are not even authentic. (Fath al-Bari (1:565)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr further said whilst reconciling between these ahadith, the ones cited above and the ones that mention the prohibition, that <em>“al-Isma’ili reconciled between them by noting that the prohibition is limited to when one is in prayer or is intending to pray, because the one who is waiting for the prayer comes under the same ruling as one who is praying… Then al-Haafiz said: The report which says that this is forbidden so long as one is in the mosque is da’eef (weak) as we have stated above.” </em>(Fath al-Bari (1:565)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people whilst in a state of prayer may interlock their fingers in an attempt to crack them. This is unnecessary movement and a distraction from concentrating on the prayer. It was narrated by Shu’bah that he said, <em>“I prayed beside Ibn Abbas and cracked my fingers. When the prayer finished, he said, “May your mother lose you! You crack your fingers when you are in prayer?” </em>(Ibn Abi Shaybah (2:344). Shaikh al-Albani said in Irwa al-Ghalil (2:99), its chain is Hasan.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is another report in which is very weak according to Shaikh al-Albani in Ibn Majah (no.965) that Ali (RadhiAllahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, <em>“</em><em>Do not crack your fingers during the prayer.”</em> (Irwa ul-Ghalil (2:99 no.367) al-Bawsiri declared a narrator in the chain to weak. (al-Zawa’id (1:63). Shaikh al-Albani follows this with another narration from Mu’adh bin Anas (Ahmad (3:438), Daraqutni (no.64), Baihaqi (2:289) who said one of the narrators was not strong.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams ul-Haq Azimabadi also offers similar explanations and alludes to the fact that there are no contradictions in the aforementioned narrations. He cites further ahadith from Ibn Hibban in the prohibition of interlocking the fingers whilst on the way to the masjid to prayer. He also cites a narration from Hakim from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) when one of you performs wudu in his house and then he comes to the masjid, he is in a state of prayer up until he returns and he should not interlock his fingers. Hakim said the hadith is authentic on the conditions of the two Shaikhs. He goes onto cite another narration from Ibn Abi Shaybah’s Musannaf, that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said when one of you prays, he should not interlock his fingers for verily interlocking the fingers is from Shaytan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Shams ul-Haq goes onto say The Hadith of Ka’b has been authenticated by Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibban and that some scholars have differed over the authenticity of its chains and have thus rendered it to be weak. They (the scholars of hadith) have said there is no contradiction between these ahadith. They are understood to mean that a person is not to interlock their fingers after wudu and whilst on their way to the masjid to pray or whilst praying. The hadith of Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllahu Anhu) in Sahih al-Bukhari refers to after the prayer and not during the prayer or from the time leading to the prayer. He then goes onto to cite the view of Ibn al-Munir, al-Ayni and al-Khattabi. (Au’n al-Ma’bud Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud (2:188-190 no.558) </span></p>
