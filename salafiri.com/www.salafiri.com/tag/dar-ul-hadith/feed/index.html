				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="center"><strong>Compiled &amp; Translated </strong></h5>
<h5 align="center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, no long introductions straight to the point. 6 scholars &#8211; 3 fathers and 3 sons who spent decades upon calling to Tawhid and Sunnah, teaching hadith, reprimanding Madhhabism and the associated bigoted taqlid. If anything take the benefit of nurturing your children on the pure pristine Salafi Manhaj and keep away from blind fanaticism of madhhabs and take evidence when it comes to you. Same people who fall prey to technical fiqhi buzz words and think they have a defence!</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[1] Shaikh al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Muhammad Sa&#8217;id Muhaddith Banarasi</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was born in a sikh household in 1274H and died in 1322H/1904CE. He was born as Mawl Singh in Gujrat and his father’s name was Karak Singh. He was a sikh and converted to Islam. He first sought knowledge in Deoband but later became Ahlul Hadith and eventually studied with major Salafi Ahlul Mashaykh like Shaykh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi who he studied hadith and tafsir with as well as Shaykh Abdullah Ghazipuri and Shaykh Muhammad Ibrahim Arawi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then went to the Banaras (Varanasi) the holiest city of the idol worshippers and set up Madrasah Sa&#8217;idiyyah in 1297H and taught for a few decades until he died. He also set up a printing press called Matba&#8217;a Sa&#8217;idiyyah and printed thousands of pages of amazing books that promoted the Madhhab of Ahlul Hadith and Salafis and refuted the bigoted Madhhabists</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From Sikhism to establishing a Salafi Madrasah built upon Tawhid and Sunnah in the holiest place of the idol worshiping Hindus and a phenomenal printing press.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaykh Abdur Rahman al-Faryawa&#8217;i said about him, <em>&#8220;He had numerous works and treatises most of which were fierce and vehement refutations of the muta’ssub Madhhabists and the bigoted staunch Muqallidin he also had a book on Fatawa in 2 parts.&#8221;</em> (al-Harakatus Salafiyyyah wa Dawriha Fi Ihya as-Sunnah (p.44)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He died in 1322H/1904CE. He had a son, who he nurtured on the Quran and Sunnah with care, affection and diligence and he was,</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[2] Shaikh al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Abul Qasim Muhammad Sayf Banarasi </strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was born in 1307H Banaras. He completed his Hifz of the Quran by the age of 7 and by the age of 16 he started teaching after having taken all the knowledge from his father, Shaykh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, Shaykh Abdul Mannan al-Wazirabadi, Shaykh Shams ul-Haq Azimabadi, Shaykh Hussain b. Muhsin Ansari.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He began teaching in his father&#8217;s Madrasah Sa&#8217;idiyyah where he taught Bukhari and Muslim 30 times (each) during his life. He spend his life defending and spreading hadith. When a Hanafi bigoted muqallid wrote a book called <em>&#8220;Jarh Alal Bukhari&#8221;</em> and 6-7 other books criticising and disparaging Sahih al-Bukhari and hadith in general. Shaykh Abul Qasim Sayf Banarasi answered and refuted all of them in overwhelming detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He defended and spread the Madhhab of Ahlul Hadith and Salafis through his numerous works. He was a prolific author and wrote books in Arabic and Urdu which number more than 65. Some of them include,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jam&#8217;a al-Quran wal-Hadith, Qadhiyatul Hadith Fi Hujjatul Hadith, Husul al-Maram, Kitab ar-Radd Ala Abi Hanifah &#8211; an rendering of the work of the Ahlul Hadith Muhaddith Imam Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Shaybah, Arba&#8217;in Muhammadi, Hidayatus Sa&#8217;il Ila Ahadith Wa&#8217;il, Naf&#8217;i al-Ahnaf, Hal Mushkilat Bukhari in 3 volumes also known as Kawthar al-Jari Fi Jawab al-Jarh Alal Bukhari, al-Amr al-Mubram Li-Ibtal Al-Kalam al-Muhkam, al-Siyar al-Hathith Fi Barah Ahlul Hadith, Ijtilab al-Manfa&#8217;a Liman Yatal&#8217;ih Ahwal Ai&#8217;matul Arb&#8217;a, 5 more books refuting the Hanafi muqallid who attacked Sahih al-Bukhari and many more. He died in 1369H/1949CE.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[3] Shaikh al-Allamah al-Muhaddith Abu Muhammad Abdul Haq al-Hashimi</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the formidable scholars of Ahlul Hadith who spent 70 years teaching over 2 continents calling to the Quran and Sunnah, refuting the bigotry of the La-Mutabbi Madhhabists and holding them at bay and their distorted call to taqlid. He was born in 1884/1302H and sought knowledge from many scholars, most of whom were upon the way of knowledge without Madhab fanaticism.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">He opposed taqlid and loved the pure Sunnah, he warned and abandoned taqlid while have respect for the Imams as he says. (Aqidah firqatun najiyyah p.5)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansari said, <em>“<strong>He did not restrict himself to a madhhab</strong> as he had profound knowledge of the hadith likewise his immense knowledge of hanafi fiqh.”</em> (Majmu’a Tarjamah al-Shaykh Hamad al-Ansari 2:613)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shaykh said, <em>“I have many teachers and I would like to mention the ones I sought knowledge from and they are those whose beliefs were in accordance with the Salaf us-Salihin with regards to Tawhid, Iman and in issues of the Sifat of Allah ie the ones who had the correct and sound Aqidah. The very same teachers who who rejected and shunned taqlid and lived their life accordance with following and obeying ie Ittiba of the Quran and Sunnah, they gave me their asanid and ijazat”. </em>(Aqidah Firqatun Najiyyah p.23-27)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Ubaydah</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Checked &amp; Annotated</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To proceed I received a letter from a Turkish student from Qauniyyah and the text of it was,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">“To Muhammad Ibn Jamil Zeno, Teacher in Darul Hadeeth Khayriyyah in Makkah Mukarramah,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Asalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">to proceed:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Oh Noble teacher! I am a student of knowledge in the faculty of Shar’eeah of Qooniyyah. I transalted your book, ‘The Islamic Belief’ as part of my dissertation into Turkish but I require your biography so that I can include it with the published book. I require from your virtous self that you send me these details.  I Thank you very much now oh virtuous Shaikh. Wasalam Upon obedience and guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bilal Baromaji – Turkey</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many other students of knowledge have requested me write about my life and the various stages in my life that I traversed since I was younger till this current age of 70 years, in how I  came towards the correct Islamic belief of the salaf Saaliheen, based on the evidences from the Noble Quran and the authentic Ahadith.  This is indeed a major blessing and no one knows this except the who tastes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) spoke the truth when he said, “He has found the taste of faith (<em>iman</em>) who is content with Allah as his Lord, with Islam as his religion and with Muhammad (ﷺ) as his Prophet. (Trans, hadith has been narrated by Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhu) Muslim <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">no.34</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore I am writing my autobiogprahy  so that the reader will obtain some advice and lesson from it and be able to distinguish between the truth from the falsehood insha Allah. I ask Allah that he benefits the Muslims with this book and makes this is sincere to seek his face.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad bin Jamil Zeno</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1/1/1415H</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So…..</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I was born in the country of Syria in the city of Halb (Aleppo) in 1925 corresponding to 1344 hijri and at this moment my age is approximately 73 years). When I was approximately 10 years old I entered into a private school where I learnt to read and write. After this I entered the school for the memorisation of the Qur’aan  known as Dar al-Huffadh and I spent 5 years there, where I learnt Tajweed and memorised the Qur’aan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then I entered a madrassah in Aleppo which was known as The Faculty of Shar’eeah at-Tajhaziyyah which is now known as ‘Shar’eeh Secondary School’. In this school I learnt the Shar’eeah along with modern subjects. So I learnt Tafseer, Hanafi Fiqh, Arabic Grammar (Sarf and Nahw), History, Science of Hadeeth and other sciences of the Shar’eeah. Like this I learnt modern subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics along with learning and reading the French language as well classical sciences invented by the Muslims like Algebra.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I remember when I learned the subject of Tawheed from a book called <em>“al-Husoon al-Humaydiyah”</em>. This book was based upon Tawheed Ruboobiyah and the main content which the book was trying to prove was that this Universe has one Creator and one Rab (Cherisher, Sustainer, Nourisher, Guide). Only afterwards I realised the author of the book and also where they teach the Shari’ah subjects to the general Muslims at the schools and universities, tawheed ruboobiyah was taught with numerous mistakes. And these same mistakes were committed by those who fought and differed with the Messenger of Allah (Sallalaahu alayhi wasalam). Even though they accepted that their creator is the one and only Allah. Whereby Allah the Most High has mentioned in regards to them:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>And if you asked them who created them, they would surely say, ” Allah .” So how are they deluded?</strong><strong>  (surah 43 az-Zukhruf ayah 87)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rather Shaytaan, the accursed even accepted that his Rab is Allah. Allah the Rab of the worlds mentioned his declaration that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[Iblees] said, “My Lord, because You have put me in error, I will surely make [disobedience] attractive to them on earth, and I will mislead them all</strong><strong> (Surah 15 al-Hijr ayah 39)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, Tawheed Uloohiyah which is the foundation of Islaam, whereby a Muslim attains salvation. I didn’t learn this and I didn’t know anything about it. The situation is that the students of the schools and universities where they teach the modern subjects don’t know anything about regards and neither is this subject taught.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst Allah the Most High commanded and sent all the Messengers and Prophets (Alayhimus Salaam) to call towards his Uloohiyah and this is what the seal of the Prophets, Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (Sallalaahu alayhi wasalam) called his people towards. However they rejected this and became arrogant, just like Allah the Most Great said about their condition,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Indeed they, when it was said to them, “There is no deity but Allah,” were arrogant</strong><strong> (Surah 37 as-Saafaat ayah 35)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is why the Arabs perfectly well knew the meaning of “There is no one worthy of being worshipped in truth except Allah.” They knew whoever said this would not be allowed to ask anyone else for help. Now the situation is as such that some Muslims testify the Aqidah of Uloohiyah from their tongues yet at the same time call upon other than Allah! Therefore they negate their own declarations.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for <em>‘Tawheed al-Asma wa-Sifaat,’</em> it is a great shame that in numerous countries and cities the attributes of Allah are figuratively explained in the various schools and institutes and this is what also happened in our school that Ta’weel was done of the Sifaat of Allah. I remember my teacher explaining Istiwa in the following Ayah of Qur’aan:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Most Merciful rose (istiwa) over the Throne.</strong><strong> (Surah 20 Taha ayah 5)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To mean Istawlaa meaning taking control over, becoming dominant and prevailing and then use the following poem as a proof:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Indeed Bishr (an Ameer) became dominant (Istiwa) over Iraq without the sword and spilling blood.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Jawzee said that nobody knows the poet who uttered these words. Others have said he was a Christian. The tafseer or explanation of the word ‘Istiwaa’ in Saheeh Bukhari under the saying of Allah the Rab of the worlds,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth. Then He directed Himself to the heaven, Istiwa [His being above all creation], and made them seven heavens, and He is Knowing of all things.</strong><strong> (Surah 2 al-Baqarah ayah 29)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Mujaahid and Abul Aaliyah said the meaning of ‘Istiwaa’ is <em>“A’alaa and Irtafa’a” </em>meaning He rose or became Lofty. (Saheeh Bukhari, Kitaab at-Tawheed 8/175. [Trans Note:Chapter 22 “And His Throne was on water”])</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So how is it allowed for a Muslim to leave the saying of the Tabi’een from Saheeh Bukhari and take the saying of an unknown Poet? (Obviously) this is not possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This corrupt Ta’weel in which they rejected Allah the Most Great being above His Throne, is against the belief (aqeedah) of Imaam Maalik and Imaam Abu Haneefah. The madhab of Imaam Abu Haneefah, which they are always studying, he says, <em>“Whoever says that I don’t know if my Rab is in the heavens or on the Earth, then he has committed Kufr ie disbelief”. Because Allah the Rab of the worlds says, </em><em> </em><em>The Most Merciful rose (istiwa) over the Throne.</em><em> (Surah 20 Taha ayah 5) and His Throne is above the seven Heavens.</em> (See Sharh Aqeedah Tahaawiyah p.322)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I completed my Secondary education in 1948 and also quickly obtained my College certificates. I also passed my entry examination for Cairo University which is in Egypt, however because of bad health I wasn’t able to go there to study and entered the Dar al-Mu’alimeen in Aleppo instead.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After graduation I started teaching as a teacher for 29 years and then I left teaching. After leaving teaching I went to Makkah Mukarramah for Umrah in 1399 Hijri (1979). I was introduced to Shaykh Abdul Azeez Ibn Abdullah Ibn Baaz. When he found out that my aqeedah was salafee he put me as a teacher in the Haram in Makkah during the days of Hajj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the season of Hajj finished he sent me to Jordan as a Daa’ee. When I arrived there I stayed for a while as an Imaam, Khateeb and teacher of the Quran in Jamia Masjid Salahudeen Ayubi which is in the city of Ramthaa. I used to go to the primary schools and give lectures on tawhid to the students and bring their attention towards it, so they accepted this knowledge with a great goodness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I went to Makkah Mukarramah for Umrah again in 1400 Hijri (1980), in the month of Ramadhaan, and stayed there until after Hajj. Whilst I was there I met a student of knowledge from Darul Hadeeth Khayriyyah. He asked me to become a teacher and teach at Dar ul Hadeeth, because there was an extreme need for teachers there, especially for lessons in the science of Hadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I spoke to the Director of Darul Hadeeth on the telephone and he showed some verbal acceptance and said that I should get a reference from Shaykh Ibn Baaz. Therefore I spoke to the Shaykh and he wrote to the Director that I should become a teacher there. I then started teaching the students at the school with regards to Tafseer, Tawheed, Qur’aan and other sciences (subjects).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then with the grace and help of Allah the Most beneficient and Most Noble I started writing small booklets, which became accepted with honour around the world. Some books were translated into English, French, Bengali, Indonesian, Turkish, Urdu and other languages and spread around the world. I named them ‘Silsilah at-Tawjeehaat al-Islaamiyah’ which is compromised of more than 20 booklets, and most of them have been printed in the thousands. All praise is due to Allah. Most of them are given for the sake of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I ask Allah the Rab of the worlds that the general Muslims gain the full benefit from them, and make this act sincerely for Him. (Allahumma Ameen)</span></p>
