				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[Shaykh Ahmad Din Ghakrwi was a powerful scholar, orator, writer and debater. He sought ilm from equally great scholars. He was a prolific debater and is on record for defeating the Hanafis, Barelwis, Qadiyanis, Shi’a and Christians in debates when he started at the age of 20 (1920). He was born in 1900 and authored magnificent books in defence of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and refuting Christians and Hindus] </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Taqlid leads to the formation of some islamically legislative deficiencies, some of them are the following,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 1<sup>st</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Taqlid is Shirk in risalah</strong> which is synonymous to shirk with Allah. Shah Waliullah Muhaddith Dehlawi said in <em>Aqd ul-Jid</em>,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Then emerged the fanatical followers of the four madhhabs who made taqlid of their respective Imams in a manner as if they were sent as Prophets to them (i.e. the fanatical muqallid followers).”<a style="color: #000080;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This is Shirk in risalah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 2<sup>nd</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The <strong>muqallidin distorted and altered texts of the Quran and Sunnah</strong>, as I mentioned previously. (The Shaykh cited the example of the Deobandi scholar Mawalana Mahmud al-Hasan forging and distorting words in the Quran and the Deobandi Hanafis altering and distorting words in ahadith).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 3<sup>rd</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Taqlid creates jealousy and hatred</strong> in humans just like the Hanafis went to <strong>extreme exaggeration</strong> in the virtues of their Imam. The marginal notes to <em>Sharh Nukhbatul Fikr</em> mentions the fanatical extreme to the extent they said in the virtue of Imam Abu Hanifah,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said he is the light of my Ummah.”</span><a style="color: #000080;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So, <strong>they openly slandered the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</strong> and they dishonoured their Imam. Furthermore, they fabricated and forged reports and incidences in the virtue of their Imam. Some of them are,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said all the Prophets have pride based on me and I have pride based on Abu Hanifah. <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/22)</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jurjani transmits if there was a scholar of the likes of Abu Hanifah in the Ummah of Musa and Isa they would not have been Jews or Christians (i.e. Abu Hanifah would have converted all of them to Islam). <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/22).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Imam Abu Hanifah saw Allah 100 (one hundred) times in his dream. <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/21). However, Fatawa Qadhi Khan in volume 4 in the chapter of Tasbih and Taslim mentions whoever says he saw Allah in a dream then he is the same as the one who worships idols! (cited from Haqiqah tul-Fiqh (1/133-134).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Our madhhab is upon the truth while the others are upon error. <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/818, 4/44).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thabit (the father of Abu Hanifah) took his son, Imam Abu Hanifah to Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu and asked him to supplicate for him. <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/26)  </span> </span> </span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Note:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It should be noted Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu was martyred in 40H and Abu Hanifah was born in 80H, meaning he went to him 40 years before his birth!</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Isa Alayhis Salam will judge and give rulings according to the Hanafi madhhab when he will descend and return.<span style="color: #000080;"> (Durr al-Mukhtar (1/24).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Imam stood on one leg and completed the Quran in one night while at the Ka’ba and a voice was heard saying to him, “You are forgiven, and whoever follows you is forgiven and all those upon your madhhab until the Day of Judgement.” <span style="color: #000080;">(Durr al-Mukhtar (1/21).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Someone disrespected Imam Abu Hanifah in the presence of Imam Abdullah b. al-Mubarak and he replied in a roaring voice, “I am amazed at you, you are disrespecting the person who prayed the 5 daily prayers for 45 years with one wudhu and who would complete reciting the whole Quran during the night in 2 rak’ahs.”<span style="color: #000080;"> (Cited from Maqam Hazrat Imam Abu Hanifah (p.60) of Molvi Sarfraz Ahmad Deobandi Ghakarwi).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="9">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is more virtuous to seek the knowledge of fiqh than reciting Quran. (Durr al-Mukhtar (1/14).</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, they insulted and belittled Muhammad b. Idris ash-Shafi’i to such an extent that it created overwhelming hatred for the Imam. They wrote,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Allah’s Messenger Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam said, “There will be a man in my Ummah who will be more harmful to my Ummah than iblis and he will be called Muhammad b. Idris ash-Shafi’i.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This is <strong>extreme exaggeration</strong> and it opposes the Prophets Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam’s Sunnah. There is also no authentic chain from the Companions proving this (cited from <em>Hashiyyah Sharh Nukhbah</em>). [The text of <em>Sharh Nukhbah</em> also mentions the muqallidin would also forge ahadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Allah Allah, <strong>they were shameless in insulting Imam ash-Shafi’i.</strong> In truth, he was from the most trustworthy of people and he was lauded with the title of defender of hadith. I do not know what harsh response the Shafiyyah must have given regarding this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 4<sup>th</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Taqlid of individuals resembles the way of the Rawafidh.</strong> The Rawafidh went to extremes in the virtue of Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu (refer to al-Kafi) to such an extent that they raised his status more than Musa’s and Isa’s (Alayhimus Salam). <strong>This is clear disbelief</strong>. Raising the status of non-Prophet to more than the status of a Prophet is clear disbelief. <strong>The muqallidin are also like this</strong>, they do not see other Imams in a good light except their own as we have shown from the examples in the previous deficiency. The usual diatribe of openly showing respect for all Imams continues but in reality much time is exerted refuting them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The 5<sup>th</sup> Deficiency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The muqallid cannot be metaphorically referred to as Ahlus Sunnah</strong> in terms of actions. Generally speaking, the muqallid will only accept matters which are part of the madhhab of his Imam, for example <strong>the Hanafis do not accept the authentic ahadith in the Sahihayn and the 4 canonical books of hadith</strong> because they oppose and contradict their madhhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Maliki’s, Shafi’is and Hanbali’s largely only recite Fatihah behind the Imam, raise their hands (Raf ul-Yadayn) and say Amin loudly because it is their Imam’s madhhab. If their respective Imams did not practise these matters, they would also not have accepted them like the Hanafis. <strong>These muqallidin do not practise these matters because they are the Sunnah of the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam</strong>, but rather, they practise them because it is the view and position of their Imams. Therefore, the muqallidin have no right to call themselves Ahlus Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>We are amazed at Hanafis, who call themselves Ahlus Sunnah</strong> and are proud about it but in essence they have no right to call themselves Ahlus Sunnah, rather, they should call themselves Hanafis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Dear readers, these are just some brief deficiencies of taqlid which I have mentioned in brevity.     </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">(<em>Qudamat Ahlus-Sunnah wa’l Jama’ah Ya’ni Ahlul Hadith</em> (p.603-606) from <em>Majmu’a Rasa’il Mawlana Ahmad Din Ghakarwi</em>.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This resting period although is observed by many Muslims, it is sometimes or often rushed and not given due importance. Jalsah Istraha is resting for a short period after the second prostration. This resting is connected to the end of the first and third rakah since one has to sit to recite the Tashahud in the second and fourth rakah by default.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">After the second prostration of first and third rakah we should sit in the iftirash position i.e. sit on our left leg and foot while the right foot is upright and toes point towards the Qiblah. This sitting should be so that the limbs are at east and comfortable while the bones return to their place properly. Then we should proceed to stand up for the second and fourth rakah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Bukhari establishes the chapter heading,<strong> “Sitting up straight in a witr prayer (i.e., an odd Rakah) and then Standing up.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Malik b. Huwayrith al-Laythi (RadhiAllahu Anhu) said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em> I saw the Prophet Sallalalhu Alayhi Wasallam praying and in the odd rakahs of the prayer, he used to sit for a moment before getting up.</em> (Bukhari no.823)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">In the following hadith in al-Bukhari part of the wording are </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“…and when he raised his head from the second prostration he would sit for a while and then support himself on the ground and get up”.</em> (Bukhari no.824)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam at-Tirmidhi established the following chapter heading,<strong> “What has been related Regarding the Description of Getting up from the Prostration”.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Malik b. Huwayrith al-Laythi (RadhiAllahu Anhu) said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"> I saw the Prophet Sallalalhu Alayhi Wasallam praying and in the odd rakahs of the prayer, he used to sit for a moment before getting up. (at-Tirmidhi no.287)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The only difference between the two hadith is al-Bukhari mentions <strong>“Qa’idan”</strong> and at-Tirmidhi mentions <strong>“Jalisan”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Abu Dawud brings a lengthy hadith from Abu Humayd as-Sa’di, a part of which mentions regarding the first rakah, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“…then he raised his head, bent his left foot and sat on it so that every bone returned to its place properly…” (Abu Dawud (no.730), at-Tirmidhi (no.304), Ibn Majah (no.1061)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam at-Tirmidhi mentions after the hadith, </span><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“The hadith is Hasan Sahih. Some of the people of knowledge act on this and this is the view of Ishaq and some of our companions (Ba’du Ashabina)&#8221;</em> (at-Tirmidhi no.287)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad b. Ali b. Adam Musa al-Ityubi</strong> traced the hadith to the following books of hadith, al-Bukhari (1/208), Abu Dawud (no.844), Nasa’i (2/234) (al-Mujtaba), (no.651) (al-Kubra), Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (no.686), Sharh Mushkil Athar (no’s 6069, 6070), Sahih Ibn Hibban (no.1934), al-Bayhaqi in al-Kubra (no.2/132) and al-Baghawi in Sharh as-Sunnah (no.668). <strong>(Ittihaf at-Talib al-Ahwadhi Bi-Sharh Jam’i al-Imam at-Tirmidhi (5/428-429)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">BENEFIT</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Shaikh Muhammad b. Ali b. Adam Musa al-Ityubi said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"> “His saying “Ashabana” means the <strong>Ahlul Hadith</strong>. My clarification has preceded in the introduction of this explanation is that when at-Tirmidhi says <strong>“Ashabana” he intends and means Ashabul Hadith – The People of Hadith, so be informed!</strong> (Ittihaf at-Talib al-Ahwadhi (5/429)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Summarised and Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibban and Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>A general point: What is taqlid?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Ibn Abdul Barr and Imam Ibn al-Qayyim quote Abu Abdullah b. Khawaz Mandad saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8216;Taqlid in the shariah is to turn to the saying of someone without proof and this is impermissible in the shariah and Ittiba is to take the saying with proof. <em>(I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> Imam Ibn Qayyim (2/178) and <em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm</em> of Ibn Abdul Barr (2/118).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Hanafi madhhab jurists have explained taqlid to mean,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">To act upon the saying of someone without any evidence or proof. (<em>Fawatih ar- Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/400).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it can be seen that those who perform taqlid will not be able to differentiate between the saying which is upon the truth and that which is upon falsehood. It can generally be seen from the definition of taqlid that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">✓ Taqlid is not knowledge but it is ignorance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Ghazzali writes, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“taqlid is to accept the saying of someone without any proof or evidence and this is not the way to attain knowledge of that which is from the usul (fundamental principles of the religion or the furu (those matters which are secondary). (<em>al-Mustasfa</em> (2/385).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">And it is written in <em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/402) that, taqlid is not the way for attaining certain knowledge. So know that that thing (taqlid) which does not lead to attaining knowledge cannot be called wajib (obligatory). Taqlid stops an individual from looking at the Quran and hadith as a proof and evidence. Never mind this being obligatory this cannot even be tolerated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Despite this some of the Hanafi scholars wrote,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The dalil (proof) for a muqallid is the saying of the mujtahid scholar, not his own thought or his scholars&#8217;. (<em>Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (p.5).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Therefore for the one performing taqlid the Quran and sunnah are no longer the proof and evidence and he is forever free from them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Some misconceptions cleared</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">To accept the witness of someone is not taqlid. The highly accepted book of the Hanafi fiqh titled <em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (2/400) states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“For the general lay person to turn to the mufti (scholar who gives a verdict) and for the judge to turn to the acceptable witness is <strong>not taqlid</strong>.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it is clearly proven to accept a verdict of the scholar of hadith is <strong>not taqlid</strong>.<strong> It is not taqlid</strong> to accept narrations from <em>Sahih Bukhari</em>. Why? Because there is <em>ijma</em> (unanimous agreement) of the ummah that it is the most authentic book after the book of Allah. And it is known that to turn to ijma is not taqlid. &#8216;So to turn to ijma is to turn to proof (not taqlid). (<em>Fawatih ar-Rahmut Sharh Muslim ath-</em>Thabut 2/400)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is <strong>not taqlid</strong> to take a saying which is based upon revelation is <strong>not taqlid</strong>. (<em>Muslim ath-Thabut</em> (1/290).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">According to the Hanafi&#8217;s it is <strong>not</strong> permissible to perform taqlid of a <strong>Tabi’i</strong> (those of the second generations and many were students of the Companions). And the famous Hanafi jurisprudence book <em>Talwih</em> reports,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8216;So as for these narrations (the tabi&#8217;in) then taqlid will not be made of them. For they were men and we are men. (<em>Talwih</em> (2/17).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Some evidences on the prohibition of taqlid from the Quran.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> &#8216;Say (O Muhammad) to your folk follow what has been revealed down unto you from your Rabb (the Quran and Sunnah), and follow not any Auliya (protectors and helpers) besides him&#8217;. (Al-A&#8217;raf: 3).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">All classical mufassirin (explainers of the holy Quran) explain <strong>“That which has been</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>revealed by your Rabb”</strong> in the above ayah to refer to the Quran and hadith. For example, <em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em> (2/200), <em>al-Qurtubi</em> (7/161), <em>al-Khazin </em>(2/182), <em>an-Nasafi</em> (2/44), <em>Shawkani</em> (2/179), <em>al-Qasmi</em> (7/2610), <em>al-Maragi </em>(8/100). This shows that we are ordered to follow the Quran and hadith as they are revealed by Allah and to abandon following any other way or saying as there is no evidence for following this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “Say, &#8216;Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful”. (an-Naml: 64).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This shows that without evidence shall not be accepted. Know that a saying which has no evidence to support it from the Quran and hadith shall not be accepted no matter who the saying is from. This is sufficient to refute the performing of taqlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Know that if a saying or action could be accepted without proof from the Quran and hadith then Allah would not have ordered for the proof to be brought forth in this verse. Verily it was sufficient for Allah to have called the disbelievers as &#8216;liars&#8217; but in ordering for the showing of proof in this verse, Allah has indicated that no saying shall be accepted without evidence. The utterance of this verse from the prophet Muhammad is to show that the way of the Muslim is not to perform taqlid and blindly follow. Some may comment that this verse was revealed in relation to the disbelievers and does not apply to Muslims. Then note that even though the disbelievers had no proof of what they used to do despite this they were still asked to produce there proof. Then the Muslim who has proof for what he does should be more readily asked for proof and this is necessary. Furthermore, to provide evidences is the way of the Muslim and to follow without proof or performing taqlid is and was the custom of the disbeliever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “When those who were followed disown (declare themselves innocent of) those who followed them, and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them. And those who followed will say, &#8216;If only we had one more chance to return (to the worldly life), we would disown (declare ourselves innocent from them) as they have disowned (declared themselves innocent from us). Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regrets for them&#8217;. (al-Baqarah: 166-167).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The ittiba (to follow) which has been mentioned in this verse is not ittiba which has been ordered with the proof as has been mentioned in verse one above. Therefore the ittiba referred to here will be to follow without proof and this is taqlid. If someone says that the itiba referred to here is the worship which is done for other than Allah and not making taqlid of any Imam or scholar. Then this in itself is a great proof in the prohibition of taqlid as it will have to be conceded that to make ittiba or to follow other than Allah is to worship that person and this will be shirk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> &#8216;When it is said to them: &#8216;Follow do ittiba) what Allah has sent down&#8217;. They say, &#8216;Nay! We shall follow (do ittiba) what we found our fathers following&#8217;. (would they do that) even though their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided?&#8217;. (al-Baqarah: 170).</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This verse invites people to follow with evidences whereas those who are astray perform ittiba or follow that for which there is no evidence or proof. This is why they follow there forefathers and elders even though they had no evidences and proofs for what they used to say. So how is it that those who were astray continued to follow there elders not knowing whether they were upon the truth or falsehood? The only way they could distinguish between the truth and falsehood and actually be certain they were following the truth was if they had followed with proof and evidence,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">If someone says that &#8216;this verse is admonition of those disbelievers who would blindly follow there disbelieving elders and forefathers and does not refer to blindly following pious people and Imams. Then the answer to this is that this is a proof against you. For if it is as you say then know that this verse shows that to follow without evidences was the way of the disbelievers whereas the way of the Muslims is to follow the prophet Muhammad with clear evidences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad), &#8220;This is my way: I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me”. (Yusuf:108).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It would have been sufficient to call the disbelievers liars in the beliefs they held. However to explain in more detail the reason for the deviancy of the disbelievers it is not being said &#8216;that you are astray because you followed your disbelieving forefathers&#8217; but what is rather being said is that the disbelievers followed those for whose guidance or being upon the truth they had no evidences and proofs. And this what taqlid is to follow without evidences and proofs.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Some sayings of the Salaf as-Salihin about taqlid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">The Companion Abdullah Ibn Mas’ud said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Let no person perform taqlid of any other person.” (<em>Majma az-Zawa’id</em> and <em>Mizan al-Kubra</em> of Shirani (1/48).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">The Companion Mu’adh Ibn Jabal said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“So when a scholar is upon guidance do not perform taqlid of him in your religion.” (<em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> (2/174), of Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, Egyptian print).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">A similar narration has been narrated as above from the companion Salmaan. (<em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in</em> (2/174), of Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, Egyptian print).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Amir al-Mu’minin Ali said,</span></li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Be aware in taking from the ways of people.” (<em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm wa Fadlihi</em> (2/114) of Imam Ibn Abdul Barr).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is known that those who were being addressed with this advise were the companions and Tabi’in. This clearly shows that taqlid in the era of the companions was forbidden.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Amir bin Sharajil Sha’bi said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“What these people inform you of from the messenger of Allah (hadith) take it. And what they say from there opinions then throw it in the rubbish.” (<em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em> (1/37) and <em>al-Hujjatullah al-Balighah</em> of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (1/148).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Dear readers know that Imam Sha’bi was from the Kibar Tabi’n&#8217; (those from the second generation after the prophet). He met 500 companions of the messenger of Allah (<em>Tazkirrah al-Huffaz</em> of Imam Dhahabi (1/74). So if the saying of a man of this stature and position is not proof in itself then how can the saying or opinion of any other Tabi’in or those who followed them be blindly accepted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Abdullah bin al-Mu&#8217;tamir said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“There is no difference between that animal which is pulled (after being tied up) and that human which performs taqlid”. (<em>Jami’ Bayan al-Ilm wa Fadlihi </em>(2/113,) <em>I’lam al-Muwaqqi’in </em>(2/170).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Know that the animal which is tied and dragged behind it&#8217;s owner knows not if it is being taken to be fed grass, or to sell or to slaughter. Likewise the muqallid (blind follower) has no knowledge that the one who he is blindly following whether he is taking him towards the truth or falsehood! This is because he has no proof for what he is following and nor is the one who he is following infallible (but our prophet is infallible).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Abu Hanifah said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“It is not halal (permissible) for anyone to take my saying who does not know from where I have bought the evidences”. (<em>Muqaddimah Hidayah</em> (p.93).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The author who recorded this saying continues by commenting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“And our Imam has prohibited the performing of taqlid and has stressed the importance of knowing the dalil (proofs and evidences).” (<em>Muqaddimah Hidayah </em>(p.93).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is clear from the above saying of the Imam that at first he prohibits the performing of taqlid and then he stresses the importance of following with proof. So it can therefore be seen that to accept with evidences and proof is not taqlid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Malik said:</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Verily I am a man and I err and at times am correct. So look at what I say and whatever is in accordance with the book (Quran) and sunnah take it and whatever opposes this then abandon it.” (<em>Jalb al-Manfa&#8217;a</em> p.68).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Imam has completely finished here the performing of taqlid. This is because he has ordered the asking for proof from the book and sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Shafi’ has clearly warned against taqlid. Therefore his student Imam Muzani said,</span></li>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It can be clearly seen Imam Sarakhsi that performing taqlid is not permissible and this was not the way of the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="12">

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“If there is a mother of misguidance then it is performing taqlid.” (<em>Atwaq az-Zahab</em> (p.42).</span></p>

<li><span style="color: #000080;">Allamah Alusi Baghdadi said,</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“If there is a father of misguidance it is performing taqlid.” (<em>Ruh al-Ma&#8217;ni</em>).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>So did the Companions or those who came before them with their various shariah&#8217;s perform taqlid in any aspects of the religion? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. Shah Waliullah Dehlwee quotes in his book <em>Hujjatullah al-Balighah</em> (p.154) from Imam Ibn Hazm in his book <em>al- Ihkam</em> (1/760) that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“So to perform taqlid was haram (forbidden) in all of the shariah&#8217;s from the first of them to the last. Whether it was (performing taqlid) in Tawhid (aqidah), Prophethood, belief in pre-destination or all of the other aspects of worship and ahkam (rules and laws).”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Explanation of an ayah which is often quoted for performing taqlid</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> “Ask the people of knowledge if you do not Know.” (surah an-Nahl)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is claimed by some that when a layperson asks a scholar or seeks a verdict from him about something this is taqlid of the scholar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This is not the case because the layperson is within his rights to ask the scholar what the Quran and hadith say about a particular matter and not to ask him about his opinion. So after being told what the hadith states about a certain matter he will try to act upon it to his capability. This is not taqlid but it is the following of proof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">If just by &#8216;asking&#8217; someone one falls into taqlid then what does one say about the following verse wherein the prophet Muhammad was ordered to &#8216;ask&#8217; from the jews and Christians. Allah forbid! Will you now say that even Muhammad was performing taqlid or blindly following the Jews and Christians?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">What does to &#8216;ask&#8217; mean in this ayah? Does it mean ask the person of knowledge for his own opinion or what the Quran and hadith state? If it meant ask the scholar of his opinion then know that opinions vary. So the only reason a questioner asks is so that he can be led to certainty rather than more uncertainty and confusion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, the “people of knowledge” in this verse are those who are people of the Quran and hadith, not people of opinion. So this in itself refutes taqlid. Therefore, the muqallid and blind follower will ask about his Imam&#8217;s or scholars opinion. Whereas if he were to ask</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">for proof from the Quran and sunnah then he would no longer remain a muqallid. Also this verse orders to ask the person of knowledge if a person does not know and the following verse restricts the questioner not to follow other than that which is revealed, that is, the Quran and sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it is proven from this that one should not follow the scholar himself but should ask the scholar for proof and then follow that. We ask about the mentioning of the people of &#8216;knowledge&#8217; in this verse. Is &#8216;knowledge&#8217; anything other than the Quran and hadith?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is it obligatory to perform taqlid?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. The Hanafi scholar Adul Hayy Lucknowi writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Only that is obligatory which Allah has made so. And only he has authority to do this. Allah did not make it obligatory on anyone that he choose for himself a madhab (school of thought today such as Hanafi, Shafi’, Maliki, Hanbali and others) of an Imam. To think it obligatory to do this is to make a new religion which Allah has not legislated for.” (<em>Sharh Muslim ath-Thabut</em>).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam Dhahabi states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Ahl us Sunnah do not make it obligatory upon anyone to follow for themselves only one specific Imam.” (<em>al-Muntaqa</em> (p.166).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is there any other person from whose tongue nothing will come except the truth, other than Muhammad?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. When the companion Abdullah bin Umar Ibn al-Aas RadhiAllahu Anhu was stopped by the Quraysh in writing the hadith (narrations) of the messenger of Allah because he (the messenger) was only a man also and at times he would be happy and at times in anger so not everything should be written down of his. Therefore, the companion Abdullah stopped writing all that was said from the tongue of the messenger. When the Prophet heard about this he pointed to his tongue and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Write! So I swear by Allah in whose hand is my soul that nothing comes from this (my tongue) except that it is the haqq (truth).” (<em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em> (1/68).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Is it permissible to ascribe to a particular madhab, being known as Hanafi, Shafi’, Maliki or Hanbali?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">No. If it were permissible for a person to ascribe himself to a particular madhhab or person then the companions would have been the foremost to make there separate and distinct madhhabs with other companions as the leaders of the particular madhhab or group. But we see that despite the existence of great companions such as the four caliphs, Ibn Umar, Ibn Masud, Ibn Abbaas RadhiAllahu Anhum and others no particular madhhabs were formed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">In fact the companions refrained from ascribing themselves to any other companion or madhab. Therefore, the companion Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">“I am not Alawi (a person who makes a particular madhab ascribing himself to the fourth caliph Ali as leader) nor am I Uthmani (a person who makes a particular madhab ascribing himself to the third caliph Uthmaan as leader), but <strong>I AM UPON THE &#8216;MILLAH&#8217; (NATION AND FOLLOWERS) OF MUHAMMAD<em>.”</em></strong> (<em>al-Ihkam</em> of Ibn Hazm (6/118).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So it can be seen that the companions did not like to ascribe themselves to any other person except Muhammad. Also the four Imams Abu Hanifah, Shafi’, Maalik and Ahmad did not have their own separate &#8216;millah&#8217;s&#8217; therefore to ascribe oneself to them cannot be permissible also. If one was to say now that there are four separate &#8216;millah&#8217;s&#8217; (nations) then this would be a different matter altogether!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">O Allah guide us all upon truly following Muhammad. Amin.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Translated by</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
[Translated in 2001, but published for the first time now]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Anas RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Straighten your rows as straightening the rows is part of establishing of the prayer.” </em>(Sahih al-Bukhari no.723).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The wording of the hadith through another chain of transmission is,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Straighten your rows, as the straightening of rows is from perfecting the prayer”</em> (Sahih Muslim no.124/433, Abu Dawud no.688, Ibn Majah no. 993, Musnad Abu Awanah 2/38, Sunan ad-Darimi no.1266, Musnad Ahmad 3/177, 253, 273, 279, 291).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We learn from this hadith straightening the rows is from establishing and the completion of the prayer. This would mean uneven rows or rows that are not straight would lead to deficiency of the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“</em><em>Straighten the rows in the prayer, as the straightening of the rows is from the perfection of the prayer.”</em> (Sahih al-Bukhari no. 723, Abdur-Razzaq no.2424).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Hurayrah RadhiAllahu Anhu also narrates Allah’s Messenger ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Perfect the straightening of the rows in prayer.”</em> (Musnad Ahmad 2/485). The narrators of this hadith are of the Sahihayn. Allaamah al-Albani graded it authentic (Sahih at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib 1/271 no.496, Sahih Ibn Hibban, Mawarid no.384, Majma’ az-Zawa’id 2/92).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We learn from these hadith straightening the rows is from perfecting and beautifying the prayer and this is what Allah’s Messenger ﷺ ordered. If the rows are not straight, it will lead to deficiency in the prayer. The straightening of the rows applies when standing and when in ruku and it is obligatory. In fact Allah’s Messenger ﷺ would first perfect the straightening of the rows and then commence the prayer. If the rows were not straight he would straighten them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Nu’man b. Bashir RadhiAllahu Anhu narrates,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“The Messenger of Allah </em><em>ﷺ used to straighten the rows until he made them like a spear or an arrow. Once he saw a man’s chest (sticking out) so Allah’s Messenger </em><em>ﷺ said, make your rows straight or Allah will create division among you.”</em> (Ibn Majah no.994, Abu Dawud no.663, Sahih Muslim no.128/436, Sahih al-Bukhari no.717 summarised)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Bara b. A’zib RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Allah’s Messenger ﷺ used to pass through the row from one side to the other; he used to set out chests and shoulders in order, and say, and do not differ in case your hearts also differ.. And he would say: Allah and His angels bless those who are near the first rows.”</em> (Abu Dawud no.664, Nasa’i no.810, Ibn Majah no.997. Zawa’id Ibn Majah mentions the chain is authentic and its narrators are trustworthy).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We learn from these authentic hadith, the rows should be straightened before the prayer. We also learn another duty of the Imam is to straighten the rows and to correct any shortcomings. It is a shame the Imams nowadays do not dispense this duty and they begin the prayer as soon as the iqamah is announced.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Worshippers should stand in the rows ensuring their feet and shoulders touch the feet and shoulders of those praying next to them without any gaps between them. Allah’s Messenger ﷺ ordered to fil the gaps in the row.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abdullah Ibn Umar RadhiAllahu Anhum said The Prophet ﷺ said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“Straighten the rows, stand shoulder to shoulder, fill the gaps, be gentle in the hands of your brothers, and do not leave gaps for shaytan. If anyone connects a row, Allah will connect him, but if anyone breaks a row, Allah will cut him off.”</em> (Abu Dawud no.666, Nasa’i no. 818, summarised, al-Bayhaqi 3/101, Ibn Khuzaimah no.1549, Mustadrak al-Hakim 1/213. Iman Hakım and adh-Dhahabi authenticated it according to the conditions of Imam Muslim. Allamah Al-Albani authenticated it in Sahih Targhib wa’t Tarhib no. 492, Musnad Ahmad 2/98).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Mundhiri explained the word ‘Farjat’, <em>“It is the plural of farjah and it refers to the gap and space between two people.”</em> We learn from this hadith we should close the gaps in the rows and there should be no space of gap between two worshippers who are praying. The action of the people who leave a gap of four fingers or more is incorrect and they should rectify this.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Anas RadhiAllahu Anhu RadhiAllahu Anhu,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“I saw each of us joining our shoulder with the shoulder of our companion and our feet with their feet, but if you were to practice this today, a person would flee from you like a restless mule.”</em> (Ibn Abi Shaybah 3/308 no. 3524, Dar al-Taj, Beirut, Fath al-Bari 2/211, Umdah al-Qari 5/260).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Nu’man b. Bashir RadhiAllahu Anhu said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“The Messenger of Allah </em><em>ﷺ</em> <em>turned to the people and said three times; straighten your rows, by Allah, you must straighten your rows, or else Allah will create disagreement between your hearts. I saw each man join shoulder to shoulder with that of his companion, knee to knee with that of his companion, and ankle bone to ankle bone with that of his [companion]”.</em> (Abu Dawud no.662, Sahih al-Bukhari in note form, Musnad Ahmad 4/276, Ibn Hibban no.396, ad-Daraqutni 1/282-283, al-Bayhaqi 3/100-101).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Uthman an-Nahdi said</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>&#8220;I was from the people whose feet Umar RadhiAllahu Anhu hit in order to straighten the row”</em> (al-Muhalla of Ibn Hazm 4/58, Mawsu’ah Fiqh Umar b. al-Khattab, p.445, Ibn Abi Shaybah 1/30 no.3530, Fath al-Bari, 2/210).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Salih b. Kaysan narrates Abdullah b. Umar RadhiAllahu Anhum said</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s more beloved to me that two of my teeth break that I see a gap in the row and I don’t fill it.&#8221;</em> (Abdur-Razzaq 2/57 no.2473, Ibn Abi Shaybah 1/333, al-Muhalla 4/59).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So, we learn from these authentic hadith that we should straighten the rows before we start praying and to close any gaps in the row, and this is an obligation. Every worshipper should join shoulder to shoulder and feet to feet with his brother in a gentle way. The Imam should begin the prayer once the row is straight in the beginning. Similarly, the row should be not be straightened once in ruku but rather before when everyone stands to commence the prayer. Similarly, the complete feet should join and not just a one toe as the Companions did and no one should run like a restless mule. The worshippers who fill the gaps will receive reward from Allah. May Allah give us tawfiq to do righteous actions and save us from exaggeration and leniency. Amin  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated by</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You alleged the Ahlul Hadith and Salafis insult Imam Abu Hanifah. This is totally incorrect, our Madhab (the Madhab of Ahlul Hadith) does not permit using derogatory words for Imam Abu Hanifah. However, everyone has the right to critique Abu Hanifah&#8217;s ijtihad and raise objection against his Madhab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Imam Malik said) Everyone’s statement can be accepted or rejected except the statement of Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. (Iqd ul-Jid (p.122), al-Insaf Fi Bayan Sabab al-Ikhtilaf (p.13), Muqaddimah Sifatus Salah (p.49)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8230;..</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Insults and abuse actually emanate for your house (ie the Hanafi Madhab) for example in your Madhab it is permissible to write the Quran with blood from a nosebleed, to write the Quran with urine, giving fiqh a greater status than the Quran, in fact giving women body parts an even greater status than both etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Durr al-Mukhtar Sharif mentions, the prayer behind an individual who swears at the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam is makruh tanzihi (prohibitively disliked) (Durr al-Mukhtar Ala Hamish ash-Shami (1/561)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To the extent that according to your fiqh such a person does not become a Kafir. (Durr al-Mukhtar (1/561)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You also believe if a person puts his feet on the Quran with the intention of desecrating it in a blasphemous manner, only then is he a Kafir otherwise he is not. (Fatawa Alamghiri (5/322)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is not placing his feet in the Quran blasphemous and desecrating it by default?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They further say, the one who accuses all the mothers of the believers of fornication except A&#8217;ishah RadhiAllahu Anha is not a Kafir and much more.</span></p>
