<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [MUSLIM]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/952, 953 hadith no.1841, book 51, chapter 5, hadith no.14), at-Tamhid (2/279) and al-Istidhkar (no.1777) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Muslim (no.1031) from the hadith of Malik, and al-Bukhari (no.6806) from the hadith of Khubaib Ibn Abdurahman al-Ansari from Hafs Ibn Hashim with the same hadith.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Hafidh Ibn Abdul Bar took the word &#8220;Dhilla&#8221; (shade) and understood it to mean mercy. If the meaning of the word literally means shade then this would mean the shade of Allah&#8217;s Throne as it is mentioned in another hadith that, &#8220;&#8230;seven people will be given shade under Allah&#8217;s Throne&#8230;&#8221; (Mushkil al-Athar of at-Tahawi, new edition 15/69 hadith no.5844, Tuhfatul Akhyar 7/195 hadith no.5117 and it&#8217;s chain is [Sahih] authentic). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Whosoever is lenient with with the loan of someone who owes them (i.e. allows them a longer time to pay back, or reduces and forgives them part of the loan or pays of their debt etc.), &#8220;&#8230;Allah will shade him on the Day of Judgement under His Throne&#8230;&#8221; (Sunan at-Tirmidhi no.1302, and he said, &#8220;Hasan Sahih Garib&#8221; and it&#8217;s chain is [Sahih] authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The wording in a hadith of Mu&#8217;adh Ibn Jabal (Radi Allahu Anhu) are, &#8220;&#8230;Allah will put them under the shade of His Throne&#8230;&#8221; (al-Mustadrak of al-Hakim 4/169 hadith no.7315, and it&#8217;s chain is [Sahih] authentic and al-Hakim authenticated it on the conditions of Bukhari and Muslim and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) This hadith points towards many important matters such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of a just leader</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of a youth who spends their youthful days in the worship of Allah</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who is connected to the Masjid and loves it and gives it preference over and above worldly matters </span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who loves and hates someone for the sake of Allah only and not because of a worldly or personal gain </span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who remembers Allah and cries whilst they are alone</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who fears Allah when a noble and beautiful woman invites him to a sinful act of relationship </span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The virtue of the one who gives charity in Allah&#8217;s path secretly </span></li>

<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>READ <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/clearing-the-allegations-and-attack-on-allamah-rabbani-shaikh-muhammad-nasir-al-din-al-albani-1420h-part-1-the-hanafi-fiqh-channel/">Part 1</a></span> <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/clearing-the-allegations-and-attack-on-allamah-rabbani-shaikh-muhammad-nasir-al-din-al-albani-1420h-part-2-the-hanafi-fiqh-channel-hanafi-asharis-on-the-hadith-in-sahih-mus/">Part 2</a> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/clearing-the-allegations-and-attack-on-allamah-rabbani-shaikh-muhammad-nasir-al-din-al-albani-1420h-part-3-the-hanafi-fiqh-channel-modern-writers-shaikh-al-albanis-clarific/">Part 3</a></span> <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/clearing-the-allegations-and-attack-on-allamah-rabbani-shaikh-muhammad-nasir-ud-din-al-albani-1420h-part-4-15-points-in-response-to-the-piteous-video-of-the-hanafi-fiqh-channel-o/">Part 4</a></strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the 15 point in response to the piteous video of the hanafi fiqh channel left a sour taste in your mouths, this will not be any easier. Therefore, no long discourses, polemics or semantics, we will show you the reality of these people i.e. the Hanafi fiqh channel and their cohorts, their dire and embarrassing double standards through their criteria of bigoted hanafi partisanship and madhhabist spirit. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The hanafi fiqh channel ran with a youtube video of Shaikh al-Albani allegedly weakening a hadith is Bukhari, but did they develop amnesiac delirium when their own scholars and arch proponents of the Asharite Maturidi Hanafi Madhhab, the defender of the Hanafi Madhab, the Majnun Abi Hanifah, Muhammad Zahid bin Hussain al-Kawthari weakened hadith in Bukhari and Muslim. What happened? You turned a blind eye to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As mentioned before, if you had any fairness and justice you would make a youtube video against Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, but obviously you don&#8217;t have the guts to do that right? Why because he is not a &#8216;leader of the salafiyyah group&#8217; and that he is a &#8216;leader of the Ash&#8217;ari hanafiyyah group&#8217;? We also mentioned that you opened this bab and inshAllah we are going to open it properly for you and let everyone in, and we will see how many Hanafi Ash&#8217;ari&#8217;s walk through, let us begin</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani&#8217;s responded to the fanatical Hanafi Ash&#8217;arites, he said you accuse me of weakening hadith in Bukhari and Muslim, let me show you with books and page numbers where (your) &#8216;Ustadh&#8217; Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari weakened and criticised ahadith in the Sahihayn. Shaikh al-Albani asks Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah a rhetorical question regarding his Shaikh, al-Kawthari who weakened hadith in the Sahihayn or either in Bukhari or Muslim, and as such they are ahadith which are well established according to the Ahl al-Hadith. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani then proceeds to list the ahadith al-Kawthari criticised or weakened that are in the Sahihayn or in either one of them in from Sharh Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah (</span><span style="color: #000000;">p.39)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>1. The hadith that Allah created soil/clay. It is transmitted by Muslim.</strong></span></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith al-Kawthari makes kalam on is is as follows,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Abu Huraira reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) took hold of my hands and said Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, created the clay on Saturday and He created the mountains on Sunday and He created the trees on Monday and He created the things entailing labour on Tuesday and created light on Wednesday and He caused the animals to spread on Thursday and created Adam (peace be upon him) after &#8216;Asr on Friday; the last creation at the last hour of the hours of Friday, i. e. between afternoon and night. This hadith is narrated through another chain of transmitters.&#8221;</em> (Muslim no.2789)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>2. The hadith in which Musa Alayhis Salam advised the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to go back and have the prayers reduced from 50, on the night of al-Isra. It is Agreed Upon</strong> <strong>(i.e. both Bukhari and Muslim transmit it.)</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Kawthari&#8217;s notes to <em>al-Asma was-Sifat</em>, p.189) (p.186-187, Turath Edition)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Compilers Note:</strong></span> <span style="color: #000000;">The hadith in question is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I was brought al-Buraq Who is an animal white and long, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule, who would place his hoof a distance equal to the range of version. I mounted it and came to the Temple (Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem), then tethered it to the ring used by the prophets. I entered the mosque and prayed two rak&#8217;ahs in it, and then came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriel said: You have chosen the natural thing. Then he took me to heaven. Gabriel then asked the (gate of heaven) to be opened and he was asked who he was. He replied: Gabriel. He was again asked: Who is with you? He (Gabriel) said: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? Gabriel replied: He has indeed been sent for. And (the door of the heaven) was opened for us and lo! we saw Adam. He welcomed me and prayed for my good. Then we ascended to the second heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) (asked the door of heaven to be opened), and he was asked who he was. He answered: Gabriel; and was again asked: Who is with you? He replied: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. The gate was opened. When I entered &#8216;Isa b. Maryam and Yahya b. Zakariya (peace be upon both of them), cousins from the maternal side. welcomed me and prayed for my good Then I was taken to the third heaven and Gabriel asked for the opening (of the door). He was asked: Who are you? He replied: Gabriel. He was (again) asked: Who is with you? He replied Muhammad (ﷺ). It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and I saw Yusuf (peace of Allah be upon him) who had been given half of (world) beauty. He welcomed me prayed for my well-being. Then he ascended with us to the fourth heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) asked for the (gate) to be opened, and it was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was (again) said: Who is with you? He said: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. The (gate) was opened for us, and lo! Idris was there. He welcomed me and prayed for my well-being (About him) Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious, has said:&#8221; We elevated him (Idris) to the exalted position&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an xix. 57). Then he ascended with us to the fifth heaven and Gabriel asked for the (gate) to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He replied Gabriel. It was (again) said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad. It was said Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and then I was with Harun (Aaron-peace of Allah be upon him). He welcomed me prayed for my well-being. Then I was taken to the sixth heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) asked for the door to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and there I was with Musa (Moses peace be upon him) He welcomed me and prayed for my well-being. Then I was taken up to the seventh heaven. Gabriel asked the (gate) to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He said: Gabriel It was said. Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad (may peace be upon him.) It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and there I found Ibrahim (Abraham peace be upon him) reclining against the Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur and there enter into it seventy thousand angels every day, never to visit (this place) again. Then I was taken to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha whose leaves were like elephant ears and its fruit like big earthenware vessels. And when it was covered by the Command of Allah, it underwent such a change that none amongst the creation has the power to praise its beauty. Then Allah revealed to me a revelation and He made obligatory for me fifty prayers every day and night. Then I went down to Moses (peace be upon him) and he said: What has your Lord enjoined upon your Ummah? I said: Fifty prayers. He said: Return to thy Lord and beg for reduction (in the number of prayers), for your community shallnot be able to bear this burden. as I have put to test the children of Isra&#8217;il and tried them (and found them too weak to bear such a heavy burden). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I went back to my Lord and said: My Lord, make things lighter for my Ummah. (The Lord) reduced five prayers for me. I went down to Moses and said. (The Lord) reduced five (prayers) for me, He said: Verily thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden; return to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. I then kept going back and forth between my Lord Blessed and Exalted and Moses, till He said: There are five prayers every day and night. O Muhammad, each being credited as ten, so that makes fifty prayers. He who intends to do a good deed and does not do it will have a good deed recorded for him; and if he does it, it will be recorded for him as ten; whereas he who intends to do an evil deed and does not do, it will not be recorded for him; and if he does it, only one evil deed will be recorded. I then came down and when I came to Moses and informed him, he said: Go back to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: I returned to my Lord until I felt ashamed before Him.&#8221;</em> (Bukhari no.13, 478, 479, Muslim no.162)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>3. The hadith concerning seeing Allah on Yaum al-Qiyamah, which also mentions the hypocrites will not see Allah in his real image. It is transmitted by the two Shaikhs.</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(al-Kawthari&#8217;s notes to <em>al-Asma was-Sifat</em>, p.292) (Turath Edition p.278-279)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Compilers Note:</strong></span> <span style="color: #000000;">The hadith in question is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Abu Huraira reported: The people said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): Messenger of Allah, shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the moon on the night when it is full? They said: Messenger of Allah, no. He (the Messenger) further said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the sun, when there is no cloud over it? They said: Messenger of Allah. no. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Verily you would see Him like this (as you see the sun and the moon). God will gather people on the Day of Resurrection and say: Let every people follow what they worshipped. Those who worshipped the sun would follow the sun, and those who worshipped the moon would follow the moon, and those who worshipped the devils would follow the devils. This Ummah (of Islam) alone would be left behind and there would be hypocrites too amongst it. Allah would then come to them in a form other than His own Form, recognisable to them, and would say: I am your Lord. They would say: We take refuge with Allah from thee. We will stay here till our Lord comes to us. and when our Lord would come we would recognise Him. Subsequently Allah would come to them in His own Form, recognisable to them, and say: I am your Lord. They would say: Thou art our Lord. And they would follow Him, and a bridge would be set over the Hell; and I (the Holy Prophet) and my Ummah would be the first to pass over it; and none but the messengers would speak on that day, and the prayer of the messengers on that day would be: O Allah! grant safety, grant safety. In Hell, there would be long spits like the thorns of Sa&#8217;dan He (the Holy Prophet) said: Have you seen Sa&#8217;dan? They replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah. He said: Verily those (hooks) would be like the thorns of Sa&#8217;dan, but no one knows their size except Allah. These would seize people for their misdeeds. Some of them would escape for their (good) deeds, and some would be rewarded for their deeds till they get salvation. When Allah would finish judging His bondsmen and because of His mercy decide to take out of Hell such people as He pleases. He would command the angels to bring out those who had not associated anything with Allah; to whom Allah decided to show mercy. those who would say: There is no god but Allah. They (the angels) would recognise them in the Fire by the marks of prostration, for Hell-fire will devour everything (limb) of the sons of Adam except the marks of prostration. Allah has forbidden the fire to consume the marks of prostration. They will be taken out of the Fire having been burnt, and the water of life would be poured over them, and they will sprout as seed does In the silt carried by flood. Then Allah would finish judging amongst His bondsmen; but a man who will be the last to enter Paradise will remain facing Hell and will say: O my Lord I turn my face away from Hell, for its air has poisoned me ard its blaze has burnt me. He will then call to Allah as long as Allah would wish that he should call to Him. Then Allah, Blessed and Exalted, would say: If I did that, perhaps you would ask for more than that. He would say: I would not ask You more than this, and he would give his Lord covenants and agreements as Allah wished, and so He would turn his face away from the Fire When he turns towards the Paradise and sees it, he will remain silent as long as Allah wishes him to remain so. He will then say: O my Lord I bring me forward to the gate of the Paradise. Allah would say to him: Did you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything besides what I had given you. Woe to thee! O son of Adam, how treacherous you are! He would say: O my Lord! and would continue calling to Allah till He would say to him: If I grant you that, perhaps you will ask for more. He will reply: No, by Thy greatness, and he will give His Lord promises and covenants as Allah had wished. He would then bring him to the gate of the Paradise, and when he would stand at the gate of the Paradise, it would lay open before him. and he would see the bounty and the joy that there is in it. He would remain quiet as long as Allah would desire him to remain silent. He would then say: O my Lord, admit me to Paradise. Allah. Blessed and Exalted, would say: Did you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything more than what I had granted you? Woe to you! son of Adam, how treacherous you are! And he would say: O my Lord, I do not wish to be the most miserable of Thy creatures. He would continue calling upon Allah till Allah, Blessed and Exalted, would laugh. When Allah would laugh at him, He would say: Enter the Paradise. When he would enter, Allah would say: State your wish. He would express his wishes till Allah would remind him (the desire of) such and such (things). When his desires would be exhausted Allah would say: That is for thee and, besides it, the like of it also. &#8216;Ata&#8217; b. Yazid said: Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri was with Abu Huraira and be did not reject anything from the hadith narrated by him, but when Abu Huraira narrated:&#8221; Allah said to that man; ind its like along with it,&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said:&#8221; Ten like it along with it,&#8221; O Abu Huraira. Abu Huraira said: I do not remember except the words:&#8221; That is for you and a similar one along with it.&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said: I bear witness to the fact that I remembered from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) his words:&#8221; That is for thee and ten like it.&#8221; Abu Huraira said: That man was the last of those deserving of Paradise to enter Paradise.&#8221; </em>(Bukhari 11:444, 446, 13:319-320), Muslim no.182)</span></p>

Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) looked towards us and laughed until his molar teeth became visible. He then again said: May I inform you about that with which they would season it? He said: Do it, of course. He said: Their seasoning would be balim and fish. The Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) said: What is this balam? He said: Ox and fish from whose excessive livers seventy thousand people would be able to eat.&#8221;</em> (Bukhari 11:372, Muslim no.2792)</span></p>

Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a mirage. Then it will be said to the Jews, &#8220;What did you use to worship?&#8217; They will reply, &#8216;We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son.

When there remain only those who used to worship Allah (Alone), both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, it will be said to them, &#8216;What keeps you here when all the people have gone?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We parted with them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today, we heard the call of one proclaiming, &#8216;Let every nation follow what they used to worship,&#8217; and now we are waiting for our Lord.&#8217; Then the Almighty will come to them in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, &#8216;I am your Lord,&#8217; and they will say, &#8216;You are not our Lord.&#8217; And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and then it will be said to them, &#8216;Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?&#8217; They will say. &#8216;The Shin,&#8217; and so Allah will then uncover His Shin whereupon every believer will prostrate before Him and there will remain those who used to prostrate before Him just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate but their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not be able to prostrate). Then the bridge will be laid across Hell.&#8221; We, the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)! What is the bridge?&#8217;</em><em>He said, &#8220;It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are clamps and (Hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the other and has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in Najd and is called As-Sa&#8217;dan. Some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye, some others as quick as lightning, a strong wind, fast horses or she-camels. So some will be safe without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some scratches, and some will fall down into Hell (Fire). The last person will cross by being dragged (over the bridge).&#8221; The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &#8220;You (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming from me a right that has been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding with Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves safe. </em></span></p>

They will go to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle of their legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then they will return, and Allah will say (to them), &#8216;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one half Dinar.&#8217; They will take out whomever they will recognize and return, and then Allah will say, &#8216;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant), and so they will take out all those whom they will recognize.&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said: If you do not believe me then read the Holy Verse:&#8211;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8216;Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.&#8217; (4.40) The Prophet added, &#8220;Then the prophets and Angels and the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the Almighty (Allah) will say, &#8216;Now remains My Intercession. He will then hold a handful of the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the water of life. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the torrent grows. You have noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how the side facing the sun is usually green while the side facing the shade is white. Those people will come out (of the River of Life) like pearls, and they will have (golden) necklaces, and then they will enter Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say, &#8216;These are the people emancipated by the Beneficent. He has admitted them into Paradise without them having done any good deeds and without sending forth any good (for themselves).&#8217; Then it will be said to them, &#8216;For you is what you have seen and its equivalent as well.&#8221;</em> (Bukhari 8:663, 664, 13:420, 422, Muslim no.183)</span></p>

<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Kawthari also weakens the hadith where Ali sends Abu al-Hayya al-Asadi to destroy images and high graves. The text of the hadith is,</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Abu&#8217;l-Hayyaj al-Asadi said that Ali (b. Abu Talib) said to him: &#8220;Should I not send you on the same mission as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) sent me? Do not leave an image without obliterating it, or a high grave without levelling It. This hadith has been reported by Habib with the same chain of transmitters and he said: (Do not leave) a picture without obliterating it.&#8221;</em> (Muslim no.969)</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Kawthari weakens this hadith in his <em>Maqalat al-Kawthari</em> (p.159)</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not need to introduce al-Kawthari to you, dear readers, as his reality and affair is clear and manifest. However, we would like to present just one example in how the Hanafi Deobandi Ash&#8217;ari Maturidi&#8217;s are part of this trinitarian nexus of Hanafi Ash&#8217;ari/Maturidi, Deobandi Sufi and Barelwi Sufi and how they are all interlinked and intrinsically connected.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The well known Hanafi Deobandi Ash&#8217;ari Maturidi Ustadh, Mawlana Muhammad Yusuf Binnouri, who was the student of Mawlana Anwar Shah Kashmiri, who in turn was a student of Mawlana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, Mawlana Mahmud al-Hasan and Mawlana Abdul Qadir Raipuri. This is the link.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Muhammad Yusuf Binnouri lauds, extols and praises the likes of this, al-Kawthari, whose popularity is unique due to his appalling and reprehensible views and doctrines. In this era he championed the ideas of the Jahmiyyah, Murji&#8217;ah and the Mu&#8217;tazilies all under the defence of the hanafi madhhab.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even the likes of Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmad and his Dar ul-taqlid have association with him, they venerate him and are secret admirers without having plucked the courage to openly promote him as of yet, except use him when they need without giving the game away.</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Yusuf Binnouri introduced the compilation of articles of Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, titled Maqalat al-Kawthari, which is spread over 10 pages. Over the 10 pages he praises him, that he refutes the detractors etc, in one place he says,</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;(he was) a pure upright hanafi who destroyed all big and small idols.&#8221;</em> (Introduction to Maqalat al-Kawthari p.6)</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">he also he was,</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was a shining sword, an unsheathed famous Indian sword.&#8221;</em> (Introduction to Maqalat al-Kawthari p.7)</span></p>
<p class="text_details" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the reality of the Deobandi Hanafi&#8217;s who are Ash&#8217;arites Maturidi&#8217;s. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><em><strong>The Hanafi Fiqh Channels Recent video on Allamah Rabbani Imam Shaikh Muhammad Nāsir ud-Dīn al-Albani by the Bradford crew</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><em><strong>Hanafi Ash&#8217;ari&#8217;s on the Hadith in Sahih Muslim &#8211; Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah and his Madhhab Fanatacism </strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Read</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/clearing-the-allegations-and-attack-on-allamah-rabbani-shaikh-muhammad-nasir-al-din-al-albani-1420h-part-1-the-hanafi-fiqh-channel/">Part 1</a></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yet again, recently the intellectual prowess of some people arose in Bradfud, the Ash&#8217;ari Deobandi&#8217;s in conjunction with the ta&#8217;an ie slanderous accusation on the name Abu Hanifah as the Hanafi Fiqh Channel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They released a video on the categorisation and grading of Shaikh al-Albani concerning the ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari. Posts of this nature will by no means explain or clarify such intricate and fine issues of the science of Hadith and illal. This inshaAllah, is to be addressed in due course.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This manipulative presentation and associated distortions are nothing new from these Ash&#8217;ari Deobandi&#8217;s, as their scholars, other Ash’arites as well underlings of this camp have presented other deceitful allegations. They alleged that Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani also rendered some ahadith in Sahih Muslim to be weak, again this is not the place to enter into these issues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, what I wanted to share was the horrible double standards these people employ and how they turn a blind eye to their own scholars, Shuyukhs they revere. It highlights how these people disastrously forget the true reality, yet under the guise of attacking and vilifying Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, they develop selective amnesia. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This being said, we hope the honest reader who fears Allah and the last day can judge for himself and see the truth and the double standards.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah, the student of Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, the one who lauded the Deobandi Echelons and his understanding of the Hadith in SAHIH MUSLIM</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abdul-Fattah-Abu-Guddah.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-8076 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abdul-Fattah-Abu-Guddah.jpeg?resize=479%2C423" alt="abdul Fattah Abu Guddah" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abdul-Fattah-Abu-Guddah.jpeg?resize=300%2C265 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abdul-Fattah-Abu-Guddah.jpeg?resize=768%2C678 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abdul-Fattah-Abu-Guddah.jpeg?resize=1024%2C905 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abdul-Fattah-Abu-Guddah.jpeg?w=1080 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>“I first met Shaikh Abdul-Fattaah Abu Guddah in his city, Aleppo, more than twenty years ago approximately. I realised that he was a man who was bigoted towards the Hanafi madhhab such that he blindly followed it when in his mosque in Aleppo he agreed to the permissibility of treating someone with alcohol under the supervision of a skilled, Muslim doctor.</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>So I said to him, “This is not enough. The doctor must also be well-acquainted with the Sunnah. For in the Sunnah, for example, alcohol has been described as being a disease and not a cure. So how can a Muslim doctor who knows the Sharee’ah prescribe a cure which the Prophet, صلى الله عليه وسلم, described as being a disease?!”</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>So he said, “Perhaps the hadith is weak or not authentic!” I replied, “How can it be when it is in Sahih Muslim?” So he said, “We will go back and check it to make sure.”</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>So one of the people who was present and he was a friend to both parties in the debate said, “So when you do check and find out that it is authentic, will you act upon it or what the madhhab says?”</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>So he replied, “The madhhab!”</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(Hayat al-Allamah al-Albani Bi Qalamihi (p.38-41), Kashf al-Niqab (p.9) </strong></span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The <em>Kashf al-Niqab</em> was first printed in 1395H / 1975ce, this should give you an idea how long these people were extreme fanatics towards their madhab. Yet they talk about hadith of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So what does Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah say, he says he will check the Hadith in SAHIH MUSLIM because he considered it to be weak or the fact that he did not even know it was in SAHIH MUSLIM</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear readers, and we have not even directed our attention to Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari yet and this is not even the top of the iceberg. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will inshaAllah, with the permission and aid of Allah alone show the historical assertions the Hanafi Ash’arites have made concerning the Sahihs of Imam’s Bukhari and Muslim.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">10 Radiant Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith; Ahl al-Bid’ah Wished Were Never Born!</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>[3]</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Imam Muhammad Fakhir Za’ir Ilabadi</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>1120H-1164H</strong></span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(1708c-1751c)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari </strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">His full name is Muhammad Fakhir and known as Za’ir, the son of Shaikh Muhammad Yahya. His title is as ash-Shaikh al-Alim al-Kabir al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir bin Muhammad Yahya bin Muhammad Amin al-Abbasi Ilabadi. (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence is Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir bin Shaikh Muhammad Yahya Ilabadi. (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.334)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had two brothers, one was Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Ilabadi who was a reputable scholar of the Din. His maternal grandfather was Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi, whose lineage could be traced back to Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhu).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find that Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was from a family of learning who valued and gave Islamic education great importance. The family were known amongst the people for their knowledge and attachment to the sacred Islamic sciences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From an early age Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir started learning from his father, grandfather and older brother and benefited greatly from them. It led him to acquire knowledge quickly and thereby becoming highly proficient and competent in the sacred Islamic sciences. (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>A Brief Overview of his Family</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(1) His father; Shaikh Muhammad Yahya Ilabadi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a major scholar of his day and the author of <em>Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram</em> praised him by saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was an ocean of knowledge in the sciences, once that sent waves of this knowledge resounding with the people and he authored a number of books and treatises.” (</em>Ma&#8217;athir Al-Kiram (2:218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had three sons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(i) Shaikh Muhammad Tahir</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(ii) Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(iii) Shaikh Shah Muhammad Hasir Afsali</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All three sons and father were keen poets and enjoyed poetry.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(2) His grandfather; Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No detailed information could be obtained regarding his biography.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(3) His brother; Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Ilabadi (b.1110H &#8211; d.1143H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the older brother of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir, he was a person of knowledge and virtue, Shaikh Muhammad Ra&#8217;is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was upon the Salafi Madhab and an Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith just like his brother as we find from his writings.&#8221;</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.193)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Hayy al-Hasani said he was well aware and acquainted with the Madhabs of the Salaf and Khalaf and that his brothers sought knowledge from him. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:332-333 no.615)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Seeking the Knowledge of Hadith from Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi [1163H]</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir studied with Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi in the year 1149H when he travelled to the 2 sanctuaries and visited Madinah. At the time Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami was also studying with Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi and hence both were of similar stature in terms of their sittings. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339-340), Taqsar Junud al-Ahrar Min Tazkar Junud al-Abrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Fakhir studied and read <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em> on Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi to the extent that he gained great credibility and heights which conjured up immense love for Hadith in his heart, such was the case that he became rigid and firm on the Quran and Hadith his whole life. (Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.141)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Hayat Sindhi also gave him Ijazah for the two Sahihs as well as other books. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349), Sarwar Azad (p.213), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.141)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Under the Tutelage of Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir studied with Shaikh Azad Bilgirami, as another beneficial point it is sufficient to note that Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlavi also studied under Shaikh Azad Bilgirami, meaning that Shaikh Azad Bilgirami was a teacher of both of them however their period of study was different. (Sarwar Azad (p.213+), Itihaf an-Nabula (p.406-407), Ma&#8217;arif (22:339)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Stay in The Two Blessed Sanctuaries</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir had special love for the 2 blessed lands and hence for the purpose and intent of seeking and consolidating his knowledge he remained there for a few years. During this period, he performed 2 Hajjs. After returning to India, he intended to perform his third Hajj in the year 1154H and whilst he set out, some goons captured him near Surat and stole all of his belongings except his books and eventually gave him a ride to the city of Surat. (Sarwar Azad (p.214), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335), Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He attempted to perform Hajj again in the year 1156H and whilst travelling by ship, the journey was short lived due to ship wreck. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir ended up residing in Bandar Faha for a few days and then eventually reached his destination of Hijaz safely in the same year and then finally returned back to India in 1159H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In one of his journeys to Hajj he returned with an edition of <em>Sahih Muslim</em>, which was copied by Mawlana Ruh al-Amin Khan, which is preserved in Habin Ganj library. (Ma&#8217;arif (23:91-92), Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349), Sarwar Azad (p.214), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.71), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.335, 340).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After seeking the traditional knowledge and sciences he began to teach his students with great vigour and fervour. He was known to have reached the status of being a Muhaddith at a very young age and thus a large number of people benefited from his knowledge and understanding.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This can easily be deduced and understood from the fact that when Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan sent Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati to study with Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlavi, he later sent him to Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir to seek knowledge of Hadith and its sciences. This clearly shows Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was a great scholar of Hadith of his era and was highly proficient as a Hadith master.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From his students were his two sons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(1) Shaikh Qutb ud-Din (1187H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(2) Shaikh Muhammad Ajmal (1236H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and also</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(3) Shaikh Qadhi Thanullah Pani Pati (1225H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(4) Shaikh Murtaza Bilgirami (al-Zabidi) (1205H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(5) Shaikh Ghulam Haidar Khan Kakawri (1252H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(6) Shaikh Ghulam Safdar Khan (1283H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(7) Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi (1234H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(8) Shaikh Muhammad Nasih</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(see Mashahir Kakawri (p.300), Tazkirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140), Siratul Bukhari (p.37-38).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Shaikh Qutb Al-Din bin Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir (b.1138H &#8211; 1187H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the Shaikhs eldest son, and was often responsible for teaching the people as well delivering regular lessons, he essentially took over his father’s role in teaching, more so when his father would travel to perform Hajj. He has been mentioned with great virtue with regards to his command of the various sciences and disciplines, especially the knowledge of <em>Fiqh</em> and its principles ie <em>Fiqh</em> and <em>Usul al-Fiqh</em> and other areas of learning. He died while he travelled to Makkah to perform Hajj and was thus buried there. He also authored some books. (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:235-236 no.437).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra&#8217;is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was upon the way of his father and uncle, on the Madhab of Ahl al-Hadith.&#8221;</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.192)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The affect of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir on his students was so profound that it was manifest in their writings. This was more so in adhering and abiding by the ahadith and rejecting any form of blameworthy and rigid staunch Taqlid which is prevalent with the muqallidin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">An example of this is what Shaikh Qadhi Thanullah Pani Pati said in his will, in that Surah Fatihah is to be recited after the first takbir and opening supplication even though he is famously attributed to the hanafi madhab. (<em>Wasiyat Nama</em> printed with <em>Majmu&#8217;a Wasaya</em> Number 4 (p.146).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi (1234H)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Ishaq Lehrawi authored a book on raising the hands in the prayer titled, <em>&#8216;Nur Al-Aynayn Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain.&#8217;</em> This maybe an addendum to his Shaikh work or his own personal work and Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is said about him that he was exemplary and unmatched in speaking the truth and being vocal in this and he spent a large part of his life strictly following the Quran and Hadith and adhering to the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He says in one place in his book, <em>&#8216;Nur Al-Aynayn Fi Ithbat Raf ul-Yadain&#8217;,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When I have obeyed and followed the Messenger of Allah </em><em>ﷺ</em> <em>I am totally unconcerned with the statements of Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Sufyan ath-Thawri and Imam at-Zuhri.&#8221;</em> (Tarajim Ulama Hadith (p.383), Tazkirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (pg.142), Siratul Bukhari (p.37-38)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Will</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was firm and strong in adhering to the Quran and Sunnah and thus vehemently abhorred grave worship and so he willed that he was to be buried next to Shaikh Abdul Latif in Burhanpur. This was due to the fact it was only his grave that was not venerated and worshipped. Hence, according to his wish he was buried next to Shaikh Abdul Latif.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Status and Position</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was a mujtahid, a Salafi and not a muqallid. We find by looking at his books that he was undoubtedly an Ahl al-Hadith and refrained from doing Taqlid of anyone. He was a mujtahid in his own right and this supported by the statement of Shaikh Abdul Hay al-Hasani which is to proceed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah blessed Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir with a great station and status.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is Nadwi said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He studied with numerous teachers and began teaching at the tender age of 20. He achieved the title of Shaikh. He then went to Haramayn Sharifayn in 1149H to perform Hajj and Umrah. He visited The Prophets Masjid and eventually sought knowledge of hadith and other disciplines from the Shaikh of the Shaikhs, Muhammad Hayat Sindhi and eventually returned back to his native land. He would visit Haramayn Sharifayn numerous times.”</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh (p.195)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Author of Risalah Najatiyyah of Shaikh al-Fazil Al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir with the title of Za&#8217;ir Ilabadi.&#8221;</em> (Ittihaf an-Nabula (p.84) Also refer to Intiqad at-Rajih (p.84), Taqsar Junud al-Ahrar Min Tazkar Junud al-Abrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At another instance Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He detested venerating the holy men ie the pirs and he would write in refutation of them. He would encourage adhering to the Quran and Sunnah. It is sufficient testimony for Shaikh Muhammad Fakhirs trustworthiness and uprightness that Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan and Shaikh Ghulam Ali Azad Bilgirami bore witness to his great virtue, immense noble character and extensive knowledge.&#8221;</em> (Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan said at another place,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was the Imam of the Imams of the followers of the Sunnah in India and he was from amongst the Shaikh of the Shuyukhs from the major and well known scholars.&#8221;</em> (Taqsar al-Junud al-Ahrar (p.115).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ismail Salafi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It is apparent from the authors poems that he was a fearless caller to Tawhid and the Sunnah, and at the same instance he would rebuke the customary staunch bigoted Taqlid. This would inevitably lead to some harshness but nonetheless he was very intelligent and the scholars would respect him highly.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Azad Bilgrami said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan said, &#8220;I have seen many notable people but after 11 hundred years I saw the likes of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir and I found him to conform and agree with the Quran and Sunnah.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram Fi Tazkirrah Ulama Bilgiram (2:218), (Sarwar Azad (p.218), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.337)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He (ie Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan) would would visit me with respect but with Shaikh Fakhir he was even more respectful and humble.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Shaikh Mirza Mazhar Jan Janan would go to visit Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir Ilabadi himself which was not the norm for him.&#8221;</em> (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati praised Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir with the following words,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ash-Shaikh al-Ustadh Muhammad Fakhir al-Muhaddith Rahimahullah said that it was unlawful to make a masjid next to a grave whilst deducing from the Hadith of Abi Lahaij in Sahih Muslim.&#8221;</em> (Tafsir Mazhari (6:23)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Qadi Thanullah Pani Pati undoubtedly, was a non staunch open minded Hanafi Scholar searching for the truth such that the current day Hanafis would not bat an eyelid except to shun and ostracise him and label him as a pseudo Hanafi as the word pseudo is often used and accustomed on the tongues of the bewildered retractors. So despite this Shaikh Thanullah Pani Pati would would still have great respect for him despite him being an Ahl al-Hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whereas in our times it is the total opposite and the present day Hanafis have left the teachings and mindset of their forefathers and abuse the Ahl al-Hadith. (Refer to Nur us-Sunnah (p.5-6)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Abdul Hayy al-Hasani said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ash-Shaikh Al-Alim Al-Kabir Al-Muhaddith Muhammad Fakhir bin Muhammad Yahya bin Muhammad Amin Al-Abbasi al-Salafi Ilabadi, one the well known and famous scholars.&#8221;</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:349 no.641)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto say,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;All the people were agreed in praise of him and his noble characteristics, he was someone who was referred to in such affairs. He did not restrict himself to only one specific madhab nor did he do taqlid of anyone in the affairs of the Din rather he followed the texts of the Quran and Sunnah and did Ijtihad which he was well qualified and capable to do.&#8221;</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:350)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qadi Atthar Mubarakpuri said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He was a major Muhaddith of his era.”</em> (Tazakirrah Ulama Mubarakpur (p.140)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Ra’is Nadwi said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“…We can see just from the titles of his books that it is apparent he was Ahl al-Hadith and upon the Salafi Madhab, he would openly say he was an Ahl al-Hadith and would spread the Manhaj of Ahl al-Hadith…..In summary, this Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith of the twelfth century, who was accepted and praised by whose who were not from the Ahl al-Hadith. The Imam was an outspoken, formidable and fervent propagator of the Madhab of Ahl al-Hadith, coupled with the fact that he was accepted by both the Ahl al-Hadith non Ahl al-Hadith, thus it is not impossible a large group of the muqallidin did not adopt and change to the Madhab of the Ahl al-Hadith due to the arduous efforts of this Imam of Ahl al-Hadith.”</em> (Tarikh Ahl al-Hadith Hindh p.196)     </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Allamah Azad Bilgrami&#8217;s (1294H) Praise for Imam Muhammad Fakhir.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Azad Bilgrami wrote a poem in Farsi on the death of Imam Muhammad Fakhir&#8217;s in respect of him and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was known as Za&#8217;ir (in the poets circles) and his name was Muhammad Fakhir, the son of Shaikh Muhammad and the grandson of Shaikh Muhammad Afzal Ilabadi, and we empowered the three, he assumed the role of the Musnad of his elders. In doing so he was very noble, virtuous and reached a high rank as well as having lofty characteristics.&#8221;</em> (Sarwar Azad (p.212), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.70)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>An Expert Master in the Sciences</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was an excelled master in the Islamic principles and far ahead in the sciences of texts and their comprehension from his counterparts, this was also applicable to some of the scholars prior to his era.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir excelled and was a specialist in Hadith and its various sciences as well has having the rank of a mujtahid in issues of <em>fiqh</em> ie jurisprudence.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Writings and Works</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir authored a number of treatises. The Hanafite biographer, Shaikh Abdul Hayy said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“He authored a number of books in spreading the Sunnah.”</em> (Nuzhah al-Khawatir (6:350)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">some of them are</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(1) Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqa&#8217;id Al-Hadithiyyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the scholars referred to this book as <em>Risalah Najatiyyah Dar Aqa&#8217;id Al-Athariyyah</em>. There is probable cause for this as Imam Muhammad Fakhir authored this book on the methodology Ahl al-Hadith and hence the Athari creed. It has only been printed twice and Walillahil Hamd we have published it for a third time.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Risalah Najatiyyah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we have already mentioned some scholars referred to this book with two equally interchangeable names. This classical 12th century text on Salafi creed was authored by Imam Muhammad Fakhir when he had to reside in Chittagong in Bangladesh for between 3-4 months in the year 1161H ie 3 years before his death. The original book is preserved in Mawlana Abdul Ghani al-Baqi’s library in Dinajpur in Bengal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treatise as also mentioned before is based purely on the Salafi Creed and Manhaj and hence the Quran and Sunnah and it is from Imam Muhammad Fakhir last works. One can gauge the importance and significance of this book from the fact that Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan translated the book from Farsi into Urdu as Farsi was the original language it was written in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-8048 alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=306%2C343" alt="najatiyyah old" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=268%2C300 268w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=768%2C861 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?resize=913%2C1024 913w, https://i2.wp.com/www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/najatiyyah-old.png?w=1040 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan produced a summarised transation and included it in his book <em>&#8216;Al-Mu&#8217;taqad Al-Muntaqad&#8217;</em> which was printed in the year 1305H from Matba&#8217;a Al-Ansari in Delhi. Furthermore, he included the whole book in Farsi in the beginning of another book, <em>&#8216;an-Nahj Al-Qubul Min Shara&#8217;i ar-Rusul.’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows the importance of the status of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir, if a great scholar of the likes of Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan summarized his book and reproduced them in his books of Aqidah, it for sure shows his status and calibre.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir was an accomplished poet in Arabic and Farisi. Shaikh Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan summarised Shaikh Muhammad Fakhirs poems in his two books, <em>&#8216;Nafah at-Tayyib&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;ar-Rawdh al-Khasib&#8217;</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Muhammad Fakhir was calling to the the Quran and Sunnah without Taqlid and adhering to the Salafi Manhaj at a time when the people and the scholars of the era were engrossed in Taqlid or the madhahibs. It also shows the status of Imam Muhammad Fakhir as well as his call based on the notable and praiseworthy scholars that were around during his era, it includes the likes of</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is also a well known incident when Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir met Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi. The incident mentions that once when Imam Muhammad Fakhir visited Delhi, while praying he said Amin loudly in the prayer in the Jamia Masjid. This was a disturbing event in Delhi. The general people because angry and began to oppress Imam Muhammad Fakhir to the extent they were on the verge of beating him. Imam Fakhir explained to them that this was established from the Sunnah and if you were to go to any of your major scholars of Hadith they will affirm this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the end they took Imam Muhammad Fakhir to the gathering of Shaikh Shah Waliullah Dehlawi and mentioned the incident to him.  So Shaikh Shah Waliullah told the people that this was also established from the Sunnah and the people were silenced. Thereafter Imam Muhamamd Fakhir said to Shaikh Shah Waliullah what don&#8217;t you tell these people openly what the Sunnah is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To which Shaikh Shah Waliullah replied that if I was to tell these people openly about such issues how would I have saved you today. Meaning that the people were so engrossed and staunch in the Hanafi madhab and fixed in their ways that they failed to accept anything else. (Taqsar al-Junud al-Ahrar (p.115), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.339), Mawj Kawthar (p.63) of Shaikh Muhammad Akram)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>His Death</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1164H Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir prepared for Hajj again but became very ill, he had just reached the town or Burhanpur when he breathed his last and returned to our creator on the 11th Dhul Hijjah 1164H. Shaikh Azad Bilgirami expressed his sorrow and sadness at the demise of Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir. (Ma&#8217;athir al-Kiram (2:218), Sarwar Azad (p.218), Nafah at-Tayyib (p.72), Tarajim Ulama Hadith Hindh (p.336)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This formidable Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith, spent his very short life in spreading Tawhid and the Sunnah, reprimanding grave veneration, grave worship and blind taqlid. Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir spent almost quarter of a decade in calling to adhering to the Quran and Sunnah in an era which was filled with ardent bigoted hanafi muqallids, who were ferociously vicious and violent. The legacy of this Imam of Ahl al-Hadith who was upon the Madhab of the Salaf still remains as radiant and bright as ever around the globe even after 250 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The existence of this impressive Scholar of Ahl al-Hadith, his efforts and struggles are a testimony and a tremendous rebuttal of the modern madhabists who claim the Ahl al-Hadith are a new sect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah have mercy upon Shaikh Muhammad Fakhir and forgive his sins, Amin   </span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[152] </strong></span><span style="color: #000080"><strong>From Malik that Humaid at-Tawil narrated to me from Anas Ibn Malik (Radi Allahu Anhu) that Abu Taiba cupped Allah&#8217;s Messenger </strong></span><span style="color: #000080"><strong>(Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) so he ordered that he be paid one Sa&#8217;a of dates and ordered his masters to reduce his tax (as he was a slave and had to pay a tax to them).</strong></span></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [BUKHARI]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/974, hadith no.1887, book 54, chapter 10, hadith no.26 with the same meaning), at-Tamhid (2/224) and al-Istidhkar (no.1823) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.2102, no.2110) from the hadith of Malik and Muslim (no.1577) from the hadith of  Humaid at-Tawil and he clarified hearing in Muslim (46/1577)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Using devices to take blood out from any part of the body (through the skin) for curing illnesses is called cupping.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) It is allowed to take a fee for cupping. Those ahadith which mention that it is bad or prohibited are understood as being disliked or abrogated. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) The meaning of this is not the conventional haircut by barbers of our time where they cut the hair of the head etc. If the conventional haircut is carried out without going against the Shari&#8217;a then charging money for it is allowed and is Halal. Remember that shaving the beard or cutting it less than one fist full is haram therefore the income that barbers make by charging for this is haram. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) If there is an Islamic country then slavery is allowed. During Jihad, one is allowed to make the Kuffar prisoners slaves and sell them later on.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) It is Sunah to recommend good work. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) Having treatment for illnesses is Sunah. </span></p>
