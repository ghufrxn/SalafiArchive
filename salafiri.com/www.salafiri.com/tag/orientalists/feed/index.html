<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Umar Fullatah may Allah have mercy upon him said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: Eesa (Jesus) the son of Maryam; Allah created him from a mother and he does not have a father. Similarly Allah created Adam without a father or a mother. And likewise Allah created Hawwa (Eve) with a father and no mother. Thus the affair is not strange. Allah said in His glorious Book:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">إِ`</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our father Adam—peace be upon him—Allah created him from soil, from sounding clay like the clay of pottery, from an adhesive soil. After that Allah ordered that a soul be blown into him with the statement, ‘Be’. Thus Adam was.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Where is the mother of Adam? Where is the father of Adam? The father of mankind—Adam—does not have a father or a mother. Thus the All-Knowing, the Most Great, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise, the One who does whatever He wants and chooses, created Adam without a mother or a father. And the affair is not like Darwin (upon him is the curse of Allah) says; the theory of Darwin which states the origin of mankind is from monkeys, and they evolved. The theory of evolution, says that monkeys evolved through stages until it became Adam. And that Adam is not from soil but rather he is an animal who evolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah the Exalted said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">إِ<strong>نَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَى عِنْدَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ آدَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِنْ تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Verily, the likeness of Eesa (Jesus) with Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from soil, the He said to him ‘Be’ and he was. (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:59)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Hawwa (Eve); Allah created her from a rib from Adam. She does not have a mother while she has a father. Thus Allah the Exalted wanted to create Eesa (Jesus) so He created him from a mother, and she is the virgin Maryam, the untouched; may the best prayers and peace be upon her and upon our Prophet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">She is Maryam the daughter of Imraan, the one whom Allah described with His statement:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">ا<strong>لَّتِي أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The one who guarded her chastity (Soorh At Tahrim 66:12)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In this is a testimony from the Creator, the Exalted, that she surely guarded her chastity and she was not a lewd woman, peace be upon her.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Her father was a righteous man, a worshipper. Her mother became pregnant with her, meaning with Maryam, so she dedicated her to the service of Allah. (Her intent was) if Allah blessed her with a son, she would dedicate this son to the Masjid, worship and the obedience of Allah. But Allah decreed the mother of Maryam was to give birth to Maryam; a girl and not a boy who would take care of the affairs of the Masjid and worship Allah in the Masjid.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thus when she gave birth to a girl she wanted an excuse with Allah, she said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">فَلَمَّا وَضَعَتْهَا قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَضَعْتُهَا أُنْثَى وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا وَضَعَتْ وَلَيْسَ الذَّكَرُ كَالْأُنْثَى وَإِنِّي سَمَّيْتُهَا مَرْيَمَ وَإِنِّي أُعِيذُهَا بِكَ وَذُرِّيَّتَهَا مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Then when she delivered her [child Maryam], she said: “O my Lord! I have delivered a female child,” – and Allah knew better what she delivered, – “And the male is not like the female, and I have named her Maryam, and I seek refuge with You (Allah) for her and for her offspring from Satan, the outcast.” (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:36)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Exalted said:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">فَ<strong>تَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ وَأَنْبَتَهَا نَبَاتًا حَسَنًا وَكَفَّلَهَا زَكَرِيَّا كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا الْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِنْدَهَا رِزْقًا قَالَ يَا مَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هَذَا قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So her Lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of Zakariya. Every time Zakariya entered upon her in the prayer chamber, he found with her provision. He said, “O Maryam, from where is this [coming] to you?” She said, “It is from Allah. Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without account.” (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:37)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maryam—while she was still young—was honored by Allah. The provision that Zakariya found with Maryam—and Zakariya was from her closest guardians—he would come and find the fruits which only grow during the summer months with her during the winter months; and he would find with her the fruits which only grow during the winter months with her during the summer months. She was blessed, righteous, pious, throughout her youth and when she reached womanhood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yusuf the carpenter asked for her hand in marriage, and he was from her relatives. He desired to marry her. And she was righteous; dedicated to her prayer area, dedicated to obedience to Allah and worship. The entire community of that time period testified to her righteousness and piety. And for this reason when she became pregnant (they said to her)</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">يَا أُخْتَ هَارُونَ مَا كَانَ أَبُوكِ امْرَأَ سَوْءٍ وَمَا كَانَتْ أُمُّكِ بَغِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">O sister of Harun, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.”       (Soorah Maryam 19:28)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">How did you get pregnant with this boy? Where did you get this boy from?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Verily this boy was a miracle from Allah the Exalted. Allah wanted for her to have this son, so an angel came to her. The angel informed her that Allah had sent him to her.</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">لِأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلَامًا زَكِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(To announce) to you the gift of a righteous son (Soorah Maryam 19:19)</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَتْ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لِي غُلَامٌ وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِي بَشَرٌ وَلَمْ أَكُ بَغِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">She said: “How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?” (Soorah Maryam 19:20)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">How can I have a son, I do not have a husband and I have not been unchaste nor committed fornication? So how can I have a son?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And it is from the way of Allah the Exalted that the child is not born except by two parents, between a husband and a wife, man and a woman. He (the angel) informed her that this is what Allah wanted.</span></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَتْ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَنِ مِنْكَ إِنْ كُنْتَ تَقِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">She said: “Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Beneficent (Allah) from you, if you do fear Allah.” (Soorah Maryam 19:18)</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">قَالَ إِنَّمَا أَنَا رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لِأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلَامًا زَكِيًّا</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(The angel) said: “I am only a Messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son.” (Soorah Maryam 19:19)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allah commanded him (the angel) to blow into the sleeve of her outer garment. Allah the Exalted commanded the angel Jibreel to blow (into the sleeve of her outer garment) the word ‘Be’. Thus Jibreel came with a command from Allah. Thus Jibreel blew the word ‘Be’ that Allah had sent him with (into the sleeve of her outer garment) and thus Maryam became pregnant with Eesa (Jesus) may the best prayers and peace be upon her and our Prophet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And I remind you and I say to you, this affair is not strange. Because Allah created Adam peace be upon him, without a father or a mother, and we are all offspring of Adam, peace be upon him. This because Adam is the father of all mankind, except for those who follow the Darwin theory of evolution, so if they are not the children of Adam then they are the offspring of monkeys. But as for us, then we are the offspring of Adam; the one who Allah created with His Hands. And Allah breathed a soul into him. And Allah caused him to live in paradise, and Allah created from his rib Hawwa (Eve). After He entered them into paradise He forbade them to eat from the tree. When they ate from the tree He expelled them down to the earth. Thus this has been the linage since Allah created Adam and Hawwa up until this day of ours, and until Allah inherits the earth and all those upon it.</span></p>
