				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from ‘Fadail As-Sahabah Sahih Riwayat Ki Roshni Mein’  (p.40-43)<br />
Tahqiq and Takhrij by Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said on the Day of Khaybar, <strong>&#8220;Tomorrow, I will surely give this flag to a man by whose hands Allah will grant victory, he loves Allah and His Messenger, and Allah and His Messenger love him.&#8221;</strong> So [the Companions] stood up, hoping that they would be granted that flag. So the next day came and all of them were hoping that they would be granted [the flag] &#8211; then [the Messenger of Allah ﷺ] said, <strong>&#8220;Where is &#8216;Ali?&#8221;</strong> So it was said to him that he was suffering from pain in his eyes, so he ordered and he (&#8216;Ali) was called for him. Then, [the Messenger of Allah ﷺ] spat in his eyes, and he became cured from his ailment until it was as if he had never been afflicted by anything. &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said, &#8220;<strong>We will fight them until they become like us (i.e., accept Islam).&#8221;</strong> So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ replied, <strong>&#8220;Slowly, until you reach their battlefield, then call them to Islam, and inform them of what is obligatory upon them, for by Allah! That one man is guided is guided through you is better for you than the red camels.&#8221;</strong> (Sahih Al-Bukhari #2942, Sahih Muslim #2406)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Allah (The Most High) granted victory to the Muslims by the hands of Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) during the Battle of Khaybar &#8211; what a lofty status it is for Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali that Allah and His Messenger love him!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Famous Companion of a great rank, the Conquerer of Al-Qadisiyyah<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, Sayyiduna Sa&#8217;d bin Abi Waqas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to &#8216;Ali, <strong>&#8220;You are, to me, in the position Harun was to Musa, except that there is no Prophet after me.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3706, Sahih Muslim #2404)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">From this Hadith, a great position is established for Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), however, one must remember that this has no relation to the Caliphate. Additionally, it is proven from this Hadith that after the Noble Prophet ﷺ until the Day of Ressurection, no Prophet will be born.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated, <strong>&#8220;By The One Who split the seed, and created the breathing, verily the Unlettered Prophet ﷺ gave me a promise that no one will love me except for the believer, and no one will hate me except for the hypocrite.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #78)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It has now become apparent that the Believers love Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali, and those that hate him are Hypocrites &#8211; all of Ahlus Sunnah love Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali and have affection towards him. [However], one must remember that to love him does not mean that a man raises the status of Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali to the likes of &#8216;Mushkil Khusa (The Solver of Difficulties)&#8217; or &#8216;Hajat Rawa (Fulfiller of Needs)&#8217;, or that he starts attacking the rest of the Noble Companions due to his great status, rather Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali has already spoken about these types of people:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>&#8220;Two [types of] men are destroyed [in regards to me]: The one who goes to extremes in exaggeration (in his love), and the one who is hateful in his speech.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Fadha&#8217;il As-Sahabah of Imam Ahmad 2/571 #964 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In another narration, Sayyiduna &#8216;Ali said, <strong>&#8220;Surely a group of people will love me until they enter The Fire due to their love for me, and surely a group of people will hate me until they enter The Fire due to their hatred for me.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Fadha&#8217;il As-Sahabah of Imam Ahmad 2/565 #952 and its chain is Sahih, Kitab As-Sunnah of Ibn Abi &#8216;Asim #983, and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Due to these statements being related to the Knowledge of the Unseen, they take the ruling of raf’ (being attributed directly to the Prophet ﷺ) – i.e., that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ informed ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) about these matters, and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is now known that two groups of people are headed for destruction:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>Those who inadvertently, out of their [extreme] love, take Sayyiduna ‘Ali to be a deity, ‘Mushkil Khusa’, ‘Hajat Rawa’, and other than these, or those that insult others from the Noble Companions, such as the extreme Rawafidh.</li>
<li>Those who insult Sayyiduna ‘Ali, such as the Khawarij and the Nawasib, and other than them.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">Note: The Ahlul-Hadith are completely free from Hakim Faiz Alam Siddiqui (the Nasibi) and other than him that attack the status of Sayyiduna ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), the Ahlul-Hadith have no connection whatsoever to the Nawasib or the Rawafidh. The way of the Ahlul-Hadith is the Kitab (Qur’an) and Sunnah and this is the way of Ahlus-Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Amir Al-Mu’minin (Chief of the Believers) ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said [as part of a lengthier narration], <strong>“I do not find anyone more deserving of this matter (leadership) than this group with whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was pleased with when he passed away.”</strong> He then named ‘Ali, ‘Uthman, Az-Zubayr, Talha, Sa’d and ‘Abdur-Rahman. <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3700)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Sa’d bin Abi Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that when the following Ayah was revealed:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">نَدْعُ أَبْنَاءَنَا وَأَبْنَاءَكُمْ</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“Let us summon our children and your children.”</strong> (Surah Ali &#8216;Imran, 3:61)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>“The Messenger of Allah ﷺ called for ‘Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn, then said, ‘Oh Allah! This is my family.’”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #2404, Darussalam Edn. #6220)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyida ‘A’isha Siddiqa (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ went out one morning whilst wearing a striped cloak made from black [camel] hear, then Hasan bin ‘Ali came and he wrapped him under it, then Al-Husayn came and he wrapped him under it with [Al-Hasan], then Fatima came and he wrapped her under it, then ‘Ali came and he wrapped him under it, then he ﷺ recited:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيُذْهِبَ عَنْكُمُ الرِّجْسَ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ وَيُطَهِّرَكُمْ تَطْهِيرًا‏</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“Allah only wishes to remove Ar-Rijs from you, O Ahlul-Bayt, and to purify you with a thorough purification.”</strong> (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:33)<br />
<em>(Sahih Muslim #2424)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The great virtues of Sayyiduna ‘Ali have been established through these Authentic Ahadith – [It should be noted that] the Mothers of the Believers (the wives of the Prophet ﷺ) also enter into ‘Ahlul-Bayt’, Sayyiduna Zayd bin Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>“His wives are from his Ahlul-Bayt.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #2408, Darussalam Edn. #6225)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Imran bin Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said [as part of a lengthier narration], <strong>“Verily ‘Ali is from me and I am from him, and he is the ally of every believer.”</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3712 and its chain is Hasan)</em>, meaning that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ loved ‘Ali and ‘Ali loved him, and every believer loves ‘Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Zayd bin Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“For whosoever I am his Mawla, ‘Ali is his Mawla.”</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3713 and its chain is Sahih)</em>, in the [Arabic] language, a special friend can also be referred to as a ‘Mawla’ <em>(Al-Qamus Al-Wahid p. 1900) </em>– the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Sayyiduna Zayd bin Harith (may Allah be pleased with him), <strong>“You are our brother and our Mawla.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #2699), </em>and he ﷺ also said regarding Sayyiduna Julaybib (may Allah be pleased with him), <strong>“He is from me and I am from him.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #2472, Darussalam Edn. #6358)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Some of the Rafidha use the Hadith of Wilayat as evidence for the Caliphate of Sayyiduna ‘Ali (i.e., that he had the most right to leadership) and propagate this, however, on account of the previous and upcoming evidences (which will be discussed later on), their argument is invalidated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On one occasion, Sayyiduna ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was in a state of illness when the Noble Prophet ﷺ passed by and supplicated for him, <strong>“Oh Allah! Restore his health”</strong> or<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> <strong>“Oh Allah! Cure him”</strong>, and Sayyiduna ‘Ali said, <strong>“So I did not suffer from my ailment again.”</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3564 and he (Abu ‘Isa At-Tirmidhi) said, ‘This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith.’, and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Famous Tabi’i Abu Ishaq As-Sabi’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said, <strong>“I saw Amir Al-Mu’minin (meaning ‘Ali) on the pulpit, and his head [hair] and beard were white.”</strong> <em>(Kitab Al-Ma’rifah wa’t-Tarikh of Al-Farisi 2/621 and its chain is Sahih, Tarikh Dimashq 45/17, Musannaf ‘Abdur-Razzaq 3/188-189 #5267)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is now known from this narration that to apply hennah or to dye the hair (when it turns white) is not obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>“Show reverence to Muhammad ﷺ by looking after his family.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3713)</em>, meaning whoever has love for Sayyiduna ‘Ali, Hasan, Husayn and the entirety of the Noble Companions will be gathered with the Noble Prophet ﷺ on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Zayd bin Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) said,<strong> “The first to accept Islam was ‘Ali.”</strong> ‘Amr bin Murrah (one of the narrators) mentioned this to Ibrahim An-Nakha’i (a junior Tabi’i), who rejected it and said, <strong>“The first to accept Islam was Abu Bakr As-Siddiq.”</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3735, and he [Abu ‘Isa At-Tirmidhi] said, ‘This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith.’, and its chain is Sahih)</em>, meaning the first to accept Islam from the children was Sayyiduna ‘Ali, and the first to accept Islam from the men was Sayyiduna Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with them both), and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>“The first to accept Islam was ‘Ali, may Allah be pleased with him.”</strong> <em>(Mu’jam As-Sahabah of Al-Baghawi 4/357 #1810 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">‘Urwah bin Az-Zubayr (may Allah have mercy on him) said that ‘Ali accepted Islam at the age of eight. <em>(Mu’jam As-Sahabah of Al-Baghawi 4/357 #1810 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Abdullah bin Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “<strong>We used to say that the most virtuous of the People of Madinah was ‘Ali bin Abi Talib.”</strong> <em>(Fadha’il As-Sahabah of Imam Ahmad 2/602 #1033 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">During the Battle of Khaybar, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib answered the call of Marhab the Jew (i.e., in battle), saying, <strong>“I am the one whose mother named him Haydar (Lion).”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #1807) </em>Thereafter, he killed Marhab and victory at Khaybar was achieved through his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was upon [Mount] Hira’, and so were Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, ‘Ali, Talha and Zubayr – then the mountain moved (i.e., started trembling), so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“Be calm! For there is no one upon you except for a Prophet, or a Siddiq (truthful one) or a Martyr.”</strong> <em>(Sahih Muslim #2417)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>“Whosoever hurts ‘Ali has hurt me.”</strong> <em>(Fadha’il As-Sahabah of Al-Qati’i #1078 and its chain is Hasan, and it has supporting evidence with Ibn Hibban in Al-Mawarid #2202, and Al-Hakim 3/123 who authenticated it, and Adh-Dhahabi agreed with him)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated, <strong>“The people were complaining about ‘Ali, so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up amongst us to deliver a sermon, then I heard him saying, ‘O People! Do not complain about ‘Ali, for by Allah, he is the toughest (i.e., he does not make concessions for anyone) regarding Allah or in the path of Allah (Jihad).”</strong> <em>(Musnad Ahmad 3/86, Mustadarak Al-Hakim 3/134 and he authenticated it, and Adh-Dhahabi agreed, and its chain is Hasan.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna ‘Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>“Verily I hope that I, ‘Uthman, Talha and Zubayr are from those that Allah, Mighty and Majestic, said [regarding]:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِمْ مِنْ غِلٍّ إِخْوَانًا عَلَىٰ سُرُرٍ مُتَقَابِلِينَ</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>‘And We shall remove any bitterness from their hearts, [so they will be like] brothers facing each other on thrones.’ [Al-Hijr, 15:47]”</strong><br />
<em>(Fadha’il As-Sahabah of Imam Ahmad #1057, and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Abu Ishaq As-Sabi’i narrated, <strong>“I saw ‘Ali, so my father said to me, ‘Stand and look at Amir Al-Mu’minin (the Chief of the Believers)!’ So I stood up and I did not see him dye his beard, his beard was large and great.”</strong> <em>(Tabaqat Al-Kubra of Ibn Sa’d 3/25, and its chain is Sahih, Yunus bin Abi Ishaq is innocent from Tadlis)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Imam of Ahlus-Sunnah, Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal (may Allah have mercy on him), said,<strong> “No number of virtues has been narrated for anyone from the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ as has been narrated for ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him.”</strong> <em>(Mustadarak Al-Hakim 3/107,108 #4572 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In summary, Sayyiduna ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was a veteran of Badr, from the Sabiqun Al-Awwalun (the foremost to embrace Islam), Amir Al-Mu’minin (Chief of the Believers), a Rightly-Guided Caliph, his virtues are endless and this short article is incapable of covering all of them, Imam Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Al-Husayn Al-Ajurri (d. 360H, may Allah have mercy on him) said, <strong>“So know, may Allah have mercy upon us and you, that Allah Al-Karim has honoured Amir Al-Mu’minin ‘Ali bin Abi Talib with the most lofty eminence, his precedence’s in goodness are great, his virtues are many, his merit is immense, his importance is revered and his rank is noble. He is the brother of the Messenger ﷺ, the son of his uncle, the husband of Fatimah, the father of Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, the Knight of the Muslims, the one that would remove anguish from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, the killer of the enemies, the just and ascetic Imam in this worldly life longing for the next, the follower of the truth fleeing from falsehood, and the one that possesses every noble character. Allah (Mighty and Majestic) and his Messenger ﷺ both love him, and he loves Allah and the Messenger, he is the one who is not loved except by a pious believer and is not hated except by a miserable hypocrite, [he is] a treasure of intellect, knowledge, gentleness, and manners, may Allah be pleased with him.”</strong> <em>(Kitab Ash-Shari’ah p. 714, 715) </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">O Allah! Fill our hearts with a complete love for Sayyiduna Abu Bakr, Sayyiduna ‘Umar, Sayyiduna ‘Uthman, Sayyiduna ‘Ali, and the rest of the Noble Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all)! Amin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> The Battle of Al-Qadisiyyah occurred in the 14<sup>th</sup> Hijri year, according to the most correct opinion chosen by Ibn Jarir At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him), and it occurred in Al-Qadisiyyah, near ‘Iraq. Sa’d bin Abi Waqas (may Allah be pleased with him) was the Commander of the Muslim Army, and with him were more than 30,000 soldiers. The Commander of the opposing army was Rustam, who had 120,000 soldiers with him, including 33 elephants, and the battle was a victory for the Muslims – see Tarikh At-Tabari 3/479.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Shu’ba, a narrator of this Hadith, doubted which wording was more correct.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from ‘Fadail As-Sahabah Sahih Riwayat Ki Roshni Mein’  (p.40-43)<br />
Tahqiq and Takhrij by Shaykh Zubair &#8216;Aliza&#8217;i</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Our beloved Noble Prophet ﷺ would invoke Allah, saying, <strong>&#8220;Oh Allah! Honour Islam through whichever of these two men is more beloved to you: Through Abu Jahl, or through &#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khattab.&#8221;</strong> Sayyiduna &#8216;Abdullah ibn &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>&#8220;And the most beloved out of the two was &#8216;Umar.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3681 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The results of this Prophetic Invocation was that Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin (Chief of the Believers) &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) accepted Islam &#8211; Sayyiduna &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>&#8220;We have not ceased to have honour since &#8216;Umar accepted Islam.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3684)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">What is famous amongst the common-people is that Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) left desiring to kill the Prophet ﷺ, then someone informed him that his sister had accepted Islam, so he went to her home and severely beat her, and thereafter he became a Muslim &#8211; This narration is found in Tabaqat Ibn Sa&#8217;d (3/287-289), Sunan Ad-Daraqutni (1/123 #435), Dala&#8217;il An-Nabuwwah of Al-Bayhaqi (2/219,220), and is present in various other books, however, this chain of narration is weak. A narrator in this chain, by the name of Qasim bin &#8216;Uthman Al-Basri, is considered weak by the majority of the Muhaddithin (scholars of Hadith). Imam Ad-Daraqutni said regarding this narration, &#8220;It is not strong.&#8221; All the narrations in this matter are weak and rejected &#8211; see Sirah Ibn Hisham (1/367-371) and Sirah An-Nabawiyyah of Adh-Dhahabi (p. 172-181).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It has reached us in some narrations that the Prophet ﷺ was praying in the House of Allah, and the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an had an effect on Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar&#8217;s heart upon hearing it, and due to this he accepted Islam. <em>(Musnad Ahmad #107, this narration is weak due to a disconnection)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily in the Nations that preceded you were Muhaddathun (those that receive intuition and insight from Allah), and if there was anyone from amongst them from my nation, then verily it would be &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3469)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Two matters are proven from this Hadith:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar Al-Faruq (may Allah be pleased with him) is a person of great virtue and status.</li>
<li>Noone from the Muslim Nation receives &#8216;Kashf&#8217; or &#8216;Ilham&#8217;.¹</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify">It has reached us in one narration that the Prophet ﷺ said to Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), <strong>&#8220;Verily the Shaytan fears you, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3690, and he [Abu &#8216;Isa At-Tirmidhi] said: &#8216;This is a Hasan Sahih Gharib Hadith&#8217;, its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In another narration, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Indeed I have seen the Shayatin from amongst men and the jinn, and surely they have run from &#8216;Umar.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3691, and he [Abu &#8216;Isa At-Tirmidhi] said: &#8216;This is a Hasan Sahih Gharib Hadith&#8217;, and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Prophet ﷺ said to &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), <strong>&#8220;O Ibn Al-Khattab! By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, the Shaytan does not meet you travelling on a way except that he takes a way other than yours.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3683, Sahih Muslim #2396, Adhwa&#8217;ul Masabih #6027)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It has reached us in one Hadith that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily Allah has placed the truth upon the tongue and heart of &#8216;Umar!&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Ibn Hibban #2184 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On some occasions, some verses from the Glorious Qur&#8217;an were revealed in agreement with the saying of Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) &#8211; see Sahih Al-Bukhari (#402, #4483) and Sahih Muslim (#3391).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna &#8216;Uqbah bin &#8216;Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;If there were to be a prophet after me, it would have been &#8216;Umar.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3686, and he [Abu &#8216;Isa At-Tirmidhi] said: &#8216;This is a Hasan Gharib Hadith.&#8217;, its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said on one occasion, <strong>&#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw the people being presented to me while they were wearing shirts, so some of their shirts only reached their chests, and some were beneath that, and &#8216;Umar was presented to me and his shirt was dragging.&#8221;</strong> The people asked him, <strong>&#8220;How have you interpreted it, O Messenger of Allah!?&#8221;</strong> He replied, <strong>&#8220;The Religion.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Meaning Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar holds a higher status than all the people, after Sayyiduna Abu Bakr. <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3691, Sahih Muslim #3390)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Noble Prophet ﷺ saw the Palace of &#8216;Umar in Jannah. (Sahih Al-Bukhari #5226, #7024, Sahih Muslim #2394)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar being from the People of Jannah was attested to on the blessed tongue of the Prophet ﷺ. (Tirmidhi #3747, and its chain is Sahih)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The merits and virtues of Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) are many, and to gather them to present them in front of the reader in a small book is a demanding task &#8211; for more detail, I advise one to read &#8216;Fadhail As-Sahabah&#8217; of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, and &#8216;Fadhail &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab&#8217; of Ibn Al-Jawzi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Finally, we will present the final moments of Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin &#8216;Umar Al-Faruq (may Allah be pleased with him):<br />
The Disbelieving Majusi (Fire-Worshipper) Abu Lu&#8217;lua inflicted a fatal wound on Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar by stabbing him, snatching the barrier between Islam and Fitnah (Trials and Tribulations). Milk was given to &#8216;Umar to drink, which came out of his intestines (indicating the severity of the wound); In this state, a young boy arrived and Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar saw that his Izar (lower garment) was below his ankles, so he said, <strong>&#8220;O my nephew! Raise your garment, for verily it is cleaner for your garment and it is more pious for your Rabb!&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3700)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) named one of his children &#8216;Umar. (Taqrib Al-Tadhib #4951)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SubhanAllah! He did not care for his wounds, rather he spent his final moments worrying about raising the status of the Sunnah³ of the Prophet ﷺ. O Allah! Fill our hearts with love for Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar! O Allah! End the misfortune of those people without &#8216;Iman that hate Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin Shahid &#8216;Umar, and fill their hearts with love! As for those that, thereafter, still hate Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar, then torture and humiliate them in this life and the next.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="text-decoration: underline">وَمَا عَلَيۡنَآ إِلَّا ٱلۡبَلَـٰغُ ٱلۡمُبِينُ</span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center">“And our duty is only to convey plainly (the Message).” [36:17]</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> What the author (may Allah preserve him) seems to intend here is the false &#8216;Kashf&#8217; of the Sufis, who believe their saints can see into the hearts of others, or are constantly watching over their students, etc. As for the real Karamat of the Awliya, then this is not being negated, as has reached us in authentic narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:]</strong> Abu Lu&#8217;lua was a Magian slave of Al-Mughira bin. Shu&#8217;bah, after applying poison to a two-headed dagger (the common depiction of the Zulfiqar championed by the Rafidha today has its origins in a Persian Majusi dagger), he stabbed &#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khattab as he was leading the Fajr prayer, and stabbed 13 others whilst trying to escape. Once he realised he had been caught, he killed himself. He is now revered as a saint by some from the Rafidha (may Allah destroy them), and there is even a shrine dedicated to him in Iran. What is apparent is that this man wanted to destroy Islam, hence attacking &#8216;Umar instead of Al-Mughira, who he believed was oppressing him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">³ <strong>[TN:] </strong>Al-Miswar entered upon ʿUmar b. Al-Khaṭṭāb after the morning prayer in the night in which he was stabbed, so he woke ʿUmar up, saying: &#8220;The Prayer, The Prayer.&#8221; So ʿUmar replied, &#8220;Yes, and there is no share in Islām for the one that abandons the prayer.&#8221; <strong>So ʿUmar prayed and blood was pouring out from his wound.</strong> <em>(Al-Muwaṭṭa of Imām Mālik, #91 in the rescension of Abu Musʿab Az-Zuhrī, Shaykh Al-Albani said: &#8216;Sahih upon the conditions of the Shaykhayn&#8217; [Irwa&#8217; Al-Ghalil 1/225], Sahih Isnad according to Shu&#8217;ayb Arna&#8217;ut [Takhrij Sharhus Sunnah 330])</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><em>Taken from ‘Faḍā’il-e-Ṣaḥāba Ṣaḥīḥ Aḥadīth Ki Roshnī Mein’ (p.125-130)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Noble Prophet ﷺ said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“Paradise is obligatory (i.e. guaranteed) for the first army from my Ummah that undertakes Jihād on the Ocean.” </strong><em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 2924)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This Jihād occurred during the time of the Khilāfat of Sayyidunā Muʿāwiya bin Abī Sufyān (<em>Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 6282, 6283)</em>, and Sayyidunā Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān participated in that Jihād <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 2799, 2800).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Sayyidunā ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said: I was playing with the children when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ arrived, I had thought that he arrived for me so I hid behind the door, so he pat me on the back and said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“Go and call Muʿāwiya for me” and he (Muʿāwiya</strong><strong>) used to write the Revelation.</strong> <em>(Dalāi’l An-Nabuwwah of Bayhaqī 2/243, and its chain is ḥasan)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">From this we understand that Sayyidunā Muʿāwiya was a scribe of the Qur’ān, Hafiẓ Ibn ‘Asākir wrote: <strong>“[Muʿāwiya is the] uncle of the believers, and the scribe of the revelation of the Rabb of the Worlds, he accepted Islām on Yawm Al-Fatḥ (the day of conquest).”</strong> <em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/38)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The famous tābi’ī ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Ubaydullāh ibn Abī Mulaykah Al-Makkī narrated that Muʿāwiya prayed one rak’at (cycle) of witr after ‘Ishā, then Ibn ‘Abbās said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“He is correct, verily he is a faqīh.”</strong> <em>(Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī No. 3765)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In opposition to this narration, Ṭaḥawī Al-Ḥanafī, “from Mālik b. Yaḥyā (who Ibn Ḥibbān is alone in declaring trustworthy), from ‘Abdul Wahhāb b. ‘Aṭā who said: from Imran b. Ḥadīr,,,” narrated a rejected narration using this chain <em>(Sharḥ Ma’ānī Al-Āthār 1/289)</em>. This narration is rejected on account of it opposing the narration of Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī, and Ṭaḥawīs claim that Ibn ‘Abbās said “He is correct.” by way of Taqiyyah is incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">The Ṣaḥābī ‘Abdur Raḥmān b. Abī ‘Umayrah narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said for Muʿāwiya: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“Oh Allāh! Make him a guiding one, and guide [others] through him.” </strong><em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhī No. 3842, and he [Imām Abū ʿĪsā At-Tirmidhī] said, “This is a ḥadīth ḥasan gharīb.”, Tārīkh Al-Kabīr of Al-Bukhārī 5/240, Tabaqāt Ibn Sa’d 7/487, Al-Āḥād wal Mathānī of Ibn Abī ‘Āṣim 2/358 No. 1129, Musnad Aḥmad 4/216 No. 17895, and it is a Ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This narration is from Marwān bin Muḥammad and other than him from Sa’īd bin ‘Abdul Azīz, and Marwāns narrations from Sa’īd bin ‘Abdul Azīz are in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim <em>(108/1043, No. 2403 [Darussalam Edition])</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It has been established that Sa’īd bin ‘Abdul Azīz’s narrations were narrated before he lost his memory <em>(As-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 1969)</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>It is narrated from Umm ‘Alqamah (Marjāna) that Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān</strong><strong> arrived in Madīnah and asked ʿĀʾishah</strong><strong> for the cloak and hair of the Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>, then he put the cloak on and dipped the hair into water and drank it and poured it over his body. </strong><em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/106 and its chain is ḥasan, and Marjāna is trustworthy according to Al-‘Ijilī and Ibn Ḥibbān.)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It is narrated from Maswar bin Makhrama that he and one delegation went to Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān and Muʿāwiya fulfilled all his needs, then Muʿāwiya called him saying, “What happened to your criticism of the rulers?”. Maswar said, “Leave this, and have good behaviour as we previously had.” Muʿāwiya said, “No, by Allāh! You have to tell me about yourself and why you are criticising me.” Maswar said that he told him every fault he saw in him. Muʿāwiya said, “No one is free from sin, O Maswar! Do you know how much I have tried to correct the people? One good deed will have the reward of ten, or will you keep counting the sins and forsaking the good actions?” Maswar said, “No, by Allāh! We only mention the sins that we see.” Muʿāwiya said, “We acknowledge every one of our sins in front of Allāh – O Maswar! Do you not have some sins that you fear that if they are not forgiven that you will perish?” Maswar said, “Yes.” Muʿāwiya said, “What has made you deserving of forgiveness that you do not hope for me? By Allāh! I try harder than you to rectify but by Allāh! In two matters, I only prefer one. Between Allah and other than him, I only choose Allah. I am upon this religion in which Allāh accepts righteous actions, He recompenses for good deeds and sins except for those who He chooses to forgive. I hope that for every righteous action I do, Allāh will recompense me many times over. I am facing great matters that neither you nor I can count – I have established the Salah, and Jihād in the way of Allāh, and have established a system that rules by what Allāh has revealed and like this there are other matters that if I told you, you wouldn’t be able to count them – ponder on this.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Maswar said that he understood that Muʿāwiya overcame him in this conversation. <strong>‘Urwah bin Al-Zubayr said, “After this we never heard Maswar censuring Muʿāwiya, he used to pray for his forgiveness.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Baghdād 48/208,209 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Ja’far Aṣ-Ṣādiq, with the following sanad: “Qāsim b. Muḥammad said: Muʿāwiya b. Abī Sufyān said:”, narrated a ḥadīth in which Qāsim bin Muḥammad (bin Abī Bakr) said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“So, the people were amazed at the truthfulness of Muʿāwiya</strong><strong>.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/115 and its chain is ḥasan)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">From this narration we understand that Amīr Muʿāwiya was truthful in the view of the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Sayyidunā ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“I have not seen anyone more befitting, meaning to rule (after the Rightly-Guided Caliphs) than Muʿāwiya.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/121 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Muṣannaf ‘Abdur-Razzāq 11/453 No. 20985)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">‘Irbāḍ bin Sāriyah narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said: </span><span style="color: #000000"><strong>“O Allāh! Teach Muʿāwiya Al-Kitāb and Al-Ḥisāb and save him from the Punishment.” </strong><em>(Musnad Aḥmad 6/127 No. 17152 and its chain is ḥasan, Ṣaḥīḥ ibn Khuzaymah 1938)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Amīr Muʿāwiya</strong> passed away in 60H – one should always stay silent on the battles that occurred between the noble companions due to ijtihad (i.e. they were seeking the truth). Imām of Ahlus-Sunnah Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal said, “Whenever you see a man cursing the companions of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, then doubt his Islām.” <em>(Manāqib Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal of Ibn Al-Jawzī No. 160, and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Tarīkh Dimashq 62/144)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Mu’āfa bin ‘Imrān al-Mauṣilī (d. 185H) was asked about Amīr Muʿāwiya, so he said: <strong>“Nobody can be placed next to the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>, Muʿāwiya was his companion, and he was the brother of Ummul Mu’minīn Umm Ḥabība</strong><strong>, and he was his scribe and the one entrusted [with the writing of] the Revelation of Allāh.” </strong><em>(Tarīkh Baghdād 1/209 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ, Tarīkh Dimashq 62/143)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Imām Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal said, <strong>“Whoever belittles anyone from amongst the Companions of Messenger of Allāh</strong> ﷺ<strong>, then he does not harbour anything except an affliction, and he has a hidden evil towards the best of the People, and they are the Companions of Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>ﷺ</strong><strong>.” </strong><em>(As-Sunnah of Al-Khallāl 2/477 No. 758, and the Muḥaqqiq said: its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibrahīm bin Maysarah Aṭ-Ṭā’ifī narrated that <strong>‘Umar bin ‘Abdul Azīz</strong><strong> never hit anyone except one man that cursed Muʿāwiya</strong><strong>, so he whipped him. </strong>(Tarīkh Dimashq 62/145 and its chain is Ṣaḥīḥ)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">163 aḥadīth are narrated by Amīr Muʿāwiya in Musnad Baqī bin Makhlad <em>(Siyar A’lām An-Nubalā 3/162)</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Those that narrated from him [from the companions] include:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">In the view of Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jama’āh, all the Companions are considered truthful in their narrations (‘Ādil) <em>(Ikthiṣār ‘Ulūm Al-Ḥadīth of Ibn Kathīr 2/498)</em>. Those differences that occurred between them out of ijtihad, and the fighting that happened, they are excused, and we should remain completely silent about them. O Allāh! Fill our hearts with a complete love for the Companions and save us from insulting and degrading them! Āmīn.</span></p>
