				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Brief Biography of Sheikh Abdur Rahman al Ajlaan</strong></p>
<p>This is a summary translation of Shaikh Abdur Rahman al Ajlaan’s biography taken from:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.albaidha.net/vb/showthread.php?t=32050">http://www.albaidha.net/vb/showthread.php?t=32050</a></p>
<p>He was born in Uyoon al-Jawaa’, one of the sub-districts of the district of Qaseem in the year 1357 after the Hijrah</p>
<p>He studied in the beginner schools (kuttaab) in Uyoon al Jawaa’.  In the year 1368 he enrolled in Faisal school in Buraidah, the first school (madrasah) to open in Qaseem.  He graduated from there in 1371.  In 1374 he enrolled in the Institute of Knowledge in Buraidah. In 1379 he enrolled in the College of Sharee’ah in Riyadh.  In 1386 he enrolled in the Higher Judicial Institute when it first opened.</p>
<p><strong>From his work</strong>:</p>
<p>In the year 1372H (when he was 15), he was appointed teacher in Tharmadaa Elementary School which the Crown Prince Sa’ood ibn Abdul Azeez  had commanded to be opened.</p>
<p>He was appointed to teach in the Prophet’s masjid</p>
<p>He was appointed to teach in the College (or Faculty) of Sharee’ah in Riyaad in 1386</p>
<p>In 1387 he was appointed Supervisor of the Institutes of Knowledge</p>
<p>In 1389 he was entrusted before the Chief Justice Shaikh Muhammad ibn Ibraheem Aalush Shaikh with opening the first Saudi courthouse in the Emirates, in the Emirate of al-Fujairah</p>
<p>In 1393 he was entrusted by command of the noble King Faisal – rahimahullah – with opening the courthouse of ‘Ajmaan (in UAE) and was appointed by him as a judge in it until the year 1405 when he requested to be moved to Makkah. So he was appointed a judge in the Higher Court of Makkah. He continued in that along with being entrusted with teaching in the Sacred Masjid until the year 1410 when the order came from the Servant of the two noble Sacred Precincts, King Fahd ibn Abdul Azeez – rahimahullah – appointing him head of the courts in the Qaseem district.  He continued in that until the year 1420 when he sought early retirement (at age 63) so that he could continue teaching in the Sacred Masjid and he is still teaching there.  He also taught in the University Ummul Quraa in the College of Sharee’ah.  He also taught in the higher department at Darul Hadeeth al Khairiyyah in Makkah and he is still doing that.</p>
