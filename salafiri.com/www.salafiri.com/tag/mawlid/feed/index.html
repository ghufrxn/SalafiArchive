				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong> Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Read <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-41-part-a-did-hafiz-ibn-kathir-d-774h-endorse-the-mawlid/">The Mawlid Papers – Part 41</a></span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaykh Isma&#8217;il al-Ansari said in his <span style="color: #000000;"><em>al-Qawal al-Fasl Fee al-Ihtifaal bi Mawlid Khayr al-Rusul</em> (pg. 110+):</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the claim of the author of the letter published in the magazine al-Mujtama (no.559), while listing the authors who considered the celebration of the Mawlid to be permissible and their works (concerning this), that the author of Kashf al-Dhunoon fee Usaamee al-Kutub wa al-Funoon mentioned on page 319 that al-Haafidh ibn Katheer authored a number of treatise concerning the noble Mawlid. From amongst them: Jaami al-Aathaar fee Mawlid al-Nabiyy al-Mukhtaar in three volumes, al-Lafdh al-Raaiq fee Mawlid Khayr al-Khalaaiq and it is succinct. And his claim that ibn Fahd mentioned that ibn Katheer authored a book which he entitled, Mawrid as-Saadee fee Mawlid al-Haadee. And his saying that al-Haafidh as-Sakhaawee had a book concerning the Mawlid entitled, at-Tibr al-Masbook fee Dhail as-Sulook  then all of this is a grievous error having no basis for being correct.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Jaami al-Aathaar fee Mawlid al-Nabiyy al-Mukhtaar then we looked up Kashf al-Dhunoon to ascertain the truth of his words and we found it under the letter jeem (pg.533) and the text is, Jaami al-Aathaar fee Mawlid an-Nabiyy al-Mukhtaar of Shams ad-Deen Muhammad bin Naasir ad-Deen ad-Dimishqee, died in the year 842, being in three volumes commencing with the words, &#8220;all praise is due to Allaah Who displayed Muhammad as the most purest of the Universe&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And we found under the letter laam page 1559 the words, al-Lafdh al-Raaiq fee Mawlid Khayr al-Khalaaiq a short booklet by al-Haafidh Shams ad-Deen Muhammad bin Naasir ad-Deen ad-Damishqee who died in the year 842.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And we found under the letter meem page. 1910 the words, al-Haafidh as-Sakhaawee mentioned in his Daw al-Laami a group who wrote concerning the Mawlid of the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wasallam) from amongst them al-Haafidh ibn Naasir ad-Deen ad-Damishqee who authored in this regards Jaami al-Aathaar fee Mawlid an-Nabiyy al-Mukhtaar in three volumes and a booklet al-Lafdh al-Raaiq fee Mawlid Khayr al-Khalaaiq and it is shorter than the one mentioned before it</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Mawrid as-Saadee fee Mawlid al-Haadee then the claim of the author of that article that ibn Fahd attributed it to ibn Katheer is without basis for ibn Fahd said in Lahdh al-Alhaadh bi Dhail Tabaqaat al-Huffaadh (pg. 320-321) under the biography of ibn Naasir ad-Deen ad-Damishqee, he authored, and some of them concerned the Mawlid of the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wasallam) and it is Jaami al-Aathaar fee Mawlid al-Mukhtaar in three volumes, and Tawdeeh al-Mushtabah and Mawrid as-Saadee fee Mawlid al-Haadee..</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And this which is mentioned by ibn Fahd is declared with certainty by as-Sakhaawee and ash-Shawkaanee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So it becomes clear with all of this that the claims of the author of that article published in al-Mujtama magazine has no basis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then what ibn Katheer mentions in the section on the Prophetic biography in his Bidaayah wan Nihaayah, and in his lengthy Seerah and in the sections of Ikhtisaar Seerah ar-Rasool, and in his stand alone treatise on the Mawlid published with the tahqeeq of Salaah ad-Deen al-Manjad, and in his revision to the Mawlid of his shaykh Kamaal ad-Deen Abee Maaalee Muhammad bin Alee al-Ansaaree contained in the section detailing Dalaail an-Nubuwwah in his Bidaayah wan Nihaayah  he does not present anything in these concerning the celebration of the Mawlid of the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wasallam) and neither of the evil practices that have occurred amongst the later generations with respect to the Mawlid. Therefore as long as the matter is like this then we cannot accept the claim of the author of that article.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[Note: and what Muhammad bin Alawee al-Maalikee vainly thinks in his work al-Ihtifaal bi Mawlid an-Nabawiyy ash-Shareef (pg. 38) that the Mawlid of al-Haafidh ibn Katheer is from those works that present celebrating the Mawlid of the Prophet is not correct.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the saying of the author of that aricle that as-Sakhaawee authored a book about the Mawlid entitled at-Tibr al-Masbook fee Dhail al-Sulook then this is also incorrect as-Sakhaawee said in his autobiography contained in Daw al-Laami li Ayaan al-Qarn at-Taasi (8/17) while listing his works, and at-Tibr al-Masbook fee Dhail alaa Taareekh al-Maqreezee as-Sulook containing the events and deaths (of scholars) since the year 45 to this day in 4 volumes so this is what as-Sakhaawee himself clarifies and it is clear that the subject matter of the book is not the Mawlid even though it may contain things connected to the Mawlid. (Translated by Abu Rumaysah and taken from various sites) End of the words from al-Qawl al-Fasl.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This can also be seen in the same book <em>al-Qawl al-Fasl Fi Hukm al-Ihtifal bi Mawlid Khayr al-Rusul </em>as part of the <em>Rasa&#8217;il Fi Hukm al-Ihtifal Bil-Mawlid</em>, 2:526-530.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author being referred to here &#8220;As for the claim of the author of the letter published in the magazine al-Mujtama (no.559)&#8221; is the famous sufi propagator of Kuwait, Yusuf Hashim al-Rifa&#8217;i, so Shaykh Isma&#8217;il here refuted him and his views, as for the former, he was vociferous in support of the innovated Mawlid celebrations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhsin b. Awad al-Qalisi said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1] Hafiz Ibn Kathir was from the Imams of Ahl al-Sunnah Wa&#8217;l Jama&#8217;ah and rather he was a pioneer of the Salafi Manhaj and the tafsir of the Quran. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2] He did not mention or expound the issue of celebrating the Prophets birthday except that he mentions concerning Muzaffar, the ruler of Irbil that he would celebrate the Mawlid in Rabi ul-Awwal and he would celebrate it extravagantly but he (Ibn Kathir) does not whatsoever in any form or shape endorse the Mawlid and say it is permissible. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And, so ever attributes to Ibn Kathir that he endorsed celebrating the Mawlid, they have to bring evidence and proof, but rather they have no proof or evidences (to support this allegation on Ibn Kathir) and have rather slandered him and created aspersions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Kathir, from his al-Bidayah Wa&#8217;l Nihayah has merely collated history, events, incidences and biographical accounts from the beginning of time  to his era and he does so based on each year. So he mentions what happened, whether good or bad. In this regard he mentioned the biographical note on Malik Muzaffar and what he used to do in the month of Rabi al-Awwal pertaining to celebrating the Mawlid al-Nabi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, whoever reads the books of history and biographies, they will even find entries of the leaders of Ahl al-Bid&#8217;ah like for example the Khawarij, the Rawafidh wherein he talks about them. So when he talks about the long standing and excessive worship of the Khawarij, does that also mean that, he Ibn Kathir endorses and supports the belief and creedal system of the Khawarij and Rawafidh? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is necessary to make a distinction between a general biographical note and entry, criticism and endorsement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3] Also when Hafiz Ibn Kathir mentioned the mawlid celebrations and the participation of Malik Muzaffar, he mentions the Sufis would sing from Zuhr until Fajr and Muzaffar would dance with them. He Ibn Kathir said:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;And during the mawlid notable scholars and sufis would attend his gatherings, he would intermingle and actively participate with them, meaning the Sufis, who sing (songs) from Zuhr until Fajr and he would dance with them.&#8221; (<em>al-Bidayah Wa&#8217;l Nihayah</em>, 17:205)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This statement (of Ibn Kathir) is sufficient to rebuke whoever alleged and claimed Hafiz Ibn Kathir endorsed and acknowledged his new innovation (of milad) the way of the Sufis, their singing and dancing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Hamud al-Tuwayjari said:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;As for the allegation of the unknown writer that Ibn Kathir expressed an explicit opinion about celebrating the Mawlid al-Nabi, then this is from his delusion about what he claims and said about Ibn Kathir.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And whoever alleges Ibn Kathir authored several books (endorsing) the Mawlid al-Nabi, then this allegation and statement is simply not true. He did write a brief treatise on the Birth mentioning the reports concerning this. however, he does not endorse or support the ruling of celebrating the Mawlid (of the Nabi) in this brief treatise or in al-Bidayah wall Nihayah.&#8221; (<em>al-Radd al-Quwi, a part of Rasa&#8217;il Fi Hukm al-Ihtifal Bil-Mawlid</em>, 1:274-275)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4] Even if for arguments sake we accept that Hafiz Ibn Kathir did endorse celebrating the Prophets birthday, then his statement is not hujjah and we say this a thousand times. This is because hujjah is only the Quran and Sunnah. any statement that confirms to this is acceptable and anything that opposes this is rejected. We also find that the Quran and Hadith warn and rebuke innovations and newly invented matters. This is a principle of the Shari&#8217;ah which conforms to the Islamic Shari&#8217;ah. As for the Shari&#8217;ah of the people desires, it is based on following desires and it built upon deception, trickery, ignorance, lying and visual dreams. (<em>Fath al-A&#8217;ziz al-Qawi Bi-Kashf Shubuhat al-Muhtafilin Bil-Mawlid al-Nabawi</em>, 681-684)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Read <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-40-milad-gatherings-reciting-fatihah-and-the-omnipresence-of-the-messenger-of-allah-ﷺ-shaykh-nawab-muhammad-siddiq-hasan-khan-d-1370h-shaykh-a/">The Mawlid Papers &#8211; Part 40</a></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Barelwi Sufi say Hafiz Ibn Kathir was pro mawlid and thus authored a book endorsing and promoting it. In fact, a UK publisher has even published the English translation of the book and before this, it was also translated and published in India.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The book is very small and does not exceed many pages. The english translations also don&#8217;t exceed 10-15 pages. I think it is pertinent to actually have a look at the book the Sufis are raving about, whether there is actually any truth to this bold claim, that Hafiz Ibn Kathir endorsed and promoted the mawlid, due to this book.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Looking at The Book of Hafiz Ibn Kathir </strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This book was given the title of <em>Mawlid RasulAllah</em> by later people, by the researcher who first sourced and published it in either 1961 or 1969 from a manuscript based in Princeton University (USA). The actual alleged manuscript was only 10 pages in this manuscript collection. We also learn that this manuscript was first written in 786H (coincidently!!!) some 12 years after the death of Hafiz Ibn Kathir, who died in 774H, this certainly raises some serious doubts at the first instance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, no biographer or researcher prior to this ever mentioned this book or even attributed such a title to Hafiz Ibn Kathir, let alone quoting from it. So when we have learnt that Hafiz Ibn Kathir did not give this book the current title it is published under, but rather the title was given by other people in the 20th century coupled with the other facts, we can take an intelligent guess based on such evidences that this was perhaps not the work of Hafiz Ibn Kathir. </span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Contents of the Book</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For arguments sake let us for an instance assume that Hafiz Ibn Kathir did author this book. However, when we look at the content, it is essentially geared towards a historical overview and can be classed as a summarised treatise on Sirah. On closer examination we further find that the contents correlate and have been taken from his <em>al-Bidayah wa&#8217;l Nihayah</em> and his glorious biography of the Messenger of Allah Sallahu Alayhi Wasallam. He says in the beginning of the book:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;This book is a brief collection of hadith and athar describing the birth (mawlid) of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi Wasallam that are narrated and accepted by the thorough memorisers and experts of hadith and Imams of Isnad criticism.&#8221;</em> (Ibn Kathir, <em>Mawlid RasulAllah</em>, 13, Eng. trans., 20, Turath Publishing; another edn. 10, Dar ul Islam Foundation)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The whole book is literally a succinct biographical account of the early life of the Messenger of Allah Sallalhu Alayhi Wasallam and has no mention of the modern day practices and customs which the Sufi Barelwi&#8217;s organise and celebrate. Therefore, this book cant be used as evidence and nor can it be said with any conviction or designation that Hafiz Ibn Kathir endorsed the innovated mawlid practices that were initiated and introduced by the Fatimids.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is even worse, although perhaps rightly so linguistically, the title of the book was chosen by later individuals, such as <em>Mawlid RasulAllah</em>, one cannot but think considerable thought was expended to title the book as such in order to portray a particular theological understanding.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If an intelligent reader was to read this book, whether he was pro mawlid or against it, he would naturally conclude the contents of the book are anything but endorsing and promoting the mawlid as we know it today. In addition to this, nothing in this book is any different to what Hafiz Ibn Kathir wrote and compiled in his <em>al-Bidayah wa&#8217;l Nihayah</em> and <em>al-Sira<span style="color: #000000;">h al-Nabawiyyah, </span></em>when this is the case where does the concept of the innovated Mawlid come from then, far from the claim that Hafiz Ibn Kathir endorsed the mawlid.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Purpose of these &#8220;Mawlid&#8221; Texts</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many mawlid texts were written after the innovation of the Fatimids Shi&#8217;as, Abu Sa‘id Muzaffar Kaukaburi, Ibn Dahiyyah and others and all subsequent texts around that period were filled with all kind of fabled stories, fabrications and exaggerations, all by storytellers (Qussas) This was the impetus that led other scholars of Damascus to compile authentic texts and base the works on traditions. Around a dozen texts were authored around Hafiz Ibn Kathir&#8217;s time. For example, the Damascene scholar al-Zamlakani (d.727H) authored a text and based it on traditions and reports that were factual rather than stories and exaggerative interpretations, al-Jazari and others followed.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Problems With Mawlid Texts</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example Hafiz Ibn al-Hajj (d.736H) said that women would organise gatherings and one of them would exaggerate while telling stories about the Prophets, she would add things and omit things based on her personal preference and at times she would fall into open clear kufr and she would not even be aware of it (based on what she would say) and there would be no one to correct her. They would also not have the islamic ability to distinguish between what was authentic or fabricated, and this would lead them to further problems. (<em>al-Madkhal</em>, 2:14-15).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Hajj further evidences this with an example, that a female scholar presented a mawlid recitation with grave discrepancies and stories and realities which were false and fabricated, this was all done in front of a Shaykh Min us-Shuyukh who was well respected in that era, and instead of reprimanding her, he honoured her with gifts! (<em>al-Madhkhal</em>, 2:14).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Haythami (d.973H) said the people would get a professional reader i.e. an admonisher (al-Wu&#8217;az) they would read some of these mawlid texts which would be filled with lies, fabrications and innovations and thus everything was extremely wrong and they would then continue and formulate and fabricate things which were worse than before. (Ibn Hajr al-Haythami, <em>Itmam al-Ni&#8217;mah al-Kubra Ala al-A&#8217;lam bi-Mawlid Sayyid Wuld Adam</em>, 28).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Hajr al-Haythami went a step further and advocated the need to reprimand or to correct. He argued that under such gatherings and circumstances it was mandatory on scholars and learned people to correct and reprimand such storytellers or just leave such gatherings where they would utter such fabrications and lies. (<em>Itmam al-Ni&#8217;mah al-Kubra Ala al-A&#8217;lam bi-Mawlid Sayyid Wuld Adam</em>, 28)</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Financial Gain</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sometimes these elaborate mawlid recitations that were filled with fallacies and fabrications were often recited in government courts. Such recitations often were gifted with wealth from the government and in doing so it became a popular in culture and practise. These mawlid recitations were filled with exaggeration, they were ostentatious and extravagant, which most certainly caught the eye of officials.  However, in order to achieve this the recitations had to be more elaborate, unique and grand than the others and in this way all normal traditional reports and narrations were neglected and considerable wealth was acquired. Such practices in turn increased with time, with more and more people fabricating their mawlid recitations. (al-Kazaruni, <em>al-Muntaqa Fi Siyar al-Nabi al-Mustafa</em>, 2:10)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was under such circumstances that many books on the mawlid were authored from the traditional approach, being heavily based on reports and narrations to counteract the innovative and exaggerative approach of the mawlid sympathisers and other opportunists.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This sheds some light on mawlid popularity in the 7th and 8th century and how some scholars attempted to tackle the spiralling deviation of the mawlid reciters. They also attempted to rectify the problems because of the huge and colossal number of fabricated narrations such people were forging. This was the backdrop and reality of such mawlid books, it was not how the Sufi Barelwis celebrate the mawlid in our time, with every act that they do, it contravenes the Sunnah. Therefore, it is foolish and desperate for them to use such books to support their innovative claims to celebrate the mawlid, even if such books were authentic.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">READ PART 38</span> &#8211; </span><a href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-38-mawlid-beginnings-historical-origins-rafidhi-fatimids/"><span style="color: #008000;">Mawlid Beginnings &amp; Historical Origins – Rafidhi Fatimids</span></a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Th historians differ greatly as to when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born ie the exact date however most of them opine it was the 9th of Rabī Al-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Sa‘īd Muzaffar Kaukabūrī was himself unsure of the exact date of the Mawlid due to the difference of opinion, he Kawkaburi, who was considered the chief Mawlid innovator, would celebrate the Mawlid on the 8th of Rabi ul-Awwal in one year and on the 12th the following year. (al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah 1:552)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Dahiyyah, the one who wrote one of the earliest books promoting the Mawlid, was of the opinion the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 8th of Rabi ul-Awwal and he refutes the notion of it being the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal (<em>al-Tanwir Fi Mawlid al-Bashir wal-Nazir from al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah</em> 2:260)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Dahiyyah also mention the 17th of Rabi ul-Awwal as another potential birth date (<em>al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah</em> 2:260)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is strange how the Barelwis use Imam Ibn Kathirs al-Bidayah to support their views in other things but in such instances they turn a blind eye to such remarks and research. The likes of Saqid Shami are happy to use Ibn Kathir on Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and his alleged book on the Mawlid, so we are we using here too?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The founder of Baraliwism Ahmad Raza Khān said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 12th of Rabī Al-Awwal and he died on the same day.&#8221;</em> (Malfūzāt 2:220)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Qādir Jilānī said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Prophet ﷺ was born on the 10th of Muharram.&#8221;</em> (<em>Ghuniyyah al-Tālibīn</em> 2:392).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan said about Shaikh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The illustrious son and descendant of the Glorious Prophet ﷺ and the true representative and inheritor of Prophetic Bounties, the great Ghawth Shaykh Sayyid ‘Abd al-Qadir Jilani (d 561/1164) states: ‘I see all the cities of Allah as I see a mustard seed in the centre of my palm.’ The Grand Ghawth also states: ‘The pupil of my eye is set on the Luhe-Mahfuz.&#8221;</em> (Malfuzat 1:35-36, Barelwi translation)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is deception at its highest level, on one hand they have this belief about Abdul Qadir al-Jilnai while at the same time reject his view regarding the birth date and hence the Mawlid. The conclusion, Ahmad Raza was categorically lying when he made this statement about Shaykh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another Barelwi writer, Muhammad Umim Ehsan al-Mujaddadi al-Barkati said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on a Monday in the year of the Elephant, either on the 8th, 9th or the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Awjaz al-Siyar Mulhiq Bi-Mishkat al-Masabih</em> 1:586)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdul Haq Dehlawi also mentions the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal being the birth date of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ (<em>Ma Thabt Bil-Sunnah</em> p.288, <em>Madarij al-Nabuwwah</em> 2:23)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qādi Muhammad Suleimān Mansūrpūrī said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Prophet ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī Al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant, corresponding to 22nd April 571ce, corresponding to the 1st Jith 628 Bikrami in Makkah in the early morning before sunrise. &#8220;</em> (<em>Rehmah Al-Alamīn</em> p.40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The historians have differed with regards to the birth date, Tabari and Ibn Khaldun said the 12th, Abu Fida said the 10th. However all are agreed the Monday (of the birth) on that year corresponds to the 9th and this is why the 9th of Rabi ul-Awwal seems to be most accurate date of birth.&#8221;</em> (<em>Rehmah Al-Alamīn</em> p.40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Suleimān Nadwī said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;As regards to the birth of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ Egypt&#8217;s Mahmūd Pashā the astronomer authored a treatise in which he proved mathematically that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 9th Rabī Al-Awwal corresponding to 20th April 571ce.&#8221;</em> (<em style="color: #000000;">Sirah al-Nabī</em> 1:171)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Indian historian Akbar Shah Najibabadi said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant corresponding to the 40th gathering of Kisrah Naushirwan corresponding to the 22th April 571ce in the morning before sunrise.&#8221;</em> <em style="color: #000000;">(Tārīkh Al-Islām</em> 1:76)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The leader of the Sufi&#8217;s, Yusuf bin Ismail Nabahani said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;And what is famous and well known and what the majority (of the scholars) are agreed upon is that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Hujjatullah Alal A&#8217;lamin</em> p.231)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Deobandi church father, Ashraf Ali Thanwi has also mentioned a difference of opinion with regards to the exact birth date. (<em>Nashr al-Tayyib</em> p.28)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of the well known scholars were of the view that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal. Imam Nawawi mentioned,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away on the Monday morning on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal after the 12th year after the Hijra.&#8221;</em> (<em>Taqrib Ala Ibn Salah</em> 2:251)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti, who is revered by the proponents of the Mawlid because of his generic reverence of the birth of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, said in explanation of the words of Imam Nawawi,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The majority (of the scholars) are upon what the author (i.e. Imam Nawawi) mentioned, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tadrib al-Rawi Sharh Tarib al-Nawaw</em>i 2:51)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Tal&#8217;at, the author of <em>Tarikh Dawal al-Arab wal-Islam</em> was also of the view the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabi ul-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdur Rahman Mubrakpuri in his <em>Tuhfa</em> brings the statement of Hafiz Ibn al-Jawzi from his <em>al-Tanqih</em> in which he says,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;They are agreed the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the Monday in the year of the elephant in the month of Rabi ul-Awwal, however, they differ with regards to the exact date of the month and there are four views, (1) 2nd Rabi ul-Awwal, (2) 8th Rabi ul-Awwal, (3) 10th Rabi ul-Awwal and the (4) 12th Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tuhfa al-Ahwadhi Sharh Tirmidhi</em> 4:295)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shia rafidah fatimid rulers were instrumental in formulating and pushing the Mawlid and the Milād amongst the people and they are the ones who made it famous. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ahmad bin Alī bin Ahmad al-Fazārī al-Qalqashandī  [821H] said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Fatimid Khaliph would organise their third gathering on the 12th of Rabī al-Awwal and celebrate the Mawlid. Their habit pertaining to the gathering was to cook various sweet dishes at Dār Al-Fitrah with a lot of sugar which they would distribute in 300 silver dishes. During the Mawlid night the sweet dishes would be distributed between the numerous dignitaries like the judges, religious callers, the various reciters and admonishers as well as the presidents of the various universities and the sūfī patrons of the tombs and shrines..&#8221;</em> [Subh al-&#8216;Asha Fī Sana&#8217;a al-Insha [3:576]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bukhīt al-Mutī‘ī Al-Hanafī the Qadī of Alexandria (Egypt) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Fatimids khaliphs were the first ones to innovate the Mawlid in Cairo and first from amongst them was Mu&#8217;az Al-DīnAllāh. He travelled from Maghrib to Egypt in shawwal in the year 361H. He then travelled to Alexandria in Sha&#8217;bān 362H and then entered Cairo in the same year on the 7th of Ramadhan. These people innovated 6 Mawālīd, the Mawlid of the prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, the Milād of Alī, the Milād of Fatimah, the Milād of Hasan, the Milād of Hussain and the Milād of the current ruler. These mawlids continued with the custom and practices until Afzal bin Amir Al-Juyūsh came and abolished them. His father Amir Al-Juyush went to egypt fromSham upon the invitation of the Khaliph Mustansarbillah wherein he entered Egypt on the eve of the 2nd of Jumada al-Ula in the year 465H. When he went on the war expedition to Sham he placed his son Afzal his representative. When Amir Al-Juyush died in Rabī Al-Thani or Jumada Al-Ula in the year 487H his son Afzal took control of the army. When Muntasarbillah died on the 17th of Dhul Hijjah 495H, his reign of Khilafah was 7 years and 2 months. Afzal then put forward muntasarbillahs son as the new Khaliph whose name was mustalabillah. Then mustalabillah died on the 17th of Safar 496H and Afzal then made his son, Al-Amr bi Ahkamallah the Khaliph. Then on the eve of Eid Al-Fitr in the year 515H Afzal was murdered and the same happened to Al-Amr bi Ahkamallah in the year 524H. The 6 Milād were restarted during his reign whereas Afzal had abolished them and the people had eventually forgotten them.&#8221;</em> [Ahsan Al-Kalām Fimā Yata‘laq Bil-Sunnah Wa&#8217;l Bid‘ah Minal Ahkām [pp.59-61]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same has been reported by other authors in their various books from them include</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Alī Mahfùz in <em>Al-Ibda‘a Fī Madhār Al-Ibtidā‘a [pp.136]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sayyid Alī Fikrī in <em>al-Mukhadharāt Al-Fikriyyah [pp.84]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Alī Nāsir Al-Faqihi in <em>al-Bid‘ah Dhawabituha Wa Athārahā as-Sayy&#8217;ia Fil Ummah [pp.16,21]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ismā‘īl bin Muhammad Ansārī in <em>Al-Qaul Al-Fasl Fī Hukm Al-Ehtifāl bi Mawlid Al-Rūsul [pp.64-72]</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As we have already mentioned the Mawlid was innovated by the Fatimid Shī‘as. The reign of the Fatimids started in approximately 362H until 567H. They are the ones who first innovated the Mawlid and they also innovated mawlids for Ahlul Bayt, again this is another clear cut evidence that the concept of Mawlid was not practised or even heard of during the first three generations. What is also apparent is that the current days Muslims the Sūfīs and Barailwis have rejected the other 5 Mawlids and just adopted one. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The people of deviation may say how could Muzaffar al-Dīn Al-Kaukabūrī innovated the Mawlid when the Fatimid Shias did. Well we say that when the ruler Al-Afzal bin Amīr Al-Juyūsh prohibited and banned the Mawlid and its associated practices innovated by the Fatimids, Muzaffar al-Din restarted it and gave it a new shape and direction. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu Muhammad Abdul Rahman bin Ismail Abī Shāmah [665H] said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The first person to do this (ie the Mawlid or Milād) in Mosul was Shaikh Umar bin Muhammad al-Mulla who was a well known Sūfī and then the ruler or Irbil followed him.&#8221;</em> [al-Bā&#8217;ith Ala Inkār Al-Bid‘ah wa&#8217;l Hawādith [pp.24]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bukhīt al-Mutī‘ī Al-Hanafī said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I say Malik Muzaffar Al-Dīn the ruler of Irbil, he is the one who Suyūti spoke about when he said he was the first one to innovated the Mawlid. His name was Abu Sa‘īd Kaukabūrī bin Abul Hasan Alī bin Baktakīn bin Mu‘ammar, his title was Mulk Al-A&#8217;zam Muzaffar Al-Dīn of Irbil. After his fathers death on the 10th of Dhul Qa&#8217;dah 563H he became the king at the age of 14. He is the one who innovated the Milād in the city of Irbil.</em> [Ahsan Al-Kalām Fimā Yata‘laq Bil-Sunnah Wa&#8217;l Bid‘ah Minal Ahkām [pp.66]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Muhammad al-Abdarī famously known as Ibn Al-Haj said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;And from everything that is new from the affair of innovations with the associated belief that they are from the superior aspects of worship and the manifestation they are the well known signs of Islam, one such issue is the Mawlid in the month of Rabī Al-Awwal which includes innovations and unlawful things.&#8221;</em> [al-Mudkhal [2:229]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;These people only want to gather at the corrupt Mawlid when there is music is sama, if it is without music and just the Mawlid and they invite the brothers for food, likewise it is free from any corrupt practices, of which some have been mentioned before and of the sole intention is for Milād then this is an innovation and a new act in the Dīn which was not a practise of the Salaf of the past because traversing the path of the Salaf is superior and better.&#8221;</em> [al-Mudkhal [2:234]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Taj Al-Dīn Umar bin Ali Al-Fākihānī was asked concerning the Mawlid who which he replied, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I do not know the basis or the origins of this Mawlid in the Kitab or Sunnah, neither is it mentioned that a single scholar from the Ummah acted upon it and they were from amongst those who were exemplary in the Dīn and held firmly onto the reports of the earlier scholars, rather this Mawlid is an innovation which was introduced by the people of falsehood, of desires, whims and to seek personal gains. &#8220;</em> [al-Hawi Lil Fatāwa [1:190-191]</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bukhīt al-Mutī‘ī Al-Hanafī the Qadī of Alexandria (Egypt) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When Umar bin Al-Hasan famously known as Abū Khattāb bin Dahiyyah whilst on his travels to Khurasān in 604H visited Irbil he saw the the kind Malik Mu&#8217;azam Muzaffar Al-Dīn bin Zain Al-Dīn was liked the Mawlid Al-Nabi. So with the intention of pleasing the king he authored a book called &#8216;al-Tanwīr Fī Mawlid Al-Sirāj Al-Munīr&#8217; which he read to the King himself. When he authored the book, Malik Mu&#8217;azam gave him 1000 Dinars.&#8221;</em> [Ahsan Al-Kalām Fimā Yata‘laq Bil-Sunnah Wa&#8217;l Bid‘ah Minal Ahkām [pp.70]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Sufi authored a book whilst hiding the truth and cloaking it with futile interpretations in establishing and the virtue of the Mawlid. He called it <em>&#8220;Al-Tanwīr Fi Mawlid Al-Bashir an-Nazir&#8221;</em> and eventually received 1000 dinars. Refer to Al-Bidāyah wan Nihāyah (13:124), Al-Hawī lil-Fatâwa (1:189), Wafyat al-A&#8217;yān (4:119). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The sufi&#8217;s full name was Umar bin Al-Hasan Abu Khatāb Dahiyyah Andalusī. As for his affair Imām Dhahabī said about him, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He is accused of lying even in the things he copies.&#8221; </em>(Mīzān (3:186)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Dhiya al-Maqdisi said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I did not like his affair in that he would tarnish the Imāms and then Ibrahim Sanhawari  informed that the scholars of Maghrib wrote concerning him in that they criticised and weakened him.&#8221;</em> [Mizān [3:186] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Najjār said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I saw that the people were united and agreed on him being a liar and weak, likewise and similarly his claim t<span style="color: #000000;">he people he heard from when he never heard from them and those who he claimed to have met when he never met them.&#8221;</span></em> [Liīsān Al-Mizān [4:295]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was of the Zahiri madhab who would tarnish and degrade the honour of Imāms and Scholars of the Salaf, he had a vile tongue, he was a fool with utmost arrogance and very little insight in the affairs of the Dīn and very lazy.&#8221;</em> [Līsān Al-Mizān [4:296]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some researchers have speculated his attribution to the Zahiri Madhab was due to his Andalusian roots, where the Zahiri Madhab featured prominently. They also said the Maliki&#8217;s at the time conformed to their roots and adhered to the thoughts of the school in Fiqh and otherwise. Likewise the concept of any offshoot from the norm in those days would be attributed to the Zahiri Madhab due to its approach of independent reasoning. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This does not however mean he was a propagator of the madhab. This is often the case, you will find ardent Sufi&#8217;s claiming to be Zahiri&#8217;s or an an attribution to the Zahiri Madhab because of their need to be free and independent of the legislated rulings, however this is a direct contradiction of the Zahiri Madhab, which is strict adherence and rigorously conform to the Divine Texts. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Suyūti said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Besides his knowledge and memory he was ver</span>y immature in citing texts. He would make bold audacious claims and would say &#8216;he narrated to us&#8217; in his ijazahs.&#8221;</em> [Tabaqāt al-Huffāz [pp.498]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Taqī al-Dīn Ahmad bin Alī al-Maqrizī [845H] said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Fatimid Khaliphs would celebrate a number of Eīds and other special days in a year. They would celebrate at the end of the year, at the beginning of the year, the day of Ashurah, the Milād (birthday) of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, the Milād of Alī bin Abī Tālib, the Mawlid of Hasan, the Mawlid of Hussain, the Mawlid of Fatimah and the Mawlid of the current ruler, the first night of Rajab, the night of the Middle of Rajab, the first night of Sha&#8217;bān, the night of the Middle of Sha&#8217;bān&#8230;&#8221;</em> [al-Muwā&#8217;iz wa&#8217;l Ei‘tibār Bi Zikr al-Khitat wa&#8217;l Athār [2:436]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Processions and other acts during the six Milād son different days. They were the Milād of the Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, Amīr al-Mu&#8217;minīn Alī bin Abi Tālib, the Mawlid of Fatimah Alayhis Salām, the Mawlid of Al-Hasan, the Mawlid of Al-Hussain Alayhuma Asalām  and the Mawlid of the current Khaliph.&#8221;</em> [al-Muwā&#8217;iz wa&#8217;l Ei‘tibār Bi Zikr al-Khitat wa&#8217;l Athār [2:333]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When the 12th of Rabī Al-Awwal would come they would prepare sweet dishes from 20 plates of sugar which would then be put on 300 silver plates and this would be the day of the Mawlid.&#8221;</em> [al-Muwā&#8217;iz wa&#8217;l Ei‘tibār Bi Zikr al-Khitat wa&#8217;l Athār [2:334]</span></p>
