<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> To proceed,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this part of lifting the blame from the Imams series, we look at the well known statement, which many people often quote when the name of Imam Ibn Hazm (d.456H) is mentioned.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> They always usually mention; al-Hajjaj’s sword and (Imam) Ibn Hazm’s tongue are brothers i.e. meaning that they are the same in their evil and severity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Throughout history this statement was modified and presented in different ways, which often led Muslims to believe different people had this view about Ibn Hazm, whereas in reality they all relied on the statement of the individual who first coined it. The statement got translated and interpreted by various historiographers and biographers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Who Initially Coined this Phrase? Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Going back through history and the books on biography, we find the first person to mention this statement about Imam Ibn Hazm was Ibn al-Arif. Ibn al-Arif was Abu’l Abbas Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Musa b. AtaAllah al-Sunhaji al-Marri, commonly known as Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif. He was a native of Spain, Almeria and thus of al-Andalus.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abi’l Abbas Shams al-Din Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Abi Bakr b. Khallikan (d.681H)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif (d.536H) was a Sufi Worshipper Who Didn’t Even Meet Imam Ibn Hazm</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was born in 481H and died in 536H. So, straight away we learn Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif was born 35 years after the death of Ibn Hazm and therefore, he didn’t even meet Ibn Hazm. Abi’l Abbas Shams al-Din Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Abi Bakr b. Khallikan (d.681H) mentions:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 90px;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif was a sufi) and from the major Salihin and spiritual Awliya. His virtuous and status was well known. He authored a book ‘al-Majalis’ and other books which were about his tariqah (i.e. way) of his group (i.e. sufi turuq). He also wrote a good poem about his tariqah…<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Khallikan further qualifies this and says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 90px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was a worshipper (al-Ubad) and someone who renounced the pleasure of the world (Ahl al-Zuhd).<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The major problem with this statement of Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif other than it being highly prejudiced, it seems like it is also spurious and dubious from Ibn al-Arif. Ibn Khallikan mentions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 90px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some Shaykhs and noble people said they saw his (i.e Ibn al-Arif’s) handwriting on an entry on Abi Muhammad Ali b. Ahmad well known as Ibn Hazm al-Zahiri al-Andalusi and he said about him ‘The tongue of Ibn Hazm and the sword of al-Hajjaj b. Yusuf are brothers.’<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Khallikan then proceeds to offer the reason why Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif made this statement,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 90px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said this about him because Ibn Hazm would often reprimand scholars of the past and present, he spared no one.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" src="blob:http://www.salafiri.com/70461fed-eed8-4e39-8305-6b4d45449ed6" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" src="blob:http://www.salafiri.com/f7f88d87-66a8-482b-b744-b16a846998e8" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" src="blob:http://www.salafiri.com/b74a0bba-3e34-4cf4-98d7-1de503f9c555" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Wafayat al-A’yan Wa Anba’ Abna’ al-Zaman</em></strong><strong>, 1:168-170.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This entry of Ibn Khallikan poses a number of serious problems.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The First Problem</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As mentioned before, Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif was born 35 years after the death of Ibn Hazm, so not only did they not meet but there is also a gap of 35 years between them. Abu’l Abbas b. Arif then, must have either taken this statement from someone or it was his own view.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Second Problem</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Khallikan mentions some scholars and noble individuals saw this statement in the handwriting of Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif. So, we don’t even know for sure if this evan was the statement of Ibn al-Arif or the view of someone else.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Third Problem</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Who were these scholars and noble people? We know, that we don’t take narrations and reports, especially when they are of this nature – heavy statements of criticism against a great scholar and Imam of Ahl al-Sunnah. Ahl al-Sunnah have some protocols and guidelines which they strongly adhere to while discerning such statements. Unfortunately, Ibn Khallikan just making this claim and assertion will not be accepted readily, it must be supported with other evidence at least to prove its authenticity from Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fourth Problem</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif was a sufi who promoted and propagated his view of Ibn Hazm, not only this but he was not recognized as someone with authority or credentials in the science of praise and criticism i.e. al-Jarh wa’l Ta’dil. He is unknown and unqualified in this field. He is generally unknown and has no specific status amongst the Ahl al-Hadith, so based on all of this, how are his words first taken as being authentic and trustworthy and secondly even worthy of consideration due to his creedal or methodological background?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Fifth Problem</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif died in 536H and Ibn Khallikan was born in 608H, therefore there is a gap of of 72 years. This is significant because Ibn Khallikan does not specify his source and rather brushes it off as saying the statement from Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif was seen by scholars and nobles. This breakage in chain for a pivotal statement such as this is crucial to its reliability.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Essentially all five problems question the veracity and authenticity of this statement from Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif and this becomes intrinsically important when the image, stature and standing of Ibn Hazm is questioned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Khallikan, further in his entry of Ibn Hazm repeats this charge from Ibn al-Arif and offers his view on Ibn Hazm and some of the problems he faced by his contemporaries. He says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" src="blob:http://www.salafiri.com/762fd396-a739-4d7d-9008-4f60baad4825" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 90px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif said about him as preceded, the tongue of Ibn Hazm and the sword of al-Hajjaj b. Yusuf are brothers and he said this about him because he frequently reprimanded scholars.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Khallikan’s <em>Wafayat al-A’yan</em> was the earliest source to record Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif’s statement and it is possible that subsequent authors, historiographers and biographers copied it from him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imam Muhammad b. Ahmad b. Abd al-Hadi (d.744H)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also cites this statement in his entry of Imam Ibn Hazm and honours him with the titles of al-Imam al-Allamah al-Faqih, al-Hafiz, one of the scholars…. Ibn Abd al-Hadi again relies on early sources for his biography and as a base, he relies on the statements of earlier biographers.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In his entry and those of other scholars we see a common trend, in that all of them while citing Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif’s statement essentially rely on Ibn Khallikan’s entry in his <em>Wafayat.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" src="blob:http://www.salafiri.com/5f0faebd-dd30-4e65-b8b5-4fe3bbc5eec8" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" src="blob:http://www.salafiri.com/be9c6cfd-29ed-4a63-be47-a1204a50da01" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Tabaqat Ulama Ahl al-Hadith</em></strong><strong>, 3:352</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imam al-Dhahabi (d.748H) on Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also brings the statement of Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif under Ibn Hazm’s entries in <em>Tazkirrah al-Huffaz</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>, <em>Siyar A’lam al-Nubala’<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a></em> and in <em>Tarikh al-Islam<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><strong>[11]</strong></a></em> but it seems like that it is more of a case of citing, just as the historiographers had to do prior to him. He doesn’t mention it at all in his <em>al-Ibar</em>, but this is perhaps because the entries in <em>al-Ibar</em> are overviews.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is interesting to note that al-Dhahabi while introducing Ibn Hazm’s entry in the <em>Tarikh al-Islam Wa Wafayat al-Mashahir Wa’l A’lam</em> is unable to holdback and is forced to describe him as THE Imam &#8211; <em>‘al-Imam Abu Muhammad’</em> while citing his lineage.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He lauds Ibn Hazm with honourific titles and then proceeds to offer the words of Ibn Khallikan, pretty much verbatim and also includes the charge on Ibn Hazm. He also furnishes his reason by saying that Ibn Hazm spoke much about the scholars.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A prime example of how such a statement was modified to give the impression many believed this about Ibn Hazm was the entry for him by Jamal al-Din Abi’l Mahasin Yusuf b. Tugri Bardi al-Atabaki (d.874H) in his <em>al-Nujum al-Zahirah</em>, he says Ibn Hazm died in the year 456H.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 90px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Muhammad, famously known as Ibn Hazm, he was a Muhaddith and the author of well known books and Zahiri in Madhhab. Everyone spoke about him (negatively) except the Ahl al-Hadith, for he was formidable in his memorisation. He was a learned Imam and a specialist in the science of hadith. Despite this he was a person with abhorrent speech, as such he would speak about the scholars and people, his contemporaries used to say, ‘We seek refuge with Allah from the sword of al-Hajjaj and the tongue of Ibn Hazm’.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an example of a modified version of the original statement by later authors, in this case by Jamal al-Din al-Atabaki who was born in 813H and died in 873H. We have shown how the origins of this statement were approximately first mentioned 250 years before Jamal al-Din.</span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif Was a Sufi</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yusuf b. Yahya Attadli known as Ibn al-Ziyat (d.627H) in his <em>al-Tashuwwufu Ila Rijal al-Tasawwufi Wa Akhbar Abil Abbas al-Sabti</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> brings an entry for Abul Abbas b. al-Arif in this book as a leading sufi with a few pages extended in honour of him, he also cites poems concerning him. This is conclusive proof that as early as 627H Abul Abbas b. al-Arif was a known sufi.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What also shows Abul Abbas b. al-Arif was a sufi, were some of his books that promoted the teachings of Sufism and its likes. Some of these books have been published while others are lost. From his books which promotes and expounds the teachings of Sufism is his book, <em>Muftah al-Sa’adah Wa Tahqiq Tariq al-Sa’adah</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> as collected by Abu Bakr Atiq b. Mu’min (d.548H). This work was published in 1993 with the verification of Doctor Asmat Abd al-Latif Dandash and spans 262 pages.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In her lengthy introduction she discusses and explains Abul Abbas b. al-Arif’s Sufism and his methodology in understanding and promoting it. She brings his chain in Tasawwuf and goes onto explain how a Sufi teacher teaches his disciples and so on. She also lists some of his other books, which are essentially also on Tasawwuf and they include,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Kitab Mahasain al-Majalis</em> (which is published)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Kitab Mataleh al-Anwar Wa Manabeh al-Asrar</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Miftah al-Sa’adah Li-Ahl al-Iradah Fil Tuhur Wal Kiswah lil-Hadharah al-Rafiyi’ah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Muftah al-Sa’adah Wa Tahqiq Tariq al-Sa’adah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The <em>Mahasin</em> was translated to English and French and often used by western academia while discussing Sufism and its terminology and understanding. He also set the foundation of a sufi Tariqah which became well known in Morroco, where Ibn al-Arif eventually died. He was heavily influenced by Ibn Masarra, who was a well known Sufi and Philosopher based in al-Andalus, where Ibn al-Arif was originally from. The Spanish orientalist, Miguel Asin Palacious, not only translated the <em>Mahasin al-Majalis</em>, but he also researched and wrote extensively on Ibn Masarra.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Abd al-Ghaffar Hasan Rehmani<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I had been searching for a statement of a scholar explaining this oft repeated comment, when until a few months ago, a brother shared the statement of Shaykh Abd al-Ghaffar Hasan Rehman, who explained this statement in a favourable manner. Shaykh Abd al-Ghaffar Hasan Rehmani said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 90px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allamah Ibn al-Aziz<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> writes: the tongue of Ibn Hazm and the sword of Hajjaj are both real Sisters<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a> [brothers]. Just as the sword of Hajjaj was reckless, the tongue of Ibn Hazm was uncontrollable. However, Hajjaj’s sword was raised to support tyranny and oppression, while Ibn Hazm’s tongue spoke to dissemnimate the truth.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" src="blob:http://www.salafiri.com/4ae229ff-e67d-4ba1-8031-43f4539828cb" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first historiographer and biographer who coined this statement was Abul Abbas b. al-Arif. He was an ardent Sufi who propagated his beliefs and authored books in promoting and defending Sufism. He was also credited leading the way to a sufi tariqah. He was born 35 years after the death of Imam Ibn Hazm and therefore this statement is purely spurious that he might have heard during his life and it was not first hand experience. In this regard, it lacks originality it is an odd and a highly-biased and prejudiced view. The attribution of this statement to Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif is also very doubtful and suspicious as “some scholars and nobles” said they saw it in his handwriting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">            Ibn Khallikan, to our knowledge was the first person to mention this statement and attribute it to Abu’l Abbas who died in 536H and Ibn Khallikan died in 681H and we find that he finished compiling his al-Wafayat 10 years prior to his death in around 671H. Ibn Khallikan does not present his sources and brushes it away by saying scholars and nobles saw the statement in Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif’s handwriting. There is at least a gap of 72 years (when Ibn Khallikan was born) to a maximum of 135 years (when he finished compiling his book) between Ibn Khallikan and Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif’s statement, again severing the direct link.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">            Later scholars all relied on Ibn Khallikan’s entry of Ibn Hazm and continued to include Abu’l Abbas b. al-Arif’s statement. Ibn Khallikan was the assistant to the chief judge of Egypt and later became the chief judge of Damascus, it was perhaps this central position that allowed his biographical work to spread and reach acclaim in Egypt and Damascus. Another potential explanation for why later authorities relied on Ibn Khallikan’s work was because he included a wide range of people from scholars, scientists, writers, cultural and notable figures, and so it became well quoted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">            In summary, this statement has very little value and is an odd isolated and dubious statement which should not be used or oft repeated against the honour of this formidable scholar of Ahl al-Sunnah, Imam Ibn Hazm. It is also shameful, the statement of a vehement Sufi is used against this great Imam of the Ahl al-Hadith without any regard, as if it was authentic and well established. Alhamdulillah, we have shown with historical references that no one else reported this statement or even believed it, through other independent routes or attributions.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sufi Shaykhs, while attracting people to Sufism, they were and are responsible for preparing new members for Sufi mystic training, taking them through various stages i.e. Maqamat and States i.e. Ahwal. They perform regimental type exercises and activities until they become proficient and thus move on to the next stage. For example, whirling and dancing like the whirling dervishes, the Naqshbandis, who say Haqq Allah repeatedly, others say Allah Hu while attempting to reconcile the chanting to coincide with their heartbeat, others use Qawwali Music, some use musical instruments like bells and flutes etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The new recruits would believe while being brainwashed into thinking that these Sufi Shaykhs could work miracles known as Karamat.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The state they would reach while having passed this stage is called fana&#8217;, which is known as individual self passing away in Allah commonly known as annihilation with Allah. (astagfirullah). The next stage is baqa&#8217;,<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> which is known as self abiding in Allah, in other words permanent stay in Allah (La Huwla Wa La Quwwata Illah Billah). This state of baqa&#8217; is the final stepping stone towards ACTUAL union with Allah i.e. the person becoming one with Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This also led them to develop other elements of belief, for example Wahdat al-Wujud and Hulul. Wahdah al-Wujud is when the created i.e. khalq becomes al-Haqq and thus the essence of existence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If the individual self became united with Allah, they would experience the ecstatic contemplation of divine beauty.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> This ecstasy also known as Dhawq was the final end stage of a mystic, which every Sufi yearns to attain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Other writers have mentioned that the Sufi had an innate desire to attain and experience ecstasy i.e. Dhawq which always resulted in the union with Allah i.e. fana’, also known as annihilation with Allah.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They had developed Sufi rituals that they used to reach Ilm al-Haqiqah i.e. esoteric knowledge. Rituals for instance, Sufi dancing known as Raqs, listening to music and Sufi type odes and poems known as Sama’ as well as chanting. They would try to achieve Dhawq i.e. ecstasy through incessant recitation and remembrance of Allah ie Dhikr while dancing.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This eventually led the Sufis to assert and claim exemption and relief of religious Islamic duties when they reached the end stage of Ecstasy &#8211; Dhawq and or sometimes defined as Hāl, a mystical state, where they would be United with The Divine essence.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They also gave this exemption of obligatory  religious duties the name of Ibaha, and interestingly this was due to the influence and while drawing from Hindu Vedantic teachings.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was this so called exemption, the various states and the concepts of Sufism which Imam Ibn Taymiyyah heavily criticised.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">YET, they have the audacity to claim Imam Ibn Taymiyyah was a Sufi! The sheer disregard for any Islamic research has led these claimants to concoct such fallacious lies. The strongest argument against these claimants and their slanderous accusations, is that not a single Sufi from the era of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah ever claimed Sufism for him, the same way they practise it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some writers have misconstrued the explanatory words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and given the false impression that he promoted and held some of the beliefs highlighted above. He, as usual explained and delineated his views and understanding of Sufism and offered an explanatory discourse. His method of explanation was often to use terminology that was used by detractors or the masses, in order for them to understand his viewpoint. Some writers have latched onto al-Ba’labakki (d.734H), the Hanbalite student of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah as a means to portray him as a Sufi, for the former was trained in the Sufi way. Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but this is not what Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah was about.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">QUESTION</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people claim it is permissible to make tabarruk ie seek blessings from the relics of the scholars and righteous people; they present evidence and say the companions sought blessings from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, so what is the ruling concerning this affair? Also in the form that is deemed permissible, is not a non-Prophet being compared to the Prophet of Allah ﷺ? Also is it permissible to seek blessing from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ after his demise? And is it permissible to seek wasilah ie intercession of the blessings of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ?</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">ANSWER</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is impermissible to seek blessing from the relics of anyone other than the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, for example the water remaining after wudu, his hair, his sweat or any other part of the body. All of these things are specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and this is because Allah had blessed his body and anything else that he touched. This is the reason why no companion sought blessing or virtue from each other during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ or after his death, even to the extent that blessings or tabarruk was not sought from the four rightly guided Khulafa Rashidun or from the other virtuous companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, such actions and the understanding of the companions is a clear and manifest evidence they understood tabarruk ie blessings to be specific and restricted to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ which was impermissible for anyone else. It is also impermissible for anyone who is not a Prophet because it leads to and is a means to Shirk with Allah which is also the false worship of others. Likewise, and similarly it is not correct to make wasilah of the essence or selfness of Prophet ie dhat, his attributes, his blessings, his station and status because it lacks evidence. This is also due to the fact that it is a means and also leads to Shirk with Allah, this is extremism as well as exaggeration in the status and station of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the reasons is is impermissible is because none of the companions adopted or practiced this type of wasilah. If this was something good, they would have surely preceded us.  Another reason why it is impermissible is because it opposes evidence s from the Shari’ah. Allah The Most High said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Allah has the most beautiful names, so call him by them.” (al-A’raf:180)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Apart from Allah&#8217;s name, it is permissible to make wasilah through his attributes like Honour, mercy and speech which is established and proven from the authentic hadith, in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would seek refuge in Allah through his Speech, Honour, Mercy and Power. (Muslim no.2202, 2708).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also by having Iman in Allah and his Messenger, it is a means of loving both. Hence it is permissible to seek nearness or closeness to Allah via his righteous good deeds. This is exemplified in the incidence of the people of the cave, who sought shelter in a cave from rain when eventually a rock covered the entrance and blocked it. The people did not have the power to remove the rock, so they began to figure out a way in how to deal with the calamity, and so they agreed to supplicate to Allah by mentioning the good deeds they had done, and would use them as interecessors. So one used his good conducts with is parents as a means to seek nearness to Allah, so the rock moved a little. The second person used his deed of abstaining from fornication as a means to seeking closeness to Allah despite having the ability to do so, so the rocked moved a little more. The third person sought means of closeness by mentioning his good deeds of being honest and trustworthy, eventually the rocked moved from the entrance of the cave and they were eventually able to leave. This is an incident of the people or nations before, so It contains admonition and guidance for us all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This answer has been further expounded by Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim in their respective books. Allamah Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan has also addressed it in his <em>Fath al-Majid Sharh Kitab al-Tawhid.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the hadith of the blind man who sought intercession through the Prophet ﷺ which also mentions the Prophet ﷺ interceded on his behalf, so Allah restored his sight (Ahmad 4:134, Tirmidhi no.3579, Ibn Majah 1404, see also Shaikh al-Albani’s al-Tawassul wal-Wasilah p.75)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we should know, this hadith did not mention his station or status as a means of closeness or intercession but rather it was due to the supplication of the Prophet of Allah ﷺ, his intercession, using his own wasitah and wasilah as the hadith clearly states. Furthermore, the people will go to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for this type of intercession on the Day of Judgement so that Allah makes Judgement on them quickly (Bukhari 7410, Muslim 193).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, and similarly the people of Jannah will come to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and ask him to intercede with Allah on their behalf for them to enter Jannah quickly (Muslim 196).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the aforementioned forms of Wasilah, whether they are related to when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was living or the afterlife, all in all of them are related to the Wasilah or du’a of intercession and not due to his selfness, ie Dhat or due to the right of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Tuhfatul Ikhwan Bajwibah Muhimmah Tataluq Biarkan al-Islam</em> (Question 5 p.29), see also <em>Majmu’a Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawah</em> (7:67)   </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">READ PART 38</span> &#8211; </span><a href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-38-mawlid-beginnings-historical-origins-rafidhi-fatimids/"><span style="color: #008000;">Mawlid Beginnings &amp; Historical Origins – Rafidhi Fatimids</span></a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Th historians differ greatly as to when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born ie the exact date however most of them opine it was the 9th of Rabī Al-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Sa‘īd Muzaffar Kaukabūrī was himself unsure of the exact date of the Mawlid due to the difference of opinion, he Kawkaburi, who was considered the chief Mawlid innovator, would celebrate the Mawlid on the 8th of Rabi ul-Awwal in one year and on the 12th the following year. (al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah 1:552)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Dahiyyah, the one who wrote one of the earliest books promoting the Mawlid, was of the opinion the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 8th of Rabi ul-Awwal and he refutes the notion of it being the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal (<em>al-Tanwir Fi Mawlid al-Bashir wal-Nazir from al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah</em> 2:260)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Dahiyyah also mention the 17th of Rabi ul-Awwal as another potential birth date (<em>al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah</em> 2:260)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is strange how the Barelwis use Imam Ibn Kathirs al-Bidayah to support their views in other things but in such instances they turn a blind eye to such remarks and research. The likes of Saqid Shami are happy to use Ibn Kathir on Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and his alleged book on the Mawlid, so we are we using here too?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The founder of Baraliwism Ahmad Raza Khān said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 12th of Rabī Al-Awwal and he died on the same day.&#8221;</em> (Malfūzāt 2:220)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Qādir Jilānī said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Prophet ﷺ was born on the 10th of Muharram.&#8221;</em> (<em>Ghuniyyah al-Tālibīn</em> 2:392).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahmad Raza Khan said about Shaikh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The illustrious son and descendant of the Glorious Prophet ﷺ and the true representative and inheritor of Prophetic Bounties, the great Ghawth Shaykh Sayyid ‘Abd al-Qadir Jilani (d 561/1164) states: ‘I see all the cities of Allah as I see a mustard seed in the centre of my palm.’ The Grand Ghawth also states: ‘The pupil of my eye is set on the Luhe-Mahfuz.&#8221;</em> (Malfuzat 1:35-36, Barelwi translation)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is deception at its highest level, on one hand they have this belief about Abdul Qadir al-Jilnai while at the same time reject his view regarding the birth date and hence the Mawlid. The conclusion, Ahmad Raza was categorically lying when he made this statement about Shaykh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another Barelwi writer, Muhammad Umim Ehsan al-Mujaddadi al-Barkati said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on a Monday in the year of the Elephant, either on the 8th, 9th or the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Awjaz al-Siyar Mulhiq Bi-Mishkat al-Masabih</em> 1:586)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdul Haq Dehlawi also mentions the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal being the birth date of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ (<em>Ma Thabt Bil-Sunnah</em> p.288, <em>Madarij al-Nabuwwah</em> 2:23)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qādi Muhammad Suleimān Mansūrpūrī said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Our Prophet ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī Al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant, corresponding to 22nd April 571ce, corresponding to the 1st Jith 628 Bikrami in Makkah in the early morning before sunrise. &#8220;</em> (<em>Rehmah Al-Alamīn</em> p.40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The historians have differed with regards to the birth date, Tabari and Ibn Khaldun said the 12th, Abu Fida said the 10th. However all are agreed the Monday (of the birth) on that year corresponds to the 9th and this is why the 9th of Rabi ul-Awwal seems to be most accurate date of birth.&#8221;</em> (<em>Rehmah Al-Alamīn</em> p.40)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Sayyid Suleimān Nadwī said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;As regards to the birth of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ Egypt&#8217;s Mahmūd Pashā the astronomer authored a treatise in which he proved mathematically that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 9th Rabī Al-Awwal corresponding to 20th April 571ce.&#8221;</em> (<em style="color: #000000;">Sirah al-Nabī</em> 1:171)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Indian historian Akbar Shah Najibabadi said, </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant corresponding to the 40th gathering of Kisrah Naushirwan corresponding to the 22th April 571ce in the morning before sunrise.&#8221;</em> <em style="color: #000000;">(Tārīkh Al-Islām</em> 1:76)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The leader of the Sufi&#8217;s, Yusuf bin Ismail Nabahani said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;And what is famous and well known and what the majority (of the scholars) are agreed upon is that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Hujjatullah Alal A&#8217;lamin</em> p.231)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Deobandi church father, Ashraf Ali Thanwi has also mentioned a difference of opinion with regards to the exact birth date. (<em>Nashr al-Tayyib</em> p.28)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The likes of the well known scholars were of the view that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal. Imam Nawawi mentioned,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away on the Monday morning on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal after the 12th year after the Hijra.&#8221;</em> (<em>Taqrib Ala Ibn Salah</em> 2:251)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Suyuti, who is revered by the proponents of the Mawlid because of his generic reverence of the birth of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, said in explanation of the words of Imam Nawawi,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The majority (of the scholars) are upon what the author (i.e. Imam Nawawi) mentioned, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died on the 12th of Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tadrib al-Rawi Sharh Tarib al-Nawaw</em>i 2:51)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Tal&#8217;at, the author of <em>Tarikh Dawal al-Arab wal-Islam</em> was also of the view the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabi ul-Awwal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdur Rahman Mubrakpuri in his <em>Tuhfa</em> brings the statement of Hafiz Ibn al-Jawzi from his <em>al-Tanqih</em> in which he says,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;They are agreed the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born on the Monday in the year of the elephant in the month of Rabi ul-Awwal, however, they differ with regards to the exact date of the month and there are four views, (1) 2nd Rabi ul-Awwal, (2) 8th Rabi ul-Awwal, (3) 10th Rabi ul-Awwal and the (4) 12th Rabi ul-Awwal.&#8221;</em> (<em>Tuhfa al-Ahwadhi Sharh Tirmidhi</em> 4:295)</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shia rafidah fatimid rulers were instrumental in formulating and pushing the Mawlid and the Milād amongst the people and they are the ones who made it famous. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ahmad bin Alī bin Ahmad al-Fazārī al-Qalqashandī  [821H] said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Fatimid Khaliph would organise their third gathering on the 12th of Rabī al-Awwal and celebrate the Mawlid. Their habit pertaining to the gathering was to cook various sweet dishes at Dār Al-Fitrah with a lot of sugar which they would distribute in 300 silver dishes. During the Mawlid night the sweet dishes would be distributed between the numerous dignitaries like the judges, religious callers, the various reciters and admonishers as well as the presidents of the various universities and the sūfī patrons of the tombs and shrines..&#8221;</em> [Subh al-&#8216;Asha Fī Sana&#8217;a al-Insha [3:576]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bukhīt al-Mutī‘ī Al-Hanafī the Qadī of Alexandria (Egypt) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Fatimids khaliphs were the first ones to innovate the Mawlid in Cairo and first from amongst them was Mu&#8217;az Al-DīnAllāh. He travelled from Maghrib to Egypt in shawwal in the year 361H. He then travelled to Alexandria in Sha&#8217;bān 362H and then entered Cairo in the same year on the 7th of Ramadhan. These people innovated 6 Mawālīd, the Mawlid of the prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, the Milād of Alī, the Milād of Fatimah, the Milād of Hasan, the Milād of Hussain and the Milād of the current ruler. These mawlids continued with the custom and practices until Afzal bin Amir Al-Juyūsh came and abolished them. His father Amir Al-Juyush went to egypt fromSham upon the invitation of the Khaliph Mustansarbillah wherein he entered Egypt on the eve of the 2nd of Jumada al-Ula in the year 465H. When he went on the war expedition to Sham he placed his son Afzal his representative. When Amir Al-Juyush died in Rabī Al-Thani or Jumada Al-Ula in the year 487H his son Afzal took control of the army. When Muntasarbillah died on the 17th of Dhul Hijjah 495H, his reign of Khilafah was 7 years and 2 months. Afzal then put forward muntasarbillahs son as the new Khaliph whose name was mustalabillah. Then mustalabillah died on the 17th of Safar 496H and Afzal then made his son, Al-Amr bi Ahkamallah the Khaliph. Then on the eve of Eid Al-Fitr in the year 515H Afzal was murdered and the same happened to Al-Amr bi Ahkamallah in the year 524H. The 6 Milād were restarted during his reign whereas Afzal had abolished them and the people had eventually forgotten them.&#8221;</em> [Ahsan Al-Kalām Fimā Yata‘laq Bil-Sunnah Wa&#8217;l Bid‘ah Minal Ahkām [pp.59-61]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same has been reported by other authors in their various books from them include</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Alī Mahfùz in <em>Al-Ibda‘a Fī Madhār Al-Ibtidā‘a [pp.136]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sayyid Alī Fikrī in <em>al-Mukhadharāt Al-Fikriyyah [pp.84]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Alī Nāsir Al-Faqihi in <em>al-Bid‘ah Dhawabituha Wa Athārahā as-Sayy&#8217;ia Fil Ummah [pp.16,21]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ismā‘īl bin Muhammad Ansārī in <em>Al-Qaul Al-Fasl Fī Hukm Al-Ehtifāl bi Mawlid Al-Rūsul [pp.64-72]</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As we have already mentioned the Mawlid was innovated by the Fatimid Shī‘as. The reign of the Fatimids started in approximately 362H until 567H. They are the ones who first innovated the Mawlid and they also innovated mawlids for Ahlul Bayt, again this is another clear cut evidence that the concept of Mawlid was not practised or even heard of during the first three generations. What is also apparent is that the current days Muslims the Sūfīs and Barailwis have rejected the other 5 Mawlids and just adopted one. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The people of deviation may say how could Muzaffar al-Dīn Al-Kaukabūrī innovated the Mawlid when the Fatimid Shias did. Well we say that when the ruler Al-Afzal bin Amīr Al-Juyūsh prohibited and banned the Mawlid and its associated practices innovated by the Fatimids, Muzaffar al-Din restarted it and gave it a new shape and direction. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu Muhammad Abdul Rahman bin Ismail Abī Shāmah [665H] said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The first person to do this (ie the Mawlid or Milād) in Mosul was Shaikh Umar bin Muhammad al-Mulla who was a well known Sūfī and then the ruler or Irbil followed him.&#8221;</em> [al-Bā&#8217;ith Ala Inkār Al-Bid‘ah wa&#8217;l Hawādith [pp.24]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bukhīt al-Mutī‘ī Al-Hanafī said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I say Malik Muzaffar Al-Dīn the ruler of Irbil, he is the one who Suyūti spoke about when he said he was the first one to innovated the Mawlid. His name was Abu Sa‘īd Kaukabūrī bin Abul Hasan Alī bin Baktakīn bin Mu‘ammar, his title was Mulk Al-A&#8217;zam Muzaffar Al-Dīn of Irbil. After his fathers death on the 10th of Dhul Qa&#8217;dah 563H he became the king at the age of 14. He is the one who innovated the Milād in the city of Irbil.</em> [Ahsan Al-Kalām Fimā Yata‘laq Bil-Sunnah Wa&#8217;l Bid‘ah Minal Ahkām [pp.66]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Muhammad al-Abdarī famously known as Ibn Al-Haj said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;And from everything that is new from the affair of innovations with the associated belief that they are from the superior aspects of worship and the manifestation they are the well known signs of Islam, one such issue is the Mawlid in the month of Rabī Al-Awwal which includes innovations and unlawful things.&#8221;</em> [al-Mudkhal [2:229]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;These people only want to gather at the corrupt Mawlid when there is music is sama, if it is without music and just the Mawlid and they invite the brothers for food, likewise it is free from any corrupt practices, of which some have been mentioned before and of the sole intention is for Milād then this is an innovation and a new act in the Dīn which was not a practise of the Salaf of the past because traversing the path of the Salaf is superior and better.&#8221;</em> [al-Mudkhal [2:234]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Taj Al-Dīn Umar bin Ali Al-Fākihānī was asked concerning the Mawlid who which he replied, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I do not know the basis or the origins of this Mawlid in the Kitab or Sunnah, neither is it mentioned that a single scholar from the Ummah acted upon it and they were from amongst those who were exemplary in the Dīn and held firmly onto the reports of the earlier scholars, rather this Mawlid is an innovation which was introduced by the people of falsehood, of desires, whims and to seek personal gains. &#8220;</em> [al-Hawi Lil Fatāwa [1:190-191]</span></p>
