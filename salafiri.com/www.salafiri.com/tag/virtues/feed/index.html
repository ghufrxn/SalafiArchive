				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>Is a ḥadīth regarding the recital of Sūrat al-Kahf on Friday proven? Please clarify with evidences <em>(Muḥammad Na&#8217;īm Sājid)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Answer:</strong> The following narration is reported concerning the recital of Sūrat al-Kahf on Friday:</p>
<p style="text-align: right">حَدَّثَنَا سَعِيْدٌ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا هُشَيْمٌ، ثَنَا أَبُو هَاشِمٍ، عَنْ أَبِيْ مِجْلَزٍ، عَنْ قَيْسِ بنِ عُبَادٍ، عَنْ أَبِيْ سَعِيْدٍ الْخُدْرِيِّ رضي الله عنه قَالَ: <strong>((مَنْ قَرَأَ سُوْرَةَ الْكَهْفِ يَوْمَ الجُمُعَةِ أَضَاءَ لَهُ مِنَ النُّوْرِ مَا بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الْبَيْتِ العَتِيْقِ))</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sayyiduna Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;Whoever recites Sūrat al-Kahf on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah (Friday), a light will shine between him and al-Bayt al-&#8216;Atīq (the Ka&#8217;bah)&#8221; </strong><em>(Sunan Sa&#8217;īd bin Manṣūr : 1368 and its Isnād is Ṣaḥīḥ)<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>a brief introduction to the narrators of this narration is as follows:</strong><br />
(1) Sa&#8217;īd bin Manṣūr: <em>&#8220;Thiqah (trustworthy), author&#8221;.</em> (al-Taqrīb : 2399)<br />
(2) Hushaym bin Bashīr: <em>&#8220;Thiqah (trustworthy), Thabt (precise)&#8221;.</em> (al-Taqrīb : 7312)<br />
He is Mudallis too but in the mentioned sanad, direct hearing (Samā&#8217; i.e سمعت, حدثنا etc) is explicitly stated.<br />
(3) Abū Hāshim Yaḥyā bin Dīnār al-Wāsiṭī: <em>&#8220;Thiqah (trustworthy)&#8221;.</em> (al-Taqrīb : 8425)<br />
(4) Abū Mijlaz Lāḥiq bin Ḥumayd: <em>&#8220;Thiqah (trustworthy)&#8221;.</em> (al-Taqrīb : 7490)<br />
(5) Qays bin &#8216;Ubād: <em>&#8220;Trustworthy&#8221;.</em> (al-Taqrīb : 5582)</p>
<p>This narration is Mawqūf (attributed to a companion) but it has the ruling of Marfū&#8217; (attributed to the prophet ﷺ)</p>
<p>Imām al-Nasā&#8217;ī رحمه الله said: &#8220;and the correct (narration) is Mawqūf&#8221; (al-Sunan al-Kubrā : 9/37)<br />
Imām al-Bayhaqī رحمه الله said: &#8220;And this is what is Maḥfūz (preserved) as Mawqūf&#8221; (Shu&#8217;ab al-Īmān 4/86)</p>
<p>Meaning that according to al-Nasā&#8217;ī and al-Bayhaqī this Mawqūf narration is preserved Alḥamdulillāh.</p>
<p>Ibn Ḥajar رحمه الله also declared the Mawqūf as being more authentic (al-Talkhīṣ al-Ḥabīr 2/1765)</p>
<p>{al-Dhahabi said: &#8220;Mawqūf is more authentic&#8221; (al-Muhadhab fī ikhtiṣār al-Sunan al-Kabīr 1/42)</p>
<p>Ibn al-Qayyim said: &#8220;and Sa&#8217;īd bin Manṣūr mentioned it from the saying of Abū Sa&#8217;īd and that is more correct&#8221; (Zād al-Ma&#8217;ād 1/463)}</p>
<p><strong>Objection: </strong>An objection is raised against the aforementioned narration that Imām Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal رحمه الله narrated the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: right">حَدَّثَنَا هُشَيْمٌ، عَنْ أَبِيْ هَاشِمٍ عَنْ أَبِيْ مِجْلَزٍ عَنْ قَيْسِ بنِ عُبَادٍ عَنْ أَبِيْ سَعِيْدٍ الْخُدْرِيِّ قَالَ: إِذَا تَوَضَّأَ الرَّجُلُ فَقَالَ: سُبْحانَكَ اللَّهُمَ وَبِحَمْدِكَ</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Then he said: &#8220;Hushaym did not hear this from Abū Hāshim&#8221; (al-&#8216;Ilal wa Ma&#8217;rifat al-Rijāl : 2/251)</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Removal (of objection): </strong>After keeping in mind the sanad (chain) and matn (text) quoted by imām Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal, consider also the following sanad and matn: Imam al-Nasā&#8217;ī رحمه الله said:</p>
<p style="text-align: right">أَخْبَرَنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ بَشَّارٍ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدٌ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا شُعْبَةُ، عَنْ أَبِي هَاشِمٍ قَالَ: ‌سَمِعْتُ ‌أَبَا ‌مِجْلَزٍ يُحَدِّثُ ‌عَنْ قَيْسِ بْنِ عُبَادٍ عَنْ أَبِي سَعِيدٍ قَوْلَهُ</p>
<p style="text-align: left">He also said:</p>
<p style="text-align: right">أَخْبَرَنَا يَحْيَى بْنُ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ السَّكَنِ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى بْنُ كَثِيرٍ أَبُو غَسَّانَ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا شُعْبَةُ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو هَاشِمٍ عَنْ أَبِي مِجْلَزٍ، عَنْ قَيْسِ بْنِ عُبَادٍ عَنْ أَبِي سَعِيدٍ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ: مَنْ تَوَضَّأَ فَقَالَ: سُبْحَانَكَ اللهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ&#8230;ـ</p>
<p>In both of the mentioned sanad, imām Shu&#8217;bah has clearly done Mutāba&#8217;ah (supported) Hushaym which indicates that Imam Shu&#8217;bah also heard this narration from Abū Hashim. Therefore, considering the mentioned narration as weak based on Hushaym not mentioning direct hearing (Samā&#8217;) is absolutely wrong and incorrect.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Some people, feigning ignorance, raise the objection that the narration in which Shu&#8217;bah did Mutāba&#8217;ah does not mention Friday.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">لو! آپ اپنے دام میں صیّاد آگیا</p>
<p>&#8220;So the hunter has fallen into his own trap.&#8221; (Lines of poetry)</p>
<p>We will only dare to ask: Is Friday mentioned in the narration where Imām Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal رحمه الله denied direct hearing (Samā&#8217;)? If the Mutāba&#8217;ah (by Shu&#8217;bah) is not accepted due to the absence of the mention of Friday, then how is Imām Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal&#8217;s criticism accepted due to the absence of the mention of Friday?</p>
<p>Futhermore, following the aforementioned objection, it is to be said that if such a difference (of opinion) arose among the scholars, they would present the direct explicit hearing (Samā&#8217;) as evidence and would not reject the direct explicit hearing (Samā&#8217;) without a clear indication (to support it)</p>
<p>Imām Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله said concerning Imām Ibn Ḥibbān رحمه الله:</p>
<p style="text-align: right">وَقَد أَعَلَّهُ أَبُو حَاتِمٍ ابْن حِبَان بأَن قَالَ: زَاذَانُ لَمْ يَسْمَعهُ مِنَ الْبَرَاءِ وَهَذِهِ الْعِلَّةُ فَاسِدَةٌ فَإِنَّ زَاذَانَ قَالَ سَمِعْتُ الْبَرَاءَ بْنَ عَازِبٍ&#8230;ـ</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&#8220;Abū Ḥātim Ibn Ḥibbān declared it defective by saying: Zādhān did not hear it from Al-Barā&#8217;, but this defect is invalid because Zādhān said: I heard Al-Barā&#8217; bin &#8216;Āzib&#8230;&#8221; (Ḥāshiyat Ibn al-Qayyim &#8216;alā sunan Abī Dawūd : 9/31, see also Kitāb al-Rūḥ page : 77)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">It is clear from the aforementioned text that when Imām Ibn Ḥibbān رحمه الله denied the hearing (of Zādhān), Imām Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله presented the direct explicit hearing (Samā&#8217;) as evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Similarly, after narrating a hadith, Imām Diyā&#8217; al-Dīn al-Maqdisī رحمه الله mentions the saying of Imām al-Dāraquṭnī رحمه الله that: &#8220;إِنَّ ابْنَ جُرَيْجٍ لَمْ يَسْمَعهُ مِنْ إِسْحَاقَ&#8221; (Indeed, Ibn Jurayj did not hear it from Isḥāq). Afterwards, Imām Diyā&#8217; al-Dīn clarifies that through the route of Yaḥyā bin Sā&#8217;id (it is) &#8220;أخبرني إسحاق&#8221; (Ishaq informed me), meaning the defect mentioned in Imām al-Dāraquṭnī&#8217;s saying was removed by the direct explicit hearing (Samā&#8217;). See al-Mukhtārah li al-Maqdisī (4/373-374)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Similarly, the claim that the direct explicit hearing (Samā&#8217;) is a mistake of a narrator is completely baseless. No credible Muḥaddith (ḥadīth scholar) has pointed this out and it is also not worthy of attention because five trustworthy and truthful narrators are reporting the direct explicit hearing (Samā&#8217;), and it is not merely the single narration of a narrator.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left">Imām Sa&#8217;īd bin Manṣūr has narrated the direct explicit hearing <em>(Sunan Sa&#8217;īd bin Manṣūr : 1368) {cf. Tarikh al-Islam 7/693-694}</em></li>
<li style="text-align: left">Imām Abū al-Nu&#8217;mān al-Sadūsī also narrated the direct explicit hearing <em>(Sunan al-Dārimī : 3450) {with the wording &#8220;Friday night&#8221;}</em></li>
<li style="text-align: left">Imām Abū &#8216;Ubayd al-Qāsim bin Sallām also narrated the direct explicit hearing <em>(Faḍāil al-Qurān : p. 244)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: left">Imām Abū al-Qāsim &#8216;Abd al-Raḥmān bin &#8216;Umar bin Naṣr also narrated the direct explicit hearing <em>(Fawāid Ibn Naṣr: 123)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: left">Imām Nu&#8217;aym bin Ḥammād also narrated the direct explicit hearing <em>{al-Mustadrak 3430 by al-Ḥākim, al-Sunan al-Kubrā 6063, al-Sunan al-Ṣaghīr 606, Shu&#8217;ab al-īmān 2220 and al-Da&#8217;awāt al-Kabīr 526 by al-Bayhaqi}</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It should be clear that the &#8220;mistake&#8221; which no credible Muḥaddith has pointed out and then the agreement of these five trustworthy and truthful Imams on such a &#8220;mistake&#8221; is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Objection:</strong> Hushaym intentionally saying &#8220;أخبرنا&#8221; (he informed us) in a narration that he had not heard.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Removal (of objection): </strong>If this were the case, it would raise questions about Hushaym&#8217;s integrity, and the distinction between authentic and inauthentic narrations from him would disappear. Meanwhile, the Muḥaddithīn have accepted his narrations where direct explicit hearing is stated which is evidence that Hushaym&#8217;s hearing was not disregarded.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In this regard, drawing a conclusion from the saying of Imam Yaḥyā bin Ma&#8217;īn: &#8220;سَمِعْتُ هُشَيْمًا يُحَدِّثُ يَوْمًا فَقَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا عَلِيُّ بْنُ زَيْدٍ ثُمَّ ذَكَرَ أَنَّهُ لَمْ يَسْمَعْهُ مِنْ عَلِيِّ بْنِ زَيْدٍ&#8221; (I heard Hushaym narrating one day, and he said: &#8216;Ali bin Zayd informed us, then he mentioned that he did not hear it from &#8216;Ali bin Zayd.) (Tārīkh Ibn Ma&#8217;īn bi Riwāyat al-Dūrī:4921) is not correct. Rather, it indicates Hushaym&#8217;s integrity and honesty that when he uttered &#8220;حَدَّثَنَا&#8221; (he narrated to us) and had not heard that hadith, he immediately clarified that he had not heard this narration. Subḥān Allāh.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Objection:</strong> Imām Ibn Ma&#8217;īn رحمه الله says: &#8220;أَخْطَأَ عَبْدُ الرَّحْمَنِ بْنُ مَهْدِي يَوْمًا فَقَالَ حَدَّثَنَا هُشَيْمٌ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا مَنْصُوْرٌ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ هُشَيْمٌ سَمِعَهُ مِنْ مَنْصُورٍ&#8221; (Abd al-Raḥmān bin Mahdī made a mistake one day and said: Hushaym informed us, who said: Manṣūr informed us while Hushaym had not heard it from Manṣūr) (Tārīkh Ibn Ma&#8217;īn bi Riwāyat al-Dūrī : 3620)</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Removal (of objection): </strong>O esteemed readers! Study the mentioned text carefully, and it will become clear that the mistake is from Imām Abd al-Raḥmān bin Mahdī رحمه الله. Therefore, it is contrary to justice to criticise and discredit Hushaym because of the mistake of Ibn Mahdī رحمه الله and it is absolutely incorrect to reject Hushaym&#8217;s narration where direct explicit hearing is stated based on this.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Conclusion of the research: </strong>The aforementioned narration regarding Surat al-Kahf is authentic and can be acted upon. It is incorrect to declare it weak unrestrictedly and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>[Ḥāfiẓ Nadeem Zaheer حفظه الله, Ustādh al-Ḥadīth in Jāmi&#8217;ah Lahore al-Islāmiyyah and founder of al-Ma&#8217;rifah institute. Taken from one of his pdfs titled &#8220;جمعہ کے دن سورة کہف کی تلاوت؟&#8221;. Also see Nūr al-Ḥadīth 24 p. 11-12]</strong></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from Fatawa &#8216;Ilmiyyah (1/493-497)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Question:</strong> The Tahqiq (research) regarding the following narration is desired: &#8220;The person that recites Surah Ya-Sin every morning will have all the needs of his day fulfilled.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Answer:</strong> This narration is present in the Sunan of Ad-Darimi <em>(2/457 #3421)</em> with the following chain of narration: <strong>&#8220;&#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah (Tabi&#8217;i) said: It has reached me that the Messenger of Allah </strong>ﷺ <strong>said&#8230;&#8221;<em> &#8211; </em></strong>and the author of Mishkat [Al-Masabih] <em>(#2177)</em> narrated it from Ad-Darimi. This narration is weak on account of it being Mursal¹, and the person that informed [&#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah] is unknown. The following Marfu&#8217;² narrations pertaining to the virtues of Surah Ya-Sin are also weak and rejected:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify">
<li style="text-align: left"><strong>&#8220;Verily everything has a heart, and the heart of the Qur&#8217;an is Ya-Sin, and whomsoever recites Ya-Sin, Allah will write for him [the reward of] the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an ten times.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Jami&#8217; At-Tirmidhi #2887 from the Hadith of Qatadah from Anas [may Allah be pleased with him], Tablighi Nisab p.292, Fadha&#8217;il Al-Qur&#8217;an p.58)</em></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam At-Tirmidhi said regarding one of the narrators [of this Hadith], <strong>&#8220;Harun Abu Muhammad is an unknown Shaykh.&#8221; </strong>Due to Harun being unknown, this narration is weak &#8211; Shaykh Al-Albani declared it to be Mawdu&#8217; (Fabricated). <em>(Silsilah Ahadith Ad-Da&#8217;ifa 1/202 #169)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu Hatim Ar-Razi claimed that the narrator of this Hadith [in reality] is Muqatil bin Sulayman, who is a liar <em>(&#8216;Ilal Al-Hadith 2/56 #1652).</em> Whereas in the Sunan of At-Tirmidhi, Sunan of Ad-Darimi (2/456 #3419), and Tarikh Baghdad (4/267), the narrator is Muqatil bin Hayyan, who is truthful &#8211; and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">2. In this same chapter, regarding the [same Hadith] narrated on the authority of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him), Imam At-Tirmidhi wrote, <strong>&#8220;And it is no more authentic than the previous chain of narration, and its chain of narration is weak.&#8221; </strong><em>(Jami&#8217; At-Tirmidhi #2887)</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Al-Albani wrote regarding this Hadith, <strong>&#8220;&#8230;and this Humayd (narrator) is unknown, just as Al-Hafidh said in Al-Taqrib, and I do not know &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Fadhl, the Shaykh of Al-Bazzar.&#8221;</strong><em> </em><em>(Silsilah Ahadith Ad-Da&#8217;ifa 1/204)</em> &#8211; Meaning this narrator Humayd Al-Makki, Mawla of Aal &#8216;Alqamah <em>(Tafsir Ibn Kathir 3/570) </em>is unknown just as Hafidh Ibn Hajr said in Taqrib Al-Tadhib, and that he does not know the teacher of Al-Bazzar: &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Fadhl. It is now understood that this narration is weak on account of two narrators being unknown.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">4. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night will be forgiven in the morning.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Musnad Abi Ya&#8217;la 11/93,94 #4324, and other than him from the path of Hisham bin Ziyad from Al-Hasan [Al-Basri] who said: I heard Abu Hurayrah&#8230;)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration is severely weak, Hisham bin Ziyad is an abandoned narrator. <em>(Al-Taqrib p.364 #7292)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">5. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night, seeking the Face of Allah, he will be forgiven in that night.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan Ad-Darimi #3420, and other than him)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration is weak on account of a disconnection, it is not established that Al-Hasan Al-Basri ever met Abu Hurayrah. Additionally, [Al-Hasan] was a Mudallis, and he is narrating with &#8216;An.³</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">6.  <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night, seeking the Face of Allah, will be forgiven.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Ibn Hibban, Marawid Adh-Dhaman #665, and other than him from Al-Hasan Al-Basri from Jundub)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration if weak on account of a disconnection, Abu Hatim Ar-Razi said, <strong>&#8220;It is not correct that Al-Hasan heard from Jundub.&#8221; </strong><em>(Al-Marasil p. 42)</em>, Also see the previous Hadith.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">7. <strong> &#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night, seeking the Face of Allah (Most High), will be forgiven for what has preceded from his sins, so recite it over your dead.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Bayhaqi in Shu&#8217;b Al-Iman #2458, from the Hadith of Ma&#8217;qil bin Yasar)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This chain of narration is weak on account of an unknown narrator: Abu &#8216;Uthman and his father, who is also unknown. This Hadith is present in a shortened form in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad <em>(5/26,27)</em>, Mustadarak of Al-Hakim <em>(1/565)</em>, Sahih Ibn Hibban <em>(Al-Ihsan 7/269 #2991</em><em>)</em>, Sunan Abi Dawud <em>(#3121)</em> and Sunan Ibn Majah <em>(#1448)</em>, and Imam Ad-Daraqutni declared this Hadith to be weak. It has one weak supporting Hadith in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad <em>(4/105)</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">8.  &#8220;<strong>Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the night will be forgiven in the morning.&#8221; </strong><em>(Hilyat Al-Awliya 4/130 form the Hadith of &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud, may Allah be pleased with him.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is considered fabricated due to the narrator &#8216;Abu Maryam &#8216;Abdul-Ghaffar bin Al-Qasim Al-Kufi&#8217;, who is a liar and a fabricator. <em>(Lisan Al-Mizan 4/50,51)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">9. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin will have the equivalent of twenty Hajj&#8217;s, and whosoever writes it then drinks it will have one thousand certainties and one thousand mercies enter his heart, and will have rancour and disease removed from it.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Hilyat Al-Awliya 7/136 from the Hadith of Al-Harith Al-A&#8217;war from &#8216;Ali)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is severely weak due to Al-Harith Al-A&#8217;war and the Tadlis of Abu Ishaq.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">10. <strong>&#8220;I wish that it were in the heart of every person from my Ummah (meaning Ya-Sin).&#8221;</strong> <em>(Kashf Al-Astar 3/87 #2305 from the Hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbas)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The narrator of this Hadith, Ibrahim bin Al-Hakim bin Aban, is weak. <em>(At-Taqrib #166)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">11. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Surah Ya-Sin whilst he is experiencing the agonies of death, or he is close to it, the Treasurer of Paradise will come to him with a drink from the drinks of Paradise, and he will give it to him to drink whilst he is on his bed, so he will drink it then die, and he will not be in need of a Basin (Hawdh) from the Basins of the Prophets.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Wasit of Al-Wahidi 3/509)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is fabricated &#8211; Yusuf bin &#8216;Atiyyah is an abandoned narrator <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #7872) </em>and Harun bin Kathir is unknown <em>(Lisan Al-Mizan 6/218)</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">12. <strong>&#8220;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin, then it is as if he recited the [entire] Qur&#8217;an ten times.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is Mursal due to Hayyan b. &#8216;Atiyyah.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">13. <strong>&#8220;Surah Ya-Sin is called Al-Muni&#8217;mah in the Torah [&#8230;].&#8221;<em> </em></strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">(</span>Shu&#8217;b Al-Iman of Al-Bayhaqi #2465, Ad-Du&#8217;afa of Al-&#8216;Uqayli 1/347, Tablighi Nisab p.292,293, Fadha&#8217;il Al-Qur&#8217;an p.58, 59)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is Mawdu&#8217; (Fabricated), [the narrator] &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr Al-Jad is abandoned in Hadith, and another narrator is unknown. Imam Bayhaqi said regarding this Hadith, <strong>&#8220;It is rejected.&#8221;<em> </em></strong>Imam Al-&#8216;Uqayli also rejected this narration. This Hadith also comes through a second chain of narration in Tarikh Baghdad and in Al-Mawdu&#8217;at of Ibn Al-Jawzi, the narrator [in this chain], Muhammad bin Abd bin &#8216;Amir As-Samarqandi, is a liar and abandoned.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">14. <strong>&#8220;Verily I have made the recitation of Ya-Sin every night obligatory upon my Ummah, so whomsoever persists upon its recitation every night, then dies, will die the death of a Martyr.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Al-Imam Ash-Shajri 1/118)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This narration is fabricated, not a single one of its narrators is known, for example &#8216;Umar bin Sa&#8217;d Al-Waqas, Abu Hafs bin &#8216;Umar bin Hafs and Abu &#8216;Amir bin Abdur-Rahim. To summarise &#8211; every Marfu&#8217; narration on the virtues of Surah Ya-Sin is weak and rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Imam Ad-Darimi, may Allah have mercy upon him, narrated: <strong>&#8220;&#8216;Amr bin Zurarah narrated to me: &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab narrated to me: Rashid Abu Muhammad Al-Hamani narrated to me from Shahr bin Hawshab who said: &#8216;Ibn Abbas said, &#8216;Whomsoever recites Ya-Sin in the morning will be given an easy day until the evening, and whomsoever recites it in the middle of the night will be given an easy night until the morning.'&#8221; </strong><em>(Sunan Ad-Darimi 1/257 #3422, and its chain is Hasan</em><em>)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">A summarised biography of these narrators is as follows:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>&#8216;Umar bin Zurarah: Trustworthy. <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #5032)</em></li>
<li>&#8216;Abdul-Wahhab Ath-Thaqafi: Trustworthy, used to change (i.e., mix up Hadith) before his death for 3 years, however, this does not harm his Hadiths as he did not narrate Hadith in this period of time. <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #4261)</em></li>
<li>Rashid bin Nujayh Al-Hamani: Truthful and perhaps he made mistakes. <em>(At-Taqrib At-Tadhib #1857) &#8211; </em>He was a Hasan Al-Hadith narrator.</li>
<li>Shahr bin Hawshab: The [Scholars of Hadith] differed on him as a narrator, the majority of the Muhaddithin declared him trustworthy. <em>(As I have researched in my book: Takhrij An-Nihayah fi&#8217;l-Fitan w&#8217;al-Malahim p.119,120) &#8211; </em>Hafidh Ibn Kathir declared one of his narrations to be &#8216;Hasan&#8217;. <em>(Musnad Al-Faruq 1/228) </em>In my research, this narrator is Hasan Al-Hadith.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">The summary of this research is that this chain of narration is Hasan, and Allah surely knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> A Mursal narration is that which is narrated by a Tabi&#8217;i (student of a Sahabi) from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ without mentioning who he had taken it from, Shaykh Zubayr &#8216;Aliza&#8217;i said, <strong>&#8220;The position of the majority of the Scholars of Hadith is that the Mursal narration of a Tabi&#8217;i is rejected.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Fatawa &#8216;Ilmiyyah 2/290)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:] </strong>Hafidh Ibn Kathir wrote regarding Marfu&#8217;, <strong>&#8220;That which is attributed to the Prophet ﷺ, whether it is speech or action&#8230;&#8221; </strong><em>(Ikhtisar &#8216;Ulum Al-Hadith with the annotations of Shaykh Zubayr &#8216;Aliza&#8217;i p.33)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">³ <strong>[TN:]</strong>  <span class="fontstyle0">Tadlis: </span><span class="fontstyle2">Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i wrote, </span><strong><span class="fontstyle0">“If a narrator transmits a narration from his Shaykh (with whom it is established that he met and heard from) using terms such as ‘An </span></strong><span class="fontstyle0">([ </span><span class="fontstyle3">عن </span><span class="fontstyle0">from], this is an ambiguous form of narrating in Arabic which can imply that one </span><span class="fontstyle0">heard it directly or indirectly from someone else)</span><strong><span class="fontstyle0"> while he heard that narration from someone else (other than his Shaykh) – and those whom he narrates this to think that is likely that he heard it from his Shaykh, then this is known as ‘Tadlis’.” </span></strong><span class="fontstyle2">– see the Maqalat of Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i, Volume 1, Page 252. In summary, Tadlis is a hidden weakness in a chain of narration caused by a narrator concealing whom he had actually heard the narration from by using ambiguous terms such as ‘An (عن).</span><span class="fontstyle4"> </span><span class="fontstyle2">Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i explains, </span><strong><span class="fontstyle0">“It is a famous and well-known issue in the Principles of Hadith (i.e., Hadith Sciences) that the narrations of the Mudallis (a narrator that practises Tadlis) that narrates by ‘An ( )</span><span class="fontstyle3">عن</span></strong><span class="fontstyle0"><strong>is rejected and not a proof, meaning it is weak.”</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle2">He further quoted from Imam Ash-Shafi’i who wrote, </span><strong><span class="fontstyle0">“So we say: We do not accept a Hadith from a Mudallis until he says ‘Hadathani (So-and-so narrated to me)’ or ‘Sami’tu (I heard directly, i.e., an explicit term used for transmitting directly)’.” </span></strong><span class="fontstyle2">[Ar-Risalah with the Tahqiq of Ahmad Shakir #1035] – see the Maqalat of Shaykh Zubair ‘Aliza’i, Volume 4, Page 151.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Taken from ‘Fadail As-Sahabah Sahih Riwayat Ki Roshni Mein’  (p.40-43)<br />
Tahqiq and Takhrij by Shaykh Zubair &#8216;Aliza&#8217;i</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Our beloved Noble Prophet ﷺ would invoke Allah, saying, <strong>&#8220;Oh Allah! Honour Islam through whichever of these two men is more beloved to you: Through Abu Jahl, or through &#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khattab.&#8221;</strong> Sayyiduna &#8216;Abdullah ibn &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>&#8220;And the most beloved out of the two was &#8216;Umar.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3681 and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The results of this Prophetic Invocation was that Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin (Chief of the Believers) &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) accepted Islam &#8211; Sayyiduna &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <strong>&#8220;We have not ceased to have honour since &#8216;Umar accepted Islam.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3684)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">What is famous amongst the common-people is that Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) left desiring to kill the Prophet ﷺ, then someone informed him that his sister had accepted Islam, so he went to her home and severely beat her, and thereafter he became a Muslim &#8211; This narration is found in Tabaqat Ibn Sa&#8217;d (3/287-289), Sunan Ad-Daraqutni (1/123 #435), Dala&#8217;il An-Nabuwwah of Al-Bayhaqi (2/219,220), and is present in various other books, however, this chain of narration is weak. A narrator in this chain, by the name of Qasim bin &#8216;Uthman Al-Basri, is considered weak by the majority of the Muhaddithin (scholars of Hadith). Imam Ad-Daraqutni said regarding this narration, &#8220;It is not strong.&#8221; All the narrations in this matter are weak and rejected &#8211; see Sirah Ibn Hisham (1/367-371) and Sirah An-Nabawiyyah of Adh-Dhahabi (p. 172-181).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It has reached us in some narrations that the Prophet ﷺ was praying in the House of Allah, and the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an had an effect on Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar&#8217;s heart upon hearing it, and due to this he accepted Islam. <em>(Musnad Ahmad #107, this narration is weak due to a disconnection)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily in the Nations that preceded you were Muhaddathun (those that receive intuition and insight from Allah), and if there was anyone from amongst them from my nation, then verily it would be &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3469)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Two matters are proven from this Hadith:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar Al-Faruq (may Allah be pleased with him) is a person of great virtue and status.</li>
<li>Noone from the Muslim Nation receives &#8216;Kashf&#8217; or &#8216;Ilham&#8217;.¹</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify">It has reached us in one narration that the Prophet ﷺ said to Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), <strong>&#8220;Verily the Shaytan fears you, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3690, and he [Abu &#8216;Isa At-Tirmidhi] said: &#8216;This is a Hasan Sahih Gharib Hadith&#8217;, its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In another narration, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Indeed I have seen the Shayatin from amongst men and the jinn, and surely they have run from &#8216;Umar.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3691, and he [Abu &#8216;Isa At-Tirmidhi] said: &#8216;This is a Hasan Sahih Gharib Hadith&#8217;, and its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Prophet ﷺ said to &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), <strong>&#8220;O Ibn Al-Khattab! By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, the Shaytan does not meet you travelling on a way except that he takes a way other than yours.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3683, Sahih Muslim #2396, Adhwa&#8217;ul Masabih #6027)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It has reached us in one Hadith that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;Verily Allah has placed the truth upon the tongue and heart of &#8216;Umar!&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Ibn Hibban #2184 and its chain is Sahih)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On some occasions, some verses from the Glorious Qur&#8217;an were revealed in agreement with the saying of Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) &#8211; see Sahih Al-Bukhari (#402, #4483) and Sahih Muslim (#3391).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna &#8216;Uqbah bin &#8216;Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said, <strong>&#8220;If there were to be a prophet after me, it would have been &#8216;Umar.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhi #3686, and he [Abu &#8216;Isa At-Tirmidhi] said: &#8216;This is a Hasan Gharib Hadith.&#8217;, its chain is Hasan)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said on one occasion, <strong>&#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw the people being presented to me while they were wearing shirts, so some of their shirts only reached their chests, and some were beneath that, and &#8216;Umar was presented to me and his shirt was dragging.&#8221;</strong> The people asked him, <strong>&#8220;How have you interpreted it, O Messenger of Allah!?&#8221;</strong> He replied, <strong>&#8220;The Religion.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Meaning Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar holds a higher status than all the people, after Sayyiduna Abu Bakr. <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3691, Sahih Muslim #3390)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Noble Prophet ﷺ saw the Palace of &#8216;Umar in Jannah. (Sahih Al-Bukhari #5226, #7024, Sahih Muslim #2394)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar being from the People of Jannah was attested to on the blessed tongue of the Prophet ﷺ. (Tirmidhi #3747, and its chain is Sahih)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The merits and virtues of Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) are many, and to gather them to present them in front of the reader in a small book is a demanding task &#8211; for more detail, I advise one to read &#8216;Fadhail As-Sahabah&#8217; of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, and &#8216;Fadhail &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab&#8217; of Ibn Al-Jawzi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Finally, we will present the final moments of Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin &#8216;Umar Al-Faruq (may Allah be pleased with him):<br />
The Disbelieving Majusi (Fire-Worshipper) Abu Lu&#8217;lua inflicted a fatal wound on Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar by stabbing him, snatching the barrier between Islam and Fitnah (Trials and Tribulations). Milk was given to &#8216;Umar to drink, which came out of his intestines (indicating the severity of the wound); In this state, a young boy arrived and Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar saw that his Izar (lower garment) was below his ankles, so he said, <strong>&#8220;O my nephew! Raise your garment, for verily it is cleaner for your garment and it is more pious for your Rabb!&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sahih Al-Bukhari #3700)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sayyiduna Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin &#8216;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) named one of his children &#8216;Umar. (Taqrib Al-Tadhib #4951)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SubhanAllah! He did not care for his wounds, rather he spent his final moments worrying about raising the status of the Sunnah³ of the Prophet ﷺ. O Allah! Fill our hearts with love for Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar! O Allah! End the misfortune of those people without &#8216;Iman that hate Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin Shahid &#8216;Umar, and fill their hearts with love! As for those that, thereafter, still hate Sayyiduna &#8216;Umar, then torture and humiliate them in this life and the next.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="text-decoration: underline">وَمَا عَلَيۡنَآ إِلَّا ٱلۡبَلَـٰغُ ٱلۡمُبِينُ</span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center">“And our duty is only to convey plainly (the Message).” [36:17]</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>¹ <strong>[TN:]</strong> What the author (may Allah preserve him) seems to intend here is the false &#8216;Kashf&#8217; of the Sufis, who believe their saints can see into the hearts of others, or are constantly watching over their students, etc. As for the real Karamat of the Awliya, then this is not being negated, as has reached us in authentic narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">² <strong>[TN:]</strong> Abu Lu&#8217;lua was a Magian slave of Al-Mughira bin. Shu&#8217;bah, after applying poison to a two-headed dagger (the common depiction of the Zulfiqar championed by the Rafidha today has its origins in a Persian Majusi dagger), he stabbed &#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khattab as he was leading the Fajr prayer, and stabbed 13 others whilst trying to escape. Once he realised he had been caught, he killed himself. He is now revered as a saint by some from the Rafidha (may Allah destroy them), and there is even a shrine dedicated to him in Iran. What is apparent is that this man wanted to destroy Islam, hence attacking &#8216;Umar instead of Al-Mughira, who he believed was oppressing him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">³ <strong>[TN:] </strong>Al-Miswar entered upon ʿUmar b. Al-Khaṭṭāb after the morning prayer in the night in which he was stabbed, so he woke ʿUmar up, saying: &#8220;The Prayer, The Prayer.&#8221; So ʿUmar replied, &#8220;Yes, and there is no share in Islām for the one that abandons the prayer.&#8221; <strong>So ʿUmar prayed and blood was pouring out from his wound.</strong> <em>(Al-Muwaṭṭa of Imām Mālik, #91 in the rescension of Abu Musʿab Az-Zuhrī, Shaykh Al-Albani said: &#8216;Sahih upon the conditions of the Shaykhayn&#8217; [Irwa&#8217; Al-Ghalil 1/225], Sahih Isnad according to Shu&#8217;ayb Arna&#8217;ut [Takhrij Sharhus Sunnah 330])</em></p>

<p><strong>2. 10 Rewards for reciting one Letter Of The Quraan</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Tirmidhee narrates from Abdullaah ibn Masood (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Whoever recited a letter from the Book of Allaah he gets one reward and each reward is similar to 10 and I do not say Alif Laam Meem is one letter rather alif is a letter laam is a letter and meem is a letter.” (Tirmidhee 8/182 no.3075 Imaam Tirmidhee graded it Hasan Saheeh and Shaikh al-Albaanee graded it Saheeh (Saheeh Sunan Tirmidhee 3/9)</p>

<p>Imaam Muslim transmits from Uqbah ibn Aamir (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who narrates that we were in Sufah and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) came out and said, “Which of you would like to go out every morning to Buthan or al-‘Aqiq and bring two large she-camels without being guilty of sin or without severing the ties of kinship? We said: Messenger of Allah, we would like to do it. Upon this he said: Does not one of you go out in the morning to the mosque and teach or recite two verses from the Book of Allah. the Majestic and Glorious? That is better for him than two she-camels, and three verses are better (than three she-camels). and four verses are better for him than four (she-camels), and to on their number in camels.” (Saheeh Muslim 1/522-523 no.251)</p>
<p><strong>4. The virtues Of The One Who Recites 10 Verses In The Night</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Haakim narrates from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Whoever recites 10 verses of the Quraan in the night he will not be counted amongst the lazy/neglectful ones.” (al-Mustadrak Alas –Saheehain (1/555) Haakim authenticated it on the condition of Muslim, Imaam Dhahabee agreed Talkhees (1/155-156), Shaikh al-Albaanee graded it Saheeh Li–Ghayrihi refer to Saheeh at-Targheeb Wat-Tarheeb (1/169)</p>
<p><strong>5. Reciting 100 Verses In The Night Is As If You Have Recited The Whole Night</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Ahmad narrates from Tameem ad-Daaree (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Whoever recited 100 verses in the night then it is written form him as if he recited the whole night.” (Musnad Ahmad 28/156 no.16958) al-Arnaa’oot and his associates authenticated it.</p>
<p><strong>6 The One Who Recites 1000 verses In the Prayer will have Written for Him To Be The Owner Of Treasures.</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Abu Dawood transmits from Abdullaah ibn Amr ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Whoever prayed and recited 1000 verses will have written form him to be the owner of treasures.” (Sunan Abee Dawood 4/195 no.1395), Shaikh al-Albaanee authenticated refer to Saheeh Sunan Abee Dawood 1/263 and Saheeh at-Targheeb Wat-Tarheeb 1/406)</p>
<p>Allaamah Shams ul-Haqq A’dheemaabadee said, “This means a lot of reward and virtue will be written for him. It has also been said a lofty virtuous reward will be assigned for him.” (A’un al-Ma’bood 4/192)</p>
