				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>Is the Madh-hab of Al-Asha`irah upon Truth or Deviance?</strong></span></p>
<p>3. <em>He mentioned that differences in creed are narrow and that the people who claim that the Madh-hab (School of Jurisprudence) of Al-Asha`irah is false should be asked to refer to the Fatwas of Ibn Taymiyyah and read what Ibn Taymiyyah wrote about ‘Aboo Al-Hasan Al-Ash’aree so that we could perceive how ignorant those people are.</em> (End of quote)</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It should be said that many sects undoubtedly went astray due to the difference in creed, such as Al-Mu`tazilah (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that those who commit major sins are in a state between belief and disbelief), Al-Jahmiyyah (a deviant Islaamic sect denying some Attributes of Allaah, claiming they are ascribed to people and cannot be ascribed to Allaah), Al-Raafidah (a Shee`ah group denying the caliphates of ‘Aboo Bakr Al-Siddeeq and `Umar ibn Al-Khattaab and making accusations against them and many other Companions of the Prophet), Al-Qaadariyyah, and others. Likewise, Al-Asha`irah went astray regarding the issues in which they disagreed with the Qur’aan, the Sunnah, and the eminent scholars of this Ummah and the Imams of guidance, i.e. the Companions (may Allaah be pleased with them), the Taabi`oon (the generation after the Companions and the Prophet) and those who righteously followed them, and the guided Imaams. They (Al-Asha`irah) interpreted Allaah’s Names and Attributes wrongly. However, ‘Aboo Al-Hasan Al-Ash’aree (may Allaah be merciful to him) was not one of Al-Asha`irah, even if they associated themselves with him. He gave up their Madh-hab and embraced the Madh-hab of Ahl-ul-Sunnah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream). Thus, the praise of Imams to him is not praise to the Madh-hab of Al-Asha`irah</p>
<p>Moreover, it is incorrect to charge whoever objects to Al-Asha`irah, regarding what they opposed of the creed of Ahl-ul-Sunnah, with ignorance, since the reality of ignorance is to speak about Allah (Exalted be He) without knowledge. Yet, the one who derives rules from the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah and from the established rules of the Shari`ah, following the path of the Salaf (righteous predecessors), and denouncing those who allegorically interpret the Names and Attributes of Allah in a mistaken way, should not be charged with ignorance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is well known and an established fact, from the time of Ādam Alayhis Salām to the time of Nūh Alayhis Salām for ten generations all the people were upon Tawḥīd, the Millah Waḥidah i.e the one nation i.e the one Dīn of Islām. Then the people became trapped in the deception of shayṭān, and slowly by slowly, they deviated from Tawḥīd and began to commit Shirk. A prophetic ḥadīth as narrated by Ayādh bin Humar Majashī that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said that Allāh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I created all of my servants upon Hunafā i.e clear and pure Dīn of Tawḥīd. Then shayṭān came to them and beguiled them, made them change their Dīn. They made ḥarām what I made ḥalāl for them and he made them equal to me in affairs for which I did not reveal any evidence for.”</em> [Reported in Muslim, Mishkāt al-Masābīḥ [2/460].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This Ḥadtīh Qudsī indicates from the time of Ādam Alayhis Salām, all the people were upon Tawḥīd for a long time, until the time just before the time of Nūh Alayhis Salām. Some people became trapped in the plots of shayṭān and the people deviated from the creed of Tawḥīd and began to associate entities (ie partners) with Allāh (the most high), for which Allāh, the most high, did not legislate any proof or evidence. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Allāh, the Most High, sent his Prophets and Messengers to these people who deviated from Tawḥīd in order to rectify their affairs. When Nūh Alayhis Salām went to these mushriks, he informed them of many issues. From them one such point was:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“I do no say to you that I have treasures from Allāh nor do I have knowledge of the unseen.” [Sūrah Hūd: 31]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This clearly shows that Nūh being a great Messenger of Allāh, the most high, and His Prophet, He did not have any such share in the specific attribute of Allāh i.e knowledge of the unseen. Then, How is it possible that someone other than a Messenger can have such a share in this specific attribute of which only belongs to Allāh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nonetheless, it is a reality that from the beliefs of the mushrikīn is that they believed other than Allāh also had knowledge of the unseen, from this attribute of Allāh. Nūh very clearly advised such people who deviated from Tawḥīd that he did not have knowledge of the unseen and that no Messenger or Prophet was equal to Allāh in this attribute.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When our Prophet Muḥammed ﷺ the final messenger, prophecised that his Ummah will follow in the footsteps of the previous nations, in their misguidance and deviation, then at the same instance, He ﷺ also very clearly informed us that people from his Ummah will also worship idols and commit shirk and kufr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence, Thawbān (RaḍiAllāhu Anhu) narrated that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The hour (of Judgement) will not be established up until tribes (groups of people) from my Ummah do not join the mushrikīn to the extent that tribes from my Ummah will worship idols”</em> [Narrated Abū Dawūd, Tirmidhī, Mishkāt [2/465]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abū Ḥurairah (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) narrated the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“At the time of Jahilīyyah, people from my Ummah will also worship idols before the Day of Judgement”</em> [Agreed Upon, Mishkāt [2/481]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similar such reports have been transmitted from ʿĀishah (RaḍiAllāhu Anha) and other companions via numerous chains. Ziyād bin Lūbaid (RaḍiAllāhu Anhu) narrated that</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Messenger of Allāh </em>ﷺ<em> while mentioning that something of fear will occur, He said it will happen when knowledge will be taken away. So, Ziyād Bin Lūbaid (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) asked How will knowledge be taken away when we read the Qurān and teach our children and so on, and this will remain until the Day of Judgement? He </em>ﷺ<em> replied “I thought of you as a person with most understanding in the city of Madīnah, However, you did not understand my point. You see the Jews and Christians reading the Torah and the Injīl but they do not act upon them, and thus the same thing will happen to my Ummah” </em>[Aḥmad, Ibn Majāh, Ḥākim in mursal form, Tirmidhī from Abū Dawūd, Dārimī from Abu Umamāh, Mirʿāh al-Mafātih Sharḥ Mishkāt al-Masābih 1/362]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Taken from Tashih al-ʿAqā’id)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">JazakāAllāhu Khair to Abū Maryam for his help.</span></p>
