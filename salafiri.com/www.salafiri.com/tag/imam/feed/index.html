				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The dar ut tahqiq website have published a few articles on the proficiency of Imām Abū Ḥanīfah in Ḥadīth, sure they have the prerogative as they are his ardent, muʿtassub and bigoted blind followers. This is a brief response to it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As the readers knows, we are currently publishing Shaikh Irshad ul-Ḥaqq al-Athari’s book ‘Asbāb Ikhtilāf al-Fuqahā’ which is an answer to Shaikh Muḥammad Awwamahs ‘Athar al-Ḥadīth Sharīf.’ Whilst translating this many years ago, at the time I added some detailed notes to the proceeding narration which is what you will be reading insha’Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, this narration will be uploaded again without the notes in the series of the book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Irshād ul-Ḥaqq al-Atharī said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Abū Ḥanīfah’s own statement has been transmitted from him by his student, Imām Abū ʿAbdur Rahmān ʿAbdullāh bin Yazīd Muqrī who said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;I heard Abū Ḥanīfah say the Ahadīth he generally narrates are incorrect.&#8221; [Tārīkh Baghdād [13:402]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, [al-Kāmil [7:2473]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The chain of this statement from the Imām is authentic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Khaṭīb Baghdādī transmitted this statement with the following chain, “I was informed by <strong>Ibn al-Faḍal</strong> who was informed by <strong>Da</strong><strong>ʿ</strong><strong>laj bin Aḥmad</strong> who was informed by <strong>Aḥmad bin </strong><strong>ʿ</strong><strong>Alī al-Ābār</strong> and it was narrated to them by <strong>Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān</strong> and <strong>Ibn Muqrī </strong>narrated to them saying he heard <strong>Abū Ḥanīfah </strong>say&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the narrators are trustworthy and upright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Muqrī is Muḥammad bin ʿAbdullāh bin Yazīd. Hafiẓ Khalīlī said, “Trustworthy with agreement.” [Tahdhīb [9:284], Taqrīb [pg.456]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān is also trustworthy and a preserver, he is also a narrator of Ṣaḥīḥ Bukhārī and Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim [Tahdhīb [10:64], [Sīyar ʿAlām an-Nabulā [12:223]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, [Tadhkirah ul-Ḥuffāz [2:475]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Aḥmad bin ʿAlī al-Ābār is also a trustworthy Imām and a preserver ie Ḥāfiẓ. [Tārīkh Baghdād [4:306], Sīyar [13:443] [Tadhkirah ul-Ḥuffāz [2:639]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dʿalaj bin Aḥmad is a well known trustworthy scholar of Ḥadīth and a jurist. Imām Ḥākim said he was an Imām of the Ahlul Ḥadīth of his time. [Sīyar [16:30]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>, Tārīkh Baghdād [8:387]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>, Tadhkirah ul-Ḥuffāẓ [3:881]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn al-Faḍal is Muḥammad bin al-Ḥussain bin Muḥammad bin al-Faḍal al-Baghdādī al-Qaṭṭān. He is a well known teacher of Imām Baihaqī and Imām Khaṭīb Baghdādī. Imām Dhahabī said that he was trustworthy with agreement. [Siyār [17:331],<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> Tārīkh Baghdād [2:246]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> others. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus, the narrators of this chain are all trustworthy; however, Ibn al-Muqrī hearing from Imām Abū Ḥanīfah is debatable. Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy has transmitted the same statement from ʿAbdullāh bin ʿAbdul ʿAzīz via the chain of Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān from al-Muqrī. In fact Imām Tirmidhī has also transmitted it from Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān and said he heard it from al-Muqrī [al-ʿEllal al-Kabīr [2:966].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What this means is that Maḥmūd bin Ghīlān did not narrate from Ibn al-Muqrī but rather from his father whose name is ʿAbdullāh bin Yazīd al-Muqrī. As for ʿAbdullāh bin Yazīd he is the famous Muhaddith, Imām Bukhārī’s teacher as well as a trustworthy Imām. [Tahdhīb [6:83]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>, Sīyar [10:166]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn ʿAdiyy also transmitted the same statement via Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Saʿīd from Muḥammad bin ʿAbdullāh bin Suleimān from Salamah bin Shabīb from al-Muqrī-and this chain is also Ḥasan. Salamah bin Shabīb al-Nīsābūrī is trustworthy [Tahdhīb [4:146]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> and others. Also note Al-Kāmil mentions Maslamatah which is incorrect and needs to be corrected.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muḥammad bin ʿAbdullāh bin Suleimān is the famous trustworthy scholar of Ḥadīth from Kūfa. [Sīyar [14:41] and others. Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Saʿīd is Ibn ʿUqadah who is a famous Hāfiẓ of Ḥadīth however, some have spoken against him whereas others declared him to be trustworthy. [Sīyar [15:340], Tārīkh Baghdād [5:14], Līsān [1:263]<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> and others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However he is not alone in this narration, nonetheless this narration is authentically established from Imām al-Muqrī and Allah knows best.)</span></p>

<h3 align="center"></h3>
<h4 align="center"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Imaam Should be Followed. If the Imaam Sits Down and Prays Then The Congregation Should Do The Same.</strong></span></h4>
<h4 align="center"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Mentioning the five hadeeth of <i>Abee Bakr Muhammad ibn Muslim ibn Ubaydillah ibn Abdillah ibn Shihaab az-Zuhree</i> from Anas.</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[1]     From Malik from Ibn Shihaab from Anas ibn Malik (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that, <em>“The Messenger of Allah, (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam), fell off his horse when riding, resulting in his right side being scraped. So he did one of the prayers sitting down and we prayed (that same prayer) behind him sitting. When he (finished and came towards us) left, he said, &#8220;The reason why the Imaam is appointed is because he is to be followed. When he prays standing, then you should pray standing, and when he goes into bowing (ruku), then you should go into bowing (ruku), and when he rises (from bowing (ruku)), then you should rise (from bowing (ruku)), and when he says, &#8216;Allah hears whoever praises Him,&#8217; then you should say, &#8216;Our Rabb, praise belongs to You,&#8217; and when he prays sitting, then all of you should pray sitting.&#8221;</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[GRADING] – [SAHIH]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A hadeeth in Saheeh Muslim (77/411) states, <em>“From az-Zuhree who said, “I heard Anas ibn Malik </em><em>(RadhiAllaahu Anhu)</em> <em>saying…”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Maalik is not a mudallis, refer to my book al-Fath ul-Mubeen (1/22 pg.27).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Secondly, there is clarification that Imaam Maalik heard directly from Imaam Zuhree (at-Tamheed (6/132) and its chain is <em>[Hasan]</em> good, al-Awsath of Ibn al-Mundhir (4/188) and its chain is <em>[Saheeh]</em> Authentic)  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[REFERENCES] – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Muwatta (Yahya ibn Yahya’s narration (1/135 hadeeth no.302, book 8, chapter 5, hadeeth 12), at-Tamheed (6/129) and al-Istidhkaar (no.273)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Transmitted by Bukharee (no.689) and Muslim (79/411) from the hadeeth of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADEETH]</span></strong></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is obligatory to pray whilst standing unless there is a valid excuse legislated in the Sharee’ah.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Imam should be followed in the bowing (ruku), prostration (sujood) and in the general actions of the prayer unless there is a clear proof for the difference. For example it is not obligatory for the person who comes late to follow the Imams salutation at the end of the prayer.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) did not have knowledge of the unseen, otherwise why would he have mounted a horse he was destined to fall from?</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) was not the remover of difficulties because if he was, he would never have fallen into difficulty himself by falling of the horse.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is Sunnah to teach the Qur’aan and Sunnah (hadeeth) after the prayer.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Whenever the imam has to sit and pray due to a valid reason then the congregation should also sit and pray. Some scholars consider this hadeeth to be abrogated however other scholars do not. Jabir ibn Abdullah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) is the narrator of the hadeeth which states when the Imaam sits and prays then you should also sit and pray. (Saheeh Muslim (no. 413), Dar us-Salam (numbering) (no.928). Once Jabir (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) sat down and prayed due to an illness and the congregation also sat and prayed behind him. (Mussanaf Ibn Abee Shaybah (4/326 no.7137) and its chain is <em>[Sahih]</em> authentic. Ibn Hajr also authenticated it in Fath ul-Bari (2/176) under hadeeth (no.689). From this we find the claim of abrogation is incorrect. Usayd Ibn Hudhayr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) during his illness led the prayer whilst sitting down and he also instructed the congregation to pray whilst sitting, so they sat and prayed. (al-Awsath of Ibn al-Mundhir (4/206 <em>[Athar]</em> no.2045) and its chain is <em>[Saheeh]</em> authentic. Hafidh Ibn Hajr authenticated it in Fath ul-Bari (2/176).  Abdur Razzaq Ibn Hummam as-Sana’ani said this is what I found the people practising that when the Imaam would sit they would also sit and pray. (Mussanaf Abdur Razzaq (2/463 hadeeth no.4089). According to the opinion of Ahmad bin Hanbal and Ishaaq ibn Rahawaihah if the Imaam sits and leads the prayer then the congregation should also sit and pray behind him. (Masaa’il al-Imaam Ahmad and Ishaaq Ibn Rahawaihah via Ishaaq Ibn Mansur al-Kawsaj (no.348), Sunan at-Tirmidhee (no.361). This is also the opinion of one group from amongst the Ahlul Hadeeth. (al-Eitibaar Fee Bayan an-Nasikh Wal-Mansukh Minal Aathar of al-Hazimi (pg.111).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is established from the hadeeth which mentions the illness whereby the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-sallam) passed away with, that if an Imaam leads the prayer and the people are standing and praying and then the first Imaam comes and prays whilst sitting down then the people will continue to stand and pray. This specific incident does not abrogate the hadeeth of Anas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The precedent opinion is that the Imaam, the congregation and the one praying alone should all say (Allah hears the one who praises him Our Rabb to you is all praise). Muhammad Ibn Sireen’s opinion was that the follower should also say<b> </b>Allah hears the one who praises him. (Mussanaf Ibn Abee Shaybah (1/253 no.2600) Its chain is <em>[Saheeh]</em> Imaam Ibn Sireen’s statement is further endorsed and supported by the narration of Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-sallam) said, “When the Imaam says samiAllaahu Li man Hamdah, the followers should also say SamiAllaahu Li man Hamidah.” (Sunan ad-Daraqutnee (2/339 no.1270) and its chain is Hasan li-Dhatihi i.e. good in itself.)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">This book <em>‘al-ittihaaf ul-Baasim Fee Tahqeeq Muwatta al-Imaam Malik [Talkhees al-Qaabisi] Riwaayah Abdur Rahman bin al-Qaasim’</em> has been presented with an understanding in conjunction with scholastic and benefits of academic research so that this understanding of the Qur’aan and hadeeth opens up the mean and path to research and actions. Wal Hamdullilah.</span></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Matters related to the Sahabah Fatwa no. 1466<span id="more-1220"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Question:</strong></span>  Many Turkish Muslims continually revile Mu`awiyyah and his son Yazid. Are they correct in doing this or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Regarding Mu`awiyyah (may Allah be pleased with him), he was one of the Prophet’s Sahabah (Companions) and one of the scribes who wrote down the Revelation. The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were the best Mu’mins (believers). There are many reported prohibitions against reviling or cursing them. It is authentically reported in the two “Sahih (Books of Authentic Hadith)” that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “The best people are my generation, then those who follow them, and then those who follow them.” It is also authentically reported that he (peace be upon him) said, “Do not curse my Sahabah, because if any of you spent gold equal to (Mount) Uhud (in Allah’s Cause), it would not be equal to a Mud (a dry measure of half bushel, 543 grams) or even a half Mud of one of them.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has been related with a good Sanad (chain of narrators) concerning Mu`awiyyah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “O Allah! Teach him (the knowledge of) the Book, reckoning, and protect him from an evil punishment.” This was mentioned by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As this is known, the basic `Aqidah (creed) of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community) with regard to the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) includes the following:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Firstly: Anyone cursing a Sahaby (Companion) of the Prophet (peace be upon him), whether Mu`awiyyah or another (may Allah be pleased with them), deserves a severe punishment. This is agreed upon by Muslim scholars, but they differ whether they should be killed or receive a less severe penalty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Secondly: The hearts and tongues of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah are free of any hatred towards the Sahabah, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: And those who came after them say: “Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful. Thirdly: Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah believe that some of the Athar (narrations from the Companions) that are reported concerning their shortcomings are</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">lies, others have been exposed to additions, subtractions, and alterations in their texts. The fact is that the Sahabah are excused if these narrations are true, as they were Mujtahids (scholars qualified to exercise juristic effort to infer expert legal rulings), who, if they were correct in their Ijtihad (juristic effort to infer expert legal rulings) will receive two rewards, and if they were wrong they will be rewarded for their Ijtihad and forgiven for their mistakes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah do not believe that the Sahabah were infallible as far as major and minor sins are concerned, rather they were liable to commit sins and will be held accountable for them, but due to their preceding good deeds and virtues they will be forgiven for things that later generations will not. During the Reckoning, some of their sins will be erased in a way that will not happen for those after them. It has been authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that they were the best generation, and that a Mud or half a Mud given in charity by them is better than a mountain of gold given by others, as was explained previously.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If any of the Sahabah committed a sin, they may have performed Tawbah (repentance to Allah) from it, performed good deeds that erased it, and they will be forgiven due to their preceding merits, through the intercession of Muhammad (peace be upon him), as they were the most deserving to receive it, or they may have been inflicted with a disaster in this world that expiated their sins. This is in regard to the sins that they actually committed, so what will be the case when it comes to matters of Ijtihad? If they were correct they will receive two rewards, and if they got it wrong they will be rewarded for their Ijtihad and forgiven for their mistakes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">But the degree of abhorrence that will be felt regarding any of their sins will be minimal next to their virtues and merits, from their belief in Allah and His Messenger, their Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah), their Hijrah (migration) with and support of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and their beneficial knowledge and good deeds. Fourthly: Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah speaks moderately about matters related to the Sahabah;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">they refrain from talking about the disputes that occurred among them, and do not say that one group is infallible and another is sinful, other than in relation to those who made innovations in the religion, such as the Shi`ah (Shi’ites) and Khawarij (separatist group that believes committing a major sin amounts to disbelief). They exceeded the limits in opposite extremes in terms of infallibity and sins. Between them they produced the Bid`ah (innovations in religion) that was cursed by the Salaf (righteous predecessors), and they declared them to be Fasiqs (those flagrantly violating Islamic law) and Kafirs (disbelievers), except for a few, in the same way Khawarij regarded both `Aly and `Uthman as Kafirs and deemed it lawful to fight them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They were the group about which the Prophet said, “In time a group will secede from the Muslims and the group that is nearer to the Truth will kill them.” They were the group that killed `Aly after they had deserted him and declared all those who followed him as Kafirs. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said with regard to Al-Hasan ibn `Aly: “This son of mine is a Sayyid (i.e. a noble) and may Allah make peace between two big groups of Muslims through him.” And indeed, he did reconcile between the followers of `Aly and Mu`awiyyah, which shows that he did what Allah and His Messenger loved, and that the two groups were not like the Khawarij, whom the Messenger of Allah commanded to be fought. This was why `Aly was happy to fight the Khawarij, and was grieved and pained about the Battles of Siffin and Al-Jamal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The two groups have therefore to be freed from the charge of Kufr and Allah should be supplicated to be merciful with their dead, as this matter is agreed upon. All those who belonged to those two groups were Mu’mins (believers) and the Qur’an attests to the fact that those who fought were</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">believers, and it did not take them out of Islam. Allah (Exalted be He) says: And if two parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both. The Hadith that states that if two caliphs fought and one of them is cursed, is false and fabricated, as it is not reported by any of the Hadith scholars. Mu`awiyyah did not claim the caliphate for himself and the Ba`yah (pledge of allegiance) was not made to him when he was fighting against `Aly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He did not fight `Aly because he considered himself to be the rightful caliph or that he thought he deserved to be. Neither he nor his supporters wanted to initiate a fight with `Aly, it was only when `Aly told them to swear allegiance and obedience to him, so there would not be two caliphs, that they refused their obedience. It was then that `Aly had no alternative but to fight them, to force them to obey him and maintain the Muslim community, as Mu`awiyyah and his supporters were saying that this was not obligatory on them until `Uthman’s (may Allah be pleased with him) rights had been taken from those in `Aly’s army who had rebelled and killed him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for Yazid ibn Mu`awiyyah, the people differed concerning him, and they split into three groups, two extreme and one moderate. One of them was that he was one of the Muslim rulers, who did good deeds and bad ones. He was not born until the caliphate of `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him). He was not a Kafir, but it was due to him that the death of Husayn occurred, and what happened to the people of Al-Harrah. He was not a Sahaby, nor was he one of the `Awliya (pious people). This is the view held by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him), the general opinion of most of the intelligent</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and knowledge people, and the view of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah. As for cursing him, people are equally split on this into three groups: One that cursed him, another that loved him, and a third that neither cursed nor loved him. Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him) said, “This is what was reported from Imam Ahmad, his fair-minded followers, and others from the Muslim community.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This moderate opinion is based on the fact that his Fisq (flagrant violation of Islamic law) was not established in a way that makes cursing him permissible, or that the specified Fasiq (one flagrantly violating Islamic law) is not entitled to be cursed, whether due to a prohibition or out of respect. It has been authentically reported in “Sahih Al-Bukhari”, on the authority of `Umar – in the story about `Abdullah ibn Himar, who regularly drank Khamr (intoxicants) and was whipped for it by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) – that when some of the Sahabah cursed him, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Do not curse him, as he loves Allah and His Messenger.” He (peace be upon him) also said, “Cursing a Mu’min is like killing them.” (Agreed upon by Muslim and Al-Bukhari).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These texts, as the other that include warnings are general, such as those concerning consuming orphans’ wealth unlawfully, Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage), and theft, are not to be taken as proof that the person concerned will be one of the dwellers in the Fire, due to the possibility of the absence of binding conditions for a predominating reason. This reason may be due to Tawbah (repentance to Allah), good deeds, expiating circumstances, an accepted intercession, or any other cause for expiation of sins. All the above reasons make it prohibited to curse him, but as for not loving Yazid, because he did not perform the good deeds that necessitate loving him, and accordingly, he was one of the Muslim rulers,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">but loving this type of person is not lawful, because he performed actions that testified to his Fisq and injustice and these are evident from his biography and in the matters related to Husayn and the people of Al-Harrah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>(clink link) <a href="http://www.salafiri.com/raful-al-laaimah-aanil-aimah-lifting-the-blame-from-the-imams-series-part-20-in-defence-of-yazid-ibn-muawiyyah-part-4/"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Shia Paper &#8211; Part 6</strong></span></a></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Rafidhah Shee’ah are famous to promote and boldly attest to their love and affiliation with the Ahlul Bayt.<span id="more-1205"></span> The Madhab of the Rafidhah Shee’ah is established on the essence of the Ahlul Bayt and their love, friendship, hatred and animosity for anyone is based on the Ahlul Bayt, the Ahlul Bayt are their criteri</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is on this basis they hate the companions more so the 3 rightly guided Khulapha (May Allaah be pleased with them), all the Rafidhah Shee’ah from amongst the men, women, teenagers, old and young all hate our companions (May Allaah Guide those who hate our companions. Ameen) because in their narrow bigoted minds they think the companions oppressed the Ahlul Bayt, killed and dishonoured them. These are obviously all lies and fallacies but lying with the Rafidhah Shee’ah has no bounds or limit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However looking whilst looking deeper in to the books of the Rafidhah Shee’ah they show and prove the Rafidhah Shee’ah actually really deep down hate and have enmity for the Ahlul Bayt and this also ties with our opinion that the Rafidhah Shee’ah are the ones who really unjustly killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and the Ahlul Bayt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So from the books of the Rafidhah Shee’ah we have</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If I were to mention a characteristic of the Shee’ah then it is that they just like to talk, if I was to coerce them into a trials or tribulations they would become murtad (ie apostate) and if I wanted to test their sacrifice (ie with their lives) then not even one from amongst a thousand (1000) would be able to fulfil this.”</em> (al-Kaafee, ar-Raudah 8/338)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Oh you wannabe men who imitate men, oh you who have the intelligence of children and oh you, you group of opinionated entertainers, I wish I had never seen you people nor had any acquaintance with you. I swear by Allaah you have afflicted and depressed me, may Allaah destroy and ruin you. You have saddened my heart and filled my chest with sorrow and grief. You have always shown me enmity and always opposed and failed by advice and plans at every instance based on your continuous disobedience and cowardliness. To the extent that people from amongst the Quraish are saying Abee Taalibs son (ie himself ie Alee) is a brave person but he has no experience or expertise in war but in reality there is no goodness in the opinion or plans of such person who is not obeyed.”</em> (Nahj al-Balagha <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.70-71</span>)      </span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) further said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“They are deaf besides having ears, speechless besides having a tongue, blind besides having eyes, they meet people without love and sincerity. They are people who not help other people at times of need, you people abandoned Ibn Abee Taalib (ie himself ie Alee RadhiAllaahu Anhu) in times when he needed their help just as menstruation flesh leaves a woman.”</em> (Nahj al-Balagha <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.132</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people are the very same people who killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), these Koofee Rafidhah Shee’ah who in this current era shift blame from themselves to the so called Yazeedee group, when in reality it is an established fact based on narrations and reports from Shee’ah books that the koofee Rafidhah Shee’ah themselves killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu). What is further interesting ins the people who allege the koofee Rafidhah Shee’ah killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and the Ahlul Bayt are the surviving members of Ahlul Bayt them themselves quoted in the own books of the Rafidhah Shee’ah!!!!!! (Refer to the Part 8)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is also the reason why other Rafidhah Shee’ah authors have elucidated further to this fact and it must be known to the dear reader there is no bigotry or staunchness from our part, we are merely reproducing statements from Rafidhah Shee’ah books and authors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hasan (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I swear by Allaah I find Mu’awiyyah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) much better than these people who attribute themselves to my group (ie Rafidhah Shee’ah), they tried to kill me, confiscated my wealth, It is better that my family are safe that these people kill me and my Ahlul Bayt are spared. I swear by Allaah if I had fought Mu’awiyyah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) these people (ie Rafidhah Shee’ah) would have captured me and wringed my neck, therefore I consider a life of reconciliation much better than being captured deceptively and being killed.”</em> (al-Ehtijaaj 2/10 of Tabarasee Shee’ah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Baaqir (Rahimahullah) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If you people become our Shee’ah (became our group) then one third 1/3 of them would stabs us in the back and another part them would be a group of stupid foolish people.”</em> (Rijaal Kashee <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">pg.79</span>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ja’afar Saadiq (Rahimahullah) said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If there were not three people from amongst you who do not hide what I say then I would not even consider it permissible for them to even hide one thing.”</em> (Usool al-Kaafee 1/396)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All of the above statements show what the members of Ahlul Bayt really thought of these koofee Rafidhah Shee’ah, their morals, their integrity, their disloyalty and their deceptive treacherous nature.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Reciting The Qur’aan Next To A Grave – Clarifying the Position of Imaam Ahmad</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Was Imaam Ahmad Unaware of these Ahadeeth</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(A student of Abdul-Fattah Abu Guddah al-Hanafee, Muhammad Awaamah attempted to discredit Imaam Ahmad by establishing this chapter heading in his book <em>Athar al-Hadeeth</em>, which Shaikh Irshaad ul-Haqq answered)</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Awaamah during this discussion said about Imaam Ahmad that he also did not have knowledge of certain ahadeeth. Imaam Ahmad no doubt was a man however the examples that have been put forward which the Shaikh has mentioned are not correct. He said, Imaam Abu Bakr Khalaal said,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “Said to me Hasan bin Ahmad al-Warraaq, said to him Alee bin Moosaa al-Haddaad that, “I was in a funeral with Imaam Ahmad and Muhammad bin Qudaamah al-Jauharee and when the body of the deceased was buried, a blind man began to recite the Qur’aan next to the grave. Imaam Ahmad said, “Reciting the Qur’aan next to the grave is an innovation.” So when we left the graveyard Muhammad bin Qudaamah said to Imaam Ahmad, ”What do you say concerning Mubasshir al-Halabee?” Imaam Ahmad replied, “He is thiqah (trustworthy)” So Muhammad ibn Qaudaamah said, “Mubasshir narrated via Abdur-Rahmaan bin E’laa bin al-Hajjaaj that his father willed that Soorah Faatihah and the beginning and last part of Soorah al-Baqarah be recited when he be buried. He said he heard this from Umar and he would oftenly ask for this to b also done for him. So upon hearing this Imaam Ahmad said to the man, “Return and recite on the grave of the deceased.” (Kitaabar-Rooh (p.17) Athar al-Hadeeth (p.125)</span></em></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then Muhammad Awaamah further cited narrations concerning this from Ellal al-Mutnaahiyyah (1/428-443) and from Tahdheeb (6/320)</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then</span></p>
<h4 style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span></h4>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the reference from Kitaab ar-Rooh of the statement of Imaam Abu Bakr al-Khalaal and this incident, then its chain is not authentic because the biography of Hasan bin al-Warraaq could not be found after a lengthy search.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Asar Allaamah al-Albaanee haafidhahullaah (the Shaikh Rahimahullah) was alive when this treatise was written) said,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“I could not find his biography in any of the books of narrators I have.” (Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz footnote (p.192)</span></em></p>
<h4 style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Secondly</strong></span></h4>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Contrary to this Imaam Abu Dawood writes,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“I heard from Imaam Ahmad when a questioner asked him concerning the reciting of the Qur’aan next to a grave, he said it should not be recited.” (Masaa’il Imaam Ahmad narrated by Imam Abu Dawood (p.158), Majmoo Fataawa of Ibn Taymiyyah (24/301-307), Masaa’il Ahmad (1/190) narrated by Ibn Haanee and narrated by the son of Imaam Ahmad (Abdullaah) (2/494-495)</span></em></p>
<h4 style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span></h4>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The position of Haafidh Ibn al-Qayyim himself is contrary to this (as the reference for the above incident is cited from his book), he writes,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“This was not the way of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) to gather the people to recite the Qur’aan in order to mourn the deceased, nor whilst next to the grave or at any other place, all of this are prohibited and despicable innovations.” (Zaad al-Ma’aad (1/146)</span></em></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He writes a couple of lines before this,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“When the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) would finish burying a person, he and his companions would stand by the grave and would supplicate for the deceased to be steadfast and he would also command the companions with this. He would not recite (the Qur’aan) whilst sitting next to the grave nor would he instruct the deceased to do so, as the people do nowadays.” (Zaad al-Ma’aad (1/145)</span></em></p>
<h4 style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Fourthly</strong></span></h4>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdur-Rahmaan bin E’laa bin al-Hajjaaj in this chain is unknown. Allaamah Dhahabee said,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“No one other than Bishr bin Ismaa’eel narrated from him.” (Meezaan (2/579)</span></em></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Abee Haatim mentioned him in al-Jarh Wat-Ta’deel but he did not mention any criticism or praise of him. (Imaam Ibn Abee Haatim remaining silent about a narrator in his book al-Jarh Wa-Ta’deel is evidence that he is unknown according to him, see my book Taudheeh al-Kalaam (2/441-442)</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However Ibn Hibbaan has mentioned him in ah-Thiqaat (7/90) but according to the Imaams and scholars of this science his praise alone is not sufficient. This is the reason why Haafidh Ibn Hajr said about him,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“From the seventh level (of narrators), he is accepted.” (Taqreeb (p.208)</span></em></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst explaining the details of the words of praise and criticism in the introduction of his Taqreeb he clarifies the narrator who has less or a small number of narrations and nothing is established from that may cause one to leave his ahadeeth then his hadeeth is accepted, only if he is supported (in his narration) if he is not supported then he will be considered to be weak. In hadeeth</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: inherit;">Therefore as Abdur-Rahmaan has no support, he is weak in hadeeth according to Haafidh Ibn Hajr. Hence when the chain of this incident and the chain of the narration are not authentic then it is not correct to draw such conclusions from this hadeeth. For further details see Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (p.191-193) (of Imaam al-Albaanee)</span></span></p>
