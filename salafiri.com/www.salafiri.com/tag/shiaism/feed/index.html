<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The PDF/E-book was originally translated in published as a PDF document in 2003, it has been edited and republished with some minor changes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The e-Book is a wealth of information on historical facts surrounding the murder of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu). Most of the references are from Shiʿa sources which the Shaikh has presented in great detail.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The e-Book serves as basic primer for those wishing to read an unbiased account of the historical events without the extreme exaggeration of the Rāfiḍah and Barelvīyyah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaikh Abūl-Ḥarīz Mālik ʿAbdul ʿAzīz Munāzīr Multānī</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was born approximately at the turn of the 19<sup>th</sup> century at about 1899 in the eastern part of Multān, a major city of the state of Punjāb, in Pākistān. He was born in a district 7 miles to the east of Multān, in an area known as Khudādwala in a family of farmers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Seeking Knowledge </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He starting seeking knowledge from an early stage, however the environment around was not entirely scholarly. So he moved to the city where he sought knowledge and achieved the studentship of the two famous and well-known scholars teaching there. They were</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Allāmah ʿAbdul-Ḥaq Multānī</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Allāmah ʿAbdul-Tawāb Multānī</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Shaikh al-Allāmah ʿAbdul-Haqq Multānī </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was originally from Dhera Ismāʿīl Khān and a Farānī Afghan, he later moved to Multān. He was from amongst the first people who started to call the people to the Tawhīd of Allāh and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) in that area. Suffice it to say that he was one of the foremost students of al-Allāmah al-Muhaddith al-Muftī Mian Nazīr Ḥussain Muhaddith Dehlawī [1318H), from who he learnt all the different branches of Islām. His rank and position with his teacher was such that he (Mian Nazīr Ḥussain) would have complete trust and reliance in him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When questions would come to Mian Nazīr he would pass them onto Shaikh ʿAbdul-Haqq who would answer them and Main Nazīr would then just add his approval. So when one looks at ‘Fatāwaa Nazīrīyyah’ of Allāmah Nazīr Ḥussain some of the verdicts have the name of ʿAbdul-Haqq next to them. This was his rank. Then another well-known student of al-Allāmah Mian Nazīr Ḥussain, Shaikh al-Allāmah al-Muhaddith Abūl-ʿA’la ʿAbdur Rahman Mubārakpūrī, Sāhib Tuhfatul Ahwaḍī, checked Fatāwa Nazīrīyyah.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Shaikh al-Allāmah ʿAbdul-Tawāb Multānī </strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Born in 1288H, he also learnt aḥadīth from the hadeeth master, al-Allāmah al-Muhaddith al-Muftī Mian Nazīr Ḥussain Muhaddith Dehlawī.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter he gained permission of hadīth from,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ahmad bin ʿAbdur Rahman al-Banna Misrī, the one who put al- Musnad of Imām Ahmad in an order.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Allāmah Muhammad Rāghib at-Ṭabbākh al-Ḥalabī Shāmī (1370H).</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was highly influenced by the works of the two Shaikhain, Shaikh ul-Islām Imām Ibn Taymīyyah and Imām Shams ul-Islām Ibn Qayyīm as well as the works of Imām Ibn Ḥajr al-ʿAsqalānī. He would often re-print their books and give them out free especially ‘ʿA’lām al-Muwaqqʿīn’. He authored many books. He died in 1366H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter the Shaikh travelled to Siyālkot and studied in ‘Jāmia Ibrāhīmīyyah’ where he benefited from Shaikh Muḥammad Ibrāhīm Mīr Siyālkotī. Then when the seeking of knowledge further instilled zealously in him, he travelled to ‘Jāmia Saʿīdīyyah’ in Delhī and learnt from Shaikh al-Allāmah Abū Saʿīd Sharf ud Dīn Dehlawī, the famous student of al-Allāmah Mian Nazīr Ḥussain Muhaddith Dehlawī, where he completed his studies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He spent most of his life as the rector of ‘Dār ul-Ḥadīth Muḥammadīyyah’ in Multān. He spent years teaching the Prophets ḥadīth in this institution as well as delivering the Friday sermon at the Jāmia Masjid. He also travelled and visited other cities where he helped to establish and propagate the dawah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of his most memorable such programs was in the town of Dhera Ghazī Khān, where he, alongside another Shaikh, severely refuted the madhab of the Rāfiḍī’s and the censurable concepts of shirk and innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Debates </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During his life he had many victories whilst debating with Ahlul-Bidʿah on various issues. He was a close companion of Shaikh al-Allāmah  Thanaullāh Amritsārī and both of them would indulge in defending Ahlus-Sunnah equally against the accusations and objections of the people of shirk and innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of his well known debates were with the Shiʿa, one of them was with the Shiʿī Sayyīd Zain al-ʿĀbidīn Shāh and another one with Ismāʿīl ash-Shīʿī, both of whom were severely refuted and their arguments annihilated by the Shaikh, Walillahil-Hamd.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the district of Shāh Ghardaiz in Lucknow (a place known for Shiʿa residency), in the house of Sayyīd Asghar ʿAlī Shāh, Sayyīd Zain al-ʿĀbidīn in the presence of other Shiʿa’s debated with the Shaikh on different issues between Ahlus-Sunnah and the Shiʿa’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was so knowledgeable about the Shiʿa madhab that he (his) opponent began to sweat as the expertise of the Shaikh was such that all his arguments were based and referenced from the books of the Shiʿa’s themselves. The Shaikh would always return victorious.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also debated with the famous Ḥanafī Mullah, Mawlāna Khair Muḥammad Jalandharī and it has been narrated that after the debate the Ḥanafī Mawlāna did not know his way back home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>His Works </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The main areas of writing and research of the Shaikh were shīʿism and the refutation of Taqlīd hence most of his works revolve around this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In refutation of the Shiʿa he wrote,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Decisive Word On Who Murdered Ḥussain.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Decisive Word On the Marriage of Umm Kulthūm (bint ʿAlī to Umar al-Khattāb).</span></li>

</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the Ḥanafīs he wrote,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And many more&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would work on his farm in the early mornings preparing the produce and generally carrying out the daily duties associated with running and maintaining a farm with the help of his children. Later during the morning he would teach the student Aqāʿid, aḥadīth, fiqh, usūl al-Fiqh in the institution and he would continue this until the end of the day. In the evening he would retire to his home and engage in seeking knowledge and research. He never took any money for teaching or for delivering sermons and lectures during his whole life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the end of his life he left Dār ul-Ḥadīth Muhammadīyah and approximately 2-3 years after he died due to asthma. He died in the first week of July in 1969 /1389H</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Completed 2003</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise be to Allāh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">O people of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamāʿah let it be clearly known that from the trials and tribulations against Islām is the tribulation of Rafḍ or the Rāfiḍī’s (Shiʿa). This shīʿism is open and in front of the people in the garb of taqīyyah and in opposition to Ahlus-Sunnah they are constantly engaged in attempting to destroy them. The Shiʿa have just one statement on their tongues that they love the people of the household of the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) (Ahlul-Bayt)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it was necessary to defend Ahlus-Sunnah against the claims of love by Shiʿa for Ahlul-Bayt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also clear with Ahlus-Sunnah the words ‘Love for Ahlul-Bayt’ are not only of value but infact are part of our faith and belief. However within the Shiʿa sect these words mean nothing except enmity and hatred for Ahlul-Bayt. The Shiʿa are very famous for fooling the people with little knowledge that the murderers of Ḥussain (raḍi-Allāhu ʿAnhu) were Sunni’s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, when the Shiʿa books are looked at then our amazement and astonishment go beyond bounds and limits as to the reality therein which indicates the falsity of their claim for their love for Ahlul-Bayt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this is something one should pay attention to as most of the general Shiʿa public are unaware of their books of ḥadīth. Their scholars hide and conceal this information from the public and the general people so that they do not become aware and familiar with the realities and therefore uncover their secrets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They propagate the Sunni’s were the murderers of Ḥussain (raḍi-Allāhu ʿAnhu) however, the books of the Shiʿas contain manifest evidences and clarify the real murderers of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) were pure Shiʿa. Who after the period of ʿAlī (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) joined alliances and co-operated with ‘Abdullāh bin Saba the jew, and they formerly joined the Shiʿa sect. Therefore the Shiʿa scholars like Mullah Baaqir Majlasee writes in his classical book ‘Jalā al-ʿAyūn’,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When the people of Kūfah found out Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) had moved and was residing in Makkah, the Shiʿas gathered in the house of Suleimān bin Sardkhazāʿī in kūfah and they discussed the issue of Muʿawīyyah (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and the pledge of allegiance to Yazīd. Suleimān said, “Imām Ḥussain denied the pledge of allegiance to Yazīd and went to Makkah and you people are his Shiʿa (sect/party) as well as for his relatives. If you want victory for them, then invite them to Kūfah. The Shiʿa said, ‘when he comes and lighten this city of Kūfah then all of us will give him our pledge of allegiance.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is very clear from this quote the Shiʿas were not only the Shiʿa of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) but also the Shiʿa of ʿAlī (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) as they claimed love for him, as the Shiʿa of today claim. These deceptive and traitorous Shiʿa wrote many letters to the Imām they oppressed, i.e. Imām Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and called him to Kūfah, to the extent that he received 12,000 letters from them. Mullah Bāqir Majlisī writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“So when these Shiʿa formulated a strategy they wrote numerous messages to Ḥussain and 12,000 letters were sent to him. He wrote an answer back to the last letter.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The final letter that was sent to him said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“From all the Shiʿa believers and Muslims of the people of Kūfah to Imām Ḥussain bin ʿAlī bin Abī Tālib. It is clear and apparent we do not have an Imām at this moment in time so pay heed and attention to us and come to our city of Kūfah. We are all obedient to you and are your followers. The governor of Kūfah Nuʿmān bin Bashīr is a very disgraced and humiliated person who is sitting at his government house. We do not pray the Friday or Eid prayer behind him.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><strong>[3]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The quote shows how extreme these Shiʿa were in that they did not pray behind others, this is the same situation with the Shiʿa today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When the requests of the Shiʿa exceeded limits Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) sent Imām Muslim bin ʿAqīl to Kūfah where 12,000 Kūfī Shiʿa gave him the pledge of allegiance. Hence Imām Muslim bin ʿAqīl wrote a letter to Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and said the people Kūfah are with you with their hearts, so please come to Kūfah.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter what the Shiʿa did with Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) is recorded in their books. When Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) went to Kūfah the Shiʿas made their deceptiveness, treachery and evil open and clear, the 12,000 letters they had written were shown to them but these tyrant Shiʿa denied them. So upon this Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Our Shiʿa have denied everything and hence our victory.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><strong>[5]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These tyrant and oppressive Shiʿas disgraced and shamed Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and destroyed his victory. When Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) saw the reality of the Shiʿa he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“May Allaah’s curse be upon you and your intentions you tyrant, disloyal and traitor Shiʿa you have carved my chest with a dagger.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><strong>[6]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mullah Bāqir Majlisī continued and said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“In the end it was these disloyal Shiʿa who martyred Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu).”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><strong>[7]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We do not need other references to establish the murderers of Ḥussain were these Kūfī Shiʿa however for the satisfaction of the Shiʿa another reference is quoted. Allāmah Qaḍī Saushastarī Shīʿī writes in ‘Majālis al-Muʿminīn’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There is no need to establish evidence the murderers of Imām Ḥussain were Kūfī Shiʿa (as this was the case) and as for the claim they were Sunni, it is against the reality and requires evidence even though Abū Ḥanīfah was a Kūfī.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><strong>[8]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This quote is very clear that the killers of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) were Shiʿas and these Shiʿas not only expressed their disloyalty, deceptiveness, treachery and their corruptive beliefs with regards to Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) but also with regards to [his father] ʿAlī (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and his brother Hasan (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) as well as with other people of Ahlul-Bayt.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mullā Bāqir Majlisī writes that Hasan (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I swear by Allaah instead of these Shiʿa, Muʿawīyyah is better for me as these Shiʿa just claim they are my Shiʿa when really they intended to kill me and loot my wealth.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also mentioned in Sīyar al-Aiʿmah and Kashf al-Ghummah that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Shiʿa betrayed Hasan (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and proved to be disloyal to him. They eventually rebelled against him and stole all his wealth and money to the extent that these Shiʿa forcefully pulled and stole the prayer mat Hasan (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) was praying on.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><strong>[11]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similar events are mentioned in the Sunni books. The Shiʿa who invited Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) to Kūfah were also the ones who in fact killed him. When Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) saw their treachery he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I did not come to Kūfah without being asked to come. I received numerous letters from you stating you had no Imām and you asked me to come. So it was obligatory upon you to stick to your promise and to obey me, but you broke your promise and your pledge of allegiance to me. This is not something strange or new to us as you people proved disloyal and treacherous to my father (ʿAlī (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and my brother (Ḥasan (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and my first cousin Muslim bin ʿAqīl. If you did not wish for me to come then I will return back to where I came from.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><strong>[12]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author of the book titled ‘Khulāsatul Masā’ib’ Shīʿī said that Imām Ḥussain said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“My Shiʿa have disgraced me.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><strong>[13]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the same book it says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The killers of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) were all Kūfī and no one from amongst them was a Shāmī (Syrian) or a Hijāzī (From Makkah or Madīnah).”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><strong>[14]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This enmity of the Shiʿas had already started since they had martyred Muslim bin ʿAqīl and ‘Abdullāh bin Bitaqar. The Shiʿa were on their way to stop Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) due to which Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) had to change his direction from Kūfah to Karbala.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have proven from the books of the Shiʿa which they consider to be reliable that the murderers of Ḥussain were pure Shiʿa. This therefore also proves their false claim of loving Ahlul-Bayt, which is in reality nothing but enmity and hatred for them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I think it is also important to inform Ahlus-Sunnah that the Shiʿa say they benefited from the murder of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and due to this all the sins of the Shiʿa have been forgiven. They claim that since in the dream when Ibrāhīm (‘alaihis salaam) had to slaughter Ismāʿīl (‘alaihis salaam), it was stopped therefore the murdering of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) was a correct interpretation of that dream and for this they use a verse of the Qurān. In this regard Mawlāna Awlād Haidar Shīʿī authored a book titled ‘Dhab al-Aẓīm’ in which he explained in detail this interpretation by the Shiʿa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will therefore ask the Shiʿa with all due respect, what is the difference between your beliefs that all your sins are forgiven due to the martyrdom of Ḥussain and the Christians’ claim that all their sins have also been forgiven? So we say there is no difference and that their is full unity and agreement, and why should there not be because the foundation of the Shiʿa religion was laid by the jews and christians. Then how can there be any differences in the final result.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reality is that the Shiʿa killed Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and now they want to acquire the reward for it by lamenting and wailing. They also claim the companions of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) became disbelievers. Qaḍī Saushastarī Shīʿī narrates,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is narrated from Imām Zain al-ʿĀbidīn that he said, “After the death of Ḥussain everyone except 5 of his companions became disbelievers. Abū Khālid, Yaḥya bin Aām Tawīl, Jubair bin Mutīʿa, Jābir bin ʿAbdullāh Anṣārī.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><strong>[15]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to the Shiʿa these 5 were also in the cloak of taqīyyah who after some days also became disbelievers and during the time of Imām Jʿafar there were not even 3 Shiʿa who were believers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">‘Usūl al-Kāfī’ mentions that Imām Jʿafar said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I swear by Allāh if I find 3 Shiʿa believers from amongst you who will conceal what I say then I would not hide my ḥadīth from them.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Mūsaa Kāẓim said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“There was only one believer who was ʿAbdullāh bin Yʿafūr.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><strong>[16]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shows according to the Shiʿa themselves they were full of heresy and disbelief and in the highly regarded Shiʿa book, Usūl al-Kāfī Imām Muḥammad Bāqir said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Allāh established 70 years for the Mahdī to appear but when the Shiʿa murdered Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) Allāh was angry with the people of the earth and therefore he increased Mahdī’s time to 140 years.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><strong>[17]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another narration it states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The anger of Allāh descended upon the Shiʿa.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><strong>[18]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this second narration explains the first one, which clarifies that the phrase ‘people of the earth’ refers to the Shiʿa. The Shiʿa were and are such great criminals that Allāh limited and specified curses upon them. Another narration in ‘Usūl al-Kāfī’ that Allāh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When I am angry with someone I declare my curse upon them and my curse stays with the all the generation and family of that person.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><strong>[19]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then what doubt can we have in their hypocrisy and heresy. Hence finally Imām Mūsa Kāẓim issued a verdict the Shiʿa were hypocrites and disbelievers. He said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If I was to separate and divide my Shiʿa then I will not find anyone except a category of those who claim they are Shiʿa only and if I examined them then I will not find any Shiʿa except that all of them will be infidel disbelievers.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><strong>[20]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shiʿa destroy their faith and religion by declaring the rightly guided Khaliphs and the Companions to be hypocrites, as well as cursing them. The Shiʿa authors, by writing the truth, declared the Shiʿa themselves to be infidels and disbelievers and the ones who will inherit the curse of Allāh upon themselves and their families for the rest of their lives.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Unlawfulness of Lamenting and Mourning</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shiʿa in order to cover their crime for murdering Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) inverted the narrations of Islām and declared the 10th of Muharram to be a month and time for seeking intercession, blessings and it being a pillar of Faith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This included wearing black clothes with black collars, beating their chests and at the same time abusing and cursing the companions of the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) as a means of seeking reward and earning salvation. Such actions are impermissible with the Sunnis however the books of the Shiʿa also contain similar verdicts that state such actions are unlawful. So in this regard we will mention some Shiʿa narrations.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">It is narrated from Imām Jʿafar Sādiq that the Messenger of Allāh (sal- Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said, <em>“A Muslim beating his thighs at a time of difficulty is synonymous to wasting his deeds.”</em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This narration mentions a Muslim to be a condition however the religion of the Shiʿa is already in danger.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Muḥammad Bāqir said, <em>“Whoever hit themselves, by slapping their faces and chests and pulling their hair then he has left patience and adopted a way other than Islām and he is despicable. Allāh causes his good deeds to be wasted and whoever cried loudly is impatient which contradicts patience and this is unlawful”.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said to Fātimah (radi- Allaahu ‘anhu), <em>“When I die do not cry over me, or pull your hair, or lament or mourn over me.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><strong>[21]</strong></a></em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said at a time of difficulty do not hit your cheeks nor your faces, do not pull your hair, do not rip your clothes nor wear black clothes or lament and mourn.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Jʿafar Sādiq was asked, <em>“Can women wear black clothes and pray.” He replied, “No, because black is the colour of the clothes of the people of hellfire.” He also said, “Alee said the Messenger of Allāh said to his companions do not wear black clothes as it is the dress of Fir’aun.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><strong>[23]</strong></a></em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note From this narration we find according to the Shiʿa religion it is absolutely unlawful whether at a time of happiness or sadness. So whoever wears black clothes their either he is a Fir’aunī or a person from the hellfire.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Muḥammad Bāqir said, <em>“Whoever made an imitation of a grave or copied anything else then he leaves the fold of Islaam.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><strong>[24]</strong></a></em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Jʿafar Sādiq said, <em>“Crying on the deceased with a loud voice and ripping ones clothes is not permissible.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"><strong>[25]</strong></a></em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Bāqir said, <em>“When the son of the Messenger of Allāh, Ṭāhir, died he prohibited Khadījah from crying.”</em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Alee (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) said, <em>“Whoever at a time of difficulty hit his thighs then his deeds will be wasted.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"><strong>[26]</strong></a></em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These narration’s prove that all that the Shiʿa do in the month of Muharram like beating oneself, hitting ones cheeks and face, wounding oneself, wearing black clothes, being in a state of mourning, lamenting and wailing, making grave imitations of the grave of Ḥussain (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) to lament over and all other actions the Shiʿa do, are all prohibited and unlawful actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If all this was permissible and allowed, then the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) would have done this for the martyrs of the battle of Uhud, yet he did not put a black shroud over his uncle Hamzah’s body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the great treachery of the Shiʿa Imām Zain al-ʿĀbidīn did not establish gatherings for mourning every year. Nor did he make images of the women of the Ahlul-Bayt as the Shiʿa do today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The reality of these issues is that Allāh or his Messenger (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) didn’t order establishing such gatherings. However the Shiʿas in order to cover up their deceit, mourn for their despicable mistake and with this send curses upon Yazeed trying to lift the blame from themselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, what is ironic here is that according to the Shiʿas it was Yazīd who himself aided this custom of lamenting and mourning. Hence the reliable Shiʿa book, Jalā al-ʿA’yūn mentions Yazīd gave Ahlul Bayt a house and asked them to wear black clothes and to lament for 7 days.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This then proves the person who first started this innovation was Yazīd (according to the Shiʿa) and that the Shiʿa followed him in this custom. So on one hand they curse him and on the other hand they follow his innovated customs. This is indeed strange.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This custom was really introduced by Maʿaz ad-Daulah ash-Shīʿī who on the 10th of Muharram in 352H ordered the people to close their shops, all trading to cease and that the people should grieve, everyone to wear black clothes, women to rip their clothes in public and walk the streets whilst lamenting and wailing.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We find the Shiʿas of this time are following their predecessors foot by foot and earning the wrath and anger of Allāh upon themselves. Similarly according to their own words they ended up declaring their own Shiʿa to be heretical infidels and thereby rightfully earning Allāh punishment.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Virtue of Abū Bakr as-Siddīq According To A Shiʿa Narration.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is narrated by Jʿafar Sādiq,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) was in the cave with Abu Bakr, he said to him, “I can see Jʿafar and his companions on a ship in the middle of the sea and I can see the Anṣār in their houses in Madīnah.” Abu Bakr asked, “O Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) can you see them?” He replied, “Yes I can see them.” Abū Bakr (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) then asked, “Can I also see them.” So the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) wiped his hands over Abu Bakr’s face and then he could also see everything. Upon this the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said to him, “You will always be my friend (Siddīq)”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"><strong>[29]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From this narration of the Shiʿa it is clear that Abū Bakr as-Siddīq the First Khalīph was the most virtuous from all the companions as his title as-Siddīq is from those who seek closeness to Allāh, as Allāh said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“And who so obeys Allāh and His Messenger then they will be in the company of those on whom Allāh has bestowed his grave, of the prophets, the Siddīqīn (Those who were the first and foremost to believe in the Messenger of Allāh)&#8230;.” <a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><strong>[30]</strong></a>           </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hence when the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said to Abu Bakr he was his Siddīq, then this station is of a great stature with Allāh.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Virtue of ‘Umar bin al-Khattāb According To a Shiʿa Narration.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a long sermon of ʿAlī in ‘Nahj ul-Balāghah’. When it was the time for Jihād against the Persians ‘Umar (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) intended to go himself in the battlefield so he sought the counsel of ʿAlī. ʿAlī advised him not to go and said to him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“O ‘Umar you are the peg of the Arabs. If you leave this land of Madīnah then the Arab lands will be destroyed from all directions and tomorrow if the non-Arabs look at you they will most certainly say you are one of the pillar of the foundation of the Arabs, please do not leave.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"><strong>[31]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This statement shows how much respect ʿAlī (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) had for ‘Umar (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) and how much revered him. It also shows the great unity between the two Khaliphs, and that ʿAlī considered ‘Umar’s (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) Khaliphate to be his Khaliphate.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Virtue of ‘Uthmān bin ʿAffān According To A Shiʿa Narration.</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a statement of ʿAlī (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) in praise of Uthmān (radi- Allaahu ‘anhu) in Nahj ul-Balāghah which is decisive of the virtue of ‘Uthmān (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu). It is,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“ʿAlī then went to ‘Uthmān and said to him, “People are hounding and hassling me and they have made me a messenger between themselves and you. But by Allāh I do not know what to say to you, I do not know anything which you do not know and nor can I represent you in anything. I do not precede you in anything except that you know it and we have nothing from seclusion that we can convey to you. You saw what we saw and you heard what we heard. You accompanied the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) and so did we. You are the same as Abū Bakr and Umar (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhuma) in acting and in following the truth. You acquired the virtue of being the son in law of the Messenger (sal-Allāhu ‘alayhe wa sallam) which Abū Bakr and Umar (Raḍi Allāhu ʿAnhuma) did not have.&#8221;<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"><strong>[32]</strong></a></em></span></p>

Then in 18thDhul-Hijjah Ma’az ad-Daulah announced to the people to make Eīd and he named the Eīd ‘Eīd Khum Ghadīr’ and the drums were beaten and it was a joyous occasion. The reason why he kept the date of 18<sup>th</sup> Dhul-Hijjah was because it was the date of the martyrdom of Uthmaan (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu). Nowadays the Shīʿa consider Eīd Khum Ghadīr to be more virtuous then Eīd ul-Adha. Then in the beginning of 352H Ma’az ad-Daulah ash-Shīʿī ordered the people to close their shops’ all trading to cease and the people should grieve, everyone to wear black clothes, women to rip their clothes in public and walk the streets whilst lamenting and wailing. The shīʿa rejoiced at this is as it was a shīʿā government. [‘The Month of Muharram And The Present Day Muslims. [pg.18-20]</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<iframe width="800" height="750" src="https://www.salafiri.com/wp-content/plugins/pdf-viewer-for-wordpress/web/viewer-shortcode.php?file=http://www.salafiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Shiasm-Soofism-Allamah-Ehsan-Ilahi-Zaheer.pdf&download=true&print=true&fullscreen=true&share=true&zoom=true&open=true&logo=true&pagenav=true&find=true#locale=en-US&page=&zoom=auto"></iframe>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shiaism is essentially rooted from Judaism and the founder of shiaism was a Jew who set its foundation. He fabricated its principles and formulated its rules. The founder of shiaism was abdullah ibn saba<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> who pretended to be a Muslim but in reality he veiled himself behind Islaam and deceptively deceived the Muslims via his taqiyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During the reign of the third Khaleeph, Uthmaan Ibn Affaan (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) abdullah Ibn saba came to Madeenah from Yemen with the sole intention of destroying the pillars of Islaam. He was one of the first individuals to cause dissension and discord amongst the Muslims and he did so by fuelling animosity and hatred amongst them. He was also the first person who hurled abuse and cursed the Muslims. He was really a Jew and pretended to be a Muslim and ended up joining the companions of Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) as his sympathiser. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to Judaism, (Joshua) Yu’sha bin Noon was the viceroy of Moosaa (Alayhis Sallam) similarly abdullah Ibn sabaa proclaimed that Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) was the representative of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) as per the teachings of Judaism. He was also the first person to announce the obligation in believing in the imaamate (leadership) of Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He cursed and abused the enemies of Alee (RadhiAllahu Anhu) and declared them to be disbelievers. It is on this basis the critiques of the Shia religion overwhelming and openly say Shiaism and the raafidhah are from Judaism. (Rijaal al-Kashee pg.101), Tanqeeh al-Maqaal 2/184, Firq ash-Shia pg.43-44, al-Maqalat Wal-Firq pg.21 of Qumi, Rijal at-Tusi pg.51, Tuhfatul Ahbab pg.184, Nasikh at-Tawaarikh 3/393, Kita bar-Rijal pg.469 of Hala, Minhaj al-Maqal pg.303, Sharh Ibn Abi Hadid 2/309 and like this in many other books of the shia)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Under the leadership of abdullah Ibn saba many Jews from various lands came under his wing and he formed an army. He thought he could not openly wage war against the Muslims and destroy their might so therefore he entered the rank of the Muslims under the garbe of Islaam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He introduced concepts of Judaism, fireworship and Christianity into Islaam thereby making his intentions manifest, ie to avenge, show his animosity and hatred for Islaam. He introduced such beliefs that were not known to the Muslims before, for example he introduced the belief of Hulool (ie incarnation) Allaah incarnates himself into humans. He also claimed the existence of prophethood after the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was also the person who introduced the following beliefs and concepts into Islaam ie revelations came to Imaams, the coming of angels to the Imaams, the Imaams being infallible, the coming of an Imaam in every era, the beliefs of Wilaayah ie the mastership of Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) over and above others in the Ummah after the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also introduced the belief that the Imaam will be in hiding, making figurative explanations, the distinction of two types of knowledge ie outer and inner, the distinction of two groups of people one particular and specific and the other the general masses. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also introduced the concept of the Sharee&#8217;ah being abrogated and the abolishment of Islamic teachings. Whereas in reality none of these concepts had any connection whatsoever with Islaam, so via these false beliefs and concepts he set the seed of doubts and distrust in Islaam all with the intent to destroy Islaam and its teachings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After abdullah Ibn saba the shias pushed his efforts forward and further expounded on his concepts. Therefore the achievements of the Shia cannot be overlooked in this regard as they really worked hard at this. So first they martyred the son in law of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam), Uthmaan Ibn Affaan (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) which led to many differences and discords amongst the Muslims. This was the main intent of the Shias and so in this way many groups and sects emerged which were unheard of before. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this period of unrest and discord these sects prospered and grew so much so that the Muslims forgot the sources of the religion ie the Quraan and Sunnah. The aim of abdullah Ibn saba and his followers was to cause dissension and fighting amongst the Muslims. The discord they caused was of two types one was in terms of ideology and the other of was of hierarchical nature.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So the Muslims began killing each other due to the hierarchical disputes and due to the ideology discord the Muslims abandoned the teachings of Islaam. They forgot the teachings and advice of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and began to overlook the rulings of the book of Allaah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During this period of mass discord, differences and dissension a new methodology was born ie tasawwuf or Soofism. Everyone who looks into the history of Soofism can very easily understand that Soofism began when the animosity and hatred of the judai shias was in full force against Islaam. Judaism gave birth too many groups and sects through Shiaism and whilst looking deep into these various groups and sects it becomes very clear that all of these sects are based on Shiaism.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the same situation with Soofism. The first three people in Islamic history who became famous or well known with Soofism were all Shias or at least 2 of them or they were accused of being shia and they were residing in such a place which was known and considered to be the base of Shiaism, which was koofah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From these individual was Abu Haashim al-Koofee who we have spoken about previously. He was from amongst the famous Shias of koofah and in actual fact it has been said about him that he was a zindeeq ie a heretic and atheist. (Taraiq al-Haqaiq 1/101 of al-Haj Masoom Ali)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>JAABIR BIN HAYYAAN</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The second individual was Jaabir bin Hayaan, the well known orientalist (Louis) Massignon said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was the first person in history who became famous with the title of Soofism. His name became well known in the second half of the 8 century of Christianity. He was an alchemist (Alchemy was a quasi-science that centered on the inherent powers of the four elements) and a famous Shia of koofah and he had a special status in Zuhd.&#8221; </em>(Da’iratul Ma’arif al-Islaamiyyah Vol.6 pg.419 (urdu) als Tasawuf of Massignon pg.26, Arabic trans)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nicholson said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Jaabir bin Hayaan was a famous alchemist who was famously known as Jaabir Soofee. He also like Dhunnoon Misree claimed to have knowledge of the secrets or hidden/inner knowledge and in Soofism he has a special place.&#8221; </em>(at-Tasawwuf al-Islami Wat-Tarikh pg.11, translated by Dr. Abi A’la al-Afifi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous orientalists of Czechoslovakia, P. Kraus and M Plessner wrote,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Jaabir bin Hayaan was an extremist Shia from the Karamattah and Ismaa&#8217;eeliyyah sect. He was like the Nusayriyyah such as Muhammad bin Salman. He alongside the other extremist Nusayriyyah (shias) believed in the reincarnation of the souls.&#8221;</em> (Da’iratul Ma’arif al-Islaamiyyah Vol.7 pg.6 (urdu), the notes of P. Kraus and M Plessner)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both orientalist cite from Jaabir bin Hayaan who himself said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I gained all the sciences from Ja&#8217;afar Saadiq who was a mountain of wisdom, I am just a conveyor of those sciences whereas he (ie Ja’afar Saadiq) was the founder and compiler.&#8221;</em> (Da’iratul Ma’arif al-Islaamiyyah Vol.7 pg.6)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly the British (orientalist) Holmyard has also cited the same with regards to Jaabir bin Hayaan and he has also published many of his books. (Refer to the Introduction of the book, <em>‘Kitaab ar-Rahmah,’ ‘al-Manshoor’</em> of Holmyard Kitaab al-Bayaan and others.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shias elevate Jaabir bin Hayaan from amongst their people. Sayyid Mohsin Ameen who was a famous Shia writes concerning notable Shias in his book <em>‘A&#8217;yaan ush-Shia’</em> and he spread the biographical note of Jaabir over more than 30 pages,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Abu Abdullaah and according to others Abu Moosaa Jaabir bin Hayaan bin Abdullaah at-Tartoosee al-Koofee who was famous with the title of soofee. He was a well known homeopath, a mathematician, a philosopher, expert in astrology, doctor, a rhetoric and the author of many books in these and other sciences. He was into Zuhd and an admonisher, he was from the companions of Imaam Ja&#8217;afar Saadiq and from the noteworthy Shias. His works and treatise number so many that the human mind is amazed. It is said he authored over 3,900 books on different sciences such as logical and philosophy. Where he was noted as a philosopher, doctor and author he was also a Zahid (abstained from the worldly things) and admonisher.&#8221;</em> (A’ayaan ash-Shia vol.15 pg.87-88, of Mohsin al-Ameen Shia, Dar at-Ta’araf, Printed Beirut)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then Sayyid Mohsin goes onto mention the names of numerous Shia authors who noted Jaabir bin Hayaan to be from amongst the Shia leaders in their books on rijaals, they also noted him to be from amongst the students of Ja&#8217;afar bin Baaqir. He writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Many affairs are established concerning him, from them that he was a Shia, second that he was a famous alchemist, a Soofee, a philosopher and that he was also the student of Imaam Saadiq. His fame was widespread with the famous scholars (of the shia) as well as his books.&#8221;</em> (A’ayaan ash-Shia vol.15 p.102)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After this Mohsin Amin established a chapter heading, <strong>&#8220;(Jaabir bin Hayaan) being Shia.&#8221; </strong>In this regard he writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Ibn Tawoos counted him from the highly respected scholars of the shia, Ibn Bastaam narrated from him and he narrated from (Ja’afar) Saadiq and it is said he narrated 500 treatises from (Ja’afar) Saadiq as al-Yaa’fe mentions. Ibn Nadeem counted him from the major Shia scholars, he also said he was from the students of Ja&#8217;afar Saadiq and not Ja’afar Barmakkee. They did not differ with regards to him being major philosophers or a Shia. His philosophy was Islamic philosophy which opposed the older type and the sharee’ah. Ibn Nadeem further said he authored books in favour of the shia religion as has been mentioned previously.&#8221; </em>(A’ayaan ash-Shia vol.15 p.105)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dr Ahmad Fuwaad al-Ahwaanee also mentions,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Jaabir bin Hayaans father was killed in khurasaan for being a Shia.&#8221;</em> (A’ayaan ash-Shia vol.15 p.87)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Here we would like to mention what the famous shia historian Tehraanee said and he also cites Jaabir bin Hayyaan to be from the shia. Tehraanee writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;2 books of Jaabir bin Hayaan are well known, one is &#8216;ar-Rehma as-Saghir&#8217; and the other is &#8216;ar-Rehma al-Kabeer&#8217; of Jaabir bin Hayyan as-Soofee at-Toosee al-Koofee he died in 200H.&#8221;</em> (adh-Dharee’ah Ilaa Tasneef ash-Shia vol.10 p.171) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for what has passed that he was a shia, Ibn Nadeem said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Abu Abdullah Jaabir bin Hayyaan bin Abdullaah al-Koofee who was famous with the title of Soofee, the people differ regarding him. The position of the Shias is that he was from the major scholars of the Shias and was a resident of Koofah and from the companions of Ja&#8217;afar Saadiq. Some of the people of philosophy say he was a philosopher and he authored many books of logic/rhetoric and philosophy. He was an expert in alchemy and even upto his death he did not teach anyone alchemy. It is said concerning him that he would not stay more than a few days in any city because he would always fear the king or leader of the land would force him to teach him alchemy. It is also said he was a very close to the Barmakki family. He was a companion of Ja&#8217;afar bin Yahyaa. The people who agree with this say Ja&#8217;afar does not refer to Ja&#8217;afar Saadiq but rather Ja&#8217;afar Barmakki. The position of the Shias is that this refer to Ja&#8217;afar Saadiq. </em>(al-Fehrist pg.498-499 of Ibn Nadeem)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After this Ibn Nadeem writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He has authored many books on the religion of the Shias.&#8221; </em>(al-Fehrist pg.498-499 of Ibn Nadeem)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has also been said concerning him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was the either student or servant of Ja&#8217;afar bin Muhammad al-Baaqir.&#8221; </em>(Khulasatul Athar 1/213 of al-Mahbi cited from Shaibi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The evidence for him being a Shia and believing in the Aqeedah of hulool/incarnation, he said himself in his book,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When I heard the statement of Imaam Saadiq concerning alchemy I was not able to leave its magic and I fell in prostration. Imaam Ja&#8217;afar said to me if your prostrating is for me then you are successful forever. Furthermore your family will continue to prostrate to me and prostrating to me is as if your prostrating to yourself.&#8221; </em>(Mukhtar Rasail Jabir bin Hayan pg.78)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for him being a student of Ja&#8217;afar Saadiq, Haji Khaleefah has cited this in his book Kashf adh-Dhunun and Ibn Khalkaan in his Wafyaat. (Wafyat al-A’yan, under the dictricial note of Jafar bin Baqir) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dr Shaibee although has said many things about Jaabir bin Hayyaan he has also omitted many aspects concerning him. For example he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Although Jaabir was a Soofee he never emphasised on this and he spent most of his time and efforts in alchemy.&#8221; </em>(as-Silah Bayna at-Tasawuf Wat-Tashayyu 1/289)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the other hand Ibn Nadeem has cited from Jaabir Ibn Hayyaan that he said himself,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I have authored many books on Zuhd and Soofism.&#8221; </em>(al-Fehrist pg.503 of Ibn Nadeem)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Qatfi writes in ‘<em>Akhbar al-Hikma’</em>,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Jaabir bin Hayyaan was a famous philosopher and he was a muqallid of it, which is also known as inner knowledge (Baatin). It is also well known about him that he was well versed in Soofism just as Haarith al-Mahasabi and Sahl bin Abdullah Tustari.&#8221; </em>(Akhbar al-Hikma pg.111 of Qatfi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The well known orientalist Phillip said concerning him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He had a special station and status in Zuhd and Soofism.&#8221; </em>(Tarikh al-Arab 2/22 of Hata)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So these are first 3 invidious were from amongst those who labelled with Soofism. There are various opinions concerning the death of Jabir, he died between 160H and 200H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>ABDAK</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the second then his is Abdak, he was a founder of Soofism as the oreintalist Massignon mentioned. In addition to him, the shia researchers, Dr Qaasim Ghanaa and the shia researcher of Iraq, Dr Mustafa ash-Shaibee have both also mentioned this and further verified that he was an extreme shia.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Massignon says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Soofiyyah which is a plural term was first heard in 199H / 814CE. During the period of unrest in Alexandria this word emerged. This was approximately the same time when Shiaism emerged and was gaining momentum in <strong>Koofah</strong>. Abdak was a famous and well known leader of the Soofee Shias and from his beliefs were that the Imaamate is specifically established. In other words every Imaam chooses and appoints the next Imaam. Abdak was a vegetarian and would never eat meat. He died in 210H / 825CE. In this regard we find the usage and the coinage of the word Soofee rose and emerged in <strong>Koofah</strong>.” </em>(Da’iratul Ma’arif al-Islaamiyyah Vol.6 pg.419, also at-Tasawuf (p.27) of Massignon (Arabic))</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dr Qaasim Ghanaa said in note to this,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was a famous Soofee who would remain isolated from the people. He was the first person who became famous with the name of Soofee. During this period the word Soofee was used for those who were Zahids from Koofah. Even during 189H the word Soofee was used for some people like Thawaar al-Askandriyyah. As Abdak never used to eat meat some people used to think he was a zindeeq. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Massignon</em><em> said the word Soofee was not well known in the first century. The word Soofee became famous in the third century and it was first used for Abdak who was from the elder Shuyookh of the Soofiyyah and he was regarded as an Aqtaab (peg/established pillar that keeps the earth intact). He was from the time before Bishr bin Harith al-Haafi. Similarly Sri Saqtah also came after him as Abdak died in 210H and Bishr bin Harith died in 227H and Sri Saqtah died in 225H. On this basis the word Soofee was first used in Koofah. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So after half a century this word starting echoing in the streets of Baghdad. In Iraq the word Soofee was used for individuals of the al-Malamatiyyah sect, who lived in and around Khurasaan. After the 4th century the word Soofee became very famous and it was not specific to any sect. The white robe the Soofees began to use or wear at the end of the first century was in remembrance of the Khawaarij and the Christians.&#8221; </em>(Tarikh at-Tasawuf Fil-Islaam (pg.64-65) Arabic of Dr. Qaasim Ghana</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaibee transmits from Sama&#8217;ani who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Abdaks name was Abdul Karim, his paternal grandson Muhammad bin Ali bin Abdak ash-Shi&#8217;ee, he was a well known leader of the Shias.&#8221; </em>(al-Insaab of Sama’ani cited from as-Sillah Bayna at-Tasawwuf Wat-Tashayyu (pg.293)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Abdak, due to his high rank and status was considered to be a leader of the Shias. On one hand he would practice tasawwuf (ie Soofism) and Zuhd and in doing so spread this concept in Koofah and Baghdaad. He was the first individual for whom the word Soofee was used. He came to Baghdaad from Koofah and the people began to use the name Soofee for him. We also know the origin of the word Soofee was Koofah where the Shias used and coined this word. If this is correct then it conclusively proves that Soofism was essentially introduced and formulated by the Shias.&#8221; </em>(as-Sillah Bayna at-Tasawwuf Wat-Tashayyu (pg.293)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the earlier individuals, al-Multee affirms this, he says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Abdak was a leader of a heretical group who claimed it was unlawful to seek any benefit from the world except what which was duly needed to preserve life. Utilising this world is only permissible up until the presence of a Just Imaam. If there is no Imaam present then seeking the world in unlawful and its is also therefore unlawful to establish any relations with the local community when there is no just Imaam. Therefore by default any transactions without the presence of a just Imaam will also be rendered to be unlawful.”</em> (at-Tanbiyyah War-Radd pg.1 of Multee, Muhammad Zahid al-Kawtharee’s checking, Edn. Egypt 1360)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was the second individual to achieve this title, ie the title of Soofee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the third individual we would like to mention here is also Koofee (Abu Haashim al-Koofee) but it is strange that although he was not been accused of being a shia he was however accused of being a zindeeq and an atheist. Haajee Masoom Alee said about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He would wear a long cloak made out of wool and he believed in hulool and I&#8217;tihaad (incarnation and unity of essence) like the Christians did. The Christians attributed Hulool and I&#8217;tihaad to Eesaa (Alayhis Salaam) whereas he attributed these beliefs to himself. He had numerous statements about Hulool and I&#8217;tihaad and he remained engrossed in these beliefs right up until the end, this has been cited from the book Usool ad-Diyaanaat. His lineage was Amawee and his open beliefs showed him to be from amongst the jabariyyah on face value where as in reality inwardly he was an atheist and in order to spread chaos and evil he fabricated and formulated the madhab of soofism in order to confuse and mix this with Islam.” </em>(Taraiq al-Haqaiq (Vol.1 pg.101) of Haajee Masoom Alee)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is another individual from amongst the strange ones and about whom it is said he was from amongst the founders of Soofism and from its first followers, Dhunoon Misree and it is said about him that he was the first person to define Tawheed in the way which the current day Soofees do. (Refer to ar-Risaalah al-Qushairiyyah of Ibn al-Qaasim Abdul Kareem al-Qushairee, checking Abdul Haleem Mahmood, Edn. Daar al-Kutub al-Hadeethiyyah, Cairo, Egypt)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore he was from the leaders of this sects and all the major Soofee acquired their knowledge from him. Many Soofee Mashaikh lived before him but he was the first person who explained the statements of the Soofee. (Refer to Nufahaat al-Ins (pg.33) of al-Jaamee, Printed in Farsee in Iran.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was also said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He is the first individual who propagated and mentioned the stations of mastery and ranks of the Soofees in his area.&#8221;</em> (an-Najoom az-Zaahirah (Vol.2 pg.320) of Tagree al-Bardee al-Ataabkee, Edn. Ministry of Culture, Egypt)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has also been stated about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He is the first person who defined and explained soofee singing and dancing (Wajd=Soofee esoteric chanting dancing ie hadra, Sama= Soofee spiritual holy music ie like the Mushrikee qawaalis).”</em> (Refer to ar-Risaalah al-Qushairiyyah of Ibn al-Qaasim Abdul Kareem al-Qushairee, checking Abdul Haleem Mahmood, edn. Cairo)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On this basis a famous British writer on the Soofee’s said the truth about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;It would be just to say this individual was the formulater of Soofism and the leader in this field and many of the historians have cited his biography.&#8221; </em>(at-Tasawwuf al-Islami Wat-Tarikh pg.7 of Nicholson, translated by Abi A’la al-Afifi, Edn Cairo)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So this was the last individual who was from amongst the leaders and founders of Soofism. He is also generally accused of being a zindeeq and a magician. It is also been said he believed in craft of talisman and magic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Just as Imaam Dhahabee has cited from Yoosuf bin Ahmad al-Baghdaadee who said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The people of his area considered him to be a zindeeq (Heretic).&#8221; </em>(Siyar A’laam an-Nabula 11/533 of Dhahabi)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is reported from Silmee,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Dhunoon was the first person who started to mention the status and biographies of the Awliyaa. Abdullaah bin Abdul Hakam opposed Dhunoon. The scholars of Misr considered him to be a zindeeq and exiled him. It is famously known about him that he introduced an ideology that no one before him had done. So the people accused and labelled him to be a zindeeq and exiled him. He would replyninhabe no answer except but silence and I will remain sitting with my hand under my chin and on my cheek.&#8221; </em>(Siyar A’laam an-Nabula 11/534)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Dhahabee has reported about him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He would mention Hadeeth very little and not would he admonish or advise the people with ahadeeth. Daarqutnee said about he reported many ahadeeth from Maalik but they need to be looked into.&#8221; </em>(Siyar A’laam an-Nabula 11/533)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The famous Soofee Farid ud deen Ittar said about him in his book,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was from the Malaamatee sect, he concealed his fear of Allaah and in open he would oppose and go against the Sharee&#8217;ah and it was on this basis that most of the Egyptians considered him to be zindeeq. Yet consequently after his death the people began to raise his status and considered him to be master. </em>(Tadhkiratul-Awliya pg.69 of Farid ud din Ittar, printed in Pakistan and also in at-Tasawwuf al-Islami Wat-Tarikh pg.9)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Nadeem has reported concerning him that he was an expert in alchemy and he knew it very well and further he also fabricated numerous principles pertaining to it. (Ibn Nadeem pg.503-504)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">al-Qaftee has said concerning him Dhunoon bin Ibraaheem al-Akhmaimee al-Misree, he was an expert on alchemy like Jaabir bin Hayaan and was an expert in many philosophical sciences. He lived in an area called Burbah which was near al-Akhmaim. This area was traditionally known for logical sciences which had all kinds of pictures and imagery in that area by which the Eemaan of a believer would increase and the disbelievers would become more misguided. (Akhbar al-Ulama Bi-Akhbar al-Hukuma pg.185, cited from the book at-Tasawuf al-Islami Wat-Tarikh pg.9 of Nicholson)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mas&#8217;oodee said about him I found out about Dhunoon by going to al-Akhmaim, there the people knew him has Abul Faidh and the people would talk about his level of Taqwa and Zuhd. He had his own set method for his wordly life and his deen. He would often visit places of or stations where people knew secret things. He would often solve complex problems with his intellect that werw widespread amongst the community. Then Mas’oodee goes onto cite some of the difficult problems Dhunoon solved. (at-Tasawwuf al-Islami Wat-Tarikh, cited from Maruj adh-Dhahab)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After citing these quotes, Nicholson writes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Dhunoon was into imagery and statues and the most complex of images that were existence in old churches and temples he would often resolve or interpret and he would have zeal for this. According to the Muslims ancient Egypt was a centre for alchemy and magic and where it originated from. Dhunoon was an Egyptian alchemist and a magician and because magic is unlawful in Islaam, Dhunoon disguised this into karamahs and this si what he presented to the people. It was from his time and period that karamahs became widespread amongst the soofiyyah. He would teach his followers words associated with magic. He was also the first one to use scents and perfumes by which magic would affect individuals.</em>(at-Tasawuf al-Islami Wat-Tarikh, cited from Maruj adh-Dhahab pg.9)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So if he is associated and intermixed with the first three individuals it presents and sketches a clear understanding of soofism.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"><em><strong>[1]</strong></em></a><em> <strong>[TRANS NOTE]</strong> Much has been written about this destructive individual however for a quick guide refer to a brief yet succinct work of the late Pakistani Hadith Scholar, Hafidh Shaikh Zubair Ali Zai (Rahimahullah) titled, Who was abdullah ibn Saba, see here.</em></span></p>
