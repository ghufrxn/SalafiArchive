				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Abridged from the book ‘ash-Shaikh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa`dee wa juhooduhu fee tawdeehil-`Aqeedah’ of Shaikh `Abdur-Razzaaq `Abdil-Muhsin al-`Abbaad]
<p><strong>Firstly: His lineage.</strong></p>
<p>He is the great scholar, the pious person, the Zaahid (one who abstained from the unnecessary things of this world), the jurist, the scholar of the principles of Fiqh. The great scholar of al-Qaseem, and our Shaikh, Aboo `Abdillaah `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir ibn `Abdillaah ibn Naasir ibn Hamd Aal Sa`dee, from the tribe of Banoo Tameem.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly: His birth.</strong></p>
<p>He was born in `Unayzah, in al-Qaseem, on the twelfth of Muharram 1307H, and he lived as an orphan, without either of his parents.</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly: His upbringing.</strong></p>
<p>His father gave importance to his cultivation, and before his death he instructed his eldest son to look after him, and he took on the task of caring for him in the best manner. So he was equipped with a righteous environment, and with a great desire to seek knowledge, and he exerted in it day and night, day after day.</p>
<p><strong>Fourthly: His characteristics.</strong></p>
<p>(a) His physical characteristics: He was of medium height, his hair was dense; and he had a full, round face, and a dense beard. He was whitish in colour, with a reddish tinge. He had a handsome face, with light upon it, and a pure complexion.</p>
<p>(b) His manners: He was good-humoured and beloved to the people on account of his good nature. Anger would not be seen upon his face.</p>
<p>He had a great degree of humility and modesty, and he was amiable, to an extent that is rarely found. He was humble with the young and the old, the rich and the poor.</p>
<p>He had a high level of manners, decency, uprightness, and firm resolve in all his affairs. He abstained from the unnecessary things of this world, and was one who withheld (from asking). He had self-respect, despite his possessing very little. He felt compassion towards the poor, the needy, and the strangers. He would give money to the poor and needy students, so that they could free themselves from preoccupation with seeking a livelihood.</p>
<p>He loved to bring about peace and rectification between the people.</p>
<p>His clothing was moderate in fineness, and avoided conspicuousness.</p>
<p><strong>Fifthly: His life in the field of knowledge.</strong></p>
<p>His overriding concern in his life was to derive the benefit of knowledge, and to utilize his time for that. So he began with memorization of the Qur’an at an early age, and he had memorized it proficiently by the age of eleven. Then he began acquiring the rest of the branches of Islamic knowledge.</p>
<p>He did not restrict himself whilst seeking knowledge to a single field of knowledge; rather he studied many fields: so he studied Tafseer, Hadeeth, Creed and Belief, Fiqh, Usool, Science of Hadeeth, the sciences of the language, and other than this.</p>
<p>The Shaikh gave a great deal of attention to the books of the two Shaikhs of Islaam: Ibn Taimiyyah and Ibnul-Qayyim; he devoted himself to reading and revising them, and to memorising and understanding them, and to writing and abridging them.</p>
<p>He first sat to teach at the age of twenty three, and he used to divide his time between learning and teaching. He would spend some time in reading to the scholars, and some time in sitting to teach the students. He would also spend some time in referring to the books, and in researching within them. He would not allow any of his time to be lost without his utilising it, to such an extent that teaching in his city fell to him, and all of the students relied upon him with regard to their education.</p>
<p><strong>Sixthly: His Shaikhs.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">(1) Shaikh Ibraaheem ibn Hamd ibn Jaasir (1241-1338 H). He was the first Shaikh whom he read to. He learned from him Tafseer and Hadeeth, and the Principles (Usool) of both of them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">(2) Shaikh Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Kareem ash-Shibl (1257-1343 H). He learned from him Fiqh, and its Principles, and the sciences of the Arabic Language.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">(3) Shaikh Muhammad ibn ash-Shaikh `Abdil-`Azeez al-Muhammad al-Maani` (1300-1385 H). He learned from him the sciences of the Arabic Language.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">(4) Shaikh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shanqeetee (1289-1351 H). He learned from him Tafseer, Hadeeth, Science of Hadeeth, and the sciences of the Language.</p>
<p><strong>Seventhly: His students:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">(1) Shaikh Muhammad ibn Saaalih al-`Uthaymeen. He took over from his Shaikh in the duty of Imaam of the Congregational Mosque of `Unayzah, and in teaching, admonishing, and delivering the khutbah.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">(2) Shaikh `Abdullaah ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Bassaam. Member of the Discretionary Committee in the Western Region.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">(3) Shaikh `Abdul-`Azeez ibn Muhammad as-Salmaan. He studied in the Imaamud-Da`wah Institute in ar-Riyaad, and he followed the path of his shaikh in authorship.</p>
<p><strong>Eighthly: His writings:</strong></p>
<p>Shaikh Ibn Sa`dee -rahimahullaah- gave great attention to writing works. He produced many works in the different fields of Islamic knowledge. Some have been printed, while others are, as yet, unprinted. So from the printed works are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">1- ‘al-Adillatul-Qawaati` wal-Baraaheen fee Ibtaal Usoolil-Mulhideen’;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">2- ‘al-Irshaad ilaa Ma`rifatil-Ahkaam’;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">3- ‘Bahjatu Quloobil-Abraar wa Qurratu `Uyoonil-Akhyaar fee Sharh Jawaami`il-Akhbaar’, and it is presently being prepared and attended to;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">4- ‘Tawdeehul-Kaafiyatish-Shaafiyah’;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">5- ‘at-Tawdeeh wal-Bayaan lishajaratil-Eemaan’;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">6- ‘at-Tanbeehaatul-Lateefah feemahtawat `alaihil-Waasitiyyah minal-Mabaahithil-Muneefah’;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">7- ‘Tayseerul-Kareemir-Rahmaan fee Tafseer Kalaamil-Mannaan’;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">8- ‘ad-Durratul-Mukhtasarah fee Mahaasin Deenil-Islaam’;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">9- ‘Risaalah fil-Qawaa`idil-Fiqhiyyah’;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">10- ‘Risaalah Lateefah Jaami`ah fee Usoolil-Fiqhil-Muhimmah’; and it is before your eyes, along with annotations upon it;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">11- ‘Tareequl-Wusool ilal-`Ilmil-Ma·mool bima`rifatil-Qawaa`id wad-Dawaabit wal-Usool’;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">12- ‘al-Fataawas-Sa`diyyah’.They were gathered after his death -rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">13- ‘al-Qawaa`idul-Hisaan li-Tafseeril-Qur·aan’;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">14- ‘al-Qawlus-Sadeed fee Maqaasidit-Tawheed’;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">15- ‘Manhajus-Saalikeen wa Tawdeehul-Fiqh fid-Deen’;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">16- ‘al-Wasaa·ilul-Mufeedah lil-Hayaatis-Sa`eedah’.</p>
<p><strong>Ninthly: His illness and death:</strong></p>
<p>He fell ill in the year 1371 H, i.e. five years before his death, with the illness of high blood pressure and arteriosclerosis, and it would strike him time after time, and he bore it patiently, until he moved on to his Lord, at the time of Fajr, on Thursday the 22nd of Jumaadal-Aakhirah 1376 H &#8211; may Allaah forgive him, and his parents, and our parents, and all of the Muslims.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Publishers Foreword</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Alhamdullilahi Rabbil A’lamīn, Waṣalatu Wasalam Ala Rasūlillahil Karīm,  Wa, Ba’d</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is before you is part one of a great book of Allāmah al-Albānī ‘Qāmūs al-Bidʿah’ ie <em>‘An Encyclopedia concerning Biʿdah.’</em> The Shaikh started the book but was taken away by Allāh before he could complete it. One of the students of the Shaikh, Shaikh Mashūr Ḥasan Aāl-Salmān and Shaikh Aḥmad Ismāʿīl Shakwakānī took the responsibility on completing the book from the works and lectures of the Shaikh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh has used over hundreds of books, recordings and column pieces written by the Shaikh to try to do justice in order to complete the book. May Allāh bless the Shaikhs who strove to give the reader an amazing text which we hope insha’Allāh can be seen as a legacy of Shaikh al-Albānī in time to come.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The parts will be released gradually and summarised whilst taking from the most relevant and important points. Shaikh Muḥammad Nāṣir ud Dīn al-Albānī discussion on bidʿah at times are very detailed and takes the course of an Usūlī discussion and at times they very succinct and precise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wherever possible the translators have attempted to keep to the method and style of the Shaikh in order to give the readers a better comprehension of the thought of his Imām of Ahlus Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Last but not least, this work alone is a testament of Imām al-Albānīs deep comprehension, interpolation and deductions which is no ordinary feat and at the same instance it silences the ardent and staunch detractors of the Imām.    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allāh accept it from everyone involved, Amīn. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh was fervent in his efforts to highlight bidʿah and its manifestations. To have knowledge of bidʿah and that which leads to it is from the chapter of knowledge which is obligatory to learn and understand so one can be saved from Bidʿah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh states in his tremendous book <em>‘al-Ajwibātun Nāfʿe’</em>,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is an obligation for one to know about Bidʿah and it&#8217;s evils as it is through this that a person will be saved and gain closeness to his Lord. Salvation from bidʿah will only be achieved after one is aware of the principles of bidʿah otherwise a person can very easily and unknowingly fall into the evils of bidʿah. It is a well known maxim amongst jurists &#8220;that which leads to fulfilling an obligation is in itself an obligation. the same can be said about the likes of shirk, for it is obligatory to know what will lead to shirk for staying away from it is an obligation.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the companion Huḍaifah ibn al-Yamān (RaḍiAllahu ʿAnhu) narrates that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The people used to enquire from the prophet about good but I used to ask about the evil, so that I could avoid it.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, in this book we shall explore the meaning of bidʿah and its various manifestations. We will also look at types of bidʿah that have crept into the Muslim creed and worship, knowledge of which is a must so that bidʿah can be avoided. May Allah help us all upon his path. Amīn.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>WHAT IS BIDʿAH?</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>LINGUISTIC DEFINITION</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Allāmah Albānī records from Imām Ṣiddīq Ḥasan Khān that bidʿah is,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“That for which there is no previous established example [proof]”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE SHARĪʿAH DEFINITION</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh mention in his books <em>‘Salāt at-Tarāwīh’</em> and <em>‘al-Ibdā’</em> that bidʿah in the religion means,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Something introduced into the religion which has a resemblance to the Sharia in some form. One acts upon it in order to worship Allah and get a nearness to him.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>THE PRINCIPLES OF IBĀDAH [WORSHIP] AND BIDʿAH [INNOVATION] IN ISLĀM. </strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh in his book <em>‘Ḥujjatun-Nabī’ </em>states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“For worship to be accepted before Allāh it must fulfill two basic conditions: a] That it be purely for the sake of Allāh and b] It be in accordance with the book of Allāh and the Sunnah of his Prophet.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>TYPES OF SUNNAH</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>1] Sunnah is of two types:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sunnah Tarkīyyah [that which was left by him] and Fʿilīyyah [that which was said or performed by him].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh explains in <em>‘Ḥujjatun Nabī’</em> that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Should someone perform an action or saying as part of worship, yet those actions or sayings were not performed by the prophet in order to get close to Allah as part of his worship is a something which is in opposition to the Sunnah. This is because Sunnah is of two types being Tarkīyyah and Fʿilīyyah. Therefore, to leave off performing that which the prophet left off is Sunnah. One should consider how there is no adhān call to prayer for the Eīd and Funeral prayer yet to give such a call is to praise Allah.  The prophet left doing this and therefore to also leave this off is considered a Sunnah and that which makes one close to Allah. The blessed companions of the prophet understood how important it was to stay away from and warn from bidʿah. Huḍaifah Ibn al-Yamān (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) narrates that, “All that was left off by the companions of the prophet must be left off” and Abdullāh Ibn <u>Masʿūd</u> (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) said that, “Follow the Sunnah and do not innovate. The Sunnah is sufficient for you so follow it.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2] The saying of the prophet “every bidʿah is misguidance” is to be left upon its general and complete meaning. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh in <em>‘al-Ajwibatun Nāfʿe’</em> states,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is narrated by Jābir Ibn ʿAbdullāh (RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu) that the prophet whilst giving his sermons used to say, &#8216; The best speech is the book of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, and the worst of affairs is that which is innovated, and every innovation is a misguidance”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh states in ‘<em>Masājilah ʿIlmīyyah’</em> that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“This shows all bidʿahs in the dīn without restriction are based on and lead to misguidance. Indeed the messenger said “every innovation is misguidance and every misguidance leads to the hellfire.””</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh in his book <em>‘Salāt at-Tarāwīh’</em> whilst recording a statement from <em>‘Majālis ul-Abrār’</em> of Mullā Aḥmad Rūmī Ḥanafī that he said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The jurists have said concerning actions such as Ṣalāt ul-Ragā’ib and its pray in congregation, Reciting the Qurān in the bowing and to make remembrance aloud ahead of the funeral procession that these are all from the rejected actions and bidʿah. So the one who says that they are ‘ḥasanah’ [good] it will be said to him in reply, “Those actions which have a proof from the religion as being ‘ḥasanah’ will be ḥasanah due to them not being from bidʿah, in which case the ḥadīth &#8216;every innovation is misguidance&#8217; shall remain upon its unrestricted meaning. So the one who who specifies and makes exceptions to these words of the prophet let him bring an evidence from the book and Sunnah or consensus of the scholars to establish the exception to the general words of the prophet. One cannot rely upon opinions and customs to make exceptions to the ḥadīth of the prophet.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>3] It is necessary to oppose those who reject the truth, regardless of whether the opposers are many or few in number.</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shaikh said at the end of his treatise <em>&#8216;Risālah Eīdain’ </em>that,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Regarding the two groups there are those upon the truth and those who oppose. As for the ones upon the truth then they are the ‘jamaʿāh’ [Ahlus Sunnah community]. This is so as they are upon the Sunnah of the prophet and it is about them that the prophet described as “The Jamaʿāh”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a> and in another place he said “They [The Jamaʿʿh] are upon what I and my companions are upon.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><strong>[11]</strong></a> Indeed those who oppose them cannot harm them even if they are greater in number as the prophet said “There never cease to be a group [Jamaʿāh] in my Ummah who shall be manifest upon the truth. Its opposers cannot harm it up until the order of Allah shall come and they shall remain upon it”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><strong>[12]</strong></a> Thus, the believer is not afraid by being shunned by the sheer number of those who oppose the truth. Imām Shaṭibī states in his ‘al-ʿEitiṣām that, “It has been the way of our lord that the  ones upon the truth have been fewer in number than those upon falsehood.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><strong>[13]</strong></a> Allah says. <strong>“</strong></em><strong><em>And most of the people, although you strive [for it], are not believers.</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><em><strong>[14]</strong></em></a> <em>and <strong>“</strong></em><strong><em>And few of My servants are grateful.</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><em><strong>[15]</strong></em></a><em>So it can be said that the one who has intellect and understanding whilst reflecting upon the history of Islām and the prophets before Muḥammad will know that those upon truth have always been the strangers and fewer in number.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><strong>[16]</strong></a> </em></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled 2003</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These biographies of these hadeeth masters and all the others that have been presented on this blog <span id="more-1113"></span>are by no means justice to these great Hadeeth Masters but rather an insight and glimpse of the heritage and History of the scholars of Hadeeth, The Ahlul Hadeeth Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah, the Salafis.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a brief biography of Shaikh Maalik Abdul Azeez. He was born approximately at the turn of the 19th century at about 1899 in the eastern part of Multaan, a major city of the state of Punjaab, in Paakistaan. He was born in a district 7 miles to the east of Multaan, in an area known as Khudaadwala in a family of farmers.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Seeking Knowledge </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He starting seeking knowledge from an early stage, however the environment around was not entirely scholarly. So he moved to the city where he sought knowledge and achieved the studentship of the two famous and well-known scholars teaching there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They were</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. Shaykh al-Allaamah Abdul-Haqq Multaanee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. Shaykh al-Allaamah Abdul-Tawaab Multaanee</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1. Shaykh al-Allaamah Abdul-Haqq Multaanee </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was originally from Dhera Ismaa’eel Khaan and a Faraanee Afghan, he later moved to Multaan. He was from amongst the first people who started to call the people to the Tawheed of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Wasallam) in that area. Suffice it to say that he was one of the foremost students of al-Allaamah al-Muhaddith al-Muftee Mian Nazeer Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawee (d.1318H), from who he learnt all the different branches of Islaam. His rank and position with his teacher was such that he (Mian Nazeer Hussain) would have complete trust and reliance in him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When questions would come to Mian Nazeer he would pass them onto Shaykh Abdul-Haqq who would answer them and Main Nazeer would then just add his approval. So when one looks at <em>‘Fataawaa Nazeeriyyah’ </em>of Allaamah Nazeer Hussain some of the verdicts have the name of Abdul-Haqq next to them. This was his rank. Then another well-known student of al-Allaamah Mian Nazeer Hussain, Shaykh al-Allaaamah al-Muhaddith Abul-A’la Muhammad Abdur Rahmaan Mubaarakpooree, the author of  Tuhfatul Ahwadhee, checked Fataawa Nazeeriyyah.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>2. Shaykh al-Allaamah Abdul-Tawaab Multaanee </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Born in 1288H, he also learnt ahadeeth from the hadeeth master, al-Allaamah al-Muhaddith al-Muftee Mian Nazeer Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawee. Thereafter he gained permission of hadeeth from,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. Imaam Ahmad bin Abdur-Rahmaan al-Banna Misree, the one who put al-Musnad of Imaam Ahmad in an order.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. Shaykh al-Allaamah Muhammad Raaghib at-Tabbakh al-Halabee Shamee (d.1370). He was highly influenced by the works of the two Shaykhain, Shaykh ul-Islaam Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah and Imaam Shams ul-Islaam Ibn Qayyim as well as the works of Imaam Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee. He would often re-print their books and give them out free especially ‘A’laam al-Muwaqqi’een’. He authored many books. He died in 1366H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter the Shaikh travelled to Siyaalkot and studied in ‘Jaamia Ibraaheemiyyah’ where he benefited from Shaykh Muhammad Ibraaheem Meer Siyaalkotee. Then when the seeking of knowledge further instilled zealously in him, he travelled to ‘Jaamia Sa’eediyyah’ in Delhi and learnt from Shaykh al-Allaamah Abu Sa’eed Sharf-ud-Deen Dehlawee, the famous student of al-Allaamah Mian Nazeer Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawee, where he completed his studies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He spent most of his life as the rector of ‘Daar ul-Hadeeth Muhammadiyyah’ in Multaan. He spent years teaching the Prophets hadeeth in this institution as well as delivering the Friday sermon at the Jaamia Masjid. He also travelled and visited other cities where he helped to establish and propagate the dawah.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of his most memorable such programs was in the town of Dhera Ghazee Khaan, where he, alongside another Shaykh, severely refuted the madhab of the Raafidhee’s and the censurable concepts of shirk and innovation.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Debates </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During his life he had many victories whilst debating with Ahlul-Bid’ah on various issues. He was a close companion of Shaykh al-Allaamah Thanaullah Amritsaree and both of them would indulge in defending Ahlus-Sunnah equally against the accusations and objections of the people of shirk and innovation. Some of his well known debates were with the Shee’ah, one of them was with the Shee’ee Sayyid Zain al-A’abideen Shaah and another one with Ismaa’eel ash-Shee’ee, both of whom were severely refuted and their arguments annihilated by the Shaykh, Walillahil-Hamd.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the district of Shaah Ghardaiz in Lucknow (a place known for shee’ah residency), in the house of Sayyid Asghar Alee Shaah, Sayyid Zain al-A’abideen in the presence of other shee’ahs debated with the Shaykh on different issues between Ahlus-Sunnah and the shee’ahs. The Shaykh was so knowledgeable about the shee’ah madhab that he (his) opponent began to sweat as the expertise of the Shaykh was such that all his arguments were based and referenced from the books of the shee’ahs themselves. The Shaykh would always return victorious.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also debated with the famous Hanafee mullah, Maulana Khair Muhammad Jalandharee and it has been narrated that after the debate the Hanafee Maulana did not know his way back home.</span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Works </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The main areas of writing and research of the Shaykh were shee’ism and the refutation of Taqleed hence most of his works revolve around this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In refutation of the Shee’ah he wrote,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. The Decisive Word On Who Murdered Hussain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. The Decisive Word On the Marriage of Umm Kulthoom (bint Alee to Umar al-Khataab).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. Hadeeth Qartaas.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4. The Garden of Fidak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5. Ehtimaam Janaazah Khair al-Anaam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6. al-Burhaan al-Ma’qool Fee Tarbee’a Binaat ar-Rasool.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7. Khilaafat Saadiqah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8. Fadhail Khulafa Raashideen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9. Fadhail Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthmaan From Shee’ah Narration’s.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the Hanafees he wrote,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10. Isteesaal at-Taqleed</span></p>
