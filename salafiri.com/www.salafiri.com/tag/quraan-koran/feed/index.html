<p><strong>2. 10 Rewards for reciting one Letter Of The Quraan</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Tirmidhee narrates from Abdullaah ibn Masood (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Whoever recited a letter from the Book of Allaah he gets one reward and each reward is similar to 10 and I do not say Alif Laam Meem is one letter rather alif is a letter laam is a letter and meem is a letter.” (Tirmidhee 8/182 no.3075 Imaam Tirmidhee graded it Hasan Saheeh and Shaikh al-Albaanee graded it Saheeh (Saheeh Sunan Tirmidhee 3/9)</p>

<p>Imaam Muslim transmits from Uqbah ibn Aamir (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who narrates that we were in Sufah and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) came out and said, “Which of you would like to go out every morning to Buthan or al-‘Aqiq and bring two large she-camels without being guilty of sin or without severing the ties of kinship? We said: Messenger of Allah, we would like to do it. Upon this he said: Does not one of you go out in the morning to the mosque and teach or recite two verses from the Book of Allah. the Majestic and Glorious? That is better for him than two she-camels, and three verses are better (than three she-camels). and four verses are better for him than four (she-camels), and to on their number in camels.” (Saheeh Muslim 1/522-523 no.251)</p>
<p><strong>4. The virtues Of The One Who Recites 10 Verses In The Night</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Haakim narrates from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Whoever recites 10 verses of the Quraan in the night he will not be counted amongst the lazy/neglectful ones.” (al-Mustadrak Alas –Saheehain (1/555) Haakim authenticated it on the condition of Muslim, Imaam Dhahabee agreed Talkhees (1/155-156), Shaikh al-Albaanee graded it Saheeh Li–Ghayrihi refer to Saheeh at-Targheeb Wat-Tarheeb (1/169)</p>
<p><strong>5. Reciting 100 Verses In The Night Is As If You Have Recited The Whole Night</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Ahmad narrates from Tameem ad-Daaree (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Whoever recited 100 verses in the night then it is written form him as if he recited the whole night.” (Musnad Ahmad 28/156 no.16958) al-Arnaa’oot and his associates authenticated it.</p>
<p><strong>6 The One Who Recites 1000 verses In the Prayer will have Written for Him To Be The Owner Of Treasures.</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Abu Dawood transmits from Abdullaah ibn Amr ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Whoever prayed and recited 1000 verses will have written form him to be the owner of treasures.” (Sunan Abee Dawood 4/195 no.1395), Shaikh al-Albaanee authenticated refer to Saheeh Sunan Abee Dawood 1/263 and Saheeh at-Targheeb Wat-Tarheeb 1/406)</p>
<p>Allaamah Shams ul-Haqq A’dheemaabadee said, “This means a lot of reward and virtue will be written for him. It has also been said a lofty virtuous reward will be assigned for him.” (A’un al-Ma’bood 4/192)</p>
<p>Note: There are 1000 verses from the Soorah Tabarakallaadhi Biyadihil Mulk till the end of the Quraan</p>
