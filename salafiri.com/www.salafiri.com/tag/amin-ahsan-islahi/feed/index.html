				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>This is a series of articles on the Modern Mu’tazilites.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Scholars of Hadith Make no Distinction Between Sunnah and Hadith</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholars of Hadith do not make the distinction Amin Ahsan Islahi made between the Sunnah and Hadith because the Sunnah ie his practical life (according to the definition of the modern rationalists) was not only based on his daily life ie his actions but rather it also includes his statements and conversation, which was an integral part of the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Qadi Ayad said in explanation of the hadith مَنْ سَنَّ فِي الإِسْلاَمِ سُنَّةً حَسَنَةً</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;He who introduced some good practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being diminished in any respect. And he who introduced some evil practice in Islam which had been followed subsequently (by others), he would be required to bear the burden like that of one who followed this (evil practice) without their&#8217;s being diminished in any respect.&#8221; [Sahih Muslim no.1017]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;This &#8216;Sanna&#8217; means a way or path, path of the Sunnah, a nahj i.e. methodology.&#8221; [Mashariq al-Anwar [2:223]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise and similarly the books of hadith not only preserved or collated the statements of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam but they also included the practical and daily life of the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. This is evident from the numerous scholars of hadith and the respective books they compiled and collated. For example the well known books of Sunan, like Sunan Tirmidhi, Sunan Abu Dawud, Sunan Nasai, Sunan Ibn Majah, Sunan Darimi and Sunan Daraqutni are just a few examples which contain everything of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam from his statements, speech and actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholars of hadith would use both the Sunnah and Hadith interchangeably and synonymously and there was no problem with this and nor did any of the other scholars object in fact they were all agreed with this method.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Ibn Athir asserts the usage of the word Sunnah in hadith has a specific meaning and it means a way, path and biographical characteristics. [al-Nihayah [2409]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The clearly shows the earlier scholars interchanged between the hadith and Sunnah and understood both terms intrinsically. The later scholars of the science of hadith transmission also understood Sunnah and Hadith to mean the same thing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The late Syrian scholar of jurisprudence, the head and supreme of the Syrian Ikhwan al-Muslimin-The Muslim brotherhood and the leader of the Islamic Social Front, Shaikh Mustafa Siba&#8217;i, said the Sunnah according to the scholars of hadith technically means and entails the speech, action, tail approvals, natural characteristics, mannerisms and biographical aspect of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) before and after his prophethood and thus in this regard according to some of the scholars of hadith sunnah and hadith are synonymous. [al-Sunnah wa Makanatuha Fi Tashari&#8217;a al-Islami [pp.47]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These are not even points of difference amongst the earlier scholars that the whole Ummah and especially the scholars of hadith are agreed; the Sunnah is established via authentic narrations which are in turn based on trustworthy and reliable transmitters and narrators of the very same hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to the celebrated scholar of jurisprudence, Imam Shatibi he said based on the understanding of the scholars of the principles of jurisprudence, they defined the Sunnah as something which refers to what the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) SAID which was not part of the text of the Quran but rather something the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said from his tongue in explanation of some aspect or point of the Quran and according to the jurists the Sunnah is something which is established from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) other than what is obligatory or mandatory. [al-Muwafiqat [4:4, 47]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have quoted various scholars and we will continue to do so in further parts to show that this recent intellectual fraud under the cloak of rationale and modern free thinking has no basis amongst the earlier scholars. The earlier scholars; the Asha’irah. Maturidiyyah and the Mu’tazilites reject Khabar al-Ahad and gave precedence to theological rhetoric and philosophical thinking over the divine texts which led to their misguidance and deviation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Over the years the modern free thinking progressives have developed further steps and demonstrated their bold ideas such as hadith having no basis in Islam especially in explaining the Quran and the general rulings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ploy and calculated sustained deviation of these modern mu’tazilites is that they say to the masses we accept and follow the Quran and Sunnah whereas their understanding of the Sunnah is totally contrary to ours.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>This is a series of articles on the Modern Mu’tazilites.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.salafiri.com/readings-in-modern-day-hadith-rejectors-the-crime-of-intellectual-fraud-and-modern-day-mutazili-rationalists-amin-ahsan-islahi-d-1997-part-2/"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>READ PART 2 HERE</strong></span></a></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Negligent Comprehension or Corrupt Understanding</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However there is a huge contradiction in their principles because Amin Ahsan Islahi includes the practice of the companions and the Muslim Ummah- as part of tawatur amali or ta’amul al-Ummah as the Sunnah but the actions of the companions and the Muslim Ummah do not constitute divine revelation so how can they be included in the Sunnah because divine revelation ceased after the demise of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are clear evidences in the Quran which overwhelmingly indicate this meaning, for example,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“Nor does he speak from [his own] inclination It is not but a revelation revealed,” [Surah al-Najm:3-4]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and the hadith,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“beware I have been given the book (ie Quran) and something similar to it.”</em> [<em>Abu Dawud</em>; [no.4604]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a similar report which mentions, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I have bene given the Quran and something similar to it.”</em> [<em>Musnad Ahmad</em> [4:130], <em>Sahih Ibn Hibban</em> [no.2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The earlier or the mutaqadimin scholars were also of this position ie the Salaf, Hassan bin A’tiyyah said that Jibra’il would descend on the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam with the Sunnah just as he would descend with the Quran. [<em>Sunan</em> <em>Darimi</em>; [2:149 no.599]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They say the hadith is the written element of the Sunnah and since it is not established or proven from tawatur amali it remains as khabar al-Ahad (lone or singular reports) which are Dhanni uncertain and do not give the benefit of knowledge and are therefore unreliable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is yet another contradiction because the scholars of the past have mentioned there is Ijma ie consensus which can be understood as tawatur amali for at least one generation of Muslims to accept and act upon Khabar al-Ahad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Mu’tazili Contradiction: Khabar al-Ahad Was Accepted as Tawatur Amali</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam Abu Khattab ibn Dahiyyah [633H] said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“All the people of knowledge from amongst the Ahl al-Hadith and the people of jurisprudence of all the countries are unanimously agreed in accepting the authentic Khabar al-Ahad, taking evidence from them is obligatory. It is mandatory to act upon them when it established they are not abrogated by any other authentic hadith or via ijma; which has been the position of all the people from the time of the companions to the scholars of this era, except the people of innovation who opposed this and they have no status anyway.”</em>[<em>Ada Ma Wajab Min BayanWadh’a al-Wadha’ayn Fi Rajab</em> [pp.119-120]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They then surmise from this the impermissibility of using such ahadith in understanding the Quran, nor can such reports be used to abrogate or specify a general ruling of the Quran especially if they contradict the meaning and understanding of the Quran or from the lexicological point of view.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They say the fundamental understanding of the Quran is via its language, its construction and order and by parts of the Quran explaining other parts and therefore if Khabar al-Ahad reports contradict this and a resolve or reconciliation is not achievable the reports which are via Khabar al-Ahad will be rejected and denied.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Amin Ahsan Islahi, considered one of the modern rationalists who was instrumental in opening the doors to hadith rejection; considered every principle or rule derived from hadith to oppose and contradict the Quran and he unwilling to reconcile between the two.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[Amin Ahsan Islahi’s, <em>Tadabbur Quran</em> [Introduction: vol1.], <em>Mubadi Tadabbur Quran</em> [pp.52, 169], <em>Mubadi Tadabbur Hadith</em> [pp.19, 28, 38, 41]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Quraniyun, as they often refer to themselves as, say the Quran is sufficient alone for our understanding of Islam and this is also because some of them have developed a rudimentary understanding of the Arabic language and thus paved a route into a powerful doubt that we must understand the Quran based on the Arabic language.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Different Forms of the Quraniyun</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani [1420H] said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“A group of people who have rudimentary knowledge of the Arabic language have risen and began to interpret and explain the Quran according to their intellects and desires; they formulated a new way. They have fabricated a few principles in explaining the Book of Allah and spend day and night propagating them. If this is not answered intellectually and scholastically a number of people with less knowledge might fall prey to this abominable affair. A group of people who were instrumental in propagating this fitnah over 50 years ago referred to themselves as Quraniyun&#8230;”</em> [Lecture: Masjid Bani Hashim on the 18<sup>th</sup> of Jumada al-Akhira 1410H / 29 December 1989]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Albani goes onto say that these people have created a new wave of discord under the banner of modern thinking and these people do not claim that they only follow the Quran but on the apparent they call with both the Quran and Sunnah. However when one reads their writings or understands between the lines with some insight and a level of scrutiny one realises their false principles in deviating, rejecting and abandoning the Prophetic Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">More to follow from Shaikh al-Albani from his various works inshaAllah. The hadith rejectors are effectively orphaned in their understanding and cannot trace their history with their understanding more than 100 years from one of their churchfather, Abdullah Chakralwi</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>This is a series of articles on the Modern Mu’tazilites.</strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Read Part 1 <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/modern-day-hadith-rejectors-javed-ghamidi/">HERE</a></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the previous part we talked about a little about Ghamidi and just some of his principles and as the readers would appreciate writing about these modern mu’tazilites and their self formulated principles they have concocted in order to reject hadith; will take a number of parts. We move onto another prominent hadith rejector and some of his principles and he is Mawlana Amin Ahsan Islahi [1322H/1904c – 1417H/1997c]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A Brief Overview of Mawlana Amin Ahsan Islahi</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mawlana Amin Ahsan Islahi studied with Hamiduddin Farahi [1280H/1863c &#8211; 1349H/1930c] for 5 years and then studied hadith with the celebrated luminary and Indian hadith master Shaikh Abdur Rahman Mubarakpuri [1353H] for a period of 6 months in the year 1932 when Shaikh Abdur Rahman Mubarakpuri was very old and frail. Shaikh Mubarakpuri knew that Amin had been influenced by the ideas and teachings of Farahi but none the less agreed to teach him after his continuous request, which Amin Ahsan Islahi confirmed himself in his book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Amin Ahsan Islahi was also one of the founding members of Jamat Islami in 1941, he remained with them for 17 years after eventually leaving them. He continued to teach the thematic of Farahi and his principles, his students included Khalid Masud and Javed Ghamidi amongst others who continued his teachings and ideas.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Hadith Rejectors and Modern Day Mu’tazilite Theory  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In summary Amin Ahsan Islahi principle is that he makes a clear and distinct difference between Hadith and Sunnah. He claims Sunnah refers to the details and intricacies of practical life of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallm or what he did on a daily basis. He believes that this Sunnah is established via something known as tawatur amali or ta’amul al-Ummah ie actions that have passed down generations and everyone agrees with them just as the Quran is Tawatur and therefore this leads to the outcome that it amounts to definitive evidence or exact proof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Classical and mainstream scholars from early times have clearly understood hadith and Sunnah synonymously and have always used it interchangeably. [Imam Shakwani; <em>Irshad al-Fuhul Ila Tahqiq al-Haq Min ‘Ilm al-Usul</em> [1:186]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In their minds this correlates to the Sunnah being synonymous with the Quran in terms of constituting evidence. This is indeed one of the very clever ploys Amin Ahsan Islahi and others who share similar ideologies present in order to protect themselves from the allegation of rejecting the Sunnah and Hadith whereas they present their points in such a lucid manner that one thinks they consider the Sunnah to constitute evidence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Their modern rationale dictates to them that since the Sunnah is not divine revelation it cannot be used as evidence unless there is a unprecedented level of practise of the people in every era by the generation of Muslims. This is very poor comprehension and a negligent approach to understanding the Sunnah. The Sunnah is clear evidence as, Allah says in the Quran</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“And whatever the Messenger has given you &#8211; take; and what he has forbidden you &#8211; refrain from. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.” [Surah al-Hashr:7]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission.” [Surah al-Nisa:65]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error.” [Surah al-Hashr:36]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another point which refutes this notion of these hadith rejectors is that they claim the Sunnah is tawatur amali or ta’amul al-Ummah yet the companions had ijma ie unanimous agreement or a consensus on the all of the affairs of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam during his life and after it. They failed to make a distinction between the Quran and the Sunnah during this period and considered it obligatory to adhere and obey to both affairs. [Shaikh Abdul Wahhab Khallaf; <em>‘Ilm Usul al-Fiqh</em> [p.38]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If we further apply the very same principle of these modern rationalists and use the idea of tawatur amali or ta’amul al-Ummah then we can apply it to the students of the companions ie the tabi’een – the successors and then their students the taba tabi’een who learnt the hadith and sunnah synonymously, its meaning, application and status. So can we not apply the same principle here which renders the hadith as being hujjah as well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What is Sunnah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Linguistically Sunnah means a way, path or biography. [<em>Lisan al-Arab</em> [3:2124], <em>al-Misbah al-Munir</em> [1:396], <em>al-Sihah</em> [5:39]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and this is supported by the hadith, “Man San Sunnah&#8230;. [Whoever starts a new way will be rewarded&#8230;. [<em>Sahih Ibn Khuzaimah</em> [no.2278]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The technical or Shar’i definition of Sunnah according to the scholars of Usul al-Fiqh or the principles of jurisprudence is the statement of the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, his actions and his silent tacit approvals. [Imam Shawkani; <em>Irshad al-Fuhul</em> [1:186]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholars of hadith extend this definition and include his physical characteristics, his etiquettes, his travels and expeditions. [Abu Zahrah; <em>al-Hadith wa’l Muhadithun</em> [p.10]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So they do not consider the Sunnah to be divine revelation and they refrain from saying this; they say there is a difference between divine revelation and whether if it constitutes evidence. They say the outcome and rulings of the Islamic courts constitute evidence and obeying your parents constitutes evidence but neither of them are divine revelation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Abdul Karim Zaydan said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The statements of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam in this regard are like the Quran since the origin of both is divine revelation. The Quran was revealed by Allah therefore obeying and following the Quran is obligatory and the same applies to the statements of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam because the meaning of the conveyed with his words is from Allah.” </em>[<em>al-Wajiz Fi Usul al-Fiqh</em> [p.162]</span></p>
