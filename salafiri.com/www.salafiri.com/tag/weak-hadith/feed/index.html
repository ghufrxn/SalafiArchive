		<description><![CDATA[Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked about the words which were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “My heaven and my earth could not contain Me, but the heart of My believing slave contains Me”?   He replied:  Praise be to Allaah.  What they mentioned is from the Israa’eeliyyaat [reports narrated from Jewish &#8230;]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked about the words which were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), <strong>“My heaven and my earth could not contain Me, but the heart of My believing slave contains Me”</strong>?<span id="more-1293"></span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;"> He replied:  Praise be to Allaah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">What they mentioned is from the Israa’eeliyyaat [reports narrated from Jewish sources], no isnaad is known for it from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). What it means is that Allaah puts love and knowledge of Himself in the heart of His slave. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">The report, “The heart is the house of the Lord” is like the first report. The heart is the home or seat of faith in Allaah and of knowledge and love of Him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;"> They reported the words, “I was an unknown treasure and I wanted to be known, so I created mankind and taught them about Myself so that they would know Me.” These are not the words of the Prophet(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and I know of no isnaad for this, either saheeh (sound) or da’eef (weak). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah created reason, and said to it, ‘Come here,’ and it came. He said to it, ‘Go there,’ and it went. He said, ‘By My Glory and Majesty, I have not created anything more noble than you. I shall reward and punish because of you.’” This hadeeth is baatil (false) and mawdoo’ (fabricated) according to the consensus of hadeeth scholars. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They narrate the words, “Love of this world is the root of all evil.” This is known from Jundub ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Bajali, but there is no known isnaad from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report the words, “This world is merely a step for the believing man.” This is not known from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from the salaf of this ummah or its imams. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report the words, “Whoever is blessed with a thing, let him stick with it” and, “Whoever commits himself to something, let him stick with it.” The first report was narrated from one of the salaf. The second report is baatil (false), for whoever commits himself to something may have to stick to it or he may not, according to what Allaah and His Messenger have commanded. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Do favours for the poor, for tomorrow they will have authority, and what authority!” and, “Poverty is my pride and I boast of it.” Both of these are lies and are not known in any way in the well known books of the Muslims. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I am the city of knowledge and ‘Ali is its gate.” This hadeeth is da’eef (weak); indeed it is mawdoo’ (fabricated) according to the scholars of hadeeth. It was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and others, but it is a lie. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The poor will sit down on the Day of Resurrection, and [Allaah] will say, ‘By My Glory and Majesty, I did not deprive you of worldly things because you are insignificant. Rather I wanted to raise your status on this Day. Go to the place where the people are standing, and whoever gave you a piece of bread, or water to drink, or clothes to wear, take him to Paradise.’” The shaykh said: this report is a lie which was not narrated by any of the scholars of hadeeth. It is baatil (false) and goes against the Qur’aan and Sunnah and scholarly consensus (ijmaa’). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Madeenah, the daughters of al-Najjaar came out with daffs (hand-drums) and sang “Tala’a al-Badru ‘alayna min thaniyyat al-Widaa”, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to them, “Shake your tambourines, may Allaah bless you.” The hadeeth about women beating the daff on joyous occasions is saheeh, and this was done at the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but it is not known that he said, “Shake your tambourines.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “O Allaah, You have brought me out of the place which is most beloved to me, so cause me to dwell in the place which is most beloved to You.” This hadeeth is also baatil (false), although it was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and others. Rather he said to Makkah, “You are the most beloved part of Allaah’s land to me.” And he said, “You are the most beloved land to Allaah.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever visits me and my father Ibraaheem in one year will enter Paradise.” This is a fabricated lie which was not narrated by any of the scholars of hadeeth. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that a Bedouin prayed (quickly), pecking (like a bird) in his prayer. ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said, “Do not peck in your prayer.” The Bedouin said, “O ‘Ali, if your father had pecked in prayer he would not have entered Hell.” This is a lie. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that ‘Umar killed his father. This is a lie, for his father died before the mission of the Prophet(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) began. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “I was a Prophet when Adam was between the water and the clay. I was a Prophet when Adam was neither water nor clay.” This wording is false. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report the words, “The bed of a single man is fire. Poor is the man who has no woman and the woman who has no man.” These are not the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">It was narrated that when Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) built the Ka’bah, he prayed one thousand rak’ahs in each corner, then Allaah revealed to him, “O Ibraaheem, this is not like feeding a hungry man or clothing a man who cannot cover his ‘awrah.” This is obviously a lie, and it is not known in the books of the Muslims. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They narrate the words, “Do not despise tribulation, for it will reap the hypocrites.” These words are not known from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They narrate the words, “Whoever teaches his brother an aayah from the Book of Allaah becomes his master.” This is a lie which is not known at all in the books of the scholars. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They narrate that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “I looked at the sins of my ummah and I did not find any greater sin than that of one who learns an aayah then forgets it.” If this hadeeth is saheeh, what is meant is forgetting in the sense of not reciting. The wording of the hadeeth is: “Among the sins of my ummah is that of a man to whom Allaah gave an aayah of the Qur’aan, but he neglected it until he forgot it.”  This forgetting means turning away from the Qur’aan and not believing in it or acting upon it. With regard to neglecting to study it until one forgets it, this is a sin. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report the words, “One aayah of the Qur’aan is better than Muhammad and the family of Muhammad. The Qur’aan is the word of Allaah, revealed not created, and there is nothing like it.” This wording was not reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever learns something beneficial and conceals it from the Muslims, Allaah will bridle him with reins of fire on the Day of Resurrection.” A similar meaning is to be found in al-Sunan: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever is asked about a matter of [Islamic] knowledge which he knows but he conceals it, Allaah will bridle him with reins of fire on the Day of Resurrection.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “When you come to talk about disputes which took place among my companions, be quiet. When you come to talk about the Divine will and decree (al-qadaa’ wa’l-qadar), keep quiet.” This was reported with munqati’ (broken or interrupted) isnaads. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Salmaan al-Farsi when he was eating grapes, “Du, du,” meaning eat them two by two. These are not the words of the Prophet(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); this is baatil (false). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever commits zina (fornication) with a woman and she gives birth to a girl, the fornicator may marry his daughter who was born as a result of zina.” This was said by those who were not among the companions of al-Shaafa’i. Some of them attributed it to al-Shaafa’i, and some of the companions of al-Shaafa’i denied that he said that. They said, he did not state that this is permitted, but he did state that this is permissible in the case of radaa’ah (breastfeeding), if he breastfed from the milk of a woman who got pregnant as a result of zina. Most of the scholars, such as Ahmad, Abu Haneefah and others, are agreed that this is haraam, and this is the stronger of the two opinions narrated in the madhhab of Maalik. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report the words, “the most deserving thing for which you take payment is the Book of Allaah.” Yes, it is proven that [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] said, “The most deserving thing for which you take payment is the Book of Allaah,” but that was in the hadeeth about ruqyah (reciting Qur’aan and du’aa’s for the purpose of healing), and the reward was for the recovery of that sick person, not for the recitation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever mistreats a dhimmi (a Jew or Christian living under Islamic rule), Allaah will be his opponent on the Day of Resurrection” or “I will be his opponent on the Day of Resurrection.” This is da’eef (weak). What is known from him is that he said: “Whoever kills a mu’aahid (member of a kaafir nation which has a peace treaty with the Muslims) for no lawful reason will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.” </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;">They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever lights a lamp in the mosque, the angels and the bearers of the Throne will not cease to pray for forgiveness for him so long as the light of that lamp is shining in the mosque.” I know of no isnaad for this from the Prophet(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="justify"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 5/88-93</strong></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="font-weight: 300; text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300; text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Many narrations are well known in the virtue of Soorah Yaseen one such is that Soorah Yaseen is the heart of the Qur’aan and recite it when a person is near death (ie dying) and so on. However in terms of the authenticity of their chains none of them reach the level of authentic and some are either fabrications or weak. The narration of (Soorah Yaseen) being the heart of the Qur’aan was declared a fabrication by Shaikh al-Albaanee. (ad-Da’eefah Hadeeth no.169)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">It is well known the recitation of Soorah Yaseen near a person about to die has his soul taken with ease, but this hadeeth is not established in its chain. The details are as follows.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Narrated Muhammad ibn E’laa bin Makkee al-Marwazee who said informed me Ibn al-Mubaarak from Suleimaan at-Taymee from Abee Uthmaan not Nahdee from him his father from Ma’qil bin Yasaar who said the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee-Was-Sallam) said, <i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">“Recite Soorah Yaseen<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">  </span>upon the one’s near death, these are the words of E’laa.”</em></i> (Mussanaf Ibn Abee Shaybah (4/84), as-Sunan Ibn Maajah (3/19), al-Mustadrak, Abu Abdullah al-Haakim (1/565), as-Sunan al-Kubraa (3/383) of Baihaqee, al-Musnad (5/26) of Imaam Ahmad, Amal al-Yaum Wal Laylah<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">  </span>(p.58) of Imaam Nasaa’ee, al-Adhkaar (pp.131-132) of Imaam Nawawee.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">The chain of this hadeeth rests on Suleimaan at-Taymee from Abee Uthmaan from his father from Ma’qil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Alee ibn al-Madeenee said Suleimaan at-Taymee is the only person who narrates from Abee Uthmaan and he is unknown ie Majhool al-Haal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Ibn Hibbaan, Haakim and Abu Dawood have narrated it from Abee Uthmaan, not Nahdee from his father however Imaam Nasaa’ee and Ibn Maajah have mentioned it as being narrated by Abee Uthmaan from Ma’qil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Hajr said this hadeeth is ‘Ghareeb’ (strange or odd). Ibn Qattaan said there is Idthiraab (mixing/confusing the chain). So in total there are three defects in the chain of this hadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">(1) Abee Uthmaan is majhool (unknown)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">(2) Abu Uthmaan’s father is also Majhool.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">(3) There is also Idhtiraab in the chain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Details of the Idhtiraab are as follows</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">(1) Is the hadeeth Mawqoof (stopped) or Marfoo (raised)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">(2) This narration has been narrated from Abee Uthmaan from Ma’qil and also from Abu Uthmaan from his father from Ma’qil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Allaamah Shawkaanee said in Nayl al-Awthaar, <i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">“Ibn Qattaan said this hadeeth is defective for the following reasons, there is Idhtiraab in it, it being mawqoof, Abee Uthmaan from his father is majhool (unknown ie both son and father are unknown).”</em></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Daarqutnee said, <i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">“The chain of this hadeeth is weak and the text is unknown and there is no such hadeeth in this subject.” </em></i>(Irwaa al-Ghaleel (3/151) of Allaamah Muhammad Naasir ud deen al-Albaanee, Nayl al-Awthaar (2/22) of Qadhee Shawkaanee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Allaamah Nawawee said in al-Adhkaar, <i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">“Its chain is weak and two narrators in it are unknown but Abu Dawood did not declare it weak. It is narrated from Ibn Abee Dawood from Mujaalid narrates from Sha’bee who said the Ansaar (The Companions who helped the Messenger of Allaah (</em></i>Sallalahu Alayhee-Was-Sallam<i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">) in Madeenah) would recite Soorah al-Baqarah when one was close to dying. However Mujaalid is weak.” </em></i>(al-Adhkaar (pp.131-132)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Also Ameer San’aanee in Subl as-Salaam (2/186), Minawee in Faidh al-Qadeer (2/67), Shaikh ul-Hdeeth Allaamah Ubaidullaah Mubaarakpooree in Mira’ah al-Mafaateeh Sharh Mishkaat al-Masabeeh (5/314-315) have all mentioned the criticism above, however Minawee has put a ‘H’ sign next to it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Allaamah Mubaarakpooree has discussed the virtue of reciting Soorah Yaseen in Mira’ah and mentions the criticism on the hadeeth but he has not written clearly whether it is authentic or weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Allaamah al-Albaanee has declared it weak in all of his books and according to my information the most detailed discussion of it is in al-Irwaa. (see Irwaa al-Ghaleel (3/15), Da’eef Ibn Maajah (p.159), Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh (1/1501) Checking al-Albaanee, Da’eef Jaami as-Sagheer Wa-Ziyaadah (1/330) and Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (p.11).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">There is another hadeeth with a similar meaning, which is narrated in Akhbaar Asfahaan by Abu Nu’aym. (Akhbaar Asfahaan (1/188) of al-Albaanee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">There is a narrator in the chain whose name is Marwaan, about whom Imaam Ahmad said, “He is not Thiqah (trustworthy). Saajee and Abu A’roobah Haraanee said, “A fabricator of hadeeth”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Daylamee has also narrated this hadeeth with the same chain but after the successor he mentions it from Abu Dardaa Abee Dharr. (Irwaa al-Ghaleel (3/152) of al-Albaanee, Talkhees al-Habeer (2/110) of Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Here we also find the narration is Musnad al-Firdaus like the hadeeth of Taareekh Asfahaan is also inauthentic as it is also narrated whilst including Marwaan and he is not reliable as has preceded. The<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>number of people that have criticised Abu Uthmaan from his father, are many however Haafidh Ibn Hajr has graded him from amongst the fourth level of acceptable narrators. (Taqreeb ut-Tahdheeb (2/449).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">The summary is this hadeeth is not established by any chain<b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">.</strong></b></span></p>
