<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000000"><em><strong>Muhadith Zubair Ali Zai</strong></em></span></h4>

<h4 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>How to Perform the Funeral Prayer</strong></span></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center"></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[14] And with the same chain of narration that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) announced the death of an-Najashi to everyone on the day that he died, and went out with them to the place of prayer, and then formed them into rows and said &#8220;Allah is the greatest&#8221; four times. </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> <span style="color: #000000">– [SAHIH]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Sa&#8217;id Ibn Musayab) in Bukhari (no.3880, no.3881)</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (1/226,227 hadith no.533, book 16, chapter 5, hadith no.14) at-Tamhid (6/324) and al-Istidhkar (no.490)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.1245) and Muslim (no.951) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) It is allowed to inform the people when someone dies. Fath ul-Bari (3/116)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">It is narrated from Ibn Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) that he instructed the people to inform others of the death of Rafi’ Ibn Khadij (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) in the surrounding areas of Madinah. (al-Mu’jam al-Kabir of Tabarani ((4/239) hadith (no.4242) as-Sunan al-Kubra of Bayhaqi (4/74) and its chain is authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Another narration prohibits informing the people about someones death (Sunan at-Tirmidhi: (no.986) and he said: this hadith is [Hasan] good) however this narration is weak because it is not established that Bilal Ibn Yahya met with Hudhayfa Ibn al-Yaman (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) [TN: Refer to Kitab al-Janaiz, Bulugh al-Maram]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Even if this narration was authentic then its meaning would be that it is prohibited to go around the and publicly announce the death of someone in public places just like the people of ignorance used to do. See the magazine al-Hadeeth  (11/20) and the book of funerals of Mubarakpuri (pg.18) [TN: The prohibition here is the public announcing in the market places etc as this resemblance the practice of the people of ignorance.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) It is better to say 4 takbirs in the funeral prayer</span><span style="color: #000000"> however saying 5 takbirs is also permissible just as it is established from Sahih Muslim (72/ 957) [no.2216]) [TN: Although it is permissible the kayfiyyah of doing the 5th takbir is not detailed in the Sunnah as to when it is to be done]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) To pray the funeral prayer outside the Masjid is better whilst praying in the Masjid is also allowed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) Allah the Blessed and most High informed His beloved (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) about affairs far afield through revelation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) If there is a valid legislated reason in the Shari’ah then praying the absentia (when the person involved is not present when it happens) funeral prayer is allowed. [TN there is contention of this issue, some of the scholars opine the person of absentia must be well known i.e. famous and or no one at his location prayed his funeral prayer. Some also use as evidence the hadith of the female companion who would clean the Masjid, thereafter the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) went and prayed her funeral prayer.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) It is not a condition to have even or odd rows in the funeral prayer. The noble Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) lead the funeral prayer and there were 2 rows behind him. (Sahih Muslim: (no.952), Dar us-Salam (numbering): (no.2209) [TN: this is another foreign practice no doubt introduced by some ardent madhabists of the subcontinent]</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[12] And with the same chain of narration that someone asked the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) about praying in one garment. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Was-Sallam) said, “Do you all have two garments?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> <span style="color: #000000">– [SAHIH]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri narrated An’ana and its <em>[Sahih]</em> authentic with a supporting hadith in Sahih Muslim ((276/515) Dar us-Salam (numbering): (no.1150)) and the narration of Bukhari (no.365) of the same length.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong> Benefit:</strong> Nawawi said: the mudallisin’s narration that are narrated with Ann in the Sahihayn and books similar to them will  be understood to have been directly heard (from the narrators) (Taqrib an-Nawawi (pg.9) (Part 12)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">This saying of Nawawi about the Sahihayn is established because of these books receiving complete acceptance whilst Sahih Ibn Khuzaimah and Sahih Ibn Hibban etc. have not received complete acceptance therefore the Mudalis’s Ann narration in these books is not a proof, unless and only when hearing (them directly) is established.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES]</span> – [AGREED UPON]</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (1/140 hadith no.316, book 8, chapter 9, hadith no.30) at-Tamhid (6/363) and al-Istidhkar (no.286)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.358) and Muslim (no.515) from the hadith of Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) It is allowed for men to pray in one garment for example one cloak or shirt on the condition that the shoulders are covered, however it is better to pray in 2 (or more) garments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Nafi’ prayed in one garment because of getting busy in some work so after the prayer Ibn Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said: “Did I not give you two pieces of clothes?” Nafi’ said: “Yes certainly!” Ibn umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said: “If I send you outside with one garment then would you go?” Nafi’ said: “No” Ibn Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said: “Does Allah deserve (is entitled to) that beauty is chosen (for Him) or for people?” Nafi’ said: “Allah.” Then Ibn Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said: “The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) or Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said: “If anyone of you have 2 garments then pray in them. (at-Tamhid (6/371) and its chain is authentic)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Also see as-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi ((2/236) and its chain is authentic) Sharh Ma’anil Athar at- Tahawi (1/377) Majmo Fatawa Ibn Taymiyyah ((22/117) and its wording is [Gharib])</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) It is allowed for a man to pray with nothing on his head. However except when performing Hajj or Umrah, it is better to have a cap (hat), handkerchief, turban or cloth on his head. Refer to my Hadayatul Muslimin hadith (no.10)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The women should cover their whole bodies except their faces when they perform the prayer at home. When other men are present the women should cover their faces. This is better and more virtuous, see at-Tamhid (6/364)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">In Defence of Yazid ibn Mu’awiyyah</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">(Rahimahullah)</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Series Part 17 / Part 3</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">By</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Series Compilers, Translated and Annotated</span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haafidh Ibn Katheer said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“</em><em>The people from all of the lands pledged their allegiance<span id="more-275"></span> (to Yazeed)”</em> (al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 8/79)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abdullaah Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Three years after the tragedy of Karbala when the people of Madina began to revolt with Abdullaah Ibn Zubair the Shaikh of the companions Abdullaah Ibn Umar severely censured this and openly announced his dissatisfaction and complete dissociation from such people</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Narrated by Nafi’ When the people of Medina dethroned Yazid bin Muawiya, Ibn ‘Umar gathered his special friends and children and said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I heard the Prophet saying, ‘A flag will be fixed for every betrayer on the Day of Resurrection,’and we have given the oath of allegiance to this person (Yazid) in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Allah and His Apostle and I do not know of anything more faithless than fighting a person who has been given the oath of allegiance in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Allah and His Apostle , and if ever I learn that any person among you has agreed to dethrone Yazid, by giving the oath of allegiance (to somebody else) then there will be separation between him and me.”</em> (Saheeh al-Bukhaari  Volume 9, Book 88, Number 227)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has been reported on the authority of Nafi, that ‘Abdullah b. Umar </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>paid a visit to Abdullah b. Muti’ in the days (when atrocities were perpetrated on the People Of Medina) at Harra in the time of Yazid b. Mu’awiya. Ibn Muti’ said: Place a pillow for Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman (family name of ‘Abdullah bin Umar But the latter said: I have not come to sit with you. I have come to you to tell you a tradition I heard from the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam). I heard him say: One who withdraws his band from obedience (to the Amir) will find no argument (in his defence) when he stands before Allaah on the Day of Judgment, and one who dies without having bound himself by an oath of allegiance (to an Amir) will die the death of one belonging to the days of Jahillyya.</em> (Saheeh Muslim No. 4562)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we find from these nariations from the Bukhaari and muslim clearly that Ameer Yazeed was the legitimate and agreed upon caliph.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abdullaah Ibn Abbaas (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">When he found out about the death of Mu’awiyyah he continued to supplicate for him for a long time and began to mention his virtues and then said </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“for verily his son Yazeed is from amongst the righteous from his household you people should stay there and pledge your allegiance later he went himself and pledged his allegiance.”</em>(Balazaaeee 4/4, al-Imaamah was-Siyaasah 1/202)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah bin Abee Taalib (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Yes the son of Alee bin Abee Taalib and the brother of Hassan and Hussain (Radhiallaahu Anhuma), when the people around him continued to feed him lies and deceits about Ameer Yazeed with the intent of getting him to revolt but when he refused to do so the people around him started to attribute alcohol drinking, abandoning the prayer and carelessness towards the religion to Yazeed. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah answered them by saying </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I did not find the things in himself which you have attributed to him, I have been to him myself and stayed with him and I found that he always prayed and seeking the truth in matters of fiqh and strongly adhering to the Sunnah”</em> (al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 8/233, al-Muntaqa 1/281)L</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah went a step further and began to debate and argue with the people who attributed such heinous claims about Ameer Yazeed, hence Haafidh Ibn katheer mentions, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“When Muhammad Ibn Hanafiyyah was asked to abandon his pledge of allegiance which he had given to Yazeed, he strongly rejected it and in support of Ameer Yazeed he argued and debated with them and refuted their allegations of drinking alcohol and his abandoning of the prayer.”</em> (al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 8/218)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Imam Ahmad</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Qadhee Abu Bakr Ibn Arabee said Imaam Ahmad has mentioned Ameer Yazeed in Kitaab az-Zuhd after the companions but before the taabieens which shows he was free from these allegations he said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“this is an evidence that he ie yawed had a great status according to Imaam Ahmad as he included him in his list of pious companions and taabieen and they are from those whose statements are followed and from whose admonitions one seeks guidance and he has mentioned him with them. So what basis do the allegations of him drinking alcohol and openly sinning have in comparison to his status which the historians have mentioned, do these people not have any shame.”</em> (al-Awaasim Minal Qawaasim 1/233)</span></p>
