<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[116] From Malik from Ishaq Ibn Abdillah Ibn Abi Talha from Anas Ibn Malik (Radi Allahu Anhu) he said, &#8220;Abu Talha (Radi Allahu Anhu) had more property of date-palm trees gardens than any other amongst the Ansar in Medina and the most beloved of them to him was Bairuha garden, and it was in front of the Masjid of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) used to go there and used to drink its nice sweet water.&#8221; Anas (Radi Allahu Anhu) added, &#8220;When these ayat were revealed &#8216;By no means shall you Attain righteousness unless You spend (in charity) of that Which you love. &#8216; (Sura no.3 al-Imran aya no.92) </strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>Abu Talha (Radi Allahu Anuh) said to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam)! Allah, the Blessed, the Superior says in the Quran: &#8220;By no means shall you attain righteousness, unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.&#8221; </strong></span><span style="color: #000080"><strong>(Sura no.3 al-Imran aya no.92)</strong></span><span style="color: #000080"><strong> And no doubt, Bairuha garden is the most beloved of all my property to me. So I want to give it in charity in Allah&#8217;s Cause and I hope its reward from Allah. O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam)! Spend it where Allah makes you think it feasible.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, &#8216;Bravo! It is a useful property. I have heard what you have said (O Abu Talha), and I think it would be proper if you gave it to your family and relatives.&#8217; So Abu Talha (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, I will do so, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam).&#8217; Then Abu Talha (Radi Allahu Anhu) distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his cousins (paternal uncle&#8217;s sons).&#8221;</strong></span></h4>

<span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (2/995, 996 hadith no.1940, book 58, chapter 1, hadith no.2), at-Tamhid (1/198) and al-Istidhkar (no.1877) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.1461, no.2752) and Muslim (42/998) from the hadith of Malik</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) This hadith shows the tremendous virtue of Abu Talha (Radi Allahu Anhu). He spent his most beloved wealth in the path of Allah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) The noble companions were always ready to sacrifice their wealth and lives for the sake of the Quran and Sunnah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) You should give preference to your close relatives when it comes to good deeds, keeping the ties of kinship, honoring, good behavior and charity. This is the best thing to do.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) Having love for wealth is a natural thing on the condition that it does not go against the Sharia. Making plantations etc. and letting the noble scholars benefit from it is all allowed. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) It is allowed to act upon the general meaning unless there is a specific proof which gives an exception. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) Whosoever gives something in charity will not have the right to ask for it back in return. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) You should spend the best things in the path of Allah, whether that is wealth or your life and therefore you should choose the best and most intelligent people to teach religious knowledge to your children.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">8) The action of Abu Talha (Radi Allahu Anhu) is one of the best commentaries on the blessed ayah , &#8220;By no means shall you Attain righteousness&#8230;&#8221; Subhan Allah</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">9) The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) commanded Abu Talha (Radi Allahu Anhu) to distribute his wealth to his close relatives. The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam&#8217;s) amazing amount of generosity is established from this. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 1/244, 245 hadith no.579, book 17, chapter 1, hadith no.2), at-Tamhid (13/113), al-Istidhkar: (no.533)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.1459) from the hadith of Malik</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, &#8220;There is no Ushar on a crops (measure, food, grain etc.) or dates except when they reach a quantity of five wasaq and there is no zakah on silver except when it reaches a quantity of two hundred dirhams.&#8221; (Sharh Ma&#8217;ani al-Athar of at-Tahawi 2/35 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Hasan]</em> good) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Abdul Bar has said that this is a prestigious sunnah and is regarded as being accepted by everyone. (at-Tamhid 20/136) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) 1 wasaq is equivalent to 7 sa&#8217;a and 1 hijazi sa&#8217;a is equivalent to 5.3 pounds which equals 2kg 99g 520mg. See Mawlana Faruq Asgar Sarim&#8217;s book &#8220;Islami Awzan (The Islamic weight measurements)&#8221; (pg. 59) there is a difference of opinion on the correct weight of a sa&#8217;a from the scholars of the truth therefore it is better to round it up to 2.5kg when giving the charity so you are free from doubts and Allah knows best. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) There are fourty dirhams in 1 uqiya which is equivalent to 472g to 1220g. See Islami Awzan pg. 21</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) Zakah becomes obligatory after 1 full year</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) From the 2nd point above it is established that it is not necessary to give the ushur if the amount of crops (measure) is below 750kg or according to another opinion 630 kg. Ushur becomes obligatory after reaching the mentioned limits. Also see hadith no.402</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Essential Q &amp; A’s regarding Zakaat Al-Fitr</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Rulings &amp; Wisdoms</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is incumbent upon every Muslim to seek knowledge and learn, more so before a particular act of worship is obligated upon him. Below is a concise summary of the basic rulings of Zakaat Al-Fitr.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What is Zakaat Al-Fitr?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Zakaat al-Fitr is an obligatory charity during Fitr i.e. when the fasting of Ramadhan is broken with Eid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What is the wisdom behind Zakaat Al-Fitr?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) beautifully explained the wisdom for the obligation of Zakaat Al-Fitr, he said:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“It is purification for a fasting person, from idle talk and false speech, and also to feed the poor.”</em> [1]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">i.e. despite a fasting person trying his best to stay away from false speech during fasting, however sometimes he may fall short. Therefore, Zakaat Al-Fitr is a purification from this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is also a way of us showing our gratitude to our Lord, who bestowed upon us Ramadhan and allowed us to live till Eid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Who needs to pay Zakaat Al-Fitr?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) obligated Zakaat Al-Fitr</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>…on the Muslims, free or a slave, male or female, young or old.”</em> [2]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is an obligation upon every Muslim, however the responsibility falls on the head of the household such as the father or husband, to donate it on behalf of his dependants. This is assuming they have enough food for themselves.</span></p>
<p>It is not obligated to pay Zakaah Al-Fitr on behalf of a foetus, however it is recommended and desired.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What should be donated?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa salaam obligated Zakaat al-Fitr to be given</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“a Saa’ of dates, a Saa’ of barley…”</em> [3]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree narrates that the companions</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“would give Zakaat al-Fitr on behalf of every young and adult, the free and enslaved in the era of the Messenger of Allah one Saa’ of staple foodstuff…”</em> [4]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The above &#8211; and other narrations &#8211; show us that Zakaat Al-Fitr should be donated in the form of the staple food of one’s locality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How much should be donated?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The measure used at the time of the Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) was a Saa’. [5]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In modern measurements this relates to:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rice: 2.3kgs Raisins: 1.64kgs</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dates: 1.8kgs Wheat: 2.04kgs</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Lentils 2.1kgs Flour: 2.06kgs</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Couscous 1.8kgs [6]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From the above measurements we can see that Zakaat Al-Fitr ranges from 1.5kgs to 2.5kgs approximately depending on the type of food. For this reason, the scholars have recommended for 3kgs of food to be given as a matter of caution. [7]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How is it given and to whom?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Zakaat al-Fitr is given to any poor person who cannot afford his daily food for himself and his family. There are three possibilities for Zakaat Al-Fitr:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The correct measure of food should be given to poor people in your locality. This is the Sunnah and it fulfils the objective of community cohesion.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">If poor people are not found in one’s community, then the correct measure of food can be transferred to a different community or country, especially if the poor are relatives.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, if none of the above are possible, then a person should give the monetary value of food, this is not from the Sunnah however it is done for a particular need or benefit. [8]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How should it be given?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From the above it is clear that the best practice is to give it directly to the poor in one’s locality. A person should include his wife and children in every step of the donation – buying the food, each child measuring their own quantity, packaging it and finally donating it to the poor.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, we should also be sensitive to the poor who are receiving the Zakaat, that they are not to be made to feel belittled, therefore where appropriate anonymity can be maintained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Why is it given to the poor specifically?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Eid is a day of happiness and festivities, and nobody should feel left out on such a day. For this reason, essential food items are distributed to the poor without them asking. It is also encouraged for Muslims to give gifts and honour the poor in other appropriate ways.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>When should it be given?</strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The best time to donate the Zakaat Al-Fitr is before the Eid prayer, however it can be given earlier by a day or two especially if it is felt that it may not reach the poor in time. If it is delayed until after the Eid Prayer, it is no longer considered as Zakaah, but mere charity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“Whoever donates the Zakaah before the Eid Prayer then it is an accepted form of Zakaah, and whoever gives it after the Prayer it is a Sadaqah.”</em> [9]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Allaah knows best; May peace and blessings be upon our beloved Prophet, his family and companions.</em></span></p>

Is it permitted unrestrictedly? Is it forbidden unrestrictedly? Is it permitted in some instances to do a need or a benefit?There are three opinions [as above] in the Madhhab of Imaam Ahmad and others. [The last opinion] is the most just and fair.” </em>[Majmoo’ Al-Fataawa 25/79]</span></p>

Then they asked him again, and he gave to them until he used up what he had. Then he said, &#8220;What wealth I have, I will not hoard from you. Whoever has forbearance, Allah will help him.

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The best manner is that the one who is in need shouldn&#8217;t ask and should rather have patience and trust (in Allah) in all matters.

<h5 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000080">Amir Ibn Sa’d: One Hadith</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[68] From Malik from Ibn Shihab from Amir Ibn Sa&#8217;d Ibn Abu Waqas from his father </strong><strong>Sa`d Ibn Abi Waqas: </strong><strong><strong>That he said, &#8220;In the year of the last Hajj of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) I became seriously ill and the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) used to visit me inquiring about my health. I told him, &#8216;I am reduced to this state because of illness and I am wealthy and have no inheritors except a daughter. Should I give two-thirds of my property in charity?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Half?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; then he added, &#8216;One third, and even one-third is much. You&#8217;d better leave your inheritors wealthy rather than leaving them poor, begging others. You will get a reward for whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s sake, even for what you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam)! Will I be left alone after my companions have gone?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If you are left behind, whatever good deeds you will do will upgrade you and raise you high. And perhaps you will have a long life so that some people (Muslims) will be benefited by you while others (non-Muslims) will be harmed by you. O Allah! Complete the emigration of my companions and do not turn them renegades.&#8217; But Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) felt sorry for poor Sa`d Ibn Khaula as he died in Mecca.&#8221; (but Sa`d Ibn Abi Waqas lived long after the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) </strong></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [SAHIH]</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri clarified hearing (this hadith from Amir Ibn Sa’d Ibn Abi Waqas) in Bukhari (no.56) and Humaydi (no.66)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>[REFERENCES] – [BUKHARI]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration 2/763 hadith no.1533, book 17, chapter 3, hadith no.4), at-Tamhid (8/374, 375), al-Istidhkar: (no.1462)          </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Bukhari (no.1295) from the hadith of Malik and Muslim (no.1628) from the hadith of Zuhri.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">From the narration of Yahya Ibn Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">1) In the will for the heirs only one third of the wealth is allowed to be given (to charity or gifts). It is not allowed to exceed this except if there is no heir then some scholars say it is allowed to give all the wealth to charity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) In this narration some narrators have said, &#8220;year of the conquest” instead of the farewell Hajj however what is most correct is that this event happened at the farewell Hajj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) Whatever charity, gifts or freeing of slaves is done during the death bed (illness before death) then this will be from the one third that is allowed to be left behind (given).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) Allocating from the Qu&#8217;ran is allowed from the authentic hadiths because this hadith has made the general ruling for wills to become specific.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) Some scholars have said that more than one third can be given in the will on the condition that the heirs consent to it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) If the person who is dying is poor then it is better for him not to give one third of his wealth away in his will and rather leave it for his relatives so that they don’t end up begging other people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) If the one who is virtuous is ill then the Sunnah is that a virtuous person should visit him during his illness. Jabir Ibn Abdullah al-Ansari (Radi Allahu Anhu) narrates that the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, “Whoever visits a sick person then he enters into mercy and when he sits down then he becomes enveloped  in (mercy).” (al-Adab al-Mufrad of Bukhari no.522, and its chain is [Hasan] good and there is another route in Ahmad 3/304, Ibn Hibban in his Sahih no.711, al-Hakim 1/350, al-Bazar no.775 and its chain is [Hasan] good)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) The foundations and pillars of actions are intentions. Whatever is spent for the sake of Allah then you will be rewarded with it. Insha Allah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">9) Spending money on your family and near relatives and helping them as much as you can (with what you can afford) is from charity also where reward will be obtained Insha Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">10) Apart from the Majestic Qu&#8217;ran, the noble Prophet (Sallalaahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) received another type of revelation because of his saying, “because of you a group of people (a nation) will receive benefit from you and another people (nation) will receive loss” is news about the unseen (future events) whereby who and from is completed. Sa’d Ibn Abi Waqas (Radi Allahu Anhu) lived after the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and he conquered Iran whereby the Muslims gained benefit and the disbelievers gained a loss. Only Allah knows the unseen (future events) therefore it has become established that Allah had told the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) about this. Wal Hamdullilah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">From this hadith there are numerous other benefits that are known. For example the muhajir (one who migrates to another land) can’t come back to live in his homeland again. It is allowed to write about or say about lamenting over the death of a Muslim brother, on the condition that the lamenting has no extravagance, magnification and lies. So it is Sunnah to regret (have sorrow) and have a sympathetic express over distress and the original distress (affliction) is the loss in religion and (good) deeds. Etc. </span></p>
