				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><strong>قال ابن المخَلِّص:ـ</strong><br />
<strong>حدثنا أبو الفضل شعيب بن محمد بن الراجيان قال: حدثنا علي بن حرب الطائي الموصلي بسر من رأى في سنة تسع وخمسين ومئتين قال: سمعت شعيب بن حرب يقول: قلت: لأبي عبد الله سفيان بن سعيد بن منذر الثوري: حدثني بحديث من السنة ينفعني الله تعالى به، فإذا وقفت بين يدي الله وساءلني عنه فقال لي: من أين أخذت هذا؟ قلت: يا رب حدثني به سفيان الثوري فأخذته عنه، فأنجو أنا وتؤخذ أنت، فقال لي سفيان: يا شعيب، هذا توكيد وأي توكيد، اكتب: بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم، القرآن كلام الله غير مخلوق، منه بدأ وإليه يعود، ومن قال غير هذا فهو كافر. والإيمان قول وعمل ونية، يزيد وينقص، يزيد بالطاعة وينقص بالمعصية، ولا يجوز القول إلا بالعمل، ولا يجوز القول والعمل إلا بالنية، ولا يجوز القول والعمل والنية إلا بموافقة السنة. قال شعيب: فقلت: يا أبا عبد الله، وما موافقة السنة؟ قال: تقدمة الشيخين أبي بكر وعمر رضي الله عنهما، يا شعيب، لاينفعك ما كتبت حتى تقدم عثمان وعليا على من بعدهما. يا شعيب بن حرب، لا ينفعك ماكتبت لك حتى لا تشهد لأحد بجنة ولا نار إلا العشرة الذين شهد لهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، وكلهم من قريش. يا شعيب بن حرب، لا ينفعك ما كتبت لك حتى ترى المسح على الخفين دون خلعهما أعدل عندك من غسل قدميك. يا شعيب بن حرب، لا ينفعك ما كتبت لك حتى يكون إخفاء بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم في الصلاة أفضل عندك من أن تجهر بها. يا شعيب بن حرب، لا ينفعك الذي كتبت حتى تؤمن بالقدر خيره وشره حلوه ومره كل من عند الله، يا شعيب بن حرب والله ما قالت القدرية ما قال الله، ولا ما قالت الملائكة، ولا ما قال النبيون، ولا ما قال أهل الجنة، ولا ما قال أهل النار، ولا ما قال أخوهم إبليس لعنه الله تعالى، قال الله تعالى: {أفرأيت من اتخذ إلهه هواه وأضله الله على علم وختم على سمعه وقلبه وجعل على بصره غشاوة فمن يهديه من بعد الله أفلا تذكرون} [الجاثية: ٢٣] ، وقال تعالى: {وما يشاؤن إلا أن يشاء الله} [الإنسان: ٣٠] ، وقالت الملائكة: {سبحانك لا علم لنا إلا ما علمتنا إنك أنت العليم الحكيم} [البقرة: ٣٢] ، وقال موسى عليه السلام: {إن هي إلا فتنتك تضل بها من تشاء وتهدي من تشاء} [الأعراف: ١٥٥]، وقال نوح عليه السلام: {ولا ينفعكم نصحي إن أردت أن أنصح لكم إن كان الله يريد أن يغويكم هو ربكم وإليه ترجعون} [هود: ٣٤]، وقال شعيب عليه السلام: {وما يكون لنا أن نعود فيها إلا أن يشاء الله ربنا وسع ربنا كل شيء علما} [الأعراف: ٨٩]، وقال أهل الجنة: {الحمد لله الذي هدانا لهذا وما كنا لنهتدي لولا أن هدانا الله} [الأعراف: ٤٣]، وقال أهل النار: {ربنا غلبت علينا شقوتنا وكنا قوما ضالين} [المؤمنون: ١٠٦] ، وقال أخوهم إبليس: {رب بمآ أغويتني} [الحجر: ٣٩]. يا شعيب، لا ينفعك ما كتبت حتى ترى الصلاة خلف كل بر وفاجر، والحج والجهاد ماض إلى يوم القيامة، والصبر تحت لواء السلطان جار أم عدل، قال شعيب: قلت لسفيان: يا أبا عبدالله، الصلاة كلها؟ قال: لا ولكن صلاة الجمعة والعيدين، صل خلف من أدركت، وأما سائر ذلك فأنت مخير ألا تصل إلا خلف من تثق به وتعلم أنه من أهل السنة والجماعة. يا شعيب بن حرب، إذا وقفت بين يدي الله تعالى فسألك عن هذا الحديث فقل: حدثني بهذا الحديث سفيان بن سعيد الثوري، ثم خل بيني وبين ربي يا شعيب</strong> <em>[المخلصيات ٤/٨٠-٨٣]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Shu&#8217;ayb bin Ḥarb (D. 197) said:<br />
I told Abū &#8216;abd Allāh Sufyān bin Sa&#8217;īd bin Mundhir al-Thawrī (D. 161), Inform me something from the Sunnah by which Allah, the High, will benefit me so when I stand before Allah and He asks me about it and tells me &#8216;from where did you get this?&#8217; I would say &#8216;O Rabb, Sufyān al-Thawrī informed me about it so I took it from him&#8217; therefore I would be saved and you would take (the burden). So Sufyān told me: O Shu&#8217;ayb, this is an assurance and what assurance (is greater)? Write (down):<br />
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Quran is the Speech of Allah, uncreated. From Him it began, and to Him it returns. Whoever says otherwise is a disbeliever.</strong></li>
<li><strong>And Iman (Faith) is statement, action, and intention. It increases and decreases; it increases with obedience and decreases with disobedience.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A statement is not valid without action. Statement and action are not valid without intention. And statement, action, and intention are not valid unless they conform to the Sunnah.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shu&#8217;ayb said: So I said, O Abū &#8216;abd Allāh, what is conforming to the Sunnah? He said: Giving precedence to the two Shaykhs, Abu Bakr and Umar (over others), may Allah be pleased with them.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>O Shu&#8217;ayb bin Ḥarb, what you have written will not benefit you until you give precedence to Uthman and Ali over those who came after them.</strong></li>
<li><strong>O Shu&#8217;ayb bin Ḥarb, what you have written will not benefit you until you do not testify for any (individual) for Paradise or Hellfire except the ten whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم testified for them and all of them are from Quraysh</strong></li>
<li><strong>O Shu&#8217;ayb bin Ḥarb, what you have written will not benefit you until you consider wiping over the Khuffayn (leather socks) without removing them more preferable to you than washing your feet.</strong></li>
<li><strong>O Shu&#8217;ayb bin Ḥarb, what you have written will not benefit you until whispering Bismillāh al-Raḥmān al-Raḥīm in prayer is better to you than reciting it aloud</strong></li>
<li><strong>O Shu&#8217;ayb bin Ḥarb, what you have written will not benefit you until you believe in Qadar its good and its bad, its sweet and its bitter – all of it is from Allah.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>O Shu&#8217;ayb bin Ḥarb, by Allah, the Qadariyyah did not say what Allah said, nor what the Angels said, nor what the Prophets said, nor what the people of Paradise said, nor what the people of Hellfire said, nor what their brother Iblīs said, may Allah, the High, curse him.<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allah, the High said: <em>&#8220;Have you seen him who takes his own desire as his god, and Allah knowing (him as such), left him astray, and sealed his hearing and his heart, and put a covering on his sight? Who then will guide him after Allah? Will you not then remember?&#8221;</em> </strong>[al-Jāthiyah 45:23]<strong><br />
and He, the High, said: <em>&#8220;And you do not will except as Allah wills.&#8221;</em> </strong>[al-Insān 76:30]</li>
<li><strong>the Angels said: <em>&#8220;<span class="citation-0 citation-end-0">Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Verily, it is You, the All-Knower, the</span> All-Wise.&#8221;</em> </strong>[al-Baqarah 2:32]<strong><br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mūsā عليه السلام said: <em>&#8220;It is only Your trial by which You lead astray whom You will, and keep guided whom You will.&#8221; </em></strong>[al-A&#8217;rāf 7:155]</li>
<li><strong>Nūḥ عليه السلام said: <em>&#8220;<span id="verse_1507_language_6_content">And my advice will not benefit you &#8211; although I wished to advise you &#8211; <span class="ttc">if Allah wants to lead you to stray</span>. He is your Rabb, and to Him you will be returned.</span>&#8220;</em> </strong>[Hūd 11:34]</li>
<li><strong>Shu&#8217;ayb عليه السلام said: <em>&#8220;We would not (ever) revert back to it unless Allah, our <span id="verse_1507_language_6_content">Rabb</span>, wills it so; indeed our <span id="verse_1507_language_6_content">Rabb</span> encompasses everything with (His) Knowledge&#8221;</em> </strong>[al-A&#8217;rāf 7:89]</li>
<li><strong>the people of Paradise said: <em>&#8220;All praise is for Allah, Who has guided us to this, and never could we have found guidance, were it not that Allah had guided us&#8221;</em> </strong>[al-A&#8217;rāf 7:43]</li>
<li><strong>the people of Hellfire said: <em>&#8220;<span id="verse_2779_language_6_content">Our <span id="verse_1507_language_6_content">Rabb</span>, our wretchedness overcame us, and we were a people astray.</span>&#8221; </em></strong>[al-Muminūn 23:106]</li>
<li><strong>and their brother Iblīs said: <em>&#8220;<span class="ttc">O my <span id="verse_1507_language_6_content">Rabb</span>! Because you misled me</span>&#8221; </em></strong>[al-Hijr 15:39]</li>
<li><strong>O Shu&#8217;ayb, what you have written will not benefit you until you view praying behind every righteous and wicked person.<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>And that Ḥajj and Jihād will continue until the Day of Resurrection.</strong></li>
<li><strong>And patience under the banner of the ruler, whether he is unjust or just.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I said, O Abū &#8216;abd Allāh, all of the prayers? He said: No, but the Jumu&#8217;ah and two &#8216;Eids. Pray (them) behind whomever you find. But apart from that, then you have a choice if you do not want to pray except behind one you trust and know that he is from Ahlus sunnah wa al-Jamā&#8217;ah<br />
O Shu&#8217;ayb bin Ḥarb, If you stand before Allah, the High, and He asks you about this information then say &#8216;</strong><strong>Sufyān bin Sa&#8217;īd al-Thawrī informed me about this&#8217; then leave the matter between me and my Lord, O Shu&#8217;ayb </strong><em>[al-Mukhalliṣiyyāt 4/80-83; Isnād Ḥasan]</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>by </strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaymah Ansari</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">This statement shows the Manhaj of the Salaf regarding the innovators and their interaction with the rulers. Although we cannot derive legal rulings or establish a specific Manhaj from this single statement, it does however show the view of one venerated Salaf (although there are others – see further points). Likewise, the early scholars of hadith used this statement for theological and methodological conclusions as evidenced by them in transmitting it in their respective early books of Aqidah and Manhaj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">It is of equal importance and something by the way of thought provoking to individuals who adhere to the ‘card’ of <strong>“the salaf differed over certain matter”</strong> when it comes to the rulers. As Salafis, we do not endorse unrestricted blind praise for rulers, but this report further adds to the scope of discussion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Two affairs are encompassed in this statement which are a reminder to those who exert time and effort in reinventing religious trends when the Salaf established them for us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Imam Abu Amr Ubadah bin Nusayyin al-Kindi (d.118H)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">He was from the Tabi’in who died in 118H. Imam Ibn Hibban said in his <em>ath-Thiqat</em> he died when he was young. (<em>Tahdhib ut-Tahdhib</em> (2/287) (ar-Rislaah). Imam Ibn Sa’d said about him, <em>“He was thiqah and died in 118H during the reign of the Khaliph Hisham bin Abdul Malik.”</em> (<em>Tabaqat Ibn Sa’d</em> (9/459 no.4686) (Khanji). Imams Ahmad, al-Nasa’i, Ibn Ma’in, Ijli and Ibn Numayr all declared him thiqah (<em>Tahdhib ut-Tahdhib</em> (2/286-287).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Ghaylan bin Muslim was from the founding members of deviant Qadari sect. Hisham bin Abdul Malik was the Umayyad ruler.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>The Statement</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>“A man came to Ubadah bin Nusayyin and said, “The leader of the believers, Hisham cut Ghaylan’s hands and feet and executed him.” He said, “Is what you say true”? He replied, “Yes.” Ubadah said, “By Allah he acted in accordance with the Sunnah and applied the correct judgement, I will write to the leader of the believers and praise him for his actions.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Transmitted by</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(1) al-Firyabi, <em>Kitab al-Qadr</em> (p.216 no.285) (Dar Ibn Hazm)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(2) Abu Zur’ah ad-Dimashqi, <em>at-Tarikh</em> (p.161-162 no.800) (DKI)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(3) Ibn Battah, <em>al-Ibanatul Kubra</em>, Kitab ath-Thani (2/239 no.1851) (Darul Rayah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(4) Al-Ajurri, <em>Kitabush-Shari’ah</em> (2/922 no.517) (Madar al-Watan)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(5) Al-Lalaka’i, <em>Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnah Wa’l Jama’ah</em> (4/526 no.1165) (Dar un-Nasihah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(6) At-Tabarani, <em>Musnad ash-Shamiyin</em> (3/266 no.2228) (ar-Risalah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(7) Ibn Asakir, <em>Tarikh ad-Dimashq</em> (26/218, 48/212) (Dar ul-Fikr)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(8) Ibn Hajr, <em>Lisan ul-Mizan</em> (2/6/314 no.6009) (Dar ul-Basha’ir)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Benefits</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(1) Expressing happiness and rejoicing when innovators die, and this refers to the callers to innovation and active ardent supporters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(2) Verifying news and making sure reports and incidents are true and accurate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(3) Communicating the truth by endorsing and openly agreeing with judgements and rulings according to the Quran and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(4) Judging and weighing all actions according to the Sunnah, whether it’s the general Muslims or the rulers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(5) Praising the rulers for their actions that coincide and conform to the affairs of the Sunnah and those which aid Islam by refuting and curb the incursion of the deviant innovators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(6) The Salaf did praise the rulers as those who equally reprimanded their evil in accordance with the constraints of the Sunnah. We do not intend by this that you start a fan club but intelligently acknowledge that if you quote statements of openly rebuking the rulers you also have statements which praise the rulers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(7) The writing of Ubadah to Hisham shows the scholars of the Salaf communicated with the rulers through writing. If in this example it is was for praise, then it is also a given they would have written to advise them on other matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Further Benefits</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(1) Scholars like Numayr bin Aws, a Qadhi from Dimashq also wrote to Hisham congratulating him on executing Ghaylan (al-Uqayli, <em>Kitab adh-Dhu’afa al-Kabir</em> (3/437) (Dar ul-Baz).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(2) Raja’ bin Haywah also wrote to Hisham praising him for his actions. (<em>Kitab adh-Dhu’afa al-Kabir</em> (3/436), <em>Lisan ul-Mizan</em> (2/6/314)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(3) Hisham bin Abdul Malik had ordered Imam al-Awza’i to debate with Ghaylan to establish evidence against him and to refute his views. Ghaylan remained adamant on his heretical views and with the evidence established against him, he was executed due to Imam al-Awza’i’s fatwa of execution. (<em>Lisan ul-Mizan</em> (2/6/314), Muhammad Ibn Abd Rabbah, <em>al-Iqd al-Farid</em> (2/193) (DKI), al-Baladhuri, <em>Ansab al-Ashraf</em> (8/419)(Dar ul-Fikr).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">(4) Maymun bin Mihran, Iyas bin Mu’awiyyah a judge in Basrah, and Rabi’ah al-Ra’y also a judge all debated Ghaylan before the reign of Hisham but under the rule of the Umayyads and at their behest. (at-Tabari, <em>Tarikh ar-Rasul</em> (7/203) (Dar ul-Ma’arif), <em>Ansab al-Ashraf</em> (8/390), Ibn Kathir, <em>al-Bidayah Wan-Nihayah </em>(9/349) (DKI), <em>al-Iqd al-Farid</em> (2/191-192), Abu Nu’aym, <em>Hilyatul Awliya</em> (3/260) (al-Maktabah as-Salafiyyah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">So, I hope based on fairness and the bravery of the new mujaddids they can ascribes labels such as ‘sell-outs’ to the Imams and scholars cited above.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah al-Rajihi said in his explanation of <em>Asal as-Sunnah wa I’tiqad ud-Din</em> wherein Imam Ibn Abi Hatim mentions from Imams Abu Hatim Razi and Abu Zur’ah ar-Razi,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[11]</strong> <strong>Allah, The Blessed and Exalted, will be seen in the Hereafter; the People of Jannah will see Him with their sights.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The believers will see their Rabb, The Exalted, as transmitted by texts from the Book of Allah and the Prophets Sunnah. So, Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah affirm the believers will see Allah with their sight in the Hereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Affirming the seeing of Allah on the Day of Resurrection is an attribute which is disputed between Ahlus Sunnah and the people of innovation. The same applies to the attribute of Kalam – Speech and the attribute of Uluww and Istiwa – Highness and rising over the Throne.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These three attributes are a distinguishing sign and a distinction between Ahlus Sunnah and Ahlul Bid’ah. So, whoever affirms these attributes is from Ahlus Sunnah and whoever rejects them is from Ahlul Bid’ah. Whoever affirms Allah’s Istiwa – rising over The Throne and his Highness over his creation, and whoever affirms Allah’s speech is with words [with] meaning, sound and letters and whoever affirms the seeing of Allah in the Hereafter is from Ahlus Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The believer has the Aqidah that Allah will be seen in the Hereafter and the believers will see Allah with their eyesight. This is established and proven from the texts of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[Evidence from the Quran and Sunnah Affirming the Seeing of Allah]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Quran says,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> “On that Day some faces will be bright, looking at their Lord.” (Surah al-Qiyamah: 22-23)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He added they will be looking at his Face by the addition of “ila” denoting they will be looking at the Face of Allah, The Magnificent with the eye(s) of their face (i.e. head). So, the statement of Allah is free of any factors that oppose the true reality of this matter. This then proves the believers will see Allah with their eyesight.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Glorious said,<strong> “There they will have whatever they desire, and with Us is even more.” (Surah Qaf: 35)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The explanation of this ayah mentions, <strong>“Mazid – Even more”</strong> means looking at the face of Allah, The Benevolent.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Allah the Glorious said,<strong> “Those who do good will have the finest reward<sup>1</sup>and </strong><strong>˹</strong><strong>even</strong><strong>˺</strong><strong> more.” (Surah Yunus: 26)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“Ziyadah – even more”</strong> means looking at the face of Allah, The Benevolent. This is proven and established from the explanation of this as mentioned in <em>Sahih Muslim</em> when the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was asked about az-Ziyadah he said, <em>“</em><em>Looking at their Rabb.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> “Undoubtedly, they will be veiled from their Rabb on that Day.” (Surah al-Mutaffifin: 15)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning the disbelievers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imam ash-Shafi’i used this ayah as evidence to affirm the believers will see Allah in the Hereafter. He said, <em>“When Allah veiled them in anger, then there is evidence in this that they will see Him in delight.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, when the disbelievers were veiled, it proves the believers will see Allah. If they (the believers) do not see Allah, they and their detractors would be in a state of confusion regarding the veiling.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, and similarly, there are texts in the Mutawatir Sunnah that affirm the seeing of Allah. Allamah ibn al-Qayyim said, <em>“As for the ahadith from the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and his Companions which evidence the seeing of Allah are mutawatir.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> and he followed this up by transmitting 30 such reports in Hadi al-Arwah.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From such reports are the following,</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Abu Hurayrah RadiAllahu Anhu when a group of Companions said, <em>&#8220;Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam! Will we see our Rabb on the Day of Resurrection?” The Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said, “Do you have any difficulty seeing the Moon when it is a full moon?” They said, “No, Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.” He said, “Do you have difficulty seeing the Sun when there are no clouds?” They said, “No, Oh Allah&#8217;s Messenger Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.” He said, “So you will see Him in the same way…”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><strong>[5]</strong></a> </em></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Hadith of Jarir bin Abdullah al-Bajali RadiAllahu Anhu when the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw the moon on the 14<sup>th</sup> night he said, <em>“</em><em>Certainly you will see your Rabb as you see this moon and you will have no trouble in seeing Him.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Abu Musa al-Ash’ari RadhiAllahu Anhu who narrates from the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who said, <em>“(There will be) two Paradises of silver and all the utensils and whatever is therein; and two Paradises of gold, and its utensils and whatever therein, and there will be nothing to prevent the people from seeing their Rabb except the Cover of Majesty over His Face in the Paradise of Adan.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Where Will the Believers See Allah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ahlus Sunnah affirm the believers will see Allah in the Hereafter. As for seeing Allah in this world, then no one holds this to be correct. Furthermore, there is no dispute among Ahlus Sunnah in this regard (that anyone can see Allah in this world) except concerning our Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam when he ascended on the Night Journey. Ahlus Sunnah agree that he (The Prophet Sallalalhu Alayhi Wasallam) did not see Allah on earth, but they differed whether he saw Allah on the night of ascension and there are two views regarding this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[The Disagreement of the Scholars Whether the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam Saw Allah on the Night Journey and There are Two Views]</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The first view:</strong> He saw Allah with his normal eyes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The second view:</strong> He saw Allah with the eyes of his heart. This is the correct view due to the following reasons.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The statement of Ai’shah RadhiAllahu Anha when Masruq asked her, <em>“Did Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam see Allah”? She said, “My hair stood up by what you said! Then she said, “Whoever says to you that Muhammad saw Allah, has indeed lied.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Abu Dharr in <em>Sahih Muslim</em> when the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was asked did you see your Rabb (Allah) he said, <em>“Nur is all that I saw.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning, the Nur was his veiled barrier which prevented him from seeing him.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The hadith of Abu Musa RadhiAllahu Anhu from the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam who said, <em>“Allah, The Exalted and Mighty does not sleep, and it does not befit Him to sleep. He lowers and raises the scale. The deeds in the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day, and the deeds of the day before the deeds of the night. His veil is the Nur – light.” In another narration it mentions “The Fire. If he withdraws it (the veil), the splendour of His countenance would consume His creation so far as His sight reaches.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a></em></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Allah’s Messenger Sallalahu alayhi Wasallam is included in the generality of the creation of Allah, The Exalted.    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Correct View is what the Researchers (Scholars) are Upon</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(they say) the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam did not see Allah on the Night of Ascension, but he heard the speech of Allah from behind the veiled barrier without an intermediary and he spoke with Allah as Musa spoke with Allah. Allah said, <strong>“It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by Revelation, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His Leave. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise.” (Surah ash-Shura: 51).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some scholars reconciled these texts like Shaykh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> so the scholars who held the view that the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw Allah based on the report of Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma who said, <em>“He Saw His Rabb (Allah) The Exalted.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> and what is transmitted from Imam Ahmad that the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw Allah as well and including all the texts and reports which affirm the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw Allah, are taken and understood as seeing with the heart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for what has been transmitted by the way of texts and reports which negate seeing Allah, are to be taken and understood as the negation of seeing Allah with the eyes. In this way the evidence is reconciled, and it is not contradictory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Those who held the view the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam saw Allah with his eyes include an-Nawawi, al-Qurtubi and a group of other scholars.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answering the Narrations Which Mention Seeing Allah with the Eyes</strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">As for what has been transmitted from Ibn Abbas RadhiAllahu Anhuma that he said, <em>“He saw His Rabb (Allah) The Exalted.”</em> Then this is general and brief. It is also transmitted from him that he said, <em>“He saw with his heart.”</em> So, the first narration is unrestricted which the second narration is restricted or confined and the restricted is taken over the unrestricted.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly the same applies to what was transmitted from Imam Ahmad when he said, <em>“He saw (Allah)”</em> as it was transmitted from him that he said, <em>“He saw with his heart”</em>, so the restricted is taken over the unrestricted.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the seeing of Allah in this world, the scholars are agreed that no can see Allah, and no one differs with this except when our Prophet ascended on the night journey.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No consideration or importance is given to some of the people of innovation like the Sufis who say it is possible to see Allah. They engulf themselves in every danger when they believe it is possible to see Allah and this is the most futile of futilities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Seeing (wanting to see) Allah in this world is permissible but also an impossible and not a reality. It might be possible rationally but invalid and unreal according to the Shari’ah. As for the Hereafter, it is rationally permissible, valid, and real according to the Shari’ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The evidence that supports the view that seeing Allah in this world is impossible is when Musa Alayhis Salam asked Allah to see Him. He said, <strong>“Oh my Rabb! Show me (Yourself), that I may look at You.” </strong>So, if it was possible to see Allah Musa would not have asked, and so in order to see Allah he asked. However, he heard the speech of Allah and wanted more and wanted to see Allah. Allah said, <strong>“You cannot see Me.”</strong> Meaning he did not have the capable power to see Allah due to the weakness of humans. So, when he said, <strong>“Oh my Rabb! Show me (Yourself), that I may look at You.&#8221;</strong> Allah said, <strong>“but look upon the mountain; if it stands still in its place then you shall see Me.&#8221;</strong> So, when Allah appeared to the mountain it was crushed to dust and Musa fell unconscious.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> As Allah said, <strong>“So when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He made it collapse to dust, and Musa fell down unconscious. Then when he regained consciousness, he said: “Glory be to You, I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.&#8221; (Surah al-A’raf: 143)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the Salaf said, <em>“He only appeared except the size of the tip of the little finger.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the Aqidah of Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah regarding seeing Allah. As for the Day of Resurrection Allah will recreate the believers stronger and it would be possible for them to see Allah. A person decays when he dies, and he becomes dust except the tailbone.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> On the day of Resurrection Allah will send rain and the bodies of mankind will sprout. Allah restores human matter through transformation and thus recreates believers stronger which affirms the believers will see Allah. So, mankind is same of and in themselves, but their attributes have changed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>In Summary</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No one can see Allah in this world, nor the Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam or anyone else. Seeing Allah is eternal bliss for the people of Paradise, and it is the greatest pleasure given to the people of Paradise that they will see Allah, as Allah said,<strong> “Those who do good will have the finest reward and even more.” (Surah Yunus: 26) </strong>and he said<strong>, “and with Us is even more.” (Surah Qaf: 35)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, when the believers see Allah in Paradise, they will forget the eternal bliss they are in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Religious View of the People of Innovation in Seeing Allah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, concerning the people of innovation they deny the seeing of Allah in this world and in the Hereafter. This is the belief of the Jahmiyyah, the Mu’tazilah and Asha’irah</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mu’tazilah: They explain away the seeing of Allah as knowledge. They say the meaning of the statement of Allah, <em>“</em><em>So verily, you shall see your Rabb as you see the moon like on a night with a full moon.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> Meaning you will see your Rabb is to have knowledge of it without difficulty and without any doubts just as one knows the moon is the moon just as Allah says, <strong>“Have you not seen how your Rabb dealt with the owners of the Elephant?” (Surah al-Fil: 1)</strong> So, the seeing of Allah here means [having] knowledge of it i.e. meaning to have knowledge of how the owner of the elephants dealt with them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This explanation is absolutely futile and it renders the meaning invalid. The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said in a hadith. <em>“Like you see the Moon…like you see the Sun.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a> This is seeing with the eyes and not having the knowledge of seeing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the Asha’irah they affirm the seeing of Allah, but they reject the direction in which they will see Allah. They say we will see Allah but not in a specific direction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you say to them: Will you see Allah above, you? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him below you? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him on your right? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him on your left? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him in front of you? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will you see Him behind you? They say: No</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So where will you see Him? They say: We will see him but not in any direction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is batil because whatever is seen must be facing opposite to what is seeing it. This is why the intelligent people laughed and mocked the position of Asha’irah: that we will see Allah but not in a specific direction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So, with this approach they (the Asha’irah) wanted to be on the same position as the Mu’tazilah in rejecting Allah’s Uluww and direction while wanting to be on the same position of Ahlus Sunnah in affirming seeing Allah. However, they were unable to do this and resorted to arguments of sophistry, they saw these are valid arguments when they were not at all. This is the reason why the Asha’irah are hermaphrodites (transgendered) as Shaykh ul-Islam, <em>“The Mu’tazilah transgendered into philosophers and the Asha’irah transgendered into the Mu’tazilah.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Meaning they are not with them or others in the issue of seeing of Allah and the same applies to many other issues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Mu’tazilah and the Jahmiyyah reject the seeing of Allah and the Asha’irah affirm the seeing of Allah but negate the direction in which He will be seen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The correct and the true position is that of Ahlus Sunnah, that Allah will be seen on the Day of Resurrection while looking up and above. The hadith of Jabir RadhiAllahu Anhu in Sunan Ibn Majah which has some weakness to it. The Prophet Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“While the people of Paradise are enjoying their blessings, a light will shine upon them, and they will raise their heads, and they will see their Rabb looking upon them from above. He will say: &#8220;Peace be upon you, Oh people of Paradise.&#8221; This is what Allah says in the ayah: &#8220;Salam (peace be upon you) &#8211; a Word from the Rabb (Allah), The Most Merciful.&#8221; He will look at them, and they will look at Him, and they will not pay any attention to the delights (of Paradise) so long as they look at Him, until He will screen Himself from them. But His light and blessing will remain with them in their bodies.”</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This affirms the seeing of Allah while He is up and above us and it also affirms Allah’s speech.   </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">By</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Aqeel al-Hindi</span></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the charges against the people of hadith is that their role within Islamic scholastics is one of compilation and transcription of the Sunnah for its benefit as a legislative source for those with the tools who fully understand it and can use it. Those who follow this line of thought argue that the one-dimensional role of the scholars of Hadith can be juxtaposed with the more complex, intricate and cognitive role of the Fuqaha. While it is true that it <em>can</em> be the case that a memoriser of Ahadith may not have complete understanding of what they convey<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, to tar the people of hadith in their entirety with such a brush is an injustice at best and libellous at worst. As will be demonstrated in this article, the well-known scholars of Hadith were individuals whose faculties for memorisation <em>and</em> understanding of the narrations they conveyed were gifts from Allah, as their works attest to.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another result of this fallacy is the assertion that the books of Ahadith are purportedly too complex for anyone other than a scholar of fiqh to benefit from and the layperson is to be warned against reading them, for fear of misunderstanding and going astray. This categorisation of the books of the Sunnah as such lowers their status to one of repositories of information, to be accessed by the elite few who have understanding. While it is true that the people of knowledge will appreciate and gain more from the books of hadith than the layperson, the success that Allah has granted the scholars of hadith in their works, in terms of their practical abilities to compile their works, as well as the thought that went in to their works, means that their books are far more than stores of Ahadith and that the layperson can pick up one of these books and learn about the religion of Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As demonstrated in the article in issue no.4, &gt;&gt;&gt; <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/imam-al-bukhari-was-a-muwahhid-salafi-athari-not-a-muqallid-partisan-or-blind-follower-of-any-madhhab-he-was-upon-the-madhhab-of-ahlul-hadith/">Imam al-Bukhari was a Muwahhid and Salafi in his Aqidah and Manhaj</a></strong></span>. One of the sources of his Aqidah is his book, the Sahih. The oft-cited principle when reading the Sahih of Imam Bukhari is that his fiqh is understood through his chapter headings. So chapter headings and the titles of books within the Sahih give an understanding as relates to his Aqidah, which he based upon the Athar. Al-Mustamla narrated in his report of the Sahih adds to the chapter heading of the book of Tawhid, <em>‘The Book of Tawhid; a Rebuttal of the Jahmiyyah and other than them’.</em> Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar comments, under the chapter heading of Tawhid:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The intent behind the narration of al-Mustamla: and other than them” is the Qadariyyah. As for the Khawarij, that which relates to them proceeded in the Book of Fitan and the Rafidah in the Book of Ahkam. And these four groups are the heads of innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Hafiz’s words show that the Sahih of Imam al-Bukhari is rich in terms of its Aqidah-based content that rebuts the fundamentals of the major groups of deviation. This richness is not, however, restricted to Aqidah. Matters relating to the relaying of Ahadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, fiqh<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, the virtues of righteous actions<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> and other than this can be derived from the Sahih. Some of the scholars have taken this a step further by compiling works that that have been derived from the two Sahihs, al-Bukhari and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The books of Sunan, particularly Abu Dawud’s and at Tirmidhi’s, also demonstrate the understanding and the compiler’s had of the implications Ahadith carried, their relevance to the sciences of fiqh and the relative stances of the people of knowledge relating to them. Abu Dawud, for example, states in his <em>Sunan</em> after reporting the Hadith of Uthman relating the wudhu of the Prophet ﷺ,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The authentic Ahadith of Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, all indicate that wiping over the head is done once, for they (the narrators) mentioned the actions of wudhu thrice and mentioned the wiping of the head without mentioning the number of times, as they did for the other actions.</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also clarifies some meanings contained in Ahadith; <em>‘…give her food when you eat, clothe her when clothe yourself, do not strike her on the face, do not revile her or leave her except in the house’</em> Abu Dawud stated:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The meaning of ‘Do not revile her’ is to say [to her] ‘May Allah revile you.’</em><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to fiqh-based intricacies and clarifying meanings, he also explains the meanings of terminology that is not often used in Arabic (Ghara’ib) in numerous Ahadith<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The scholastic weight of Imam at Tirmidhi is equally evident in his Jam’i, as attested to by Ibn al-Athir, where he mentions its distinguishing features among the books of Ahadith, namely: its ordering and lack of repetition; mentioning the views of the fiqhi Madhahib and how they respectively deduce rulings; explanation of the Ahadith, in terms of their grade of authentic, sound, weak, gharib and mu’alal; explaining the names of the narrators, their monikers and kunyas, and additional points of benefit that pertain to the sciences of rijal and the book of Ellal at the end of the Jami<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Having established the richness of the books of Hadith, we can now focus on how to benefit from them. This has been outlined by countless scholars when discussing the Manhaj of the student of knowledge in acquiring knowledge. A fitting example here would be the Muhaddith of Yemen, Shaykh Muqbil b. Hadi al-Wadi’, a scholar whose call to the Quran and the Sunnah, and particular emphasis on Ahadith, caused changes on a societal level in his native lands. He states:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fact that some beginner seekers of knowledge in the field of Ahadith err [in their endeavours] is taken up by their antagonists, who use the errors to justify driving them away from their Manhaj [that of the people of hadith]. However, I advise my brothers to acquire what they can from the books of Ahadith and dedicate themselves to reading them – and as for the one who says that whoever’s Shaykh is a book will err more than they are correct, this is only if they do not choose the most fitting book and do not refer to the statements of the scholars relating to the hadith – and acting upon knowledge that has been found [al-Wijadah] is permissible. They should refer to the explanations that the people of the Sunnah have given and if they see in the books of Hadith something that contradicts what the people around them are upon, they should look to see what the people of knowledge have said about the Ahadith in terms of its authenticity and in terms of its meanings. If the Hadith is authentic and the meaning has been understood correctly, it has not been abrogated and you have checked in the explanations that it is not a general hadith that has been made specific elsewhere, or an unrestricted hadith that has been restricted elsewhere, do so if you can. If they are in an environment in which the community have an acceptance of the Sunnah and have trust in them, they should teach them with statements and actions. If they are in an environment in which the community do not have acceptance of the Sunnah, nor do they have trust in them, they should strive to encourage them to act in accordance to the Sunnah and request evidences [for practices].<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Translated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Sinan</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Checked &amp; Revised</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></h5>
<h3><span style="color: #000080">Hadith No. 7443</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Yusuf bin Musa narrated to me: Abu Usamah narrated to me from Al-A&#8217;mash, from Khaythamah, from &#8216;Adiy bin Hatim who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;There is none amongst you except that his Rabb will speak to him, there will be no interpreter between them nor a veil to veil Him.&#8221; </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left">
<h3 style="text-align: left"><span style="color: #000080">Explanation of Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him)</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">And in this Hadith is a refutation of those that speak with &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217;¹, and its meaning is that Allah will introduce speech (yuhdithu al-qawl) in that Hour, He speaks to the one who is alone with him in that Hour, and those that speak with &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217; (i.e., the Asha&#8217;irah) say: &#8220;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi is eternal, however, Allah creates sounds when He wishes for someone to hear, and it is an expression from Al-Kalam An-Nafsi.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And on account of this, some of the intelligent said: The Madhab of the Asha&#8217;irah regarding the Speech [of Allah] is the Madhab of the Jahmiyyah, rather it is even worse! For verily they say that which is heard [in recitation] and that which is written in the Masahif is created, and it is [nothing more than] an expression from the [true] Speech of Allah, and as for the Speech of Allah then it is that which is in His Self, it is not heard and He does not speak when He wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the Jahmiyyah, then they said, &#8220;That which is heard is the Speech of Allah in reality, however it is created.&#8221; So who is closer to that which is correct? The Jahmiyyah, and this is the reason they said, &#8216;The speech of the Asha&#8217;irah regarding the Speech [of Allah] is worse than the speech of the Jahmiyyah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As for the reality of the matter, then there is no difference between them and the Jahmiyyah, for verily they are in agreement that what was heard by Muhammad ﷺ, and what was heard by Musa (Peace be upon him), and what will be heard in the future is all created. But the Asha&#8217;irah say that is an &#8216;Ibarah (Expression)² from Al-Kalam An-Nafsi, and these people say: &#8220;No! Rather it (the Speech of Allah) is a creation that He created, He created sounds which are heard, and He attributed them to His Self as a way of honouring and venerating.&#8221; &#8211; So this Hadith clearly refutes those that claim that the Speech of Allah is [just] the Meaning established eternally within His Self, and they have narrated that the Speech [of Allah] is like [His] Knowledge or [His] Will.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>(Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin, Sharh Kitab At-Tawhid min Sahih Al-Bukhari p. 437, 438,<br />
Dar Al-Kalim At-Tayyib, 1st Edn.)</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">¹ <strong>&#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi:&#8217; </strong>The Asha&#8217;irah reject that Allah has volitional actions (actions tied to His will), and this led to their belief in &#8216;Al-Kalam An-Nafsi&#8217;, the corrupt belief that Allah does not speak, rather the &#8216;Speech (Kalam)&#8217; is merely a single indivisible meaning which is established in His Essence &#8211; as for the Qur&#8217;an that we have with us which is written in the Mushaf and memorised by all Muslims, then it is <strong>created</strong> and merely an &#8216;Expression (&#8216;Ibarah)&#8217; of the Meaning which subsists within the Essence of Allah. Some went as far as claiming the Qur&#8217;an we have with us is the speech of Jibreel (Peace be upon him), rather than the Speech of Allah! Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;The Ash&#8217;ariyyah say: What is in the Mushaf is not the Speech of Allah, rather it is an &#8216;Ibarah (Expression) from Him [&#8230;] and these letters which are in the Qur&#8217;an, and the sounds which the Messenger heard, or Jibreel heard, verily it is created.&#8221;</strong> <em>(Sharh Fath Al-Bariyyah bi-Talkhis Al-Hamawiyyah p. 314)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Madhab of Ahlus-Sunnah regarding the Speech of Allah: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu &#8216;Uthman As-Sabuni said, &#8220;And the Ahlul-Hadith testify and believe that the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah and His Book, and His Revelation, and that which He revealed is uncreated, and whoever speaks with its creation (i.e., that the Qur&#8217;an is created) and believes in it is a Kafir according to them.&#8221; <em>(Aqidatu&#8217;s Salaf wa Ashabu&#8217;l Hadith p. 165, Dar Al-&#8216;Asimah)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Muhammad bin Isma&#8217;il Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;I met more than 1000 men from the People of Knowledge: [From] the People of Hijaz, and Makkah, and Madinah, and Kufa, and Basrah, and Wasit, and Baghdad, and Sham (Levantine Region), and Misr (Egypt) [&#8230;] and I did not see one of them differ on these matters: [&#8230;] and that the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah, uncreated&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad of Imam Al-Lalaka&#8217;i 1/273-274, Dar Al-Lu&#8217;lua)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Abu Zur&#8217;ah and Abu Hatim Ar-Raziyayn said, &#8220;We reached the scholars of all the cities, in Hijaz, &#8216;Iraq, Sham, Yemen, and from their Madhab was: Al-&#8216;Iman is speech and action, it increases and it decreases, and the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah, uncreated from all aspects [&#8230;] and whoever claims that the Qur&#8217;an is created then he is a disbeliever in Allah Al-&#8216;Adhim, with a disbelief that removes him from the Religion, and whoever doubts his disbelief &#8211; from those that understand [this issue] &#8211; then he is [also] a disbeliever&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Sharh Usul Al-I&#8217;tiqad of Imam Al-Lalaka&#8217;i 1/278-282, Dar Al-Lu&#8217;lua)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Ibn Battah narrated from Imam Ahmad who said, &#8220;And whoever says that verily Allah will not be seen in the Hereafter, then he is a Jahmi who has surely disbelieved&#8221; and &#8220;They will look at their Rabb, and He will look at them, and they will speak to Him, and He will speak to them, However He wills, Whenever He wills.&#8221; <em>(Al-Ibanah &#8216;an Shari&#8217;atu&#8217;l Firqatu&#8217;n Najiyah #47-48, Dar Al-Rayah)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Imam Harb Al-Kirmani, companion of Imam Ahmad and Ishaq bin Rahuyah, transmitted consensus on this issue saying, &#8220;And the Qur&#8217;an is the Speech of Allah by which He speaks, uncreated, so whoever claims that the Qur&#8217;an is created then he is a Jahmi Kafir.&#8221; <em>(Ijma As-Salaf fi&#8217;l-I&#8217;tiqad p. 64, Dar Al-Imam Ahmad)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Shaykh Ibn Al-&#8216;Uthaymin said, <strong>&#8220;Ahlus-Sunnah w&#8217;al-Jama&#8217;ah have agreed upon that Allah speaks, and His Speech is an Attribute in truth, established for Him in a manner which is befitting for Him. And He, Exalted is He, speaks with letters and sounds, however He wills, whenever He wills, and His Speech is an attribute of His Essence (Sifat Dhatiyyah) in terms of genus, and it is an attribute of action (Sifat Fi&#8217;liyyah) in terms of occurrences.&#8221;</strong> He commented on his own speech, explaining, &#8220;This is because it is connected to His Will, and every attribute connected to His Will is an attribute of action, and Speech in its essence is an attribute of the Essence, for verily Allah has not ceased and does not cease to be One that Speaks.&#8221; <em>(Sharh Fath Al-Bariyyah bi-Talkhis Al-Hamawiyyah p. 303, 304) </em></li>
</ol>
<p>² Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilani said, &#8220;So whoever claims that it (the Qur&#8217;an) is created, or an &#8216;Ibarah, or that the recitation is other than what is recited, or he says: &#8216;My articulation of the Qur&#8217;an is created&#8217;, then he is a disbeliever in Allah Almighty, he is not to be mingled with, or fed, or married, or neighboured&#8230;&#8221; <em>(Al-Ghunya li-Talibi 1/128, Dar Al-Kutub Al-&#8216;Ilmiyyah)</em></p>
