				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>10 Books Ahlul Bidah Wished That Were Never Written!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>[3] Husn al-Bayan Fima Fi Sirat un-Nu’man</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Of</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Abdul Aziz Muhammadi Rahimabadi (1338H)</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Reciting Fatihah Behind The Imam and Contradictory Hanafi Principles</strong></span></h3>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Compiled and Translated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author of Sirat un-Nu’man spoke about the issue of reciting Fatihah behind the imam and whilst raising objections on Imam Bukhari he says in the issue of reciting Fatihah behind the imam, Imam Abu Hanifah uses the the ayah, “When the Quran is recited listen silently…” And Imam Bukhari said concerning this ayah in his Juzz al-Qirah that it was pertaining to the sermon and not the prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shibli Numani says how astonishing is this answer of Imam Bukhari because who does not know the ayah being revealed for a specific occasion does not take away the fact that the ruling is clearly general and therefore cannot be specific or restricted to one particular occasion in terms of its ruling</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I say: this is a wild stretch of the imagination and wishful thinking of the author of Sirat an-Numan as Imam Bukhari answered this deduction of Imam Abu Hanifah from both perspectives ie in general wording and a specific occasion. It is a well known principle in the field of debate and discussions to answer every angle of the argument. It is from this principle that Imam Bukhari answered the question first and foremost from the perspective of a general wording.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is interesting here is that the hanafis do not themselves adhere to the generality of this principle and ayah when it comes to pray the morning Sunnah prayers. This is because their Fiqh dictates that if the imam is reciting loudly in the morning obligatory prayer and a worshippers comes and he has not prayed his Sunnah prayers, then he should pray his Sunnah prayers (whilst the Jama’ah is in progress) so this by default is goes against the generality of that ayah as they claim, so where has that principle gone now?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So when you restrict this ayah to exclude sunnah prayer meaning (that the worshiper can recite Fatihah in the Sunnah prayer whilst the Jama’ah is in progress) then why cannot the ayah be restricted from the generality you claim, to reciting Fatihah in the prayer? Especially since there is not text that restricts or specifies the recitation of Fatihah in the Sunnah prayer. Whereas on the contrary their are specific texts with regards to reciting Fatihah (in all prayers) for example the Hadith of Ubadah bin as-Samit (RadhiAllaahu Anhu).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you claim it is specific with regards to the prayer, then this specificity or restriction is not established because it is specific with regards to the sermon as Imam Bukhari elucidated. This deduction of Imam Bukhari is a testament to his incredible line of argument, contrary to the debate of Imam Abu Hanifah which we have already spoken about.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated and Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Compiled 2003</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These biographies of these hadeeth masters and all the others that have been presented on this blog <span id="more-1113"></span>are by no means justice to these great Hadeeth Masters but rather an insight and glimpse of the heritage and History of the scholars of Hadeeth, The Ahlul Hadeeth Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah, the Salafis.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a brief biography of Shaikh Maalik Abdul Azeez. He was born approximately at the turn of the 19th century at about 1899 in the eastern part of Multaan, a major city of the state of Punjaab, in Paakistaan. He was born in a district 7 miles to the east of Multaan, in an area known as Khudaadwala in a family of farmers.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Seeking Knowledge </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He starting seeking knowledge from an early stage, however the environment around was not entirely scholarly. So he moved to the city where he sought knowledge and achieved the studentship of the two famous and well-known scholars teaching there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">They were</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. Shaykh al-Allaamah Abdul-Haqq Multaanee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. Shaykh al-Allaamah Abdul-Tawaab Multaanee</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1. Shaykh al-Allaamah Abdul-Haqq Multaanee </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He was originally from Dhera Ismaa’eel Khaan and a Faraanee Afghan, he later moved to Multaan. He was from amongst the first people who started to call the people to the Tawheed of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Wasallam) in that area. Suffice it to say that he was one of the foremost students of al-Allaamah al-Muhaddith al-Muftee Mian Nazeer Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawee (d.1318H), from who he learnt all the different branches of Islaam. His rank and position with his teacher was such that he (Mian Nazeer Hussain) would have complete trust and reliance in him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When questions would come to Mian Nazeer he would pass them onto Shaykh Abdul-Haqq who would answer them and Main Nazeer would then just add his approval. So when one looks at <em>‘Fataawaa Nazeeriyyah’ </em>of Allaamah Nazeer Hussain some of the verdicts have the name of Abdul-Haqq next to them. This was his rank. Then another well-known student of al-Allaamah Mian Nazeer Hussain, Shaykh al-Allaaamah al-Muhaddith Abul-A’la Muhammad Abdur Rahmaan Mubaarakpooree, the author of  Tuhfatul Ahwadhee, checked Fataawa Nazeeriyyah.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>2. Shaykh al-Allaamah Abdul-Tawaab Multaanee </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Born in 1288H, he also learnt ahadeeth from the hadeeth master, al-Allaamah al-Muhaddith al-Muftee Mian Nazeer Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawee. Thereafter he gained permission of hadeeth from,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. Imaam Ahmad bin Abdur-Rahmaan al-Banna Misree, the one who put al-Musnad of Imaam Ahmad in an order.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. Shaykh al-Allaamah Muhammad Raaghib at-Tabbakh al-Halabee Shamee (d.1370). He was highly influenced by the works of the two Shaykhain, Shaykh ul-Islaam Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah and Imaam Shams ul-Islaam Ibn Qayyim as well as the works of Imaam Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee. He would often re-print their books and give them out free especially ‘A’laam al-Muwaqqi’een’. He authored many books. He died in 1366H.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thereafter the Shaikh travelled to Siyaalkot and studied in ‘Jaamia Ibraaheemiyyah’ where he benefited from Shaykh Muhammad Ibraaheem Meer Siyaalkotee. Then when the seeking of knowledge further instilled zealously in him, he travelled to ‘Jaamia Sa’eediyyah’ in Delhi and learnt from Shaykh al-Allaamah Abu Sa’eed Sharf-ud-Deen Dehlawee, the famous student of al-Allaamah Mian Nazeer Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawee, where he completed his studies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He spent most of his life as the rector of ‘Daar ul-Hadeeth Muhammadiyyah’ in Multaan. He spent years teaching the Prophets hadeeth in this institution as well as delivering the Friday sermon at the Jaamia Masjid. He also travelled and visited other cities where he helped to establish and propagate the dawah.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of his most memorable such programs was in the town of Dhera Ghazee Khaan, where he, alongside another Shaykh, severely refuted the madhab of the Raafidhee’s and the censurable concepts of shirk and innovation.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Debates </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During his life he had many victories whilst debating with Ahlul-Bid’ah on various issues. He was a close companion of Shaykh al-Allaamah Thanaullah Amritsaree and both of them would indulge in defending Ahlus-Sunnah equally against the accusations and objections of the people of shirk and innovation. Some of his well known debates were with the Shee’ah, one of them was with the Shee’ee Sayyid Zain al-A’abideen Shaah and another one with Ismaa’eel ash-Shee’ee, both of whom were severely refuted and their arguments annihilated by the Shaykh, Walillahil-Hamd.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the district of Shaah Ghardaiz in Lucknow (a place known for shee’ah residency), in the house of Sayyid Asghar Alee Shaah, Sayyid Zain al-A’abideen in the presence of other shee’ahs debated with the Shaykh on different issues between Ahlus-Sunnah and the shee’ahs. The Shaykh was so knowledgeable about the shee’ah madhab that he (his) opponent began to sweat as the expertise of the Shaykh was such that all his arguments were based and referenced from the books of the shee’ahs themselves. The Shaykh would always return victorious.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also debated with the famous Hanafee mullah, Maulana Khair Muhammad Jalandharee and it has been narrated that after the debate the Hanafee Maulana did not know his way back home.</span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>His Works </strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The main areas of writing and research of the Shaykh were shee’ism and the refutation of Taqleed hence most of his works revolve around this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In refutation of the Shee’ah he wrote,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. The Decisive Word On Who Murdered Hussain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. The Decisive Word On the Marriage of Umm Kulthoom (bint Alee to Umar al-Khataab).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. Hadeeth Qartaas.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">4. The Garden of Fidak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">5. Ehtimaam Janaazah Khair al-Anaam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">6. al-Burhaan al-Ma’qool Fee Tarbee’a Binaat ar-Rasool.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">7. Khilaafat Saadiqah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">8. Fadhail Khulafa Raashideen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">9. Fadhail Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthmaan From Shee’ah Narration’s.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the Hanafees he wrote,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">10. Isteesaal at-Taqleed</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">11. Faisalah Raf ul-Yadain</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">12. Faisalah Munazarah Raf ul-Yadain (Murattab)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">13. Risaalah Qiraa’h Khalf al-Imaam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">14. Tahqeeq at-Taraaweeh</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Other books include:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">15. Akaazeeb Mirzaa (Ghulaam Ahmad Qaadiyaanee)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">16. Hayaat Maseeh (Eesaa Ibn Maryam)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">17. Fadhail Durood Shareef</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And many more…</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would work on his farm in the early mornings preparing the produce and generally carrying out the daily duties associated with running and maintaining a farm with the help of his children. Later during the morning he would teach the student Aqaa’id, ahadeeth, fiqh, usool al-Fiqh in the institution and he would continue this until the end of the day. In the evening he would retire to his home</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">and engage in seeking knowledge and research. He never took any money for teaching or for delivering sermons and lectures during his whole life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the end of his life he left Daar ul-Hadeeth Muhammadiyah and approximately 2-3 years after he died due to asthma. This Hadeeth master died in the first week of July in 1969 leaving behind a legacy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allaah grant his Jannatal Firdaus. Ameen</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Completed 2003</span></p>

<h4 dir="ltr" align="left"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Question:</strong> </span></h4>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">Why does Saudi Arabia permit celebrating the commemoration of Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhaab in a conference, paying hundredsof thousands for it, and it is not allowed for us to celebrate the commemoration of the mawlid of the Messenger of Allah -Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam-?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">Who is more deserving of that: the Messenger of Allah -Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam- or Muhammad bin Abdel Wahhab?</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">This is a question that some of the people of knowledge of Damascus ask, please give us an answer.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr" align="left"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></span></h4>
<h4 dir="ltr" align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">All praise be to Allah alone, and Salat and Salam be upon the Messenger of Allah</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">The week of shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhaab was only an academic conference held in 1400 Hijri, under the supervision of the Islamic University of Imam Muhammad bin Sa’ud in Riyadh, it consisted for a number of researches regarding the dawah of Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhaab in terms of its emergence and its affects, and the doubts created surrounding it with its refutation. In addition to that, the works of Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhaab were printed after compiling and organizing it.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">The difference between that conference and the celebration of the Prophetic Mawlid is obvious, as the week of shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhaab was not an act of worship itself, what was meant by it is to inform about this dawah and to do justice to its reviver; also, the week of the shaikh does not reoccur or return as is the case with the ones who celebrate the Prophetic Mawlid, tending it every year; while this week was held about a quarter century ago, and has ended.</span></p>
