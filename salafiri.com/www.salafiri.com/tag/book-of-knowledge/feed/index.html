				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chapter: Regarding The Raising up of Knowledge And The Appearance Of Ignorance [1]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1856 &#8211; From Anas Ibn Maalik (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu) who said, &#8221; Should I not narrate to you a hadeeth which I heard from the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) not narrated by any of you, nor will you hear like it? &#8220;Verily from the signs of the hour is the raising of knowledge, and the manifestation of ignorance, and the spreading of adultery/fornication (Zinaa), and the drinking of intoxicants, and the departure of men, and the remaining of women. Until there will be fifty women to be cared for by one man.&#8221;[2] [Saheeh Muslim (8/58)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chapter: Regarding the Taking Away of Knowledge</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1857 &#8211; From Abee Hurayrah (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu) who said, Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;A time is approaching in which the knowledge will be taken away, and trials (Fitan) will appear, and greed will be present[3], and al-Harj will increase.&#8221; They said, &#8220;And what is al-Harj?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Killing.&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim (8/59)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chapter: Regarding The Taking Away of Knowledge By Taking Away The Scholars</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1858 &#8211; From &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Umar Ibnul &#8216;Aas (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu) who said, &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8216;Verily Allaah does not take away knowledge by snatching it away from the people, rather He takes it away by taking away the scholars, until there is not one scholar left. So The people will take ignorant leaders, so they will be asked, and they will give rulings without knowledge. So they will be misguided, and they will misguide. [Saheeh Muslim (8/60)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chapter: Whoever Takes A Good Way, or Bad In Islaam</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1859 &#8211; From Jareer Ibn &#8216;Abdullaah (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu) who said: &#8220;People from amongst the Arabs came to the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) with wool on them. So he incited the people to give charity, but they were slow on that, until I saw that (displeasure) on his face.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then a man from the Ansaar came with a bag from paper, then others came. Then they followed until it was known that there was happiness on his (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) face. So the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8216;Whoever takes in Islaam a good way, and it is acted upon after him; There is for him a like reward from the performers of it without there being anything decreased from their reward. And whoever takes a sinful way, and it is acted upon after him, there is written for him a like burden from the performers of it, and there is not decreased from their burden, anything.'&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim (8/61)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chapter: Whoever Calls To Guidance or Misguidance</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1860 &#8211; From Abee Hurayrah (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu) that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) &#8220;Whoever calls to guidance has a reward like the rewards of those who follow him, without that decreasing anything from their reward. And whoever calls to misguidance, there is on him sin from the sins of those who follow him, not decreasing that from their sins anything.&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim (8/62)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chapter: Regarding The Writing of The Qur&#8217;aan and a Warning Against Lying On The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wa Sallam)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1861 &#8211; From Abee Sa&#8217;eed al-Khudree (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu) that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;Do not write from me, and whoever writes from me other than the Qur`aan, then let him erase it.[4] And narrate from me, and there is no problem. And Whoever lies on me [Hammaam said, &#8220;He must be careful&#8221;, He said, &#8220;purposely&#8221;][5], then let him settle on his seat in the Fire. [Saheeh Muslim (8/229)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1862 &#8211; From Mugheerah Ibn Shu&#8217;bah (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu) who said: &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8216;Verily a lie on me is not like a lie on anyone else. So whoever lies on me purposely, then let him settle on his seat in the Fire.'&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim (1/8)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">1863 &#8211; From Samoorah Ibn Jundub and from Mugheerah Ibn Shu&#8217;bah (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu) who said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8216;Whoever speaks about me a statement, and he suspects that it is a lie, then he is one of the liars. [Saheeh Muslim (1/7)]</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[1] Translators Note: This is a collection of hadeeths from Kitaabul Ilm in Saheeh Muslim. They were taken from al-Haafidh al-Mundthiree&#8217;s abridgement of Imaam Muslims book. The original place of each hadeeth in Saheeh Muslim is provided at the end of each. Unless otherwise stated, the additional comments are by Shaykh al-Albaanee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[2] Shaykh al-Albaanee says, &#8220;He is the one who will be the caretaker of their welfare, he will not be their husband.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[3] Shaykh al-Albaanee says about this statement, &#8220;That is: it will be put into the hearts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[4] Shaykh al-Albaanee says about this statement, &#8220;This has been abrogated by many hadeeths which command with the writing of prophetic hadeeths.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">[5] Shaykh al-Albaanee says, &#8220;This word &#8216;purposely&#8217; is established from many chains of narration, and it has reached the standing of recurrent (tawaatur). So Hammaam does not compel doubt in it.&#8221;</span></p>
