<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>This is transmitted by </strong><strong>Ibn Abi Dunya in his <em>as-Samt</em> (no.235) and <em>al-Ghibah wan-Namimah</em> (no.98) from <em>Muhammad from Marwan bin Mu’awiyyah from Za’idah bin Qudamah who said I said to Mansur bin al-Mu’tamar, “Can I insult the ruler when I am fasting?

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The teacher of Ibn Abi Dunya, Muhammad bin Ubad bin Musa is weak. And Marwan bin Mu’awiyyah is a mudallis and would transmit with AanAan.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Hafiz Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani in his book <em>Ta’rif Ahlul Taqdis Bi-Maratib al-Mawsufin bit-Tadlis</em> (p.45 no.105) he said, <em>“He is famous for tadlis and he would do tadlis of his shuyukh and ad-Daraqutni described his affair like this.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] Marwan bin Mu’awiyyah despite being thiqah is also a mudallis, who did tadlis of his teacher’s name. This is as Hafiz Ibn Hajr described him in <strong><em>at-Taqrib ut-Tahdhib</em></strong> (p.742, no.6579) (Syria: Mu’assasah ar-Risalah, 1436H/2015, 1<sup>st</sup> Edn. Ed. Sa’d bin Najdat Umar).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Hafiz al-Ala’i in <strong><em>Jam’i at-Tahsil Fi Ahkam al-Marasil</em></strong> (p.110 no.51), Abu Zurah al-Iraqi in <strong><em>Kitab al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (no.62), Hafiz Suyuti in <strong><em>Asma Man Urifa Bi-Tadlis</em></strong> (no.70), Sabt ibn al-Ajami in <strong><em>Kitab at-Tabiyin Li-Asma al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.54) (no.76), <strong><em>Manzumah Mahmud al-Maqdisi</em></strong> (line 12) all graded him to be a mudallis narrator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Muhammad bin Tal’at describes his tadlis and criticism over 7 pages in his <strong><em>Mu’ajam al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.436-443 no.154) (KSA: Adwa as-Salaf 1426H/2005, 1<sup>st</sup> Edn.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i further said while explaining Imam Ibn Ma’in’s statement when asked by ad-Duri about Marwan transmitting from Ali bin Abil Walid, he replied, <em>“He is Ali bin al-Ghurab”</em> (<strong><em>Tarikh ad-Duri</em></strong> (no.2843), also (no.2611), <strong><em>Tahdhib ul-Kamal</em></strong> (27/408).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000080;">Shaykh Zubair said, <em>“Meaning he did tadlis of his Shuyukh and it not proven he did tadlis of the isnad.”</em> (<strong><em>Fath ul-Mubin Fi Tahqiq Tabaqat al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.124) (Pakistan: Maktabah al-Islamiyyah, 1434H) END]  </span>  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Imam Yahya bin Ma’in said, <em>“I have not seen more devious tadlis from anyone except him.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] This is mentioned in <strong><em>Tarikh ad-Duri </em></strong>(no.2843). It should be noted ad-Darimi in his recension from Imam Ibn Ma’in reports him to be thiqah, yet this contradicts most of Ibn Ma’in’s statements concerning Marwan. For a comprehensive overview of Imam Ibn Ma’in’s statements on refer to <strong><em>Mawsu’ah Aqwal Yahya ibn Ma’in Fi Rijal ul-Hadith wa I’llalihi</em></strong> (4/293-296 no.3646) (Tunisia: Dar ul-Gharb, 1430H/2009, Edn, 1<sup>st</sup> Ed. Bashar Ma’ruf, Jihad Mamud and Mahmud Muhammad).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">How Najm Abdur Rahman said in his checking of <strong><em>as-Samt</em></strong>, <em>“Its narrators are from the thiqat.” </em>(<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan </em></strong>of Ibn Abi Dunya (p.343 no.236) is baffling.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Al-Huwayni in his checking of <strong><em>as-Samt</em></strong> said,<em> “There is weakness in the chain.”</em> (<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan </em></strong>(p.145 no.235). END]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Nu’aym also transmitted it in his book <em>Hilyatul Awliya</em> (5/41) and mentioned the same text through the chain Abu Hamid bin Jabalah from Muhammad bin Ishaq from Abbas bin Muhammad from Khalf bin Tamim from Za’idah from Mansur.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hamid bin Jabalah is in the chain, and I could not find any statements of praise or criticism for him. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Khallal also transmit in his <em>Kitab as-Sunnah</em> (no.789) without mentioning the part of the rulers, he said, <em>from Harb from Muhammad bin Abdur Rahman from Abu Usamah from Za’idah who said, I said to Mansur, “Oh Abu Uttab, the day on which one of us fasts (for seeking reward) he denounces those who denounce Abu Bakr and Umar? He replied yes.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] This is reported in <strong><em>as-Sunnah</em></strong> of al-Khallal as Shaikh Abdul Qadir said, (1/391 no.789) (al-Faruq al-Hadithiyyah) and (1/400 no.774) (KSA: Dar al-Awraq, 1439H/2018. 3<sup>rd</sup> Edn. Ed. Al Hamdan. END]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The chain contains Muhammad bin Abdur Rahman bin al-Hasan bin al- al-Ju’fi. Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Shaybah said, <em>“he memorised hadith with good memory of hadith that were connected and disconnected.”</em> Ibn Hibban mentioned him in <em>ath-Thiqat</em> and said he preserved hadith and his hadith transmitted from Sham are very strange and odd. Maslamah bin Qasim <em>said the people criticised him and he narrated abandoned reports</em>. Ad-Daraqutni said, <em>he is relied upon</em>, Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani said, <em>truthful and a preserver of hadith but he transmitted odd and strange reports.</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>I say: This report is not evidence for backbiting the oppressive ruler rather it is clear evidence which prohibits it. When I mentioned these defects of this report to a detractor, may Allah correct him, he thought the meaning was, it was allowed to backbite the rulers when not fasting. He abandoned the clear claim and did not pay attention to the answer of Mansur to the question. The statement of the one who backbites is not evidence and the affair requires a legal Islamic text to support it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(<strong><em>Athar al-Waridah Fi Jawaz Ghibah al-Hakim al-Ja’ir</em></strong> p.17-18)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(These 2 scans were shared on social media by those who promote the permissibility of backbiting rulers publicly)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abdur Rahman bin al-Maghra’a’s trustworthiness and reliability is disputed. Ali bin al-Madini, Ibn Adiyy and others criticised him for his narrations from al-A’mash and this report is from and through the route of al-A’mash.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] Ali bin al-Madini said concerning Abdur Rahman bin Maghra’a, “<em>He is nothing he transmitted 600 hadith from al-A’mash, we discarded them as they were not transmitted like that.” </em>Also<em>, “Trustworthy narrators did not corroborate his hadith, he narrated odd and strange narrations from other than al-A’mash and all of them were weak</em>.” Yahya ibn Ma’in said <em>“He is nothing.”</em> As-Saji said, <em>“He is from the truthful people but has weakness.”</em> Abu Ahmad al-Hakim said, <em>“His hadith are not supported.”</em> Abu Zurah said, <em>“Truthful”,</em> al-Khalili said, <em>“Thiqah.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Refer to <strong><em>al-Kamil</em></strong> (5/471), <strong><em>al-Iktifa Fi Tanqih adh-Dhu’afa</em></strong> (2/406), <strong><em>Mukhtasar al-Kamil</em></strong> (p.490), <strong><em>adh-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin</em></strong> (2/101) of Ibn al-Jawzi, <strong><em>Diwan ad-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin</em></strong> (p.246), <strong><em>Mughni fidh-Dhu’afa</em></strong> (1/614), <strong><em>Mizan </em></strong>(2/520), <strong><em>Qanun adh-Dhu’afa</em></strong> (p.229) from <strong><em>al-Jam’i li-Kutub adh-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin wal Kadhabin</em></strong> (8/441 no.6433)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Najm Abdur Rahman said in his checking of <strong><em>as-Samt</em></strong>, <em>“Its chain is Hasan and Abdur Rahman bin al-Maghra’a is truthful.”</em> And then he said, <em>“They (scholars of hadith) resented the hadith he transmitted from al-A’mash since he was not supported by other trustworthy narrators.” </em>(<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan </em></strong>of Ibn Abi Dunya (p.338 no.223). So, there is a problem with al-Maghra’a from al-A’mash and his saying the chain is Hasan is incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Al-Huwayni in his checking of <strong><em>as-Samt</em></strong> said, <em>“There is weakness in the chain. Although Abdur Rahman bin Maghra’a is truthful his hadith from al-A’mash have been criticised.”</em> (<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan </em></strong>of Ibn Abi Dunya (p.142 no.222). END]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>Ad-Darimi</em></strong><strong> (no.394) also transmitted it but without the words <em>“the oppressive ruler.”</em> He ad-Darimi transmits, <em>“From Makhlad bin Malik from Abdur Rahman bin Maghra’a from al-A’mash who said, “Ibrahim (an-Nakha’i) did not consider it backbiting when speaking about innovators.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] This shows the wording especially the phrase, <em>“The oppressive/unjust ruler”</em> is controversial and disputed by the very fact it is lost in transmission in some reports. This is further problematic when the transmission is through the same narrators. Since the chain of transmission is the same in <strong>Ibn Abi Dunya </strong>except Musa bin Yusuf and Makhlad bin Malik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Makhlad bin Malik is awthaq than Musa bin Yusuf and thus his riwayah is taken and accepted. Makhlad is a narrator of <strong><em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em></strong> and Imam al-Bukhari’s Shaikh. His narration in <strong><em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em></strong> is (no.4074).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abi Nasr Ahmad bin Muhammad al-Bukhari al-Kalabadhi (d.398H) has an entry for him in his book on the narrators of al-Bukhari. He says, <em>“al-Bukhari transmitted from him in the Ghazwa of Uhud.”</em> (<strong><em>Rijal Sahih al-Bukhari</em></strong> (2/725 no.1205) (Lebanon: Dar al-Ma’rifah, 1407H/1987, 1<sup>st</sup> Edn.

There is no doubt he is thiqah refer to (<strong><em>al-Jam’a Bayna ar-Rijal as-Sahihain</em></strong> (2/507), <strong><em>at-Taqrib</em></strong> (2/235), <strong><em>Tahdhib ut-Tahdhib</em></strong> (10/75), <strong><em>al-Kashif</em></strong> (3/113) as mentioned in <strong><em>Rijal Sahih al-Bukhari</em></strong>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">For further details on Makhlad refer to Imam al-Bukhari’s <strong><em>Tarikh al-Kabir</em></strong> (4/438 no.1914. <strong><em>Tahdhib ul-Kamal</em></strong> (27/340), <strong><em>Tahdhib ut-Tahdhib </em></strong>(12/625-626 no.6937), <strong><em>al-Hidayah wal-Irshad</em></strong> (2/725), <strong><em>al-Mu’ajam al-Mushtamil</em></strong> (p.289)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">For arguments sake, some researchers did authenticate this riwayah in <strong><em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em></strong>, like Shaikh Subhi Hasan Hallaq (p. 106 no.408) and his saying the rijal are trustworthy and ad-Darimi is the only one who reported it, it is still not worthy of evidence since it does not contain the words which are disputed, namely the oppressive or unjust ruler.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Shaikh Muhammad Ilyas, a student of Shaikh Ibn Baz, alludes to its weakness. He says, <em>“The narrators of this narration are thiqah however there is criticism regarding Abdur Rahman bin Maghra’a’s narrations from al-A’mash and al-Lalaka’i transmits it with an authentic chain.” </em>(<strong><em>Sunan ad-Darimi</em></strong> (1/240 no.408)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Nabil Hashim al-Ghamari also alluded to Abdur Rahman bin Maghra’a’s narrations from al-A’mash being criticised and that his reports from him were unsupported. He declared the chain of the report to be hasan, due to a supporting report in Imam al-Lalaka’i’s <strong><em>Sharh Usul I’tiqad</em></strong> (no.276). (<strong><em>Fath ul-Manan Sharh Musnad al-Jam’i</em></strong> (4/418 no.427) (Lebanon: Dar al-Basha’ir al-Islamiyyah, 1436H/2014, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edn. Ed. Nabil Hashim)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Again, this is not opposing the weakness of the former report since its words are different, this report does not mention the oppressive or unjust ruler. END]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Lalaka’i also transmitted it in his book <em>Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus-Sunnah</em> (no.276) through the route of Sulayman bin Hayyan from al-A’mash from Ibrahim with the wording, <em>“It is not backbiting when speaking about the people of innovation.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The chain is Hasan but not Muhammad bin al-Hasan ash-Sharqi and perhaps he is Muhammad bin Ahmad bin al-Hasan ash-Sharqi, I could not any biographical information for an entry of that name.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] reported in al-Lalaka’i’s <strong><em>Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah</em></strong> (1/231 no.276) (al-Maktabah al-Islamiyyah – Nashat bin Kamal, in another edition (1/309 no.243) (Mutamayyiz / an-Nasihah – al-Qufili) with the chain from al-Hasan from Muhammad bin al-Hasan al-Sharqi from Muhammad bin Uthman from Abu Bakr from Abu Khalid from al-A’mash….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Al-Qufili said, <em>“This report is Hasan – good, and I could not find anyone other than the author transmitting it with a connected chain to (al-Hasan). Abu Khalid in the chain is al-Ahmar Sulayman bin al-Azdi, who is truthful but would make mistakes.”</em> (<strong><em>Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah</em></strong> (1/309 no.243) (KSA: Mutamayyiz / an-Nasihah, 1436H/ 2015, 1<sup>st</sup> Edn. Ed.al-Qufili)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">In the advent the report is taken to be authentic, it does not endorse the view of those who advocate backbiting the oppressive ruler. END]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ibn Abi Dunya also transmitted it in <em>as-Samt</em> (no.226) and in <em>al-Ghibah wan-Namimah</em> (no.89) from Ahmad bin Imran al-Akhnasi from Sulayman bin Hayyan from al-A’mash from Ibrahim who said, <em>“It is not backbiting speaking against three people, the oppressor, the wicker sinner and the person of innovation.”</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ahmad bin Imran bin Abdul Malik al-Akhnasi in the chain is weak and there is an unknown link between al-Akhnasi and Ibn Abi Dunya.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] Ahmad bin Imran al-Akhnasi is weak and abandoned in hadith. Imam al-Bukhari said<em>, “He is rejected in hadith, and he was criticised.”</em> (<strong><em>adh-Dhu’afa</em></strong> (1/366) of al-Uqayli, <strong><em>adh-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin</em></strong> (1/82) of Ibn al-Jawzi, <strong><em>Mughni Fidh adh-Dhu’afa</em></strong> (1/83), <strong><em>Mizan</em></strong> (1/146), <strong><em>Lisan</em></strong> (1/559).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam adh-Dhahabi said, <em>“His reports are false.”</em> Abu Zur’ah said, <em>“Kufi, abandoned (in hadith).”</em> (<strong><em>Mughni Fidh adh-Dhu’afa</em></strong> (1/83). Abu Hatim also abandoned him. (<strong><em>Mizan</em></strong> (1/146). Al-Azdi said, “<em>He was munkar al-hadith</em>.” (<strong><em>Lisan</em></strong> (1/559).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Refer to <strong><em>al-Jam’i li-Kutub adh-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin wal Kadhabin</em></strong> (1/546-547 no.851) for more details concerning him. END]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Najm Abdur Rahman said, <em>“The chain is Hasan, Ahmad bin Imran was declared thiqah by a group of scholars of hadith while others said he was weak. The author narrates from in his book in other places. He narrates from him many times with words that indicate he heard directly from him.”</em> (<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan </em></strong>(p.329 no.227).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Al-Huwayni in his checking of <strong><em>as-Samt</em></strong> said answers Najm’s argument, <em>“The chain is weak. The author also transmitted it through the same chain in his book <strong>Dhamm ul-Ghibah</strong>.</em> <em>The chain is weak due to a disconnection in the chain between the author (Ibn Abi Dunya) and Ahmad bin Imran al-Akhnasi in this report. This is because the author transmits the report without a narrator between them yet in no.19 and no.168 he transmits with narrators between them. Furthermore, al-Bukhari said about Ahmad bin Imran, “He was criticised.”, Abu Zur’ah “He was abandoned.” adh-Dhahabi said in <strong>Mizan</strong>, “Abu Hatim abandoned him.” This is why in <strong>al-Jarh wat-Ta’dil</strong> (1/1/65) Abu Hatim said, “He did not write anything from him, but he only encountered his era.”… Abu Hatim clarified in another book that he was abandoned in hadith…So, it is possible adh-Dhahabi may have not taken the statement due to other reasons. Some people said, “The chain is Hasan (good) Ahmad bin Imran, a group of scholars said he was thiqah while others said he was weak.” This is a lie in this matter, where are the those who said he was thiqah? And where was he declared thiqah? This miskin person was not satisfied with this audacity to the extent he declared other chains of Ahmad bin Imran al-Akhnasi (no.417, 418) to be authentic.” </em>(<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan</em></strong> (p.142-143 no.226).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] There is a difference of opinion concerning Sharik bin Abdullah whether he is weak or Hasan in hadith. Many of the scholars and Imams of hadith, rijal and Jarh wat-Ta’dil have criticised and praised him. For further details refer to <strong><em>al-Jam’i li-Kutub adh-Dhu’afa wal-Matrukin wal Kadhabin</em></strong> (7/261-281 no.5506) where the latter has collated over 20 pages concerning him by the way of his integrity in hadith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Further to differences on his trustworthiness, Sharik is a Mudallis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The following scholars all classed and graded him to be a mudallis. Hafiz Ibn Hajr in <strong><em>Tabaqat al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.75 no.56), Hafiz al-Ala’i in <strong><em>Jam’i at-Tahsil Fi Ahkam al-Marasil</em></strong> (p.77 no.23), Sabt ibn al-Ajami in <strong><em>Kitab at-Tabiyin Li-Asma al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.33), <strong><em>Manzumah Mahmud al-Maqdisi</em></strong> (line 4), Abu Zurah al-Iraqi in<strong><em> Kitab al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (no.28), Hafiz Suyuti in <strong><em>Asma Man Urifa Bi-Tadlis</em></strong> (no.31), Muhammad Tal’at  in <strong><em>Mu’ajam al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.248-250) (KSA: Adwa as-Salaf 1426H/2005, 1<sup>st</sup> Edn.).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Shaikh Zubair Ali Za’s discusses this to some extent despite declaring him hasan in hadith. See his <strong><em>Fath al-Mubin Fi Tahqiq al-Mudallisin</em></strong> (p.75 no.56). The Shaikh Rahimahullah also quotes Imam Ibn Hazm and Ibn Qattan al-Fasi declaring Sharik a Mudallis (<strong><em>al-Muhalla</em></strong> (8/263 issue no.1383 and 10/333 issue no.2016) <strong><em>Bayan al-Wahm wal-Iyham</em></strong> (3/533-534) (KSA: Dar Tayybah, 1432H/2011) 2<sup>nd</sup> Edn. Ed.al-Hussain Ayat Sa’id)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Al-Qufili in his checking of <strong><em>Sharh Usul al-I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah</em></strong> said<em>, “Also transmitted by Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Dunya in <strong>al-Ghibah</strong> (no.98) and in <strong>as-Samt</strong> (no.235) through the route of Sharik bin Abdullah an-Nakha’i from Uqil bin Khalid al-Ayli from al-Hasan al-Basri with the same wording. However, its chain is weak due to Sharik al-Qadhi and there is a disconnection in the chain between Uqil and al-Hasan and Allah knows best.” </em>(<strong><em>Sharh Usul al-I’tiqad</em></strong> (1/310)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Najm Abdur Rahman in his checking of <strong><em>Kitab as-Samt</em></strong> said, <em>“Its narrators are from the thiqat.”</em> (<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan</em></strong> (p.343 no.235) (Lebanon: Dar ul-Gharb, 1406H/1986) 1<sup>st</sup> Edn.). This is not the case, and he did this because he made assumptions on who this Uqil is and despite bringing criticism on Sharik. Al-Huwayni answers Najm’s words with surprise and astonishment, as you will read below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Abu Ishaq al-Huwayni, who many of the advocators of backbiting the ruler publicly take from and who is known to have serious errors in Manhaj, grades the chain weak, he says, <em>“There is weakness in the chain and Sharik an-Nakha’i had a weak memory….some of them claim the narrators are trustworthy! Despite what they said about Sharik an-Nakha’i (in terms of weakness)!!”</em> (<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan </em></strong>of Ibn Abi Dunya (p.145 no.234) (Lebanon: Dar ul-Kutub al-Arabi, 1410H/1990, 1<sup>st</sup> Edn. Ed. Abu Ishaq al-Huwayni) [END]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ad-Dinawari also transmit it in is his book <em>al-Majalisah wa Jawahir al-Ilm</em> (no.1347) with a very weak chain.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] Ibn Qutaybah ad-Dinawari transmit this report in <strong><em>al-Majalisah</em></strong> (4/196 no.1347) also with the same chain in (8/43 no.3352) (KSA: Dar ibn Hazm, 1419H/1998) 1<sup>st</sup> Edn. Ed. Mashur Hasan) and in his other work, <strong><em>U’yun al-Akhbar</em></strong> (2/17).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The chain is from Ad-Dinawari from Ahmad from Yusuf bin Abdullah al-Halwani from Uthman from A’wf from al-Hasan. Yusuf bin Abdullah al-Halwani is majhul – unknown and ad-Dinawari himself was accused of lying by Imam ad-Daraqutni (<strong><em>Mizan</em></strong> (1/156) and <strong><em>Lisan</em></strong> (1/309) END]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Al-Bayhaqi also transmit it in <em>Shu’bal Iman</em> (no.9221). The chain includes Abul Abbas bin Masruq, Mandal and Musa bin Ubaydah and all three are dhu’afa – weak narrators.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Lalaka’i also transmits this in his <strong><em>Sharh Usul al-I’tiqad</em></strong> with the following chain, from al-Hasan from Ahmad bin al-Hasan bin Yunus from Muhammad bin Uthman from Ahmad bin Yunus from Mandal from Musa bin Ubaydah from Sulayman bin Muslim from al-Hasan, <em>“It is not unlawful to backbite three people, one is the person of innovation who is extreme in his innovation.”</em> (<strong><em>Sharh Usul al-I’tiqad</em></strong> (1/231 no.278) (Maktabah al-Islamiyyah – Nashat bin Kamal).

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">It seems that Imam al-Lalaka’i made ikhtisar of the riwayah perhaps owing to only mentioning the point of discussion (backbiting the people of bid’ah) or perhaps the feasible possibility he was not convinced of the authenticity of the other two types of people. It is therefore also possible he might have summarised report (no.276), the report above or again, he might not have deemed the other wording to be authentic, Allahu Ta’la A’lam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The muhaqqiq of <strong><em>Sharh Usul I’tiqad</em></strong>, Nashat bin Kamal said about this report (no,278), <em>“(1) Mandal bin Ali al-Anazi Abu Abdullah al-Kufi, Ahmad declared him weak.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Also, Sulayman bin Muslim transmits from al-Hasan, but I could not find anyone who transmitted on al-Hasan al-Basri with that name.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Several current researchers have definitively said Sulayman bin Muslim is Abu Mu’alli al-Ijli who is majhul – unknown.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">So, it seems Abdullah bin Shawdhab encountered al-Hasan’s era, but he did actually meet or transmit any narrations or reports from him. So, there is a disconnection in the chain which renders it weak.</span></p>

(Ghiyath is weak in his hadith”</em> (<strong><em>adh-Dhufa as-Saghir</em></strong> (no.108 p.259), <strong><em>Tuhfa al-Aqwiya Fi Tahqiq Kitab adh-Dhu’afa</em></strong> (p.41), <strong><em>Tarikh ash-Saghir</em></strong> (p.192)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Shaikh Zubair also said in his checking of <strong><em>Kitab adh-Dhu’afa as-Saghir</em></strong>, <em>“Kadhab – a liar, matruk – abandoned, did tadlis from liars.” </em>(<strong><em>Tuhfa al-Aqwiya Fi Tahqiq Kitab adh-Dhu’afa </em></strong>(p.41 no.109) (Pakistan: Maktabah al-Islamiyyah, 1433H)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Furthermore, Ibn Jaban is not known on the scale of the scholars of praise or criticism. This then adds to the weakness of the report. Najm Abdur Rahman Khalaf said, <em>“I could not find a biographical note for him</em> (<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan</em></strong> (p.345)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">He continues and says, <em>“I think it was misspelt and it should be Ibn Jad’an al-Basri. He is one of the narrators who narrated from al-Hasan al-Basri. His name is Ali bin Zayd bin Jad’an at-Tamimi. He is weak. He was from the fourth tabaqah and he died in 131H, some said before that. (<strong>Taqrib</strong> (2/37<strong>), Tahdhib</strong> (7/322-324)” </em>(<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan</em></strong> (p.345)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Al-Huwayni in his checking of <strong><em>as-Samt</em></strong> said, <em>“The chain is very weak. Kharijah bin Mus’ad is matruk – abandoned (in hadith) as an-Nasa’i and others said and as for Ibn Jaban, I do not know who he is.”</em> (<strong><em>Kitab as-Samt wa Adab al-Lisan </em></strong>of Ibn Abi Dunya (p.146 no.238) (Lebanon: Dar ul-Kutub al-Arabi, 1410H/1990, 1<sup>st</sup> Edn. Ed. Abu Ishaq al-Huwayni) END]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Other people have transmitted this report from al-Hasan al-Basri and sometimes these reports only mention the innovator, sometimes they only mention the wicked sinner and sometimes they mention both.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">[AK] As mentioned there are various reports from Imam al-Hasan al-Basri in many books. Some of these reports are authentic and some are weak. Reports concerning innovators can be found in books of Aqidah and Manhaj that discuss the reprehension of innovations and innovators. Some of these reports are from Rabi bin Sabih, as-Salat bin Tarif, Uthman bin Matar, Yunus bin Ubayd and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Some are related to etiquettes and manners for example, from Qatadah from al-Hasan who said<em>, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>“There should be no sense of respect between you and a wicked sinner.”</em> (<strong><em>Adab al-Mufrad</em></strong> no.1018, Shaikh al-Albani authenticated it)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Another interesting report of al-Hasan al-Basri with the chain from al-Mubarak bin Fadhalah from al-Hasan who said, <em>“When wicked sinning becomes open, it is not backbiting to speak about them. He said the same regarding the effeminate man and the Haruriyyah (the Khawarij).”</em> (Ibn Abi Dunya in <strong><em>as-Samt</em></strong> (no.236), <strong><em>al-Ghibah wan-Namimah </em></strong>(no.98)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The narrators in the chain are thiqah except al-Mubarak who is truthful but also mudallis and narrates with Aan-Aan, however all the various reports from al-Hasan that speak about backbiting the innovators support this transmission since some are authentic</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Imam al-Khattabi (d. 388H) said while expanding the Manhaj of Imam al-Hasan al-Basri when he said, <em>“Who amongst is like al-Hasan today who will carry out his tasks with regards to giving sincere advice and aspiring admonishment. May Allah rectify us and our rulers, for they are corrupt because of our sins.” </em>(<strong><em>al-Uzla</em></strong> p.235. Damascus: Dar Ibn Kathir 1410H/1990 2<sup>nd</sup> Edn. Ed. Yasin Muhammad al-Sawwas)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This shows this was the Manhaj of Imam al-Hasan al-Basri of advising the rulers and not backbiting them. Imam al-Khattabi recalls this in his era of the 4<sup>th</sup> century and expresses the need for someone to be like Imam al-Hasan al-Basri.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">There are many reports from al-Hasan al-Basri which show apparent contradictions with this view, for example Imam Ibn Abdul Barr transmit from al-Hasan al-Basri said<em>, “One who acts without knowledge is like one who travels off the path; and the one who acts without knowledge corrupts more than he rectifies. So, seek knowledge in a way that does not harm your worship, and seek to worship in a way that does not harm (seeking) knowledge. For verily, there were people (the Khawarij extremists) who sought to worship (Allah) but abandoned knowledge until they attacked the Ummah of Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam with their swords. But if they had sought knowledge, it would not have directed them to do what they did.”</em> (<strong><em>Jam’i Bayan al-Ilm wa Fadlihi</em></strong> no.905)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">These reports contradict his insightful words which Imam Ibn Abi Hatim mentions in his explanation of the Quran, when al-Hasan al-Basri said, <em>“If people called on Allah when put to trial because of their rulers, Allah would relieve their suffering, but instead they resorted to the sword, so they were left to it. And not one day of good did they bring. Then he recited <strong>(Quran 7: 137),</strong></em><strong> “<em>And the good word of your</em></strong><em><strong> Rabb</strong></em><em><strong> was fulfilled for </strong></em><em><strong>Bani Isra’il</strong></em><em><strong>, for the patience and</strong></em> <em><strong>perseverance they had, and We</strong></em><strong> <em>destroyed the works of Pharaoh and his people and what they had</em> <em>erected.</em></strong><em><strong>”</strong></em> (<strong><em>Tafsir al-Quran al-A’zim Musnadan Aan Rasul Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was-Sahabah wat-Tabi’in,</em></strong> (7/311 no.883), Ibn Sa’d in <strong><em>at-Tabaqat al-Kubra</em></strong> (7/164), and as-Suyuti in <strong><em>ad-Darr al-Manthur</em></strong> (3/532)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">And when l-Hasan was on his deathbed some of his companions came to him and said<em>: “Oh Abu Sa’id, offer us some words you can benefit us with. He replied, “I will equip you with three words, then you must leave me to face what I am facing.( 1) Be the farthest of people from those things you have been forbidden (2) And be the most involved of people in the good you have been commanded to do (3) and know that the steps you take are two steps: a step in your favour and a step against you, so be careful where you come and where you go.”</em> (<strong><em>Hilyatul Awliya</em></strong> (2/154)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">And when al-Hasan said to the people regarding the oppression of al-Hajjaj<em>, “If he is a punishment for you then do not oppose Allah’s punishment with the sword but with peace and supplication.”</em> (<strong><em>Tarikh Dimashq</em></strong> (12/177)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This again shows, the need to be patient when faced with oppression. It is not the case if one argues that al-Hasan said with peace and supplication and by backbiting him since this is incomprehensible. Yes, this is about not rebelling but the advice of the Salaf is to be patient and advise privately. END]</span></p>
