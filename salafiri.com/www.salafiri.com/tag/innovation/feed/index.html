				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></span></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Milad Gatherings and Reciting Fatihah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Sayyid Nawab Muhamamd Siddiq Hasan Khan Rahimahullah (d.1307/1890) was asked:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>QUESTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What do the scholars of the Din and legal verdicts say regarding the following issues:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is is permissible or not to praise and venerate the leader of mankind, Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and to conduct the eulogy recitations of the Mawlid in such a manner that the gathering is ornate with lights and decoration while the people recite poetry as if the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam was present in the gathering and was being being addressed directly? Is it also permissible or impermissible to stand in veneration when his birth is being mentioned and furthermore, what do the scholars of legal verdicts says with regards to attending such gatherings?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also is it permissible or impermissible from the viewpoint of the Prophetic Hadith to recite al-Fatihah while raising the hands (i.e. making dua) over food on the day of Eid, Shab Barat and other days with the intent of the reward reaching the deceased? Please explain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also is it permissible or impermissible for people to gather on the third day after the death of an individual in order recite the Quran and to recite the Kalimah and five ayat on roasted chick peas? Please explain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ANSWER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Organising Milad gatherings and its likes is an innovation. Organising Milad gatherings and standing when the birth of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam is mentioned is not established or proved from the first three best generations. Therefore, it is an innovation and thus moving along the same line of argument, we do not find any evidence for raising the hands and making dua by reciting al-Fatihah on the days of Eid, Shab Barat and other special days.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, on behalf of the deceased, if food is given to the poor and destitute for the sake of Allah without the restriction and specification mentioned in the question, with the intent of reward for the deceased [as sadaqah], supplicating and seeking forgiveness, then we hope that is it beneficial (for the deceased). The same applies to other restricting and specifying other days after the death, for example the the third, the tenth and the fortieth. (i.e it is impermissible on any day after the death).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for reciting five ayats on roasted chick peas and other things, then we do not find any evidence for this whatsoever in the books of Hadith and the Din, therefore in conclusion these affairs are innovations and thus disliked in the shari’ah. And our resort is in Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Shaykh Nawab Sayyid Muhammad Siddiq Hasan Khan al-Qinawji al-Bukhari, Fatawa, 177-178.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shaykh Abd Al-Jabbar Umrpuri (d.1334/1916) On The Omnipresence of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam During the Mawlud Recitations</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaykh Abd al-Jabbar Umrpuri was the grandfather of Shaykh Abd al-Ghaffar Hasan Rehmani)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>READ HIS BIOGRAPHY &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span> <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.salafiri.com/biography-shaikh-abdul-jabbar-amrpuri-1344h/?fbclid=IwAR0K88P48URiNwGT26kKSjiKt7HRGbRi9RgyFVtbNMBUL3L_R846uJBfeDg">http://www.salafiri.com/biography-shaikh-abdul-jabbar-amrp…/</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Believing the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam i.e. having the Aqidah about him that he Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam travels to wherever the Mawlud’s are recited is indeed Shirk. Only Allah is everywhere in terms of knowledge and power, and he has not given his attributes to anyone and Allah knows best.</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What the Scholars said about him when he died</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Badʿi al-Dīn Shāh al-Rāshidī al-Sindhī wrote:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I was very shocked after hearing the news of the tragic death of Faḍīlat ul-Shaykh Mawlāna Maḥmūd Aḥmad Mirpūrī. May Allāh accept his efforts and service with regards to propagating and spreading Islām in the foreign lands, May Allāh forgive his mistakes, raise his status and grant the whole Jamāʿah strength to cope with this tragedy. Amīn, as the whole Jamāʿah is equally grieving and may Allāh allow us to die upon Islām.”</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAbdul ʿAzīz ibn ʿAbd Allāh Bāz said:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The news of the tragic death of Maḥmūd Aḥmad Mirpūrī reached me. May Allāh forgive the Shaikhs shortcomings and grant him mercy and may he grant you wholesome patience. May Allāh give the Shaikhs children guidance and success to tread upon his path and grant us an equal replacement, Amīn. We all belong to Allāh to him we shall return.” </em>(<em>ʿ</em>Abdul ʿAzīz bin ʿAbd Allāh bin Bāz &#8211; Dār al-Iftā, Riyāḍh)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ʿAbdul Qādir Ḥabībullāh al-Sindhī wrote:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>“Me, my father and my household are all grieving with you. Kindly convey my condolences to the Jamāʿah, the Shaikhs family and children, as I am also a member of this Jamāʿah</em><em>.  I praise the efforts of Jamāʿah Ahl al-Ḥadīth United Kingdom. </em><em>I was impressed with the Shaikh’s praiseworthy and noble efforts and I ask Allāh to accept this from him and to replace him with someone beneficial for the Jamāʿah Ahl al-Ḥadīth. May Allāh also grant success in further propapagting the Dīn and its teachings and may he give you and all of us patience. Amīn.” </em>(Shaikh ʿAbdul Qādir Ḥabībullāh al-Sindhī<em> &#8211; </em>Professor Islamic University Madīnah) abībullah</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Ṣafī al-Rahman al-Mubārakpūrī wrote:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“The Shaikh had raised the knowledge of Islām in the land of kufr and upheld the burden of rectification in this land of anarchy. Due to his effort, struggle, understanding, contemplations, wisdom and intelligence he raised the rank of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth of Britain from being virtually unknown and non-existant to the epitomy and vast stature of society. Without doubt everyone played a role in this formation and InshaʾAllāh everyone will be rewarded accordingly for their efforts. Thus the pivotal role the Shaikh played is not in need of any clarification. We have hope in our Rabb the most generous and oft giving and we supplicate to him that he grants the Shaikh the loftiest of stations and that he is blessed, favoured, forgiven and compassion. My heart pains after contantly thinking that a very capable and an adept visionary leader passed away. Death is undoubtedly a stark reality and its time and place is also definitive and so when a tragic event like this occurs the heart is affected and old thoughts become active. I pray to Allāh that he grants the Shaikh his special blessings and that he grants his close relatives virtuous patience and that he replaces the Shaikh with someone beneficial for all of us.”</em> (Shaikh Ṣafī al-Rahman al-Mubārakpūrī &#8211; Markaz Khidmah al-Sunnah Waʾl Sīrah al-Nabawīyyah &#8211; Islamic University Madīnah)</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Definition of <em>Bidʿ</em></strong><strong><em>ah</em></strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In light of the statements of the Messenger of Allāh (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) we can generally define innovations ie <em>bidʿ</em><em>ah</em> as, <strong>“Inventing or introducing something new into the Dīn.”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> </strong>In some further detail we can say<strong>, “Introducing something new into the Dīn which has no evidence from the Messenger of Allāh </strong><strong>(Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> or the companions, with the intent of receiving reward and thinking it is his means of salvation by acting on it. (ie the <em>bidʿ</em></strong><strong><em>ah</em></strong><strong>)</strong><strong>”<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh ul-Islām Imām Ibn Taymiyyah has further elucidated and said, it means to introduce an action, which was not practised during the time of the Messenger of Allāh (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam), and there was no obstacle that prevented them from doing it. Furthermore, there was no legal reason for them to even formulate an innovation, so despite this if a new action is performed with the understanding that it is part of the Dīn, then this is an innovation.<a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> ʿAlī Maḥfūẓ said regarding the technical or Sharīʿah meaning of <em>bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah</em>, <em>“A new way introduced in the Dīn which resembles (aspects) of the Sharī</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah which is only practiced in order to exceed in worshipping Allāh.”</em> [ʿAlī Maḥfūẓ, <em>al-Ibdā</em><em>ʿ</em><em> Fī Maḍhār al-Ibtidā</em><em>ʿ</em> [p.15]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>[A]</strong> The linguistic definition of <em>bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah</em> is: <em>“Something invented without having any prior example.”</em> This is based upon its usage in the Qur&#8217;ān in the saying of Allāh, <strong>“Say: “I am not a new thing <em>(bid</em></strong><strong><em>ʿ</em></strong><strong><em>an)</em></strong> <strong>amongst the Messengers” (Sūrah al-Aḥqāf:9)</strong>, meaning Muḥammad is not a new thing amongst the Messengers, as he has precedents and prior examples before him (Isā, Mūsā, Ibrāhīm and so on). [Shāṭibī, <em>al-Ei</em><em>ʿ</em><em>tisām</em> [1:43]. Some linguists have defined <em>bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah</em> as, <em>“Innovating something new in the Dīn after its completion or any statement or action based on whims, desires or personal opinion innovated after the Messenger of Allāh </em>(Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam)<em>.”</em> Some added “<em>A statement or action without and prior precedence.”</em> [<em>al-Qāmūs al-Muḥiṭ</em> [p.906], Ibn Manzūr, <em>Lisān al-</em><em>ʿ</em><em>Arab</em> [6:8], Ibn al-Fāris, <em>Mu</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ajam al-Maqā</em><em>ʿ</em><em>is Fil Lugha</em> [p.119] and Ibn Taymiyyah,<em> Fatāwa</em> [35:414]. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[B]</strong> The word <em>bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah</em> in the Dīn has many meanings attached to it. One such meaning is given by al-Shāṭibī who said, <em>“Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah</em><em> is an expression of a path taken in the religion, which is invented and resembles the Sharī</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah and by whose practice exaggeration in worshipping Allāh is intended”</em> [Shāṭibī, <em>al-Ei</em><em>ʿ</em><em>tisām</em> [1:53]. Ibn Rajab said. <em>“Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah refers to newly invented actions which have no basis in the Sharī</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah. Actions that do have a basis in the Sharī</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah are not classed as innovations and are understood in the linguistic sense.”</em> [Ibn Rajab, <em>Jām</em><em>ʿ</em><em>e Ulūm al-Ḥikam</em> [2:127-128]. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[C] </strong>The Scholars of Ahlus Sunnah have explained that innovation is of two types. That which is<em> <strong>Ḥaqīqīyyah</strong> (or ḥaqīqī)</em>, meaning proper innovation, in every sense of the word. It has absolutely no association to, or basis in the Sharīʿah. [Shāṭibī, <em>al-Ei</em><em>ʿ</em><em>tisām</em> [1:367]. It is when a person seeks nearness to Allāh through something the Messenger of Allāh (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) never sought nearness to Allāh with at all, in its very foundation. From the examples of this type of innovation is seeking nearness to Allāh through celebrating birthdays, through dancing and music, or through acting. Some scholars have mentioned different examples like monasticism and secluding oneself from the worldly life and benefits etc. Such people impose fabrictated types of worship on themselves. [Shāṭibī, <em>al-Ei</em><em>ʿ</em><em>tisām</em> [1:370], Ibn Kathīr, <em>Tafsīr al-Qurʾān al-</em><em>A</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ẓīm</em> [4:316], Saʿdī, <em>Taysīr al-Karīm ar-Rahmān Fī Tafsīr Kalām al-Manān</em> [1:782]. Shāṭibī mentions numerous other examples in his book. [Shāṭibī, <em>al-Ei</em><em>ʿ</em><em>tisām</em> [1:370-445].  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>[D]</strong> As for that which is <strong><em>Iḍāfīyyah</em></strong> (that which has a basis in the religion), this is when a person seeks nearness to Allāh on account of something by which nearness is in fact sought with Allāh in its foundation (asl). However, to which he adds something which takes it away from the form that it came with in the Sharīʿah and this is done in respect to six matters: <strong>(i)</strong> al-Kam (number), <strong>(ii)</strong> al-Kayf (form), <strong>(iii)</strong> al-Jins (type), <strong>(iv) </strong>al-Ṣabab (cause, reason), <strong>(v)</strong> al-Makān (place), <strong>(vi)</strong> al-Zamān (time). Hence, <strong><em>Bid</em></strong><strong><em>ʿ</em></strong><strong><em>ah</em></strong><strong><em> Iḍāfīyah</em></strong> [despite having a basis in the Sharīʿah] is rejected just as <strong><em>Bid</em></strong><strong><em>ʿ</em></strong><strong><em>ah</em></strong><strong><em> Ḥaqīqīyah</em></strong> is. This is because the six matters above are never established in the Qurʾān and Sunnah when the asal or foundation will be in the Qurʾān and Sunnah. [Ṣāleḥ bin Saʿd al-Suḥaimī, <em>Tanbīyyah Ulil al-Abṣār Ila Kamāl al-Dīn Wa Ma Fī al-Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah Min Akhṭār </em>[p.96], ʿAdawī, <em>Uṣūl Fī’l Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah Waʾl Sunan</em> [p.30] (also known as <em>Ṭarīq al-Wuṣūl Ilā Ibṭāl al-Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>a</em><em>h bi ʿIlm al-Uṣūl</em>). An example of <strong><em>Bid</em></strong><strong><em>ʿ</em></strong><strong><em>ah</em></strong><strong><em> Iḍāfīyah</em></strong> would be to offer special prayers in mid Shaʿbān despite prayer being established in the Dīn the mode and form of such a prayer is not established by the Messenger of Allāh (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) at the particular time, hence it is an innovation. Examples of this are making Zikr in unison after the five daily prayers etc. [Shāṭibī, <em>al-Ei</em><em>ʿ</em><em>tisām</em> [1:452], Ṣāleḥ bin Saʿd al-Suḥaimī, <em>Tanbīyyah Ulil al-Abṣār Ila Kamāl al-Dīn Wa Ma Fī al-Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah Min Akhṭār</em> [p.96]. <strong>[E]</strong> In fact, the ḥadīth of Āʿishah, <em>“Whoever introduces something into this affair of ours which does not belong to it, shall have it rejected.”</em> leads to the irrefutable conclusion that, nothing is considered a <em>bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah</em> in the <em>Sharī</em><em>ʿ</em><em>a</em><em>h</em> sense except when these conditions are met. These three conditions are: <em>‘</em><strong><em>al-Ihdāth</em></strong><em>’</em> &#8211; Introducing something new, <em>‘</em><strong><em>al-Iḍhāfah</em></strong><em>’</em> &#8211; Ascribing it to the religion, <em>‘</em><strong><em>A’dm al-Dalīl ash-Shar</em></strong><strong><em>ʿ</em></strong><strong><em>ī</em></strong><em>’</em> &#8211; Absence of Sharīʿah evidence [for this newly-introduced matter] in either a general way or a specific way from the prophet of Allāh. [See also ʿAlī Nāṣir al-Faqīhi, <em>al-Bid</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ah Ḍawābiṭha Wa </em><em>A</em><em>tharuhā al-Sayy</em><em>ʿ</em><em>ia Fi</em><em>ʿ</em><em>l Ummah </em>[p.12-13]. The Albanian Ḥadīth Master, Muḥammad Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī was of the opinion that most innovations are based on general principles which are still impermissible and al-Shatibi classed such innovations as <strong>Iḍāfī</strong>. [al-Albāni, <em>Ṣaḥīḥ Targīb Waʾl</em><em> Tarhīb</em> [1:54-55], <em>al-Radd al-Taʿqīb al-Hathīth</em> [p.48] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Ibn Taymiyyah said <em>“An innovation in the Dīn of Islām is every action not legislated by Allāh The Most High nor his Messenger </em><em>(Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam</em><em>)</em><em> ie something not legislated which is neither mandatory nor recommended.” </em>[Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>Majmū</em><em>ʿ</em><em>a Fatāwa</em> [4:107-108]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> There are numerous statements of Ibn Taymiyyah regarding <em>bidʿah</em> and its principles. For further clarification of Ibn Taymiyyahs words refer to <em>Majmū</em><em>ʿ</em><em>a al-Fatāwa</em> [4:194, 22:306, 18:346, 35:414]</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Bukhīt al-Mutī‘ī Al-Hanafī the Qadī of Alexandria (Egypt) said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When Umar bin Al-Hasan famously known as Abū Khattāb bin Dahiyyah whilst on his travels to Khurasān in 604H visited Irbil he saw the the kind Malik Mu&#8217;azam Muzaffar Al-Dīn bin Zain Al-Dīn was liked the Mawlid Al-Nabi. So with the intention of pleasing the king he authored a book called &#8216;al-Tanwīr Fī Mawlid Al-Sirāj Al-Munīr&#8217; which he read to the King himself. When he authored the book, Malik Mu&#8217;azam gave him 1000 Dinars.&#8221;</em> [Ahsan Al-Kalām Fimā Yata‘laq Bil-Sunnah Wa&#8217;l Bid‘ah Minal Ahkām [pp.70]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Sufi authored a book whilst hiding the truth and cloaking it with futile interpretations in establishing and the virtue of the Mawlid. He called it <em>&#8220;Al-Tanwīr Fi Mawlid Al-Bashir an-Nazir&#8221;</em> and eventually received 1000 dinars. Refer to Al-Bidāyah wan Nihāyah (13:124), Al-Hawī lil-Fatâwa (1:189), Wafyat al-A&#8217;yān (4:119). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The sufi&#8217;s full name was Umar bin Al-Hasan Abu Khatāb Dahiyyah Andalusī. As for his affair Imām Dhahabī said about him, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He is accused of lying even in the things he copies.&#8221; </em>(Mīzān (3:186)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Dhiya al-Maqdisi said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I did not like his affair in that he would tarnish the Imāms and then Ibrahim Sanhawari  informed that the scholars of Maghrib wrote concerning him in that they criticised and weakened him.&#8221;</em> [Mizān [3:186] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Ibn Najjār said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;I saw that the people were united and agreed on him being a liar and weak, likewise and similarly his claim t<span style="color: #000000;">he people he heard from when he never heard from them and those who he claimed to have met when he never met them.&#8221;</span></em> [Liīsān Al-Mizān [4:295]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hafiz Ibn Hajr said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;He was of the Zahiri madhab who would tarnish and degrade the honour of Imāms and Scholars of the Salaf, he had a vile tongue, he was a fool with utmost arrogance and very little insight in the affairs of the Dīn and very lazy.&#8221;</em> [Līsān Al-Mizān [4:296]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some researchers have speculated his attribution to the Zahiri Madhab was due to his Andalusian roots, where the Zahiri Madhab featured prominently. They also said the Maliki&#8217;s at the time conformed to their roots and adhered to the thoughts of the school in Fiqh and otherwise. Likewise the concept of any offshoot from the norm in those days would be attributed to the Zahiri Madhab due to its approach of independent reasoning. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This does not however mean he was a propagator of the madhab. This is often the case, you will find ardent Sufi&#8217;s claiming to be Zahiri&#8217;s or an an attribution to the Zahiri Madhab because of their need to be free and independent of the legislated rulings, however this is a direct contradiction of the Zahiri Madhab, which is strict adherence and rigorously conform to the Divine Texts. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imām Suyūti said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Besides his knowledge and memory he was ver</span>y immature in citing texts. He would make bold audacious claims and would say &#8216;he narrated to us&#8217; in his ijazahs.&#8221;</em> [Tabaqāt al-Huffāz [pp.498]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Taqī al-Dīn Ahmad bin Alī al-Maqrizī [845H] said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;The Fatimid Khaliphs would celebrate a number of Eīds and other special days in a year. They would celebrate at the end of the year, at the beginning of the year, the day of Ashurah, the Milād (birthday) of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, the Milād of Alī bin Abī Tālib, the Mawlid of Hasan, the Mawlid of Hussain, the Mawlid of Fatimah and the Mawlid of the current ruler, the first night of Rajab, the night of the Middle of Rajab, the first night of Sha&#8217;bān, the night of the Middle of Sha&#8217;bān&#8230;&#8221;</em> [al-Muwā&#8217;iz wa&#8217;l Ei‘tibār Bi Zikr al-Khitat wa&#8217;l Athār [2:436]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He goes onto says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;Processions and other acts during the six Milād son different days. They were the Milād of the Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, Amīr al-Mu&#8217;minīn Alī bin Abi Tālib, the Mawlid of Fatimah Alayhis Salām, the Mawlid of Al-Hasan, the Mawlid of Al-Hussain Alayhuma Asalām  and the Mawlid of the current Khaliph.&#8221;</em> [al-Muwā&#8217;iz wa&#8217;l Ei‘tibār Bi Zikr al-Khitat wa&#8217;l Athār [2:333]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He further said, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#8220;When the 12th of Rabī Al-Awwal would come they would prepare sweet dishes from 20 plates of sugar which would then be put on 300 silver plates and this would be the day of the Mawlid.&#8221;</em> [al-Muwā&#8217;iz wa&#8217;l Ei‘tibār Bi Zikr al-Khitat wa&#8217;l Athār [2:334]</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><br />
Question:</strong> The questioner says, O our virtuous Shaykh, what is your statement, may Allaah reward you with good: You repudiate A-Turaabee, At-Tilmisaanee,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Al-Ghazaalee, and Al-Qardaawee; you declare them to be innovators, and you refute them, and backbite them whilst leaving off mentioning their good qualities; while there are Imaams who fell into innovation, such as Ibn Hajr and An-Nawawee; but you mention the earlier ones with good while speaking about (i.e., refuting) the latter ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong> I say, firstly: This comparison from this person displays his ignorance. How can one compare Ibn Hajr and An-Nawawee to the likes of At-Turaabee, Al-Ghazaalee, and Al-Qardawee? What is dirt in comparison to the stars? What is dung in comparison to the camel? These (Imaams) are lovers of the Sunnah; explainers of it, and clarifiers of it. That which they misinterpreted and fell into was miniscule in light of that which they clarified from the affairs of Al-Islaam. So the people of knowledge continue to benefit from their speech. Rather, they understand the texts of the Book and the Sunnah based upon that which they clarified, because they were people of knowledge, in truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for these latter day people, from the likes of At-Turaabee, Al-Ghazaalee, Al-Qardaawee, At-Tilmisaanee, and their likes; these are heads in calling the people to not clinging to the Sunnah, and to its rejection. Hence, the condition is different. (You have) he who errs and avoids that which is correct in an issue or a branch from the subsidiary branches or an issue or two of creed (and on the other hand) he who opposes (the Sunnah) at its basis. These (latter people) do not give Tawheed any status and they have no concern for it. Rather, the people of Tawheed have encountered from them the greatest harms, as is attested to. At-Turaabee is such that his condition is known. He deems that there is a need for <em>“updating”</em> the foundations of Al-Islaam, and <em>“updating” </em>the principles of Fiqh; and that the principles of Fiqh is terminology of the scholars, in spite of the fact that the texts are understood based upon these principles; and this (according to At-Turaabee) does not mean that we are bound by them. So he says that we must institute new principles for Fiqh by way of which we can understand the Book and the Sunnah with that which is appropriate for this era.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Ghazaalee rejects the Sunnah if it opposes his intellect and if it opposes his understanding. Al-Qardaawee traverses upon the same program, although he does not openly display that like Al-Ghazaalee. At-Tilmisaanee does not acknowledge Tawheed Al-‘Ibaadah nor the Sunnah. He mixes up the affairs greatly. There is no wonder (that this is the case); for these four, and those of their ilk, graduated from the same (ideological) school; it is the school of the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimeen. This school is known, in its foundations and its methodology; so it is no wonder that the likes of these would come out in the future; and it is no wonder that the likes of these are present in the likes of this time, as long as they are nurtured upon the principles of that school. So repudiation of them and that which they are upon (is a must). For they lead the youth astray in the name of the Da’wah. The youth venerate them thinking that they are callers to Al-Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr and An-Nawawee, not one day have we heard that anyone defended an issue from the issues of creed in which they erred using as a proof that Ibn Hajr said it or An-Nawawee said it. Their mistakes passed away in their time, and it remains that the people benefit from their abundant knowledge and their enlightened understanding. As for these (latter guys), they cannot compare, and it is not permissible that they be placed alongside these (Imaams); and the dirt cannot compare to the stars.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[133] </strong></span><span style="color: #000080"><strong>From Malik from Al-&#8216;Ala Ibn Abdurahman from his father from Abu Hurairah (Radi Allahu Anhu) that (once) </strong></span><span style="color: #000080"><strong>the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) came to the graveyard and said: &#8220;Peace be upon you! (i.e. May Allah grant you peace) The abode of the believing people and we, if Allah so wills, are about to join you. I love to see my brothers.&#8221; They (the companions) said: Aren&#8217;t we your brothers, O Messenger of Allah? He said: You are my companions, and our brothers are those who have, so far, not come into the world and I would arrive at the Hawd (Kawthar) before them . They said: Messenger of Allah, how would you recognise those persons of your Ummah who will after you (and have not yet been born into the world yet)? He said: What do you think about a man who had horses with white faces and feet among horses which were all black, tell me, would he not recognise his own horses? They said: Certainly, O Messenger of Allah. He said: These people (my Ummah) will come ono the day of Judgement with white faces, arms and feet (due to the ablution), and I would arrive at the Hawd (Kawthar) before them. Then some people would be driven away from my Hawd (Kawthar) as the stray camel is driven away. I would call out to them (three times): Come here, come here, come here. Then it would be said (to me): These people changed (the Sunnah and the religion of Islam by Innovating things into it) after you (passed away), thus I would say: Get far away (from me), get far away (from me), get far away (from me).<br />

<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="color: #000080">[GRADING]</span> – [IT&#8217;S CHAIN IS SAHIH]</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000080">[REFERENCES] <span style="color: #000000">&#8211; [MUSLIM]</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Al-Muwatta (Yahya’s narration (1/28-30 hadith no.57, book 2, chapter 6, hadith no.28), at-Tamhid (20/238, 239) al-Istidhkar (no.51)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Transmitted by Muslim (no.249) from the hadith of Malik </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>[UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HADITH]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000">1) Apart from specifically making special preparations to travel to a particular grave, it is highly recommended to visit the graveyard in order to make dua for the deceased Muslim people and to reflect and remember death. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Note that the prohibition of visiting graves has been abrogated. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">2) Women are allowed to visit the graves of their close relatives such as their brother etc. just as it is established from the authentic ahadith. See Sahih Bukhari (no.1283) and Sahih Muslim (no.974, Darusalam no.2256)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">A&#8217;isha (Radi Allahu Anha) went to the grave of her brother Abdurahman Ibn Abi Bakr (Radi Allahu Anhuma). (See al-Mustadrak of al-Hakim 1376 hadith no.1392, and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Sahih]</em> and adh-Dhahabi authenticated it)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">However note that it is not allowed for women to go the graves of non-relatives such as the grave of a scholar who was famous amongst the general people. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">See Sunan Abi Dawud (no.3123 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Hasan]</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">Rather the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) has cursed (sent La&#8217;nah) on those women who visit graves frequently. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">See Sunan Ibn Majah (no.1576, and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Hasan]</em>) and Sunan at-Tirmidhi (no.1056, and he said: <em>[Hasan Sahih]</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">3) Asalamu alaikum is a dua. In no way does this mean that the dead can hear because it is wajib for the one who hears the salam to reply back to it and there is no authentic hadith which mentions that the dead person gives the reply of salam. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">4) The meaning of when the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said that those righteous believers who will come after him are his brothers was an indication of his great love and great kindness for them. On the other hand the The Prophet or Messenger (Alayhimusalam) is the Imam, guide, leader and the one who should be obeyed. He is not restricted to only being a big brother (!) it is noteworthy to understand this point fully. The righteous predecessors did not go around saying that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) was our big brother and we should respect him (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) as a big brother is respected. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">5) The Hawd Kawthar is a reality. The people who innovate in the religion and the wrongdoers will be taken far away from it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">6) The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) will recognise his followers from the Ummah on the day of Judgement because the body parts which they did ablution on will be shining. For example see at-Tamhid (20/261, 262 and it&#8217;s chain is <em>[Hasan]</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">7) The Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) did not have knowledge of the unseen rather Allah is the only One who has knowledge of the unseen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000">8) It is a highly good deed to act upon the Quran and Sunnah in the era where there are severe amounts of Innovation in the religion, misguidance, disbelief and oppression. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"> </span></p>
