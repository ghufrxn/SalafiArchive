				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated</strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abu Khuzaimah </strong><strong>Ansari</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ignorant people of other faiths, in their emotionally filled rants and outbursts against Islām allege the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) slept with the body of Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha based on the wording of this ḥadīth. Such horrible claims are often regurgitated by people who follow and believe in Christianity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is an outright lie and a desperate attempt to discredit Islām, such claims are often raised by people who have not read anything about Islām and rather just take some information from websites, who extend most of their efforts to concoct fallacious allegations against Islām.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This treacherous claim rests on the words  فاضطجع  They claim the word means to sleep, lay down ie he lay down with Fātimah bint Asad to have sex with her and this Arabic word is often used to denote to lie down and sleep with someone. We seek refuge in Allāh from such lies and aspersions. Āmīn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Firstly:</strong> </span> we have shown this ḥadīth is weak in the preceding discourse, but let’s assume for arguments sake that it was authentic, then;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Secondly:</strong></span> The word اضطجع means to lie, lie down, recline, repose and sleep according to the well known Arabic dictionaries. It does not mean to sleep or to lay down for sex. This is also the word the Christians use in their Arabic translation of the Bible. Hence, they say وَدَخَلَ أَلِيشَعُ الْبَيْتَ وَإِذَا بِالصَّبِيِّ مَيْتٌ وَمُضْطَجعٌ عَلَى سَرِيرِهِ. [<em>And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed</em>. (2Kings 4:32) Kings James Version).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So one asks, does the word laid here also mean, ‘lay to have sex?’ Of course it does not! Then why is this meaning specified and restricted to the ḥadīth only.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> </span>the wording of the ḥadīth clearly mentions the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) entered the grave after it was dug and the body of Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha had not been lowered into the grave. The Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) lay in the grave after it was dug by his companions. The grave had a Laḥd, which is a horizontal opening in the vertically dug grave. The Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) also dug the grave and the Laḥd after which he lay in it. Thereafter, he stood up and eventually the body was lowered into the grave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should therefore be noted; the body was lowered into the grave after he stood up &#8211; the body was not even in the grave when he was lying down in it! What kind of necrophilia was this? We presume the claimants can further shed some light on this matter, for the claimants are likely to know the reality and details of necrophilia the best, perhaps from experience in the modern Christian atheistic world, because surely one only accuses others of things they have experience, practice and knowledge about.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we ask again? How is the alleged incident even possible when the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) did not even lie next to the body, unless the detractors have developed other forms of sex!!! Again, this would not be surprising because this is what happens when you abandon your scriptures by distorting the divine message they contained.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The wording of the report further shows the great care and love the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) had for Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha, the alleged wording says,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;">“<strong><em>When camphor water was brought, Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) poured some water into his hands. Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) took off his shirt and clothed her with it and used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This showed the love and care the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) had for her due to her status. The detractors show more affection and care for animals and dogs and regularly bathe them, how about Fātimah bint Asad RaḍiAllāhū ʿAnha, who was his paternal aunt and looked after him just like his mother! At what expense is the human mind and intelligence being carelessly wasted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Fourthly:</strong></span> another indication which shows the futility of this repulsive allegation is the fact that the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) used his shirt and wrapped it around her and then used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin, the words are,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>“Then Allāh’s Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him) took off his shirt and clothed her with it and used his own sheet of cloth as her coffin.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again, a sane, upright and normal human being asks, why would a person use their own shirt to wrap the corpse of his paternal aunt &#8211; a mother like figure, then use his own sheets as her coffin, then dig her grave with his own hands, then lie in her grave and supplicate to the creator to forgive and have mercy on her (allegedly as the ḥadīth is weak), then to have her lowered in the grave, then unfasten the coffin sheets and shirt and then indulge in necrophilia? Absolutely preposterous!   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like to exercise our common sense by using our brains and minds, given to us by our creator and ask, what were the other companions doing during this incident of necrophilia? Why do this in the grave and not on the ground if they were looking?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people have no idea about the stature, uprightness and credibility of the illustrious companions, that they would allow someone to do such a heinous act in front of them. The companions were powerful, they were Ūsāmah bin Zayd, Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī, ʿUmar bin al-Khaṭṭāb and the Abyssinian companion, May Allāh be pleased with all of them. Who does not know the lofty credentials of ʿUmar bin al-Khaṭṭāb, that even satan was forced to change paths when he would see him due to his, principles, morals, standards, character and firm belief. That the likes of these companions just stood there and watched this evil incident to unfold.       </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Fifthly:</strong> </span>the detractors should know in Islām purification and cleanliness play a pivotal role in the daily life of Muslims. For example, Muslims are instructed to hold their private parts with their left hand because they have been instructed to eat with their right. They are instructed to sit down while relieving themselves, they are instructed to protect themselves and their clothes from urine and faeces, they are instructed to clean themselves with water, they are instructed to wash their hands everytime they relieve themselves, they are instructed to conceal their private parts from others and much more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muslims were given these instructions by the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam), whose words in the Religion are taken as divine texts, ie from the Prophetic Ḥadīth. This said, the rules, regulations and etiquettes for sexual intercourse between legally married partners in Islām require a greater level of purification and cleanliness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The point being, on another occasion the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) asked his companions to help lower a body into a grave, and he asked them if any of them were in a state of sexual impurity, ie if they had spent the night with their lawful wives. One of the companion who was in a state of sexual impurity was asked not to help in lowering the body (Bukhārī).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This honours the deceased, ie the people who help lower the deceaseds body are in a state of ritual purity and clean. So when a person is in a state of sexual impurity and he is not allowed to partake in lowering the deceased, then how about the act of sexual intercourse with a corpse! Let alone the rules and regulations Muslims have when it comes to intimacy and intercourse.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We mentioned examples of how Muslims uphold purification and cleanliness while relieving themselves and at the same token the clever people who regurgitate these treacherous lies about the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallm), are the same people who do not even wash their hands when they go to the toilet, they have cascades of urine droplets on their clothes and toilet seats. They are the same people who would not bathe for weeks, just less than 100 years and when they would bathe, the whole family would use the water, whereas our glorious Prophetic Divine teachings go back 1400 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, it is absolutely absurd and a despicable aspersion to even suggest this notion of necrophilia, which is an outright treacherous lie.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All Praise is to Allaah, the Most High and Majestic, may there be abundant salutations upon the Messenger of Allah (r) and his family.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After translating the book <em>‘The (Aqidah of the) Bareilwis and Deobandis Are The Same’</em> of Shaikh Talib ur Rehman, we thought it would be beneficial to publish it as two separate treatises, with the aim to highlight the beliefs of these two sects separately for the new reader who may want to know the basics of their beliefs.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Aqeedah of Wahdatul Wajood (ie Allaah is incarnate in everything) that Allaah Came To This Earth as Muhammad (r)</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Deobandee Aqeedah</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah (the famous author of Fadhail Amaal) said whilst ­presenting the poetry of Qaasim Nanautwee, <em>“Remained the veil of being a man on your grandeur, we do not know who is what in the part of the veil”</em> (Tableegi Nisaab pg.810)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Zakariyyah writes about the very famous proponent of ­wahdatul ­wajood, Mansoor Hallaaj, <em>“And mansoor was hanged just on the basis of leaving ­etiquettes, his saying of annal-Haqq (I am the truth) was the Haqq (ie the truth) but one word too blasphemous.”</em> (Walee Kaamil pg.279)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> The close Soofee disciple of Zakariyyah, Soofee Iqbal writes <em>“Love, the loved and the lover say it as one, and so the oneness was explained.” </em>(Muhabbat pg.70)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [2]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Attributes Of Allaah Are Exclusive For Him And Even Messenger of Allaah (r) Cannot Have Them.</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah writes, <em>“Allaah, the truth who is an encompassment of every grandeur and goodness then in reality there is none other than his ­grandeur.” </em>(Tableegi Nisaab pg.300)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Maulana Rasheed Ahmad Gangohee said, <em>“Sayyid Sahib had the attributes of the almighty incarnated in him.”</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.185)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Ashraf Alee Thanwee writes, <em>“The one who is complete has a position called Abul-Waqt and when he wishes to have Allaahs attributes to be incarnated in him he can do so. it is not strange that Shaah Sahib may have had attribute of al-Jabbar incarnated in him at that time and from his position of mazhariyyat he may have resolved it by this attention.”</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.68)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [3]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Mankind Can Only Claim to be the Worshipper of Allaah and Nothing Else As This Is Shirk.</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Haajee Imdaadullah Muhaajar Makkee writes, <em>“As the Messenger of Allaah </em>(r) <em>is the truth you can call the worshipping slave of Allaah the ­worshipping slave of the Messenger.” </em>(Shamaa’im Imdaadiyyah 2/71)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly Manzoor Numaanee said about Shah Abdur Rasool that he was from the well known Auliyaas of Muhammad Mian. (Monthly ­al-Furqaan Shaikh ul Hadeeth no pg.66)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [4]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Only Allaah Alone Can Help And No Prophet Or Holy Person Can Help.</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maulana Ahsan Gheelanee writes, <em>“We do not deny or reject seeking help from the souls of the Auliyaa, hence so if a believer ­inflicted with troubles seeks help from good souls then what verse of the Quraan or Hadeeth refutes this.”</em> (Haashiyah Suwaaneh Qaasimee 1/332)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> The deobandee author Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah writes, <em>“The scholars of Deoband never say that no one other than Allaah can have knowledge of the unseen and similarly they also do not believe and accept that a man during his life or even after his death has no power to help.”</em> (Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah pg.101)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> In another place he writes, <em>“Every man whether in this world or in the state or barzakh needs the permission of Allaah and his spirituality. Up until there is permission some souls who are in the state of barzakh help the people, who are from this world and tell them some things.”</em> (Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah pg.152)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> the Deobandee author of Inkishaaf writes, <em>“The friendship of Allah and the miracles of the Auliyaa remain after their deaths with the permission of Allah and so with regards to this just understand that souls of the auliya can also come to this world with the permission of Allaah and can help the people with the command of Allaah.”</em> (Inkishaaf pg.67).</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [5]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Only Allaah Can Help With Calamities And He Alone Is The One Who Is Asked For Help.</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is no reference to this quote so we have not translated it, but it is a poem of Imdaadullah Muhaajir Makkee and Qaasim Nanautwee full of shirk.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [6]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Only Allaah Alone can Remove Calamities</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Deobandee author of Inkishaaf writes whilst quoting a book on Soofee terminology, <em>“It is these people who are the inheritors of the Prophets and they are the ones who remove the calamities of the creation.”</em> (Inkishaaf pg.250)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [7]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Only Allaah Is the One Who We Plea To And He Is The Helper (ie Gauth)</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ashraf Alee Thanwee whilst talking about an incident says, <em>“And so I remembered the happiness of the great helper ie (Gauth al-Azam) rahimahullah (here is talking about Shaikh Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee)</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.123)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Imaadullaah Muhaajir Makkee writes, <em>“The auliya are the pillars from the pillars of Allaah”</em> (Shamaa’im Imdaadiyyah Part 2 pg.55)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> [8]</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Believing Other Than Allaah Have The Knowledge Of The Unseen</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee  Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Read the following incidence of a shaman having knowledge of the unseen, Mr Zakariyyah (the author of Fadhail Amaal) said <em>“Shaikh Abu Yazeed Qurtubee said, “I heard whoever recites the kalimah 70,000 times will be saved from the fire of Hell.” Upon hearing this I recited the kalimah 70,000 times for my wife and also recited the kalimah for myself as a means of salvation. A young boy used to live with us and it was well known that he had the power of Kashf (ie he could see apparitions) of both Paradise and Hell but I had reservations about this. One day we were eating and all of a sudden he started to scream and began to breath erratically and said my mother is being burnt in the Hellfire, I can see her.” Qurtubee said I was seeing his anxiety and thought I should transfer a set of 70,000 kalimahs to his mother and at the same time see if he is telling the truth about having the ability to see apparitions. So I transferred the kalimah to his mother and I did this inherently in my heart so no one knew of this except Allaah. The boy said, “Oh uncle my mother ie being removed from the Hellfire.” So I benefitted from this incident in 2 ways, firstly the benefit of the recitation of the kalimah 70,000 times as I saw an incident myself first hand and secondly the truth about the boy having the ability to see apparitions”</em> (Fadhail Tableegi Nisaab pg.576)</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> [9]</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The People of This World Call Upon Those Who Are Dead, Who Do Not Have The Ability to Speak, Listen, Smell, Hold or To See in This World.</span></strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah Deobandee said, <em>“An old man who was my fathers friend and also from his sincere servants had the ability to see apparitions and he had a status in seeing apparitions pertaining to the grave. On the second day after my fathers demise he visited his grave and my father said 3 things to him and there were many people who opposed my father. (1) he said say to moulwee Zakariyyah not to worry about them (ie the opposers) they will themselves bare the fruits of their harm, (2) my father had a lot of debt and there were many people who would ask (for their money back) he said do not worry about it (ie it has been paid) (3) always fear the elderly people as their wrong is really right.”</em> (Teen Majaalis pg.185)</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Coming and Goings of Souls Is A Mere Fallacy of These Mullahs And A Means of Filling Their Hell Bent Stomachs In Which The Deobandee are Similar to the Bareilwees</strong></span></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Deobandee author of Teen Majaalis writes, <em>“Always do good deeds and transfer them to the elders as by doing this their souls are attentive and due to this we seek blessings”</em> (Teen Majaalis pg.211)</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Zakariyyah mentions an incident he had heard from his father, <em>“When the Jamna river is at its shores peak crossing it becomes impossible. There was a man from Panee Pat who was accused of killing someone and he wanted to flee across the river. So he would ask the boat people to take him accross but they would decline  and would say we will drown in the river. So the poor worried man just kept on crying. A man who saw the bad state he was in said to him, “I’ll tell you a solution if you don’t mention my name. A holy shaman/nympholept lives over there in that small hut, so go to him and do whatever he says and be of service to him not leaving anything out. He may swear to you and even hit you but whatever he does do not hit him back. So this poor worried man went to this shaman and did as he was told and as he was told the shaman was rude and obtrusive and said, “Im not no god what can I do?” So the man continued to cry profusely (and crying is something important, may Allaah grant me blessing for me to cry[Zakariyyahs words]) so the shaman said to him, “Go to the river Jamna and say to it, “I have been sent by the man who has never eaten anything in his whole life nor slept with his wife so give me way.” So when this was said, the river gave way.”</em> (Fadhail Sadaqaat pg.528)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The deobandee author of Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah, Najm ud deen writes, <em>“The Scholars of Deoband do not say this at all that other than Allaah cannot have knowledge of the unseen.”</em> (Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah pg.101)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In one place Najm ud deen writes, <em>“The scholars of deoband also believe that some of the knowledge of the unseen can also be acquired by some of the normal people in addition to the Prophets, Auliyaa and purified ones.”</em> (Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah pg.98)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another place he writes, <em>“People are born in every era who Allaah has gifted and granted things to and has informed them of many hidden and concealed things.”</em> (Zalzalah Dar Zalzalah pg.114)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author of Arwah ath-Thalatha writes, <em>“Maulana Muzaffar Hussain travelled to the house of Allaah on the 23 of Jumadee ath-Thaanee in the year 1282H and on his journey just before he reached Makkah, he fell ill due to diarrhoea. So one day he said to Haajee Imdaadullah, “I wish that I die in Madeenah but as the time of my death is approaching would you kindly perform spiritual communion (ie with Allaah) and find out for me. When Haajee Imdaadullah had completed his spiritual communion he said to Muzaffar Hussain, “No don’t worry you will get to Madeenah.” After a few days Muzaffar Hussain became better and hence travelled to Madeenah. Whilst on his journey, when he was short distance away from Madeenah he became ill again and died on the 10<sup>th</sup> of Muharram 1283H. He was buried near the grave of Uthmaan </em>(t)<em>.”</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.222)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author of Arwah ath-Thalatha writes, <em>“Shah Abdur Raheem Walaytee had a trusted soofee disciple whose name was Abdullaah Khan and was of the Rajpoot caste.

So whatever he would say is what would happen.”</em> (Arwah ath-Thalatha pg.185)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A disciple of Ashraf Alee Thanwee wrote, <em>“In a dream I was reciting the kalimah Laa Ilaaha Illalaahu Muhammadur Rasoolullah but I say Ashraf Alee instead of Muhammad all the time. My heart said I am making a mistake whilst reciting the kalimah and I should recite it correctly. With this intention I recited the kalimah again thinking that I am reciting it correctly but uncontrollably I say Ashraf Alee instead of Muhammadur Rasoolullaah. Whereas I know this is not correct but uncontrollably the words were being uttered. When this happened for a few times I saw the Shaikh infront of me and the usual people that were with him. During this time whilst I was standing I began to tremble and my body began to move as if I was in a fit. I fell down and screamed loudly, I felt powerless. At this instance I woke up but I was still very weak. Even after I woke up I was still thinking of the Shaikh (ie Ashraf Alee) and when I remembered my mistake regarding the kalimah I intended to remove this thought so that I don’t make such a mistake again. So I sat up and turned and lay on my other side and began to send salutations upon the Prophet but still I kept on saying, Allaahuma Sallee Ala Sayyidana Wa Nabiyina Maulana Ashraf Alee, whereas now I was awake and was not dreaming and yet again it was uncontrollable and as if I was forced and had no control over my tongue. Similar thoughts remained in my mind the same day. The next day my body kept on moving uncontrollably as if I was in a fit and I cried a lot. Even now there are many reasons why I love the Shaikh so much, how can I mention everything.”</em> (Risaalah al-Imdaad pg.35)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So Ashraf Alee Thanwee instead of saying to his disciple to remove this thought from his mind and repent to Allaah he gives the following encouraging answer, <em>“Answer: This incident contain reassurance that the one who you refer to is by Allaah a follower of the Sunnah”</em> (24<sup>th</sup> Shawwaal 1335H, Risaalah al-Imdaad pg.35)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ashraf Alee Thanwee brings the following narration of Jaabir (t) concerning the creation of the Messenger of Allaah (r), <em>“Oh Jaabir before Allaah created anything he created your Prophets Noor from his own Noor and not in terms of meaning but his essence itself. He created him with the blessings of his Noor and then that Divine Noor roamed wherever Allaah wished. At that time there was no Lauh, Pen, Paradise, Hell, Angels, Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon, Jinn nor mankind. Then when Allaah wished to create his creation and he divided that noor into 4 parts. With one part he created the Pen, the Lauh with the second part, the Throne with the third part. This hadeeth therefore proves the Noor of Muhammad </em>(r) <em>was the first thing that was created. Similarly Alee </em>(t)<em> narrates the Prophet said, “14,000 years before the creation I (the Messenger of Allaah) was a noor with Allaah.</em>” (Nashr at-Tayyib pg.5-6)</span></p>

To this Haajee Imdaadullah answered and said, <em>“This is the blessings of prophecy on your heart and this heavy constricting feeling you feel is when something is being revealed.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Deobandee Aqeedah</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah said that Ilyaas said to me, <em>“Thanwees sayings are evidences and proofs for you and me.”</em> (Mahboob al-A’arifeen pg.30)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> In one place Mr Zakariyyah answers a question posed by a person by saying, <em>“You wrote the evidence should only be from the Quraan, Hadeeth or fiqh, as the statements of scholars will not be accepted. I say concerning this, an ­Al­laamah like yourself has the right not to take the statements of the scholars but for someone like me with little knowledge all the statements of the people of the truth and those who are trustworthy are evidence.</em>” (The Problems with the Books of Fadhail and their Answers pg.128)</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Who Is The One Who is Really Disrespectful (Gustaakh) To The Prophet</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Deobandee Aqeedah</span></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zakariyyah said, <em>“I saw my dads sister when she was nearing death she shouted and said, “Hurry and make me sit up and the Prophet </em>(r)<em> is coming, then her soul left her. When my paternal grandfather Maulana Ismaa’eel died there was a crowd for 3 and a half miles from Nizaam ud Deen to Delhi. A man who had the ability to see apparitions saw that Maulana Ismaa’eel said, “Bury me quickly as I am very embarassed because the prophet is waiting for me with his companions.”</em> (Maulana Ilyaas and his Religious Dawah pg.48)</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Who Disrespects The Companions</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Deobandee Aqeedah</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Munshee Muhammad Eesaa mentions the statement of Mr Thanwee concerning Mr Zakariyyah and his group, “(then Mr Thanwee) addressed the gathering and said, <em>“If anyone wants to see how the prophets companions were, then look at these people.”</em> (Tablighi Tahreek Kee Ibtidaa Aur Iske Bunyaadee Usool pg.51 <em>‘The Beginning Of the Tableeghi Movement &amp; Its Fundamental Principles’</em>)</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Reciting The Qur’aan Next To A Grave – Clarifying the Position of Imaam Ahmad</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Was Imaam Ahmad Unaware of these Ahadeeth</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(A student of Abdul-Fattah Abu Guddah al-Hanafee, Muhammad Awaamah attempted to discredit Imaam Ahmad by establishing this chapter heading in his book <em>Athar al-Hadeeth</em>, which Shaikh Irshaad ul-Haqq answered)</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh Muhammad Awaamah during this discussion said about Imaam Ahmad that he also did not have knowledge of certain ahadeeth. Imaam Ahmad no doubt was a man however the examples that have been put forward which the Shaikh has mentioned are not correct. He said, Imaam Abu Bakr Khalaal said,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> “Said to me Hasan bin Ahmad al-Warraaq, said to him Alee bin Moosaa al-Haddaad that, “I was in a funeral with Imaam Ahmad and Muhammad bin Qudaamah al-Jauharee and when the body of the deceased was buried, a blind man began to recite the Qur’aan next to the grave. Imaam Ahmad said, “Reciting the Qur’aan next to the grave is an innovation.” So when we left the graveyard Muhammad bin Qudaamah said to Imaam Ahmad, ”What do you say concerning Mubasshir al-Halabee?” Imaam Ahmad replied, “He is thiqah (trustworthy)” So Muhammad ibn Qaudaamah said, “Mubasshir narrated via Abdur-Rahmaan bin E’laa bin al-Hajjaaj that his father willed that Soorah Faatihah and the beginning and last part of Soorah al-Baqarah be recited when he be buried. He said he heard this from Umar and he would oftenly ask for this to b also done for him. So upon hearing this Imaam Ahmad said to the man, “Return and recite on the grave of the deceased.” (Kitaabar-Rooh (p.17) Athar al-Hadeeth (p.125)</span></em></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then Muhammad Awaamah further cited narrations concerning this from Ellal al-Mutnaahiyyah (1/428-443) and from Tahdheeb (6/320)</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then</span></p>
<h4 style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span></h4>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the reference from Kitaab ar-Rooh of the statement of Imaam Abu Bakr al-Khalaal and this incident, then its chain is not authentic because the biography of Hasan bin al-Warraaq could not be found after a lengthy search.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shaikh al-Asar Allaamah al-Albaanee haafidhahullaah (the Shaikh Rahimahullah) was alive when this treatise was written) said,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“I could not find his biography in any of the books of narrators I have.” (Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz footnote (p.192)</span></em></p>
<h4 style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Secondly</strong></span></h4>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Contrary to this Imaam Abu Dawood writes,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“I heard from Imaam Ahmad when a questioner asked him concerning the reciting of the Qur’aan next to a grave, he said it should not be recited.” (Masaa’il Imaam Ahmad narrated by Imam Abu Dawood (p.158), Majmoo Fataawa of Ibn Taymiyyah (24/301-307), Masaa’il Ahmad (1/190) narrated by Ibn Haanee and narrated by the son of Imaam Ahmad (Abdullaah) (2/494-495)</span></em></p>
<h4 style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span></h4>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The position of Haafidh Ibn al-Qayyim himself is contrary to this (as the reference for the above incident is cited from his book), he writes,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“This was not the way of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) to gather the people to recite the Qur’aan in order to mourn the deceased, nor whilst next to the grave or at any other place, all of this are prohibited and despicable innovations.” (Zaad al-Ma’aad (1/146)</span></em></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He writes a couple of lines before this,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“When the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) would finish burying a person, he and his companions would stand by the grave and would supplicate for the deceased to be steadfast and he would also command the companions with this. He would not recite (the Qur’aan) whilst sitting next to the grave nor would he instruct the deceased to do so, as the people do nowadays.” (Zaad al-Ma’aad (1/145)</span></em></p>
<h4 style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Fourthly</strong></span></h4>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Abdur-Rahmaan bin E’laa bin al-Hajjaaj in this chain is unknown. Allaamah Dhahabee said,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“No one other than Bishr bin Ismaa’eel narrated from him.” (Meezaan (2/579)</span></em></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Imaam Ibn Abee Haatim mentioned him in al-Jarh Wat-Ta’deel but he did not mention any criticism or praise of him. (Imaam Ibn Abee Haatim remaining silent about a narrator in his book al-Jarh Wa-Ta’deel is evidence that he is unknown according to him, see my book Taudheeh al-Kalaam (2/441-442)</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However Ibn Hibbaan has mentioned him in ah-Thiqaat (7/90) but according to the Imaams and scholars of this science his praise alone is not sufficient. This is the reason why Haafidh Ibn Hajr said about him,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">“From the seventh level (of narrators), he is accepted.” (Taqreeb (p.208)</span></em></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst explaining the details of the words of praise and criticism in the introduction of his Taqreeb he clarifies the narrator who has less or a small number of narrations and nothing is established from that may cause one to leave his ahadeeth then his hadeeth is accepted, only if he is supported (in his narration) if he is not supported then he will be considered to be weak. In hadeeth</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: inherit;">Therefore as Abdur-Rahmaan has no support, he is weak in hadeeth according to Haafidh Ibn Hajr. Hence when the chain of this incident and the chain of the narration are not authentic then it is not correct to draw such conclusions from this hadeeth. For further details see Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (p.191-193) (of Imaam al-Albaanee)</span></span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Translated by</span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> Rasheed ibn  Estes Barbee</span></strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Questioner</strong>:</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is the ruling in Islam concerning Sufism?</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Answer</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sufism, there is no Sufism in Islam, this is an innovation. Sufism is an innovation, it is not from Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus it is upon those who have fallen into Sufism to repent to Allah the Exalted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And it is upon them to return to the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And it is upon them to return to that which the pious predecessors were upon from uprightness and firmness upon the Deen of Allah and following the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah are upon him, and following the rightly guided successors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the pure unadulterated methodology.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings are upon him said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>This nation will divide into seventy three sects all of them will be in the fire except one. They said: Who are they oh Messenger of Allah? He replied: Those who are upon what I and my companions are upon.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus there is no safety and security except by following the Minhaj of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings are upon, him and his companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And Sufism is not from the Minhaj of the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah are upon him, and it is not from the Minhaj of his companions, and it is not from the Minhaj of the virtuous generations; rather it is something newly invented in Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">And it (Sufism) contains a great deal of deviations; some of which contains grave worship and shirk with Allah the Exalted and belief in the dead.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Thus Sufism also contains polytheism.</span></p>
