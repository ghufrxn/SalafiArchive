<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> The Messiah (Jesus, son of Mary) was no more than a Messenger, many were the Messengers that passed away before him. His mother (Mary) was a Siddeeqah (she believed in the words of Allaah and his Books). They both used to eat food [as other human beings do while Allaah does not eat]. Look at how We make the signs clear to them, yet look at how they are deluded from the Truth. (5:75) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Comments</font>    <P>
<blockquote>In this verse, Allaah establishes the invalidity of the saying of the Christian sects who appeared after Eesaa (peace be upon him) and ascribed divinity to him. The mother of Eesaa, Mary (peace be upon her) gave birth to Eesaa like all other women give birth, and this is only characteristic of humans, not of the Lord of the Worlds. Eesaa is simply a messenger like all the other messengers of Allaah who came and went. Allaah performed many miracles through the person of Eesaa (peace be upon him) as signs, admonitions, lessons and evidences for his truthfulness, just as He had done with previous Messengers.     <P>
His mother Mary (peace be upon her) was a very truthful woman in word and deed and she was a believer in previous scriptures and in the signs of Allaah. The words <i>siddeeq, siddeeqeen, siddeeqah</i> (representing the utmost truthfulness in intention, word and deed and congruency between them) are used in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> as the highest rank and status which comes after Prophethood, meaning the highest rank a human can achieve short of Prophethood.     <P>
Both Eesaa and his mother Mary used to eat food, because they were in need of food and drink in order to sustain their bodies, and anyone who is like that can never ever be a deity in truth, since one who is like this is dependant upon another and is not self-sufficient. And all people of sound <a href='tags/innate-disposition.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innate disposition</font></a> (<a href='tags/fitrah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fitrah</font></a>) know that dependence upon food is a sign of incapacity and he who is incapable (of self-sufficiency) can never be the deity in truth. Al-Baghawi, the exegete (mufassir), states that the mention of food here is an indirect expression of the passing of stool and urine, meaning that anyone who ate and drank must necessarily pass stool and urine, and thus, how can the one characterized as such be a deity in truth? So this is a subtle allusion to the falsehood of the claim of the <a href='tags/christians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Christians</font></a> that Eesaa is divine.    <P>
Allaah says, "<b>Look at how We make the signs clear to them, yet look at how they are deluded from the Truth</b>" this truth is recognized by people whose innate dispositions are intact and sound, and for this reason many of those who are disillusioned with the Christian doctrines innovated after Eesaa (peace be upon him) know and recognize the truth of what is said regarding Eesaa in Allaah's final revelation, the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, because their innate dispositions still have a semblance of recognition of what is imprinted in their souls, that there is no creator,  provider and sustainer worthy of worship besides Allaah alone.  </blockquote>    <P>
Refer to the tafsirs (explanations) of al-Tabari, al-Baghawi, Ibn Kathir, <a href='tags/al-sadee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Sa'dee</font></a> and Tafsir al-Muyassar for further elaboration upon this particular verse. <P>
