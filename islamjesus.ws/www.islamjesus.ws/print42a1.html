<blockquote>When a delegation of <a href='tags/christians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Christians</font></a> from Najraan came to the Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), they said to him, "O Muhammad, you belittle our companion (meaning Jesus)," and they meant that you call him an "Abd Allaah", slave of Allaah, and he replied, "It is not a shortcoming for Eesaa (Jesus) to be a slave of Allaah (Abd Allaah)," and this particular verse was then revealed. Jesus (peace be upon him) did not scorn being a slave of Allah, just as the near Angels do not scorn to be in servitude to Him, and he, like all the Prophets of good, were humble servants of Allah who bowed and prostrated to Him in humility and worship. This is in contrast to the exaggeration of the <a href='tags/christians.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Christians</font></a> with respect to the person of Jesus (peace be upon him), who raised him and gave him divine qualities. Thus Jesus is mentioned in this verse, along with the near Angels, who are in humble submission to their Lord. Jesus was desirous of worshipping his Lord, and this matter is still preserved in the Gospels that remain extant in which it is mentioned that Jesus would fall on his face in worship. This means <a href='tags/prostration.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prostration</font></a> and this was the worship of all the Prophets of Banee Israa'eel (Children of Israel), who would bow and prostrate in submission to their Lord.    <P>
And <a href='tags/prostration.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prostration</font></a> (<a href='tags/sujud.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sujud</font></a>) is from the greatest of aspects of  <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>, others being bowing (ruku') and standing (qiyaam), and sitting (julus) and invocation (<a href='tags/dua.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>du'a</font></a>) - and the Muslim <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> comprises of all of these matters, and it is the very <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> of all of the Prophets of Allaah whose details can still be found in the Torah and Gospel, enough to recognize the striking similarities.    <P>
So this is the example of Jesus, a Prophet, a humble worshipper of Allaah, in a line of Prophets, sent to the Jews calling them to single out Allaah in worship and to abide by the Torah, and he was a mortal, both he and his mother (peace be upon her) ate and drank, and his mother was favoured by Allaah for <a href=index660c.html?ehudu>her utmost chastity</a>, and He bestowed upon her this noble Prophet. They were monotheists, given to devotion and worship of Allaah, and they shunned the worship of others, and this was the very religion of Noah, Abraham,  Moses and Muhammad (peace be upon them all), which is represented in the word "Islam."    <P>
