<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Quotes from Shafi'i Jurists</font>    <P>
We have some valuable quotes in some of the more lengthy articles dealing with the academic fraud of todays <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> in trying to twist the statements of <a href='tags/al-shafii.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shafi'i</font></a> and some of the later Shafi'ite jurists such as <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> to justify innovations in worship in a broad sense. Because these are <u>important quotes</u> and are buried in long articles, we are going to isolate them and give them their own separate article for easy reference and linking purposes. At the same time it should be pointed out that whilst there is agreement between the general tone and spirit in the rejection by these scholars of innovations in worship and between what the Salaf were upon of the same, because of their particular orientation in understanding this matter, some of these jurists may have allowed certain affairs which the Salaf never allowed and which the Salaf would have treated as blameworthy innovations.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Imam al-Nawawi's Refutation of The Bid'ah of Salat al-Ragha'ib</font>    <P>
View this quote in <a href=indexd378.html?chbjn>the original article here</a>:    <P>
This fatwa can also be found in the printed version of his fatawa in "Fatawa al-Imaam al-Nawawi" organized and arranged by his student Alaa al-Din Ibn al-Attaar, published 1411H in <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> (on page 31). Again, pay very careful attention to the words used - and then take these choice of words of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and compare them to his commentary on the hadeeth (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1606; &#1587;&#1606; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1587;&#1606;&#1577; &#1581;&#1587;&#1606;&#1577;</span>) quoted earlier - and you will see the true and real intent of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> revealed walhamdulillaah!    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/bidah-izz-musajalah-p48.gif border=1 width="100%" border=0></div>    <P>
Here is the translation of it:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The Shaykh of Islam <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> was asked about the well-known Salat al-Ragha'ib performed on the first Friday night of Rajab, whether it is bid'ah or sunnah?    <P>
<blockquote><b>The Answer:</b> <span style="background-color:#ffffcc;"><b>It is a repugnant, rejected <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>, with the most severe rejection</b></span>, it comprises many evils,  hence it is specifically designated to abandon it and turn away from it and to show rejection againt the one who does it. And it is upon the ruler (one in authority) - may Allaah grant him success - to prevent the people from doing it, for indeed he is a shepherd and every shepherd is responsible for his flock. The scholars have written books in rejection and rebuke of it and declaring those who perform it as fools. One should be not deceived by the abundance of those who perform it in many of the cities, and nor that it is mentioned in [the books] Qut al-Qulub, or Ihya Ulum al-Din and their likes, <span style="background-color:#ffffcc;"><b>for it is a futile innovation</b></span>. And it is authentically related from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that he said, "<i>Whoever introduced into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected</i>." And in the Sahih (of Muslim) that he (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<i>Whoever introduced into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected</i>," and in Sahih Muslim and others that he (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<b>Every <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is misguidance</b>." And Allaah the Exalted has ordered us to return to His Book whenever there is a dispute, so He, the Exalted said, "<b>And if you dispute regarding any matter then return it back to Allaah and His Messenger</b>" (4:59), and He did not ordder the following of the ignoramuses, and nor being decieved by the errors of those who have erred, and Allaah knows best.</blockquote></blockquote> <P>
