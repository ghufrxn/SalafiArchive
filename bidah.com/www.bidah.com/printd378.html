<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bidah-shyster-js.gif border=1 align=right border=0> We've met this individual <a href=http://www.abovethethrone.com/arsh/?xbdmd>before somewhere</a>, and he's running a very slick operation on the tube. We even had to commend him for his slickness, because it is <u>very</u> professional - when you are out to swindle, it simply has to be, there is no other choice. As most people's attention spans have dwindled to literally minutes and seeking <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> for them has become reduced to watching byte-sized vids on the tube (because reading and studying books is so excruciatingly painful and boring), <u>the situation is ripe</u> for individuals such as this one to come along and play the pied-piper. Citing isolated, decontextualized statements of the Scholars or brandishing their phraseology <u>whilst concealing the reality of what these scholars meant by it</u> is the method by which this individual and countless others deceive and misguide the people away from the Prophetic Sunnah and instead to the misguided innovations they have entered into the religion. He is holding up the book of Imaam <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1578;&#1607;&#1584;&#1610;&#1576; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1587;&#1605;&#1575;&#1569; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1594;&#1575;&#1578;</span>) and is impressing upon the byte-sized deen-learner how Imam <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, allegedly, is sanctioning the innovations (in worship) that he and his likes spread amongst the Ummah. The reality is not as simple as he makes it out to be and is in fact otherwise, and we will address this matter, by Allaah's permission in this article.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>To appreciate this article fully, please be sure to read and digest   <a href=indexadb8.html?ezaqa>Part 1</a>, <a href=index7350.html?uvlmw>Part 2</a>, <a href=index4c41.html?rouuz>Part 3</a>, <a href=indexcb64.html?vfhnh>Part 4</a>, <a href=index6c1a.html?edofk>Part 5</a>, and <a href=index5204.html?unpbn>Part 6</a>. Also useful for you to read is the <a href=indexea20.html?muagm>definition of bid'ah</a>, and <a href=indexbf6b.html?rwmef>its basis</a> from the Sunnah and understanding that it is of two types (haqiqiyyah and idafiyyah) from the angle of how it relates to <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> evidences (see <a href=indexab0d.html?hwnvg>this article</a>, and <a href=index5fc3.html?agquf>this one</a>).

<font class='titleHeadline'>Revision of the Basics</font>    <P>
So far we have established that whenever the term "praiseworthy innovation" (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1581;&#1605;&#1608;&#1583;&#1577;</span>) and "<a href="tags/good-innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/good-innovation-qr.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">good <a href="tags/innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">innovation</font></a></font></a></font></a>" (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1587;&#1606;&#1577;</span>) is used in the language of certain scholars, they are using it purely in its linguistic sense (not <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> sense). This we established from <a href='tags/ibn-hajar-oz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-hajar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Hajar</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexadb8.html?ezaqa>see here</a>) and also Ibn Rajab (see quote <a href=indexbf6b.html?rwmef>in this article</a>). Further, we established that by inspecting and examining the actual examples given by those who categorize <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>) into obligatory (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1575;&#1580;&#1576;</span>), recommended (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1606;&#1583;&#1608;&#1576;</span>) and permissible (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1576;&#1575;&#1581;</span>), it is very clear that they are in fact speaking of either <b><u>a)</u></b> something that is not an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> sense at all (e.g. tarawih <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> in congregation in Ramadan in the mosque) or <b><u>b)</u></b> something that comes under the topic of <a href='tags/al-maslahah-al-mursalah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-maslahah al-mursalah</font></a>, a matter of broad <a href='tags/public-interest.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>public interest</font></a> by which specified <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> goals are served and by which the five necessities (religion, life, intellect, wealth and lineage) are preserved (see <a href=index7350.html?uvlmw>this article</a> for understanding and <a href=indexcb64.html?vfhnh>this article</a> for illustrative examples given by <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> to show what he actually intended). This is where schools, hospices, teaching <a href='tags/arabic.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Arabic</font></a> grammar and so on enter into as explained by the Scholars who speak of <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> (bidah) having classifications. If you have got all of that in the bag, then grab your stick, join us, and lets collectively give this doubt (of the Innovators) a pounding and send it back from where it came ...    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Understanding the Deceptive Tactics Of These <a href="tags/innovators.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">innovators</font></a></font>    <P>
In order to understand how these people are operating we need to know that those scholars whose words they are employing (al-Nawawi, <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a>, <a href='tags/ibn-hajar-oz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-hajar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Hajar</font></a></font></a> etc.) have two types of statements:    <P>
<ol><li> <b><u>The first type:</u></b> A mere mention of bidah being either "praiseworthy innovation" (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1581;&#1605;&#1608;&#1583;&#1577;</span>) or "blameworthy innovation" (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1584;&#1605;&#1608;&#1605;&#1577;</span>) or bidah being of categories such as obligatory (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1575;&#1580;&#1576;</span>), recommended (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1606;&#1583;&#1608;&#1576;</span>) and permissible (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1576;&#1575;&#1581;</span>) <b>but without any further elaboration and giving of illustrative examples</b>, because within the context in which they are writing, they are only intending to make a quick hint or reference to the matter.    <P>
<li> <b><u>The second type:</u></b> A mention of those phrases and terms but this time <b>with full elaboration and illustrative examples</b> which reveal their intent and which show exactly what their objective is in using these terms and classifications.   </ol>    <P>
Examples of each of these types will be clear as we progress in this article, but the trick and <a href='tags/deception.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>deception</font></a> of the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> is that they will gather together as many statements as they can from <u>the first type</u>, or <u>selectively quote parts from the second type</u>, and then present them to the people and subsequently make very general statements like, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1605;&#1575; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1603;&#1576;&#1575;&#1585; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605;&#1575;&#1569; &#1608;&#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1605;&#1575; &#1606;&#1581;&#1606; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607;</span>), "<i>This is what the Major Scholars are upon and this is what we are upon</i>." So your byte-sized deen learner only gets a surface-level, shallow understanding and has only learned terms and phrases yet is none the wiser about what these Scholars really intend by the use of these terms and classifications. All he knows is that the scholars used these terms and made these classifications, but any mention of them has been stripped of the explanation, meaning and illustrative exemplification. And even those quotes which may have added elaboration have been decontextualized by removal of the appropriate information which provides all the details as to what is really intended. The swindler is therefore able to lead the intended target audience into thinking that <u>innovating into the matters of worship to bring oneself closer to Allaah</u> is perfectly legitimate and sanctioned by these scholars, and that this is, allegedly, "<i>what the Major scholars are upon</i>." So the fraud is complete, having been executed to perfection with the slick presentation, and the deceiver is free to move on to the next swindle.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Practical Illustration of the Academic Fraud</font>    <P>
The deceptive individual pictured earlier has posted a few videos and in each of them he has cited a quote from <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> from the same place in one of his books (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1578;&#1607;&#1584;&#1610;&#1576; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1587;&#1605;&#1575;&#1569; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1594;&#1575;&#1578;</span>). <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Nawawi</font></a> is discussing the entry (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;</span>) and he does actually elaborate upon it in detail, but this crooked Habashite Sufi pictured above eliminated the part where <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> explains the intent behind the classification (through a full citation from al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam).  Each quote that we bring below is the subject of a separate video created by these people. Their intent is to isolate each of the general statements that offer no detail or explanation as to the intent and purpose behind the classification of these scholars so that the intended audience thinks "how numerous are these statements that legitimize innovation" when they see all these individual videos. So lets now analyze those isolated statements that are used as part of the bait.     <P>
<b><u>1st Statement of Imam <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> from Tahdhib al-Asmaa wal-Lughaat</u></b>    <P>
The first quote from <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> is from his book (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1578;&#1607;&#1584;&#1610;&#1576; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1587;&#1605;&#1575;&#1569; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1594;&#1575;&#1578;</span>), Idarah al-Tibaa'ah al-Muniriyyah, (3/22), and this is presented in its own short video on the tube:    <P>
<blockquote><div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1576;&#1603;&#1587;&#1585; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1575;&#1569; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1585;&#1593; &#1607;&#1610; &#1573;&#1581;&#1583;&#1575;&#1579; &#1605;&#1575; &#1604;&#1605; &#1610;&#1603;&#1606; &#1601;&#1610; &#1593;&#1607;&#1583; &#1585;&#1587;&#1608;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1608;&#1607;&#1610; &#1605;&#1606;&#1602;&#1587;&#1605;&#1577; &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1581;&#1587;&#1606;&#1577; &#1608;&#1602;&#1576;&#1610;&#1581;&#1577;</div></blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Al-Bidah, with a kasrah on the letter baa, in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> it is the introduction (invention) of that which is not found in the era of the Messenger of Allaah, and it is divided into [that which is] <b>good</b> and [that which is] <b>repugnant</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
So this quote is isolated like this and presented and a person thinks, "Hey, yes they are right, there is "<i>good bidah</i>" in the religion," but little does the person know what exactly <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> (and others) intend by this phrase - that part is kept hidden.    <P>

And the second is what has been introduced of goodness and there is not a single scholar who opposes it. This is newly-introduced yet not blameworthy and Umar (radiallaahu anhu) had said about the qiyam (al-layl) in the month of Ramadan, "What an excellent <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> this is," meaning, that it is newly-introduced and was not previously done.</blockquote></blockquote>    <P>
We have already addressed this quote in the article on the statements of <a href='tags/al-shafii.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shafi'i</font></a> (<a href=index4c41.html?rouuz>see here</a>) so please refer to that. However, it is clear that al-Shafi'i's words are in relation to bidah from a purely linguistic meaning and this is very clear from what he says at the very end when he quotes the saying of Umar and then says, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1610;&#1593;&#1606;&#1610; &#1571;&#1606;&#1607;&#1575; &#1605;&#1581;&#1583;&#1579;&#1577; &#1604;&#1605; &#1578;&#1603;&#1606;</span>), "<i>meaning, that it is newly-introduced and was not previously done</i>..." and <a href='tags/al-shafii.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shafi'i</font></a> knows that this was in fact done by the Messenger (alayhis salam) but abandoned because he (alayhis salaam) feared it might become wajib (obligatory) upon his Ummah. So this act of worship has specific proof in the Sunnah, but its re-enactment is referred to by <a href='tags/al-shafii.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shafi'i</font></a> as "bidah" purely from <u>a linguistic meaning</u> and not a <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> meaning, and this act does not have opposition to the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, rather it is in perfect agreement with the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, with the Prophetic Sunnah, in its foundations and details. Hence, it is not an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> in the blameworthy sense.    <P>
All the above three quotes were all from the same section. But what was left out? Well lets go and take a look!    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>What Has Been Deliberately Omitted!</font>    <P>
That's right, <b>the most crucial part of it all</b>, which actually explains the classifications that these Shafi'ite jurists were making use of, even thought it is right there, sandwiched between all those quotes you have read above, it is not presented and mostly kept from view. The reason is plainly obvious, because the game would be over and the fraud would be plain to see. We have already alluded to this elaboration by <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> in the articles dedicate to his statements (see <a href=indexcb64.html?vfhnh>Part 4</a> and opening of <a href=index6c1a.html?edofk>Part 5</a>). Here is the full entry:    <P>

Al-Nawawi is citing from al-Izz, and obviously he agrees with it and his intent is the same as that of al-Izz:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><u>For the obligatory innovations are examples</u>, from them: <b>[First]</b> Being occupied with the <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> of grammar by which the speech of Allaah and the speech of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is understood. This [innovation] is obligatory because the preservation of the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> is obligatory, and its preservation cannot be maintained except by that, and that without which an obligation cannot be fulfilled is itself obligatory. <b>Second</b>, preservation of the [meanings of] obscure words in the language occurring in the Book and the Sunnah. <b>Third</b>, laying down the foundations of the religion and of jurisprudence. <b>Fourth</b>, speech about al-jarh wal-ta'deel (criticism and appraisal) [of narrators], and distinguishing between the authentic from the weak. The principles of the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> have themselves indicated that preserving the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> is fard kifaayah (collective obligation) regarding that which goes beyond the capacity of an individual, and  that cannot be fulfilled except by what we have  mentioned.    <P>
<u>And for the unlawful innovations are examples</u>, from them: The [belief] doctrines of al-qadar, and al-jabar, and (those of) the <a href='tags/murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Murji'ah</font></a> and Mujassimah. Refuting these (people) is from the obligatory innovations.    <P>
<u>For the recommended innovations are examples</u>, from them: Setting up hospices and schools and every benevolent endeavour not present in the first era, and (also) from (the examples) is at-Tarawih, and speech regarding the details of tasawwuf, and [also] argumentation, from which is the setting up of gatherings for deduction of evidence (in <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> based matters) [only] if Allaah, the Exalted's face is sought by that.    <P>
<u>And for the disliked innovations are examples</u>, from them: Adornment of the mosques, and decoration of the mushafs [of the Qur'an].    <P>
<u>And for the permitted innovations are examples</u>, from them: <a href='tags/shaking-hands.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shaking hands</font></a> after the morning and late afternoon prayers, and from them is taking liberties in that which is great pleasure in terms of <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a>, drink, clothing and residence and wearing shawls and widening of the sleeves. There could be some differing regarding some of these matters and some of the Scholars may place them amongst the disliked innovations, and others may place them amongst the sunnahs that were actually performed in the time of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and also after his time, and this is like pronouncing the isti'aadhah and basmalah in the <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>.    <P>
[Al-Nawawi:] This is the end of his [al-Izz's] speech.</blockquote>    <P>
If you have been reading the previous parts in the series, the matter should be very clear to you. Neither al-Izz, nor <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> permitted innovations in matters of worship (in order to get closer to Allaah as is alleged) and as you can see there is nothing in what has preceded which indicates that they are laying down these classifications to enable the justification of innovating into matters of worship under the slogan of "<a href="tags/bidah-hasanah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">bidah hasanah</font></a>". Rather, it is clear that they are operating upon the premise that "bidah" when it is used in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> is to be treated as a purely linguistic idea which needs further clarification and qualification. And that is the purpose behind them speaking of "praiseworthy innovation" or "<a href="tags/good-innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/good-innovation-qr.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">good <a href="tags/innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">innovation</font></a></font></a></font></a>" and into which they are including either matters of broad <a href='tags/public-interest.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>public interest</font></a> (maslahah mursalah) (as you can see in the examples given under the "obligatory innovations") or they are matters having specific proof in the Sunnah (like the tarawih <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> in congregation in the mosque), and in which case it is not really an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> at all (in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> sense).  It is useful to recall the simple diagram we used in earlier parts:    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/bidah-terminology.png width="100%" border=0></div>    <P>
And you are very strongly recommended to refer to the <b><a href=index64ad.html?waumz>more detailed diagram</a> (click on the image below)</b> we have in <a href=index64ad.html?waumz>Part 7</a>, which breaks the whole issue down more clearly and vividly, and leaves no ambiguity as to what these Shafi'ite jurists meant at all.    <P>

Now let us have a look at <u>the full passage</u>, we are using a 1929CE Egyptian print (al-Azhar) and it occurs in (6/154-155) in Kitab al-Jumu'ah in the chapter titled (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1575;&#1576; &#1582;&#1591;&#1576;&#1578;&#1607; &#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1578;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1609; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1605;&#1593;&#1577; </span>):    <P>

Note the parts indicated (between square red brackets) were completely omitted. Let us provide the full translation - the omitted part is in the second paragraph below:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>His (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam's) saying (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1590;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604;&#1577;</span>), "<i>Every <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is misguidance</i>." This is a generalisation which has been qualified (by other texts), and the intent behind it is the majority of innovations (not all of them). The scholars of the language have said that [bidah] is: "Every thing that is performed without any prior example (precedent)." The Scholars have said bidah is five types, obligatory, recommended, unlawful, disliked and permitted.    <P>
<b>So from the <u>obligatory</u> [innovations] is organization and composition of the evidences of the Mutakallimin for refuting the atheists and <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> and whatever resembles that. And from the <u>recommended</u> is authoring of the books of <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> and building schools and hospices and other than that. And from the <u>permitted</u> is (taking pleasure through) indulging in the variety of foods and other than that. And as for the unlawful and disliked (types), then they are very clear. And I made this matter clear alongside its evidences in <i>Tahdhib al-Asmaa wal-Lughaat</i> and by knowing what I have mentioned, it becomes known that the hadeeth is [considered] to be a generalization that is qualified, and likewise (is the case with) whatever resembles it form the reported ahaadeeth.</b>    <P>
And supporting what we have said is the saying of Umar Ibn al-Khattab (radiallaahu anhu) regarding Tarawih, "What an excellent <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> this is." And that the generalization in his saying "Every innovation" is supported by the word "Every (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604;</span>)" does not prevent from that it is subject to being qualified such as what occurs in His saying (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1578;&#1615;&#1583;&#1614;&#1605;&#1617;&#1616;&#1585;&#1615; &#1603;&#1615;&#1604;&#1617;&#1614; &#1588;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1569;&#1613;</span>) "<b>Destroying every single thing</b> (46:25)" [Meaning, even though "every (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1615;&#1604;&#1617;&#1614;</span>)" was used, not everything was actually destroyed, hence it is a generalization that is qualified with exceptions].</blockquote>    <P>
Note the middle paragraph in bold was conveniently ommitted just in case the audience clicks on and understands what is going on and that <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> (and al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam) certainly do not intend what todays low-life <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a>, with all their dishonesty and academic treachery, intend. As for the issue of (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604;</span>), meaning "all, every" being a qualified generalization, this is discussed further below and al-hamdulillaah, this only supports us against the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a>, it is not a proof for them, it is a proof against them, it is from our goods, not theirs, they have merely stolen it and are pretending it belongs to them.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>If we analyze the examples given again, we see that the <u>obligatory </u>innovation appears to be ways and means that come under the principle "<i>that by which an obligation cannot be fulfilled is itself obligatory</i>" and the <u>recommended</u> <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> appears to be ways and means that facilitate already defined <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> goals (teaching, looking after the ill). So we are really speaking here, in the obligatory and recommended innovations, the ways and means (wasaa'il) that support <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> goals.

New varieties or forms of these are "innovations" which are permitted (these are your <u>pizzas</u> and <u>burgers</u> and your <u>hoodies</u> and <u>sneakers</u> and your <u>carbonated juices</u> and your <u>marble buildings</u> and so on). Nothing about innovations in worship (ta'abbud) being hasanah here!</div>    <P>
<b><u>2nd Statement of Imam <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> from Sharh Sahih Muslim</u></b>    <P>
This statement is generally kept hidden and is not readily presented because it reveals the actual intent of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> (and the Shafi'ite jurists in general). <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Nawawi</font></a> is commenting upon the hadeeth (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1606; &#1587;&#1606; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1587;&#1606;&#1577; &#1581;&#1587;&#1606;&#1577;</span>), "<i>Whoever enacts a good Sunnah in Islaam</i> ..." which is what today's <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> use to justify their particular interpretation of "good bidah" (which is not the same as al-Nawawi's), for they intend innovating into the matters of worship (ibaadah), whereas <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> is staunchly against that, as we shall see further below. Here is the quote, and <b>it is absolutely crucial for you to pay attention to the part highlighted in yellow</b> and <b>the one underlined in red</b>, because essentially they comprise <u>a baseball bat</u> and <u>a crowbar</u> by which we are going to metaphorically <b>ground and pound</b> the <a href='tags/deception.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>deception</font></a>, so here is the saying of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> (in our version, 7/104, in Kitab al-Zakah):    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/nawawi-sahih-muslim-7-104.gif width="100%" border=0></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>His (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam's) saying, "<i>Whoever enacted a good sunnah in Islam will have its reward </i>..." to the end of [the hadeeth]. This contains encouragement to initiate good deeds and to  enact the good sunnahs <span style="background-color:#ffffcc;">and a warning from inventing falsehoods and repugnant things (mustaqbahaat)</span>. And the reason behind this statement in this hadeeth is that he (the narrator) said at the beginning of it, "<i>Then a person came there with a money bag which his hands could scarcely lift; in fact, they could not (lift). Then the people followed continuously (in giving)</i>..." So the great virtue was for the one who began this goodness and the one who opened the door to this benevolence.     <P>
And within this hadeeth is the qualification of his (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam's) saying, "<i>Every newly-introduced matter is an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>, and every <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is misguidance</i>" and that <font color='red'><u>the intent behind it is the newly introduced matters and blameworthy innovations</u></font>. And the explanation of this has already preceded in Kitab al-Salat al-Jumu'ah and we mentioned there that innovations are of five types: obligatory, recommended, unlawful, disliked and permitted. </blockquote>    <P>
To be frank, a separate lengthy article is required to fully appreciate this passage from <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and how it fits in with and explains the earlier passage we quoted above (from Sharh Sahih Muslim of al-Nawawi), but for now we will suffice by raising the two important issues that arise from both statements (quoted from Sharh Sahih Muslim):    <P>
<blockquote><b>The First: Concerning The Qualification of the Phrase (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1590;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604;&#1577;</span>) That It is Not Absolute and Unrestricted But Is Qualified</b>. This is one of the favourite doubts of the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> from the speech of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and what they don't realize is that this is actually a proof in our favour. It supports us, and <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> is with us in the reality of the affair. And the truth is that <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> is essentially correct because he is (as are the other Shafi'ite jurists) looking at this word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>) and seeing it <b>upon its linguistic meaning only</b>, which incorporates all newly-invented things, blameworthy or praiseworthy, religious or otherwise. Hence, when the Messenger (alayhis salaam) says (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>), "Every <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>...", this clearly is a generalization needing qualification upon al-Nawawi's view. And we don't disagree with that, in fact it is absolutely correct to state that it needs qualification and restriction. And this is the purpose of the classification found with the Shafi'ite jurists. Conversely, the majority of the Scholars of the Sunnah, when they look at this wording (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1590;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604;&#1577;</span>), they are upon the understanding that the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>) <b>has already been qualified</b> in the hadeeth of Aa'ishah (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1614;&#1606;&#1618; &#1571;&#1614;&#1581;&#1618;&#1583;&#1614;&#1579;&#1614; &#1601;&#1616;&#1610; &#1571;&#1614;&#1605;&#1618;&#1585;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1607;&#1614;&#1584;&#1614;&#1575; &#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1604;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1587;&#1614; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1618;&#1607;&#1615; &#1601;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615;&#1608;&#1614; &#1585;&#1614;&#1583;&#1612;</span>), which restricts and qualifies innovations in religion only, since the Messenger said, <i>introduces into this affair of ours</i>", and hence when the Messenger (alayhis salaam) says (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>), this saying is absolute, unqualified and unrestricted and applies to every <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> in the religion.  So the issue here is that <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> is absolutely correct that the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604;</span>) is indeed a generalization that is qualified - from his particular perspective of things (which is to see the word "bidah" purely with its linguistic meaning). The difference is that most of Ahl al-Sunnah believe that that word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>) is already qualified by what is in the hadeeth of Aa'ishah (radiallaahu anhaa), whereas <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and the Shafi'ite jurists have brought a classification to enable the qualification of what they see to be a word only having its broad unqualified linguistic meaning which is "<i>anything without any prior example whether praiseworthy or blameworthy</i>" Now because this definition would include (in the modern era) your pizzas, burgers, hoodies, sneakers, brick and marble houses, the internet, mobile devices, types of technology and so on, these Shafi'ite jurists simply made classifications to allow these types of things to be excluded from what is otherwise the blameworthy bidah (<a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>). Hence, they said there is an <u>obligatory innovation</u> (so we would say putting the refutations of atheists and defences of the Qura'n and the Sunnah in digital format for devices and for the internet is an obligation) and a <u>recommended innovation</u> (setting up online schools for teaching of <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and tajweed is a recommended innovation), and a <u>permitted innovation</u> (enjoy that pizza, wear that hoodie and don those cool sneakers). In other words, <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a>, drink, clothing and residence not present in that way before. So it becomes clear after all this that in reality there is no difference between these two groups of Scholars, they all have the same understanding, but are just simply using two different languages to express it. Having said this, we do consider the classification of bidah into wajib, mandub and mustahab to be an error and the truth is with the Salaf and the likes of <a href='tags/al-shatibi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shatibi</font></a> who <a href=indexcb64.html?vfhnh>clarified this matter</a>.    <P>
<b>The Second: Understanding What "Good Sunnah" is And That It is Not the "<a href="tags/bidah-hasanah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">bidah hasanah</font></a>" Presumed by the Innovators</b>. The second key thing that <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> reveals to us about what his real position is known by looking at the hadeeth under discussion more fully:    <P>
<blockquote>Al-Mundhir bin Jarir reported on the authority of his father: While we were in the company of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam) in the early hours of the morning, some people came there (who) were barefooted, naked, wearing striped woollen clothes, or cloaks, with their swords hung (around their necks). Most of them, in fact, all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The colour of the face of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam) underwent a change when he saw them in poverty. He then entered (his house) and came out and commanded Bilal (to pronounce adhaan). He pronounced adhaan and iqaamah, and he (the Prophet) observed <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> (along with his Companions) and then addressed (them reciting verses of the Holy Qur'an): "<b>O mankind, <a href='tags/fear.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fear</font></a> your Lord, Who created you from a single being</b>" to the end of the verse, "<b>Allaah is ever a Watcher over you</b>" (4:1). (He then recited) a verse of Sura Hashr, "<b>Fear Allaah and let every soul consider that which it sends forth for the morrow and <a href='tags/fear.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fear</font></a> Allaah</b>" (59:18). (Then the audience began to vie with one another in giving <a href='tags/charity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>charity</font></a>.) Some donated a dinar, others a dirham, still others clothes, some donated a measure of wheat, some a measure of dates; till he (the Prophet) said: (Bring) even if it is half a date. Then a person from among the Ansar came there with a money bag which his hands could scarcely lift; in fact, they could not (lift). Then the people followed continuously (following the example of this man), till I saw two heaps of eatables and clothes, and I saw the face of the Messenger (sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam) glistening, like gold (on account of joy). The Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: He who sets a good precedent in Islam, there is a reward for him for this (act of goodness) and reward of that also who acted according to it subsequently, without any deduction from their rewards; and he who sets in Islam an evil precedent, there is upon him the burden of that, and the burden of him also who acted upon it subsequently, without any deduction from their burden. </blockquote>    <P>
Note how <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> used the action of that one man (the one who came with a bag full of money) as an example of an "<a href="tags/innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">innovation</font></a>" which - in his view - qualifies the other statement of the Messenger (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1590;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604;&#1577;</span>). This man from the Ansar was the first to bring a whole bag of money and there was no prior example for this (amongst the people and those giving), so linguistically, he did make a "good <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>." However, his practice is not really an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>, as it is simply an enactment of an already existing Sunnah which is giving <a href='tags/charity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>charity</font></a>, however he gave in a way that others had not. He never introduced or innovated anything into the deen of Islam that which was not already from it. But the fact that <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> used this example to illustrate how the other saying of the Messenger (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1590;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604;&#1577;</span>) is qualified, only strengthens whatever we have said above, and it shows that these Scholars (Shafi'ite jurists) simply included either the re-enacted Sunnah, or the revived Sunnah or the commanded Sunnah (<a href=index64ad.html?waumz>which we have illustrated in our detailed diagram</a>) into their terminology of "praiseworthy innovation" - and intending that from a purely linguistic sense, because they are wrongly presuming that the use of the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>) was intended by the Messenger with its linguistic meaning only, and this is not correct, since <a href=indexbf6b.html?rwmef>the hadeeth of Aa'ishah</a> (radiallaahu anhaa) is the foundation and basis of the meaning of (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>), <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>, in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>.  </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Unfinished Business</font>    <P>
As of now <b>we have some unfinished business</b> and if you recall from a little earlier, we said that in this last quote of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> (in Kitab al-Zakat) there was <u>a baseball bat</u> and <u>a crowbar</u> in the form of two sentences included within that passage (highlighted in yellow and underlined in red). The time has come now to metaphorically make use of these tools that Allaah the Exalted decreed - fifty-thousand years before He created the creation - would in fact be delivered to us (Ahl al-Sunnah, the followers of the Salaf) buried in al-Nawawi's words, to be let loose upon the flimsy doubts of the Ahl al-Bid'ah.    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/nawawi-bat-crowbar.gif width="100%" border=0></div>    <P>
You should be perceptive enough to understand the significance of our <u>crowbar</u> and <u>baseball bat</u> and you should pay careful attention to their wording (highlighted in yellow above)... recall from <a href=index5204.html?unpbn>Part 6</a>, where we looked <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> demolishing the bidah known as Salat al-Ragha'ib (an innovated prayer), and established that al-Izz does not intend by his classification of bidah into wajib, mandub and mubah what todays <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> have twisted it for. Well Imam <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> actually has two fatwas on the topic, and they are both found and documented in the book that we were quoting from in <a href=index5204.html?unpbn>Part 6</a>. These two fatwas are in reality what have turned those two statements above (highlighted in yellow) into the crowbar and baseball bat, and all praise is due to Allaah for this fortification and strengthening. <img src=assets/images/acid-test-kit.jpg width="100%" align=right border=0>You should also remember what we pointed out in <a href=index5204.html?unpbn>Part 6</a> about <b>the Acid Test</b>, which is that the only true and real way to test, verify and corroborate what these Shafi'ite jurists intend and mean by their classifications and terms is to take an example of what they consider to be a heretical <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>, look at it, examine it and then extract from that, exactly what their understanding is. Hence, we have <u>a crowbar</u>, <u>a baseball bat</u> and <u>an acid test kit</u> ready and waiting. So let us jump straight in, here is the first fatwa:    <P>
<b><u>1st Fatwa of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> Refuting Two Bidahs in Worship (Salat al-Ragha'ib and Salat Nisf Sha'baan)</u></b>    <P>

Here is a translation of the question and answer:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>What is said by the leading scholars, the imaams of the religion (radiallaahu anhum)  regarding Salat al-Ragha'ib and the Salat Nisf al-Sha'ban which are commonly practised by the people now. Did the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) pray them or anyone from the Companions (radiallaahu anhum ajma'een), or did any of the well-known for Imaams pray them, I mean, the Imaam Abu Hanifah, Imaam <a href='tags/al-shafii.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shafi'i</font></a>, and Malik and Ahmad bin Hanbal, or did they make any indication towards praying either of these (prayers). And is anything related about them from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)? And are they in agreement with the intent (muraad) of the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> or not? And is it better to perform them or abandon them. And is kindling fire on these two nights above and beyond what is customary unlawful or disliked or permitted? Please answer us, rewarded in your endeavour.    <P>
So he (<a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>) wrote in the answer:    <P>
<blockquote>All praise is due to Allaah.  These two prayers were not prayed by the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and nor anyone from the Companions (radiallaahu anhum), and nor any of the aforementioned four Imaams (rahimahullaah), and nor did any of them hint at it, and no one who is worthy of being followed has practiced it, and nothing is authentically related from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) at all, and nor from anyone who is worthy of being followed. Rather, it was introduced in the later times, <span style="background-color:#ffffcc;"><b>and praying them both is from the rejection innovations, and the futile newly-invented matters</b></span>. And it is authentically related from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that he said: "<b>Beware of the newly-invented matters, <u>for every <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is misguidance</u></b>", and in the two Sahihs from Aa'isah (radiallaahu anhaa) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<i>Whoever introduced into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected</i>", and in Sahih Muslim that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<i>Whoever does an action which is not upon our affair will have it rejected</i>."    <P>
<b>And it is desirable for everyone to prohibit this <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>, warn from and and make [the people] flee from it, to render its performance as repugnant, reprehensible, and to spread its prohibition everywhere (amongst the people)</b>. For it is authentically related from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that he said, "Whoever amongst you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand, and if he is not able, then with his tongue, and if he is not able then with his heart."    <P>
And it is upon the Scholars to warn from it, and to turn away from it <u>more so than it is upon others</u> because they are taken as a model to be followed. And no one should be deceived by the fact that it is common, being practised by the common-folk, and nor by their doubts, for indeed, following (in guidance) is only done  through the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), not through what he himself has prohibited and  warned against.    <P>
As for lighting fire and burning a lot of oil over it in the way that is done, then it is from the evils and repugnant prohibitions. And it is authentically related that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) prohibited from wastage of wealth, and its meaning is to spend it upon other than the angle from which it is permitted to spend, and this action is from that, [Allaah said], "<b>Let those beware who oppose his (the Messenger's) command that a tribulation should afflict them or a painful torment should afflict them</b>" (24:63). May Allaah protect us from the innovated matters and protect us from falling into the oppositions, and Allaah knows best.</blockquote>  </blockquote>    <P>

Again, pay very careful attention to the words used - and then take these choice of words of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and compare them to his commentary on the hadeeth (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1606; &#1587;&#1606; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1587;&#1606;&#1577; &#1581;&#1587;&#1606;&#1577;</span>) quoted earlier - and you will see the true and real intent of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> revealed walhamdulillaah!    <P>

Here is the translation of it:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The Shaykh of Islam <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> was asked about the well-known Salat al-Ragha'ib performed on the first Friday night of Rajab, whether it is bid'ah or sunnah?    <P>
<blockquote><b>The Answer:</b> <span style="background-color:#ffffcc;"><b>It is a repugnant, rejected <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>, with the most severe rejection</b></span>, it comprises many evils,  hence it is specifically designated to abandon it and turn away from it and to show rejection againt the one who does it. And it is upon the ruler (one in authority) - may Allaah grant him success - to prevent the people from doing it, for indeed he is a shepherd and every shepherd is responsible for his flock. The scholars have written books in rejection and rebuke of it and declaring those who perform it as fools. One should be not deceived by the abundance of those who perform it in many of the cities, and nor that it is mentioned in [the books] Qut al-Qulub, or Ihya Ulum al-Din and their likes, <span style="background-color:#ffffcc;"><b>for it is a futile innovation</b></span>. And it is authentically related from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that he said, "<i>Whoever introduced into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected</i>." And in the Sahih (of Muslim) that he (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<i>Whoever introduced into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected</i>," and in Sahih Muslim and others that he (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<b>Every <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is misguidance</b>." And Allaah the Exalted has ordered us to return to His Book whenever there is a dispute, so He, the Exalted said, "<b>And if you dispute regarding any matter then return it back to Allaah and His Messenger</b>" (4:59), and He did not ordder the following of the ignoramuses, and nor being decieved by the errors of those who have erred, and Allaah knows best.</blockquote></blockquote>    <P>
Allahu Akbar! And another <a href='tags/prostration.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prostration</font></a> of gratefulness.     <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Issue: What is done by some of those who (lead) the people (in prayer) in  Salat al-Tarawih, which is the recitation of Surah al-An'aam (a lengthy Surah in earlier part of the Qur'an) in the last rakah of al-Tarawih on the seventh night in the month of Ramadan, or on other than the seventh month, is it sunnah or bidah? For someone could say that [the surah] was revealed in a single night (and thus praying with it in a single go is acceptable), so is it established in the Sahih or not? And there is any evidence therein for what they do, and if it is a bidah, what is the reason for its abhorrence?    <P>
Answer: This aforementioned action is not a sunnah, <b>rather it is a detested bidah (<a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>)</b>, and its abhorrence has numerous reasons. From them: giving the impression that it is a sunnah, and form them: lengthening the second rakah over the first. The sunnah is to make it lighter (shorter), and from them: the babbling in the recitation (which is done hastily), and from them: the exaggeration in shortening the rakahs which come before it and other such reasons. It is not established that [surah] al-An'am was revealed in a single go and there is no evidence for that, and even if it was established it would not have constituted evidence for this practice. Hence, it is desirable for every one who prays (leading the people) to shun this practice, and it is desirable to spread rejection of it, <b>for authentic hadeeths are established regarding the rejection of newly-invented matters, and that <u>every <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is misguidance</u>, and this practice has not been narrated from any one of the Salaf, and far from it that it should</b>, and Allaah knows best.</blockquote>    <P>
Allahu Akbar! And another <a href='tags/prostration.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prostration</font></a> of gratefulness. The <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> have just received a mighty pounding in our cage. There is absolutely no doubt that when <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> says that the statement (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1590;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604;&#1577;</span>) is a generalization that has to be restricted and qualified, he means that it is qualified to remove what would otherwise enter into the purely linguistic meaning of (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>), such that whatever remains would only apply to blameworthy innovations (in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> sense) and all other matters (like building schools, and laying down foundations of Islamic sciences, revival of what is Sunnah to begin with, and new types of foods, drink, clothing and homes) are excluded from this generalization. He is absolutely right, upon his perception of the  matter, and there is nothing in this at all for the Innovators!     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Also pay special attention to the fact that <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> included amongst the reasons that make an act to be a detestable <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>, <b>the creating of the presumption amongst the people that it is a Sunnah when it is not</b> - and how many an act is there which these <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> have misguided the people into thinking it is the Sunnah and abandoning it is a bidah?!</div>    <P>
And as they try to flee on their heels with their dodgy merchandise we can turn swiftly to the result of our acid test.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Results of the Acid Test</font>    <P>
As we have repeatedly stated in this series, the classifications of bidah used by certain scholars and the use of the phrases such as "praiseworthy innovation" and "<a href="tags/bidah-hasanah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">bidah hasanah</font></a>" were never ever intended by these scholars to justify innovations in worship. Rather, they used these terms because they thought that when the Messenger (alayhis salaam) said (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1590;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604;&#1577;</span>), he was using the word bidah from a purely linguistic meaning. Upon this understanding it is perfectly legitimate and appropriate to say that this statement must be qualified to exclude what is not otherwise blameworthy in the religion, which would include the following:     <P>
<ul><li><u>Matters of broad public interest</u> (maslahah mursalah) which may either be <u>obligatory</u> or <u>recommended</u>, hence, the examples given by <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> and followed by <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, such as being concerned with <a href='tags/arabic.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Arabic</font></a> grammar (obligatory) and building schools (recommended).    <P>
<li> <u>Matters which are merely permitted</u>, which include enjoyment of new forms and types of <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a>, drink, clothing, residence.    <P>
<li> <u>Matters of goodness which in and of themselves are established in the Shariah</u> (giving <a href='tags/charity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>charity</font></a> for example), but which a person enacts from his own initiative (in a way no one did before him) and is subsequently followed by others. An example of this could be when a person takes half his savings and travels to poverty-stricken area and feeds the people and builds wells for them. So he is then followed by a dozen others. So no new act has been innovated here into Islam, but a person has simply performed an act which no one preceded him in, and it became an example for others besides him. So he instituted a "<i><a href='tags/sunnah-hasanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sunnah hasanah</font></a></i>" to use the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> term, or if you want to use the language of others, "<a href="tags/bidah-hasanah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">bidah hasanah</font></a>", in other words, an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> purely with its <u>linguistic</u> (not Shariah) meaning, and this is true because prior to this man, no one else took half of his own wealth and travelled to the poverty stricken place and fed the people and built wells for them.</ul>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Once this is clear, the acid test is to see these same scholars pointing out - what is to them - an instance of a heretical <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> and this allows us, without any ambiguity,  to identify exactly what they mean and what they do not mean by their terms and classifications in this regard. And we have - in everything we have quoted - the implementation of such an acid test.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary and Conclusion</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bidah-keller-haddad-habashi.gif align=right width="100%" border=0>So <u>the results of the acid test are clear</u>, neither <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> nor al-Izz bin Abd  al-Salam laid down these terms or classifications to enable the justification of innovations in the religion. The reason why they used these classifications and terms is very apparent and has been very sufficiently explained.     <P>
The bottom line is that these scholars never set out to sanction <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> in worship and all of their speech about bidah is from the angles we have explained in this article, not from the angle of permitting departure from the Sunnah and turning to innovations, even if these innovations have a basis and support from the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> from some angles (like Salat al-Ragha'ib for example). We see clearly the vehemence with which <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> spoke against two innovations, Salat al-Ragha'ib and Salat Nisf Sha'ban, and it proves that these Shafi'ite jurists opposed the <a href='tags/bidah-haqiqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah haqiqiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/bidah-idafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah idafiyyah</font></a> (<a href=indexab0d.html?hwnvg>see this article</a>) and despised innovations in worship. And if it is counter-argued that these Scholars had things which you might oppose and count as opposition to the Sunnah, then that has its own explanation in that a scholar  may fall into opposition <u>for a variety of different reasons</u>, from them, thinking a hadeeth to be authentic when it is not, or interpreting Prophetic text(s) in a way that is incorrect, or simply being mistaken. In any case, that which constitutes proof is what is found in the Book and the Sunnah and the Ijmaa' of the Companions so whoever tried to contradict these three matters with the opinions of later scholars is in clear manifest error.     <P>
Henceforth, no one (including your Kellers, GF Haddads and slippery Habashites [all pictured]) can claim to be confused or try to use the statements of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> after this to justify the abandonment of the Sunnah and introduction of innovations in worship and gaining nearness to Allaah (as already clarified) except that he is a stubborn, misguided, deliberate opposer of Allaah's Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), in fact a disputant and  opponent to the Messenger (alayhis salaam) who stated:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>By Him in whose hand is my soul, I have not left anything which brings you closer to Paradise and distances you from the Fire except that I have commanded you with it and have I left anything which  brings you closer to the Fire and distances you from Paradise except that I have prohibited you from it. <font style='font-size:11px;'>Related by Ahmad and Ibn Khuzaymah.</font></blockquote>    <P>
So we ask Allaah to either guide this person or break his back and relieve the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> of his harm, and what a great ocean lies between <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> (rahimahullaah) and those people who are out to rob the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> of their deen with such <a href='tags/deception.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>deception</font></a> and lies and distorting the true and real intent of the Muslim Scholars.     <P>
