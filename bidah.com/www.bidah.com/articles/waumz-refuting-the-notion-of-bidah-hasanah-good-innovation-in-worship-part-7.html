<div class='sidebar'>We are now six parts into the series, and its time now to bring out - yes you've guessed it - <b>the dreaded diagram</b>! As you peek from behind the pillow, take note that the diagram below should be studied as part of all the previous articles <a href=../series/the-notion-of-bidah-hasanah-in-worship-destroyed.html>in this series</a>. It helps to distinguish between those affairs which todays <a href='../tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> (mostly Sufi grave and saint-worshippers pretending to be Ahl al-Sunnah) deliberately try to confuse and obfuscate. And they are, a) that which is established Sunnah, b) that which was a re-enacted Sunnah, c) that which is a revived Sunnah, d) that which is a maslahah mursalah, d) that which is merely mubah (permitted), e) that which is a rejected bidah. This diagram will also reveal the true and real intent of those Shafi'i scholars who used terms such as praiseworthy <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1581;&#1605;&#1608;&#1583;&#1577;</span>) and <a href='../tags/good-innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="../tags/good-innovation-qr.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">good <a href="../tags/innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">innovation</font></a></font></a></font></a> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1587;&#1606;&#1577;</span>) or who classified it into obligatory (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1575;&#1580;&#1576;</span>), recommended (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1606;&#1583;&#1608;&#1576;</span>) and permissible (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1576;&#1575;&#1581;</span>). Feedback and suggestions on the diagram are welcome, we've tried to make it as comprehensive as possible. Please read   <a href=../indexadb8.html?ezaqa>Part 1</a>, <a href=../index7350.html?uvlmw>Part 2</a>, <a href=../index4c41.html?rouuz>Part 3</a>, <a href=../indexcb64.html?vfhnh>Part 4</a>, <a href=../index6c1a.html?edofk>Part 5</a>, and <a href=../index5204.html?unpbn>Part 6</a>. Also useful for you to read first is the <a href=../indexea20.html?muagm>definition of bid'ah</a> and understanding that it is of two types (haqiqiyyah and idafiyyah) from the angle of how it relates to <a href='../tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="../tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> evidences (see <a href=../indexab0d.html?hwnvg>this article</a>, and <a href=../index5fc3.html?agquf>this one</a>). </div>    <P>

Imam <a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> has a nice passage in (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1578;&#1607;&#1584;&#1610;&#1576; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1587;&#1605;&#1575;&#1569; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1594;&#1575;&#1578;</span>) wherein he cites <a href='../tags/al-shafii.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shafi'i</font></a> and <a href='../tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a>, and we can quote that here. You can refer to the full documentation of that quote in <a href=../indexd378.html?chbjn>Part 8</a>:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>Al-Bidah, with a kasrah on the letter baa, in the <a href='../tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="../tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> it is the introduction (invention) of that which is not found in the era of the Messenger of Allaah, and it is divided into [that which is] <b>good</b> and [that which is] <b>repugnant</b>.    <P>
The Shaykh, the Imaam whose leadership, lofty stature, and proficiency and skill in a variety of sciences  is agreed upon, Abu Muhammad Abd al-Aziz bin Abd al-Asalam (rahimahullaah wa radiya anhu) said, at the end of his book, al-Qawa'id:    <P>
<blockquote>Innovation is divided into obligatory (waajibah), unlawful (muharramah), recommended (makruhah), disliked (makruhah) and permitted (mubaahah), and the way to knowing that is to view the <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> in light of the <a href='../tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="../tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> principles, and so if it enters into the principles of obligation, then it is obligatory, or [if it enters into] the principles of unlawfulness, then it is unlawful, or if recommended, then recommended, or if [its falls into] the disliked, then disliked, or the permitted, then permitted. </blockquote>    <P>
<u>For the obligatory innovations are examples</u>, from them: Being occupied with the <a href='../tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> of grammar by which the speech of Allaah and the speech of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is understood. This [innovation] is obligatory because the preservation of the <a href='../tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="../tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> is obligatory, and its preservation cannot be maintained except by that, and that without which an obligation cannot be fulfilled is itself obligatory. Second, preservation of the [meanings of] obscure words in the language occurring in the Book and the Sunnah. Third, laying down the foundations of the religion and of jurisprudence. Fourth, speech about al-jarh wal-ta'deel (criticism and appraisal) [of narrators], and distinguishing between the authentic from the weak. The principles of the <a href='../tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="../tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> have themselves indicated that preserving the <a href='../tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="../tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> is fard kifaayah (collective obligation) regarding that which goes beyond the capacity of an individual, and  that cannot be fulfilled except by what we have  mentioned.    <P>
<u>And for the unlawful innovations are examples</u>, from them: The [belief] doctrines of al-qadar, and al-jabar, and (those of) the <a href='../tags/murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Murji'ah</font></a> and Mujassimah. Refuting these (people) is from the obligatory innovations.    <P>
<u>For the recommended innovations are examples</u>, from them: Setting up hospices and schools and every benevolent endeavour not present in the first era, and (also) from (the examples) is at-Tarawih, and speech regarding the details of tasawwuf, and [also] argumentation, from which is the setting up of gatherings for deduction of evidence (in <a href='../tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> based matters) [only] if Allaah, the Exalted's face is sought by that.    <P>
<u>And for the disliked innovations are examples</u>, from them: Adornment of the mosques, and decoration of the mushafs [of the Qur'an].    <P>
<u>And for the permitted innovations are examples</u>, from them: <a href='../tags/shaking-hands.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shaking hands</font></a> after the morning and late afternoon prayers, and from them is taking liberties in that which is great pleasure in terms of <a href='../tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a>, drink, clothing and residence and wearing shawls and widening of the sleeves. There could be some differing regarding some of these matters and some of the Scholars may place them amongst the disliked innovations, and others may place them amongst the sunnahs that were actually performed in the time of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and also after his time, and this is like pronouncing the isti'aadhah and basmalah in the <a href='../tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>.    <P>
[Al-Nawawi:] This is the end of his [al-Izz's] speech.    <P>
Al-Bayhaqi reports with his chain in Manaqib <a href='../tags/al-shafii.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shafi'i</font></a> from <a href='../tags/al-shafii.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shafi'i</font></a> (radiallaahu anhu) that he said:<blockquote>Newly-invented matters are of two types: The first of them is what opposes [something from] the Book, or [something from] the Sunnah, or a narration [from the Companions], or [a matter of] consensus, this is the misguided <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>. And the second is what has been introduced of goodness and there is not a single scholar who opposes it. This is newly-introduced yet not blameworthy and Umar (radiallaahu anhu) had said about the qiyam (al-layl) in the month of Ramadan, "What an excellent <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> this is," meaning, that it is newly-introduced and was not previously done.</blockquote>    <P>
[Al-Nawawi:] This is the end of his al-Shafi'is speech (radiallaahu anhu).</blockquote>    <P>
And <a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> also said in <i>Kitab Salat al-Jumu'ah</i> in his Sharh Sahih Muslim (documented in <a href=../indexd378.html?chbjn>Part 8</a>):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>His (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam's) saying (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1590;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604;&#1577;</span>), "<i>Every <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is misguidance</i>." This is a generalisation which has been specified, and the intent behind it is the majority of innovations. The scholars of the language have said that [bidah] is: "Every thing that is performed without any prior example (precedent)." The Scholars have said bidah is five types, obligatory, recommended, unlawful, disliked and permitted.    <P>
So from the <u>obligatory</u> [innovations] is organization and composition of the evidences of the Mutakallimin for refuting the atheists and <a href='../tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> and whatever resembles that. And from the <u>recommended</u> is authoring of the books of <a href='../tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> and building schools and hospices and other than that. And from the <u>permitted</u> is (taking pleasure through) indulging in the variety of foods and other than that. And as for the unlawful and disliked (types), then they are very clear. And I made this matter clear alongside its evidences in Tahdhib al-Asmaa wal-Lughaat and by knowing what I have mentioned, it becomes known that the hadeeth is [considered] to be a generalization that is to be specified, and likewise whatever resembles it form the reported ahaadeeth.    <P>
And supporting what we have said is the saying of Umar Ibn al-Khattab (radiallaahu anhu) regarding Tarawih, "What an excellent <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> this is." And that the generalization in his saying "Every innovation" is supported by the word "Every (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604;</span>)" does not prevent that it is subject to being qualified alongside that, such as what occurs in His saying (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1578;&#1615;&#1583;&#1614;&#1605;&#1617;&#1616;&#1585;&#1615; &#1603;&#1615;&#1604;&#1617;&#1614; &#1588;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1569;&#1613;</span>) "<b>Destroying every single thing</b> (46:25)"</blockquote>    <P>
A quick clarification is need on the above statement, especially the last paragraph.    <P>
<blockquote><b>Note Concerning al-Nawawi's Qualification of the Phrase (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1590;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604;&#1577;</span>) That It is Not Absolute and Unrestricted</b>. This is one of the favourite doubts of the <a href='../tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> from the speech of <a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and what they don't realize is that this is actually a proof in our favour. It supports us, and <a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> is with us in the reality of the affair. And the truth is that <a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> is essentially correct because he is (as are the other Shafi'ite jurists) looking at this word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>) and seeing it <b>upon its linguistic meaning only</b>, which incorporates all newly-invented things, blameworthy or praiseworthy, religious or otherwise. Hence, when the Messenger (alayhis salaam) says (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>), "Every <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>...", this clearly is a generalization needing qualification upon al-Nawawi's view. Hence, <a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> mentions proofs from the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> to show that when the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; </span>) is used, it is does not mean absolutely "everything" but that it is a qualified generalization. So upon the belief that when the Messenger said (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>), he was using the word "bidah" with its pure linguistic meaning, then <a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> is correct in this.  And we don't disagree with that, in fact it is absolutely correct to state that it needs qualification and restriction in this situation. <b>And this is the very purpose of the classification found with the Shafi'ite jurists</b>. <u>They do not by any means intend to legitimize innovating into matters of  worship</u>. Rather, they simply intend to expel those affairs from this generalization which are not blameworthy, even if linguistically they are said to be innovations. Conversely, the majority of the Scholars of the Sunnah, when they look at this wording (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1590;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604;&#1577;</span>), they are upon the understanding that the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>) <b>has already been qualified</b> in the hadeeth of Aa'ishah (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1614;&#1606;&#1618; &#1571;&#1614;&#1581;&#1618;&#1583;&#1614;&#1579;&#1614; &#1601;&#1616;&#1610; &#1571;&#1614;&#1605;&#1618;&#1585;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1607;&#1614;&#1584;&#1614;&#1575; &#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1604;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1587;&#1614; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1618;&#1607;&#1615; &#1601;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615;&#1608;&#1614; &#1585;&#1614;&#1583;&#1612;</span>) - <a href=../indexbf6b.html?rwmef>see explanation here</a> - which restricts and qualifies innovations in religion only, since the Messenger said, <i>introduces into this affair of ours</i>", and hence when the Messenger (alayhis salaam) says (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>), this saying is absolute, unqualified and unrestricted and applies to every <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> in the religion.  So the issue here is that <a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> is absolutely correct that the word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604;</span>) is indeed a generalization that is qualified - from his particular perspective of things (which is to see the word "bidah" purely with its linguistic meaning). The difference is that most of Ahl al-Sunnah believe that that word (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>) is already qualified by what is in the hadeeth of Aa'ishah (radiallaahu anhaa), whereas <a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and the Shafi'ite jurists have brought a classification to enable the qualification of what they see to be a word only having its broad unqualified linguistic meaning which is "<i>anything without any prior example whether praiseworthy or blameworthy</i>" Now because this definition would include (in the modern era) your pizzas, burgers, hoodies, sneakers, brick and marble houses, the internet, mobile devices, types of technology and so on, these Shafi'ite jurists simply made classifications to allow these types of things to be excluded from what is otherwise the blameworthy bidah (<a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>). Hence, they said there is an obligatory <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> (so we would say putting the <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in digital format for devices and for the internet is an obligation) and a recommended <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> (setting up online schools for teaching of <a href='../tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and tajweed is a recommended innovation), and a permitted <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> (enjoy that pizza, wear that hoodie and don those cool sneakers). So it becomes clear after all this that in reality there is no difference between these two groups of Scholars, they all have the same understanding, but are just simply using two different languages to express it.  </blockquote>    <P>
Shaykh Ahmad bin Hajar Aal Butami (d. 1423H), who is Shafi'i in fiqh, explains in his book <i>Tahdhir al-Muslimin anil-Ibtidaa' wal-Bida' fil-Din</i> (Dar al-Imam al-Bukhari, 1428H, p. 114):    <P>

You can refer to the documentation of the fatwas of <a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> in <a href=../indexd378.html?chbjn>Part 8</a>:    <P>

Please answer us, rewarded in your endeavour.    <P>
So he (<a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>) wrote in the answer:    <P>
<blockquote>All praise is due to Allaah.  These two prayers were not prayed by the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and nor anyone from the Companions (radiallaahu anhum), and nor any of the aforementioned four Imaams (rahimahullaah), and nor did any of them hint at it, and no one who is worthy of being followed has practiced it, and nothing is authentically related from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) at all, and nor from anyone who is worthy of being followed. Rather, it was introduced in the later times, <span style="background-color:#ffffcc;"><b>and praying them both is from the rejection innovations, and the futile newly-invented matters</b></span>. And it is authentically related from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that he said: "<b>Beware of the newly-invented matters, <u>for every <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is misguidance</u></b>", and in the two Sahihs from Aa'isah (radiallaahu anhaa) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<i>Whoever introduced into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected</i>", and in Sahih Muslim that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<i>Whoever does an action which is not upon our affair will have it rejected</i>."    <P>
<b>And it is desirable for everyone to prohibit this <a href='../tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>, warn from and and make [the people] flee from it, to render its performance as repugnant, reprehensible, and to spread its prohibition everywhere (amongst the people)</b>. For it is authentically related from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that he said, "Whoever amongst you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand, and if he is not able, then with his tongue, and if he is not able then with his heart."    <P>
And it is upon the Scholars to warn from it, and to turn away from it <u>more so than it is upon others</u> because they are taken as a model to be followed. And no one should be deceived by the fact that it is common, being practised by the common-folk, and nor by their doubts, for indeed, following (in guidance) is only done  through the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), not through what he himself has prohibited and  warned against.    <P>
As for lighting fire and burning a lot of oil over it in the way that is done, then it is from the evils and repugnant prohibitions. And it is authentically related that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) prohibited from wastage of wealth, and its meaning is to spend it upon other than the angle from which it is permitted to spend, and this action is from that, [Allaah said], "<b>Let those beware who oppose his (the Messenger's) command that a tribulation should afflict them or a painful torment should afflict them</b>" (24:63). May Allaah protect us from the innovated matters and protect us from falling into the oppositions, and Allaah knows best.</blockquote>  </blockquote>    <P>
And in another fatwa in Fatawaa al-Imaan <a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> (p. 31) - see <a href=../indexd378.html?chbjn>Part 8</a> for full documentation:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>The Shaykh of Islam <a href='../tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> was asked about the well-known Salat al-Ragha'ib performed on the first Friday night of Rajab, whether it is bid'ah or sunnah?    <P>
<blockquote><b>The Answer:</b> <span style="background-color:#ffffcc;"><b>It is a repugnant, rejected <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>, with the most severe rejection</b></span>, it comprises many evils,  hence it is specifically designated to abandon it and turn away from it and to show rejection againt the one who does it. And it is upon the ruler (one in authority) - may Allaah grant him success - to prevent the people from doing it, for indeed he is a shepherd and every shepherd is responsible for his flock. The scholars have written books in rejection and rebuke of it and declaring those who perform it as fools. One should be not deceived by the abundance of those who perform it in many of the cities, and nor that it is mentioned in [the books] Qut al-Qulub, or Ihya Ulum al-Din and their likes, <span style="background-color:#ffffcc;"><b>for it is a futile innovation</b></span>. And it is authentically related from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that he said, "<i>Whoever introduced into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected</i>." And in the Sahih (of Muslim) that he (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<i>Whoever introduced into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected</i>," and in Sahih Muslim and others that he (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<b>Every <a href='../tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is misguidance</b>." And Allaah the Exalted has ordered us to return to His Book whenever there is a dispute, so He, the Exalted said, "<b>And if you dispute regarding any matter then return it back to Allaah and His Messenger</b>" (4:59), and He did not ordder the following of the ignoramuses, and nor being decieved by the errors of those who have erred, and Allaah knows best.</blockquote></blockquote>    <P>
