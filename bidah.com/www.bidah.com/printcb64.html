<div class='sidebar'>It is essential that you have read <a href=indexadb8.html?ezaqa>Part 1</a>,  <a href=index7350.html?uvlmw>Part 2</a> and <a href=index4c41.html?rouuz>Part 3</a> of this series. Also useful is the <a href=indexea20.html?muagm>definition of bid'ah</a> and understanding that it is of two types (haqiqiyyah and idafiyyah) from the angle of how it relates to <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> evidences (see <a href=indexab0d.html?hwnvg>this article</a>, and <a href=index5fc3.html?agquf>this one</a>). </div>    <P>
Al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam followed Imam al-Shafi'i's usage of the term 'bidah' upon its linguistic meaning, and this becomes very apparent when we see him entering <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> into the five <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> rulings (wajib, mustahabb, mubah, makruh, haram). This actually makes the intent of <a href='tags/al-shafii.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shafi'i</font></a> even  more clear and this is further evidence of the <a href='tags/deception.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>deception</font></a> of those grave-worshipping Sufis of our times (and other than them) who try to confuse between the <a href='tags/bidah-idafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah idafiyyah</font></a> (by which they oppose the Sunnah) and the other affairs which have been included into the linguistic definition of the term 'bidah' by the likes of <a href='tags/al-shafii.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shafi'i</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> and others.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note: <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> was not upon the way of the Salaf in <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> and methodology, he was an <a href=http://www.asharis.com/>Ash'arite</a>, having Tajahhum, and was also a Sufi, and he has much that he can be refuted for.  There is a <a href=http://www.salafitalk.net/st/printthread.cfm?Forum=9&amp;Topic=2273>good article on him here</a>.

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And Ibn Abd al-Salam said at the end of [his book] "al-Qawaa'id":<blockquote>Bidah is of five types. That which is <u>obligatory (wajib)</u>, such as being concerned with the [knowledge of] grammar by which the speech of Allaah and His Messenger is understood, because the preservation of the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> is obligatory, and it [the preservation] does not come about except through that, hence it becomes a precursor to what is obligatory. Similarly, explanation of what is obscure, strange (from the texts in terms of words), and compiling the principles of jurisprudence, and arriving at the distinction between what is authentic and weak [from the narrations]. The <u>unlawful (haram)</u>, that which has been devised by those who oppose the Sunnah from the Qadariyyah, <a href='tags/murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Murji'ah</font></a> and Mushabbihah. The <u>recommended (mandubah)</u>, every act of goodness that was not specifically established (maintained) during the era of the Prophet, such as congregating for the tarawih <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>, building schools and hospices (for the poor) and speech about the praiseworthy tasawwuf, and setting up gatherings for debate [to arrive at the truth] when Allaah's face is sought through that. The <u>permitted (mubah)</u>, such as <a href='tags/shaking-hands.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shaking hands</font></a> after the morning and late afternoon prayers, and being liberal in taking pleasure through <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a>, drink, clothing and abode. And some of that could be <u>disliked (makrooh)</u>, or opposed to what is most befitting, and Allaah knows best. </blockquote></blockquote>    <P>
Al-Shatibi also quoted (Maktabah Dar al-Tawhid, 1/319) from <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> from his book al-Qawaid, and from that we can  look at all the various things <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> entered into his classification:    <P>
<ul><li> <u>Waajib (obligatory)</u>: <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> of grammar (to preserve the religion], clarifying obscure, strange words used in revealed texts, compiling and laying down foundations of jurisprudence (fiqh), speech in criticism and appraisal of the narrators to distinguish sound from weak narrations, refuting the innovations.  <li> <u>Muharram (unlawful)</u>: the beliefs of the factions of innovations like the Qadariyyah, <a href='tags/murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Murji'ah</font></a> and others.  <li> <u>Mandub (recommended)</u>: setting up hospices, schools, dams (or other structures for irrigation), every instance of goodness that was not found routinely in the first era (of Islam), the tarawih <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>, speaking about the detailed affairs of that tasawwuf which is praiseworthy, debate and discussion and gathering to discuss issues, where only Allah's face is sought.  <li> <u>Makruh (disliked)</u>: decorating mosques, and decorating the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.  <li> <u>Mubah (permitted)</u>: <a href='tags/shaking-hands.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shaking hands</font></a> after the morning and late afternoon prayers, taking pleasure in <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a>, drink, clothing and residence, wearing shawls and widening the sleeves.  </ul>    <P>
It is important to inspect this list very carefully and to look at the things he has included here, and this will be made clear by looking at al-Shatibi's rebuttal and explanation of it. We can see clearly by the examples given that none of this supports the innovated matters of worship (be they haqiqiyyah or idafiyyah in terms of their innovatory status).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Imam al-Shatibee's Refutation Of This Classification</font>    <P>
Imam al-Shatibee has responded to both al-Qarafi and his Shaykh, <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> with an excellent clarification and refutation which clearly shows their error to anyone who has any sense of justice and desire for truth. He said (Maktabah Dar al-Tawhid, 1/321 onwards) - after citing this view from both al-Qarafi and al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>And the Answer:</b> This classification is an invented matter, there is no <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> evidence which points to it (at all). Rather it is self-defeating, because the reality of bidah is that no <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> evidence points to it, neither from the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> texts, nor from its principles. Because if there had been something from the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> which indicates the obligation (wujoob), recommendation (nadab) or permissibility (ibaahah) of anything, then it would not be bid'ah, <b>and this practice would have been within the generality of the actions which are commanded (in the Shariah) or in which a choice has been granted</b>. Hence, combining between these matters as innovations and between the [Shariah] evidences indicating theri obligation, reccommendation or permissibility <u>is combining between two contradictory affairs</u>.    <P>
As for the makruh (disliked) or the muharram (unlawful), then it is acknowledged from the angle that they can be <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>, but not from another angle. Since if an evidence indicated the prohibition of a matter or it being disliked, that would not establish that it is a bidah because of the possibility that it is a sin such as killing, stealing, drinking intoxicants and what is like them.     <P>
Hence, there is no <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> about which this classification can ever be imagined, except for [the two classifications] of being disliked and being prohibited, upon what is being said in the relevant chapter [pertaining to them] inshaa'Allaah. So what al-Qarafi has mentioned about the agreement about rejecting <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is correct, but his classification therein is not correct. And it is strange that he cites consensus (on rejecting innovation) then he clashes against that with opposition (to it) alongside his awareness that (this position of his) makes the destruction of that consensus binding upon him!</blockquote>    <P>
This is a very clear observation in that if the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> or its principles indicates something to be obligatory, recommended or permissible, then it simply comes within the confines of the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> and entering it under the label of 'bidah' (meaning, from purely a linguistic point of view) is self-defeating and of no merit. <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> himself said, as cited by <a href='tags/al-shatibi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shatibi</font></a> (1/319):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The path to knowing that [i.e. the particular classification] is that the <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> should be looked at in light of the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> principles, so if it enters under the principles of obligation, then it is obligatory (waajibah)...</blockquote>    <P>
Al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam is saying that it is by referring the newly invented matters (i.e. linguistically, anything that is new, both praiseworthy and blameworthy) to the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> principles and looking at what they would enter into (of the five rulings), and so they would take the appropriate ruling depending on which one they would enter into. And this is what <a href='tags/al-shatibi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shatibi</font></a> indicates is pointless and self-defeateing, not having any purpose at all, since the bidah tha the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> intends can never be wajib, mustahabb or mubah. Later, <a href='tags/al-shatibi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shatibi</font></a>, discusses each example provided under the five categories and addresses each one (see below).    <P>
Al-Shatibi continues (1/322):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And just as he (al-Qarafi) followed his Shaykh this classification without reflection, then it is apparent from Ibn Abd al-Salam that he labels the matters of <a href='tags/public-interest.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>public interest</font></a> (<a href='tags/al-masalih-al-mursalah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-masalih al-mursalah</font></a>) to be "innovations" (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;</span>) built upon - and Allaah knows best - that they do not have any specific [explicit] mention in specific texts, even though they are conciliatory with the general principles of the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>. So from this (starting point) he made the general principles to indicate that these matters are deemed good. Hence, his referring to them with the word "innovations" (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;</span>) is from the angle of the absence of specific evidence for a specific issue, and then considering them as being good from the angle that they enter into [general] principles [in the Shariah]. And when he depended upon these principles, then these actions became equal to him to those actions which come under specific texts, and therefore he became from those who [simply] speak with the matters of <a href='tags/public-interest.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>public interest</font></a> (al-masaalih al-mursalah), but he labelled them as "innovations" in wording, just as Umar (radiallaahu anhu) labelled the unification of the people for the <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> in Ramadan in the mosque as "<a href="tags/innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">innovation</font></a>", as will some soon inshaa'Allaah.</blockquote>    <P>
Basically, what <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> did is to consider certain actions which do not have specific texts for them through general <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> principles such as "<i>That without which an obligation cannot be fulfilled is itself an obligation</i>" as a result of which they were deemed as "good" (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1581;&#1587;&#1606;</span>) and then entered them under the label of (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>) <u>with its linguistic meaning</u>. In reality, these affairs are simply matters of <a href='tags/public-interest.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>public interest</font></a> (masalih mursalah).

<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Shatibee Addressing the Example Given by <a href="tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a></font>    <P>
Al-Shatibee addresses the various examples that were used by al-Izz, and we will simply summarize the points made by him (refer to 1/323 onwards in al-I'tisaam):    <P>
<blockquote>Al-Shatibi says that the affairs he entered under <u>mandub (recommended)</u> do not enter into innovations at all and that is clear by the examples which he gave. <u>Salat al-Tarawih:</u> This is established from the Messenger (alayhis salaam), and he quotes the narrations in this regard from the Sunan of Abu Dawud. He explains that the Messenger (alayhis salaam) stopped praying tarawih in the mosque after three days because he feared it might be made obligatory on the Ummah which may cause them hardship, citing the hadith of Aa'ishah (radiallahu anhaa) in Sahih al-Bukhari. <a href='tags/al-shatibi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Shatibi</font></a> says that these texts prove that this action was in fact a Sunnah, and that because the era was one in which revelation was still being received, he stopped it for that reason, it was not an absolute withholding. So when revelation stopped, the affair was eventually returned to exactly how it was, congregational tarawih <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> in the mosque behind a single imam. <a href='tags/al-shatibi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Shatibi</font></a> explains that Umar (radiallaahu anhu) called this action a "bidah" only on account of the outward appearance of the matter, in that the Messenger left it and it did not occur in the era of Abu Bakr (radiallaahu anhu). So when this word is used in this sense, there is no problem with such a term, however, this does not make it permissible to use this statement for permitting the blameworthy <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> that the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> condemns, because this is clearly distorting the words from their proper places (i.e. distorting the words of Umar).    <P>
As for what he (al-Izz) entered into the <u>wajib (obligatory)</u>, then the examples he gave are from the angle of the principle, "<i>that without which an obligation cannot be fulfilled is itself an obligation</i>." Hence, it is not a condition in these matters that the Salaf must have acted upon them, and nor that there must be a specific basis for them in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, because these matters and examples are from the subject of <a href='tags/al-masalih-al-mursalah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-masalih al-mursalah</font></a> (matters of <a href='tags/public-interest.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>public interest</font></a> by which the five necessities, life, religion, intellect, wealth and lineage are protected). Al-Shatibee gives an example by saying that if a person was to travel for the obligatory <a href='tags/hajj-qy.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/hajj.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Hajj</font></a></font></a> by flying in the air, or walking on the water, he would not be considered an innovator, because <u>the objective</u> is to reach Makkah to fulfil an obligation.    <P>
As for the example of the <u>mubah (permitted)</u> of <a href='tags/shaking-hands.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shaking hands</font></a> after the morning and late afternoon prayers, then as for saying it is an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>, this is granted, but as for them being permitted (mubaahah), then this is prohibited because there is no specific evidence in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> which indicates the specification of those times.</blockquote>    <P>
Refer to al-Shatibi's lengthy discussion in al-I'tisam, we have only provided a summary of some of the issues he discussed but which serve as an illustration for them all.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam, Sticking to the Sunnah and Avoiding Bidah in Matters of Worship</font>    <P>
Alongside everything which has preceded which should now make clear that there is absolutely nothing for the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> in the mere fact that <a href='tags/al-shafii.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shafi'i</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> applied the word 'bidah' with its broader linguistic meaning  which allows them (the innovators) to justify their reprehensible innovations in matters of worship, be they <a href='tags/bidah-haqiqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah haqiqiyyah</font></a> or <a href='tags/bidah-idafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah idafiyyah</font></a>. This will be made even  more clearer by looking at some fatawa of al-Izz bin Abd al-Salaam in relation to matters of worship. Through this, we will illustrate that these contemporary <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> also misrepresent the position of <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> because even though he made an erroneous classification of 'bidah' upon its broad linguistic meaning into five types, he did not intend or mean by that what the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> of today have wrongly employed this classification for, which is to oppose the Sunnah in the affairs of worship and to depart from what the Salaf were upon and to justify their multitude of innovations in affairs of worship not known to the Companions or the Salaf.    <P>
In Part 5, we will look at a sample of fatawa of <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> to prove this point inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
